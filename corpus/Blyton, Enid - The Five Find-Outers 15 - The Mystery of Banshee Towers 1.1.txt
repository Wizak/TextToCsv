enid blyton the mystery of banshee towers off to meet old fatty i do wish old fatty would buck up and come back from wherever hes staying said bets weve had almost a week of the holidays without him already such a waste hes coming back today said pip passing a postcard across the breakfasttable to his young sister heres a card from him three cheers bets read the card out loud back tomorrow by bus from warling meet me at bus stop if you can what about a nice juicy mystery i feel just about ready for one fatty a nice juicy what said her mother puzzled mystery said bets her eyes shining you know how something always seems to happen when fattys about mother there was the mystery of the pantomime cat and the mystery of the vanished prince and her father groaned look bets im tired of all these adventures and strange happenings that seem to pop up whenever your friend frederick is about just try and steer clear of any trouble these holidays i was hoping that frederick was staying away for a nice long time i wish you wouldnt call him frederick daddy said bets it does sound so silly i should have thought that frederick was a much better name for a boy in his teens than the absurd name of fatty said her father i wonder frederick allows people to call him by that old nickname now but fatty is fat and the name suits him said pip anyway i dont think my nickname is very suitable for me now that im a bit older why cant i be called by my proper name of philip instead of pip simply because youre a bit of pipsqueak still and probably always will be said his father disappearing behind his newspaper bets gave a sudden laugh and then a groan as pip kicked her under the table pip said his mother warningly bets changed the subject hurriedly she didnt want pip to get into any trouble the very day that fatty came home mother wheres the bus timetable she said id like to find out what time old fattys bus arrives well seeing that there are only two in the morning and the bus from warling takes two hours to get here i should think hell be on the first bus said pip otherwise hed be jolly late it should be about a quarter to ten said his mother that means youll have plenty of time to clear up the fearful mess in your playroom first i could hardly get into it yesterday pip groaned why do we always have to tidy the playroom when we plan to go out he demanded i really do think its enough said said his father from behind his newspaper and pip became silent at once he looked across at bets and she grinned at him happily fatty was coming back fatty with his wide grin his twinkling eyes his mad jokes and his extraordinary habit of suddenly finding himself in the middle of peculiar mysteries oh the time they had had with fatty the excitement the adventures why was it that some people always found themselves in the middle of something thrilling if fatty was cast away on a lonely desert island something extraordinary would immediately happen thought bets a mermaid would pop up and let him swim away on her back or a submarine might arrive and bets what are you dreaming about said her mother youve carefully buttered your bread on both sides pip and bets tore upstairs as soon as breakfast was finished only one thought in their minds fatty was coming back lets buck up and tidy the playroom said pip i want to go round to larrys and see if he and daisy know that fattys coming back today he began to throw everything into the big toy cupboard higgledy piggledy bang crash wallop mother wont like that began bets but pip only laughed at her all right you do it properly old slowcoach goodbye im off to larrys see you later but bets couldnt bear to be left behind so she shoved in the last few things flew to get her hat and raced down the stairs after pip falling over the cat sitting on the bottom stair sorry puss she panted and raced down to the front gate pip wait for me soon they were at larrys house the front door was open and they could hear daisy calling to her brother arent you ready to meet fatty youll be late in a few moments all four children were on their way to the busstop what do you bet that old fatty will play one of his tricks on us and come in some kind of disguise said pip well i hope he does said larry wed soon see through it fatty cant disguise his plumpness look were just in time said bets here comes the bus lets run the bus a doubledecker came to a stop and the four children ran to the exit at the back people were crowding off and the conductor was shouting loudly hurry off please and mind the step larry suddenly nudged pip look thats fatty hes disguised himself just as we guessed he would hes carrying a dogbasket too and i bet old dog buster is in there stand back dont let him see us the fellow who was carrying the dogbasket was stout and wore a bulky overcoat a yellow scarf round his neck and chin and a cap with a large peak pulled down over his nose he coughed hollowly as he stepped down from the bus and held a large green cotton handkerchief to his mouth bets giggled thats fatty all right she said in a low voice to pip lets not say a word but just follow him solemnly home they set off keeping just behind him the fat fellow went off at quite a pace limping slightly with his left foot yes thats fatty said larry sort of thing he would do in disguise put on a limp or something he cant fool us though they followed the limping youth down the street round a corner and up the hill then larry shouted to him hey fatty stop we know its you the youth swung round and glared at them dont you dare to call after me he shouted cheeky young brats go on fatty we cant help knowing its you said pip and we know youve got old busterdog in that basket too let him out buster whos buster said the fellow are you mad theres a cat in here not a dog have a look he slipped the catch of the basket and opened the lid out sprang a most enormous ginger cat spitting and hissing the four children stared in the greatest astonishment a cat not buster so this fellow wasnt fatty after all gosh what an awful mistake er were very sorry its all a mistake stuttered poor larry his face scarlet we do beg your pardon now you just listen to me said the fat fellow angrily see that bobby over there well im going to complain of you see following me about whispering behind my back calling me names i cant help being fat can i come here pussykins thats right you hiss at these little varmints scratch them if you like to the childrens horror the fellow went across the road to a corner and who should be standing there but mr goon the village policeman mr goon he was no friend of theirs what in the world could they do better get away quickly before mr goon comes after us said pip gosh what a mistake we made he turned to run and bumped hard into someone standing just behind him grinning a little scottie dog in his arms fatty its you fatty we thought you were that fellow over there with the dogbasket cried pip overjoyed to see his friend gain we followed him and now hes gone to complain about us to goon and i followed you said fatty i was on the top deck of the bus and i saw you though you didnt see me i carried buster because i was afraid hed go careering after you and give the game away give your friends a lick buster he held up the little scottie and buster most ecstatically licked all his four friends whining in joy then fatty put him down on the pavement and alas buster suddenly spotted goon the policeman who was staring angrily at the children from across the road buster gave a yelp of delight and raced across the road at top speed ah here was his old enemy what about dancing round his ankles and pretending to nip him buster felt just like a little exercise after his long ride on the bus mr goon glared at the excited buster in disgust ha you little pest of a dog so youre back with your master are you get away now clearorf busters only telling you how pleased he is to see you said fatty as the burly policeman tried to skip away from busters attentions my word mr goon you ought to learn dancing youre really nippy with your feet almost as nippy as buster is with his teeth heel buster the dancing lesson is over goon went purple in the face that boy that toad of a boy what wonderful peace and quiet there had been in the village for at least a week with that boy away now he was back and something would turn up to make things uncomfortable goon was sure that fat boy was always in the middle of peculiar happenings of some sort fatty joined the others who feeling sure that the fellow with the cat had complained about them to mr goon were keeping well away from the angry policeman i must say that i think you were all a bit fatheaded following a chapwithacat instead of a boywithadog said fatty all right dont rub it in said larry ill stand us all icecreams to make up for our mistake sorry but i think i must get home first said fatty mother will be looking out for me but lets have a meeting this afternoon a meeting of the famous findouters and dog come to my workroom about halfpast two come on buster old thing to heel and do remember to be polite and shake paws with my father and mother as soon as you see them larry and daisy went off together and so did pip and bets bets mother was amused to see the little girls happy face i can see that you met frederick all right she said were having a meeting at fattys this afternoon said bets her face glowing its the first meeting the findouters have had for ages findouters said her mother let me see now thats oh mother you know were the five findouters and dog said pip dont you remember all the mysteries weve solved i daresay well find out another and solve it these hols if one turns up said bets dont worry bets things always happen when fatty is around i dont expect you will have to wait very long before a nice juicy mystery looms up for every one of you down in fattys workroom bets felt excited when at last the time came to go to the first meeting of the holidays her mother had not allowed her to race off immediately after dinner but had sent both her and pip up to their playroom i dont know if you think that what you did this morning to tidy up the room was anything like enough she said throwing things higgledypiggledy into corners and cupboards isnt my idea of clearing up please do the job properly before you go oh blow said pip exasperated now we shall be late come on bets you do your share it was soon done and they raced off down the garden path happy to be on their way to fattys house they joined up with larry and daisy and were soon in fattys workroom at the bottom of his garden well away from everyone and almost out of range of any shout from the house grownups want an awful lot of things done if youre within shouting distance you know fatty said but if they have to go and fetch you theyre sure to decide its too much bother so they do the things themselves the shed was certainly well tucked away and very very comfortable an oilstove gave quite enough warmth and on the floor was an old tigerskin complete with its head bets had been scared at first of its open mouth showing such fierce teeth and of its glassy eyes but now she didnt mind it a bit and often sat on the great head itself this tiger is getting a bit motheaten she said we ought to powder him thats what mother does to our furrugs oh fatty youve still got the old crocodile skin stretched on the wall too i do think this is a most exciting shed its lovely to be back again after so long at school nice to have you here little bets said fatty in the special voice he sometimes kept for the little girl be careful the old tiger doesnt nip you woof said buster at once and showed his teeth he says hed nip the tiger if he did a thing like that said bets and cuddled buster round the neck got anything to eat fatty asked larry i had quite a good dinner but somehow i always feel hungry when we meet down here there are some chocolate biscuits in the cupboard said fatty who invariably seemed to be provided with a vast variety of good food wherever he was by the way please look firmly the other way if buster tries to beg any food from you he is on a diet slimming you know he overate himself while he was away too many cats about but surely he hasnt begun to eat cats said daisy shocked no ass but with plenty of catdishes around always ready to be licked clean he did far too well said fatty buster stand up show your tubby figure oh what a middle youve landed yourself with disgraceful buster certainly had a tummy his tail dropped when fatty scolded him and he went sadly into a corner and curled himself up eyeing the chocolate biscuits sadly bets felt very sorry for him ill just let him lick my chocolatey fingers fatty she said thats all i promise i just cant bear to see him looking so leftcut here you are buster lick my fingers buster was pleased he licked bets fingers and then sat down as close to her as he possibly could he loved kindhearted little bets she put her arm round him again fatty is this meeting about anything special she said id be just as pleased if there wasnt any mystery to solve at the moment i mean i do like mysteries but i do like a bit of peace too well really bets dont you want to belong to the findouters said daisy quite amazed whats the good of being a findouter if you dont want to find out anything yes i see all that said bets but what i mean is do we have to snoop round and look for problems and mysteries to solve cant we just not bother for once you mean just play about and enjoy ourselves said daisy well it does sound rather nice for a change you know fatty solving mysteries can be quite hard work well im rather inclined to agree with you said fatty lazily you know ive just been staying with two cousins both firstclass footballers firstclass boxers firstclass crosscountry runners and firstclass bores to tell you the truth my word the excuses i had to think of to get out of kicking a football from morning to night running for miles in shorts uphill and down and putting on boxinggloves and having sparring bouts thank goodness that didnt last long qthe sparring i mean why were you knocked out asked larry knocked out dont be fatheaded said fatty the tiring part about the boxing was that i kept on doing the knockingout i tell you it got boring youre boasting fatty said larry ha youll never get rid of that habit thats one thing you do better than any of us boast youre superlative at that dont be rude larry said daisy shocked why fatty might knock you out if you talk like that no i shant said fatty larrys quite right i do boast just a bit on the other hand i do actually do what i boast about i really did knock out my two cousins ill show you the blow i used you swing out like this with your left and then ooh sorry buster what on earth made you get in the way did i hurt you funny you didnt even knock him out said larry irritatingly bets cuddled poor buster who had received a blow on his fat tummy that had quite winded him he stared at fatty unhappily really puzzled listen said pip lets go exploring a bit these hols my father made a list of interesting spots we could go to see he said we shouldnt just mess about doing nothing he said he said that but what he really meant was that he didnt want you under his feet all the time said larry my fathers like that too i mean hes an absolute sport and im frightfully proud of him and he is of me but i do notice that after about ten days of the hols he always gets this idea of us going off for the day not just one day but every day and mine made out a list too here it is ill read it out he took a neatly written list from the pocket of his flannels and read from it old watercaves at chillerbing museum of ageold fossils at tybolds norman tower at yellowmoss gosh those are down on my list too said pip scrabbling in his pocket for it yes all those are down and two or three more roman remains at jackling museum seapictures at banshee towers at the top of banshee hill old musical instruments at i dont want to see any of them said bets suddenly looking very woebegone i wouldnt so much mind the seapictures i like seapictures but i dont like those ugly fossily things or those all right bets you shant spend lovely spring days in museums or norman towers or caves said fatty putting his arm round her but we might go and see banshee towers you know why its called that dont you nobody knew well said fatty a banshee means a woman of the fairies and it shrieks and wails when any misfortune or unhappiness comes to the family in whose house it lives how very unpleasant said daisy at once im very glad my family doesnt own a banshee i should be scared stiff does banshee towers own a banshee then i suppose it did once when the family lived in it said fatty but now that its a museum or a picturegallery or something i expect the banshee has retired i dont want to go to see banshee towers if the banshee still lives there said bets decidedly so youll have to find out fatty i honestly shouldnt worry said fatty it would be a pity to let an oldtime woman of the fairies frighten you from seeing wonderful seapictures and i believe they really are wonderful well well make a few expeditions to show our parents that we really are not the lieabeds they think we are said larry it should be rather fun actually we could picnic in these places and i could use one of them for my holiday essay it would be something to write about especially the banshee howling i hope it wails like anything when were there i shant go if it does said bets at once hallo whos that at the door golly that loud knock made me jump whos there demanded fatty its me ern said a wellknown voice outside ive been sent to stay with my uncle theo mr goon you know because one of my sisters has measles and i havent had it at least mum cant remember me having it can i come in of course i come along in ern were all here said fatty and opened the door ern stood there shockheaded as ever and as plump as fatty grinning in delight to see his friends again buster at once made a great fuss of him coo its nice to see you all again said ern sitting down on the floor and hugging the little scottie i didnt want to come and stay with my uncle i dont like him and he doesnt like me but i dont mind putting up with him if youll let me be with you now and again any mysteries going not so far ern said fatty help yourself to the chocolate biscuits but dont give buster any hes slimming luvaduck is he really said ern i must say he feels a bit solidlike you look a bit balloony too fatty ern please remember your manners said fatty in a shocked voice you must not refer to people as balloony you might easily get a smack on the nose oooh im sorry fatty reeeely sorry said ern maybe ill pick up a few good manners now im with you again i seem to lose them like at ome er i mean home its good to see you ern said fatty we are planning to go on some interesting rambles and you shall come with us if you like if your uncle will let you coo id like that said ern well uncle says ive got to turn to and look nippy and not get under his feet and use my loaf your loaf said bets in surprise do you have a loaf of bread of your own then you dont know much do you grinned ern so delighted to be with his old friend again that his eyes shone like stars using your loaf means using your brains see ah yes said fatty gravely well if we all intend to go sightseeing and learning about banshees and old musical instruments and roman remains we must all use our er loaves are we allowed any butter with them ern but dear old ern didnt see the joke though the others roared in delight ern didnt mind it was sheer happiness to him to be with fatty bets and the rest they could pull his leg correct him laugh at him they were his friends and he was theirs let them do whatever they liked as long as he could be with them bingo and buster it was fun to have ern again he enjoyed the company of the five friends so much and entered into everything with the greatest delight he sat listening intently as they went on discussing their plans for the next two or three weeks i suppose i couldnt come with you sometimes he said at last i daresay uncle would let me off now and again so long as i do the jobs he sets me of course yes if hes kind enough to have you to stay you must certainly help him in any way you can said fatty his garden for instance i passed it the other day shocking full of weeds thats what my uncle said agreed ern mournfully trouble is i dunno weeds from flowers oh and theres another thing hes letting me have my dog with me while im here what do you think of that dog i didnt even know you had one ern said pip surprised well hes a bit new like said ern ive had him for three weeks im trying to train him good and proper like youve trained old buster there fatty good said fatty very good an untrained dog is a nuisance nobody likes him where is this dog of yours and whats he called what kind is he i dont rightly know what kind he is said ern hes a bit of a mixture really hes not very big but hes got a mighty long tail with a mighty big wag in it and nice ears that prick up like busters here and rather short legs pity about his legs really he looks comic when he runs you see and all the other dogs laugh at him they dont said bets disbelievingly well they stand and stare at him and sort of wink at one another when he comes scuttering by said ern his name is bingo good name isnt it it suits him too you wait till youve seen him i like him an awful lot its the first time ive had a dog of my own hes potty on me you know thinks im the worlds wonder just like old buster then said bets he thinks fattys the worlds wonder dont you buster woof said buster agreeing heartily he went to fatty and licked his chin and then put his head on fattys knee looking up at him adoringly loving old thing said fatty and patted him well ern im awfully glad youve a dog of your own good for the dog and good for you too youll like having someone who looks up to you and thinks that everything you do is right but look after him well wont you where is this bingo asked larry ive locked him in the woodshed at uncles said ern you see well i didnt know if youd like me to bring him along buster mightnt like him rubbish said fatty getting up any dog is a friend of busters if he belongs to one of us lets go and visit this dog of yours and take him for a walk youre a real sport fatty said ern his face glowing come on then they all went out of the shed and made their way to peterswood village buster dancing round in joy sniffing along the hedges barking at a sparrow wagging his tail without a stop is your uncle in a good temper today enquired larry soso said ern with a grin he smiled when i cleaned his big boots for him and he frowned when i upset the milk he doesnt know ive come to see you why didnt you tell him asked bets youre not scared of him are you oh im proper scared of uncle all right said ern bit too free with his hands he is id like to have sixpence for every slap hes given me id be rich by now swimming in sixpences i dont think hell be too pleased if i go about with you too much so i shant tell him anything they came to goons little house which stood not far from the police station as soon as they opened the gate a terrific volley of bloodcurdling howls greeted them and something hurled itself against the woodshed door thats him thats bingo said ern in pride i hope uncles out he wouldnt like that noise at all hey bingo ive brought friends to see you buster the scottie was astonished and rather alarmed to hear the extraordinary noise from the shed he put his head on one side and pricked up his ears to sharp points he gave a little growl its all right buster said ern thats my dog in there hey bingo come along out and he slipped the catch of the door and opened it out shot something at sixty miles an hour gave one horrified look at the crowd of children and disappeared at top speed through the gate thats him said ern proudly as bingo shot down the road what do you think of him fatty well i really only caught sight of his tail said fatty but that certainly looked fine look out here comes old goon your uncle ern he looks pretty badtempered too mr goon had opened his front door and was standing there in his uniform helmet and all glaring in his best manner ern whats the matter with that dog of yours barking like that has he gone mad or something where is he i dont know uncle said ern truthfully he shot off at top speed i only hope he hasnt gone back to my home he might catch measles and come out in nasty spots you and your measles snorted mr goon i said you could have that dog if he behaved himself and if i could borrow him at nights when i go down into the rough part of the town but i tell you this straight ern if hes going to act silly and bark at nothing and rush off like a mad thing i wont have him and you might tell him to keep away from my feet hes tripped me up twice already oh im very sorry about that uncle said ern er i just brought my friends to see him well you can take them away again said goon ungraciously they may be your friends but theyre not mine especially master frederick algernon trotteville pah whos he talking about said ern in wonder as goon went indoors and slammed the door me im afraid said fatty those are my real names you know ern i try to forget them though i cant say i like my nickname either now what about your dog bingo ern where do you suppose hes gone i dont know said ern suddenly looking desperate i cant think why he went off like that i suppose my uncle went and shouted at him in the shed and gave him a lamming or something lets go and look for him but before they had gone more than a few steps mr goon was at his door again shouting for ern ern you come back what about those jobs i gave you to do you come back i tell you better go ern said fatty cheer up well have a look for old bingo he wont have come to any harm ern went slowly back through the gate looking angry and troubled his thoughts were full of bingo his beloved dog he might get run over he might get lost he might even be stolen hes so friendly and goodnatured he would go with anyone thought poor ern and began to run as he heard a stentorian shout from inside the house ern you come on in ive got to go to the police station and i want you to peel the potatoes for supper and get things tidy ern poor ern disappeared into the house he longed to slam the door just as goon had done but he didnt dare the others walked slowly through the village talking about ern and keeping a lookout for bingo there was no sign of him fatty thought he must have gone to find his way back to erns own home they decided to go to the bunshop and have tea there buster was pleased he knew that this usually meant a few titbits for him just as they reached the bunshop they heard a little whine a very small and pathetic one it seemed to come from the hedge nearby buster went at once to investigate he slipped through the hedge and then gave a sharp bark buster what is it come back called fatty buster appeared again with something trotting behind him bingo bingo said everyone in astonishment and bingo wagged his long tail went flat on his tummy and began to crawl anxiously towards them in a most humble manner poor bingo said bets in her gentle voice and at once bingo shot over to her pressed himself against her and gave a funny little high whine he wagged his long tail so hard that it slapped against bets legs but she didnt mind she patted him and stroked him and he went nearly mad with joy buster stood nearby and watched gravely well youre a bit of a comic bingo i must say said fatty looking at him from all angles what a tail pity you didnt have legs to match old boy but my word youve real doggy eyes yes bingo had good bright faithful eyes and a tongue always ready to lick any friend the children decided that ern was lucky what do you think of him buster said fatty seeing buster standing and watching everything his eyes bright his tail wagging just a very little woof said buster and went straight over to bingo he stood nose to nose with him each sniffing at the other then buster danced round bingo and bingo gave a joyful bark and away they went together tearing down the road like mad things buster approves said larry i rather approve of him too a comical dog but a real little sport well if were going to have tea at the bunshop what about it and please dont eat more than six buns fatty you want to be able to squeeze out of the door again in they all went made for their favourite table and sat down fatty as usual had plenty of money and that meant a good tuckin for everyone in the middle of the meal the door was pushed open with a heave and in trotted the two dogs panting their mouths open as if they were both laughing buster go and shut the door after you said fatty sternly have you forgotten your manners bingo please notice that doors must be pushed shut not left open when you come in and out of rooms wuff said bingo head on one side listening carefully he trotted over to the door and helped buster to shut it using both paws and nose hes one of us already said larry im beginning to like you bingo old thing now sit buster teach him how to sit gosh look at that fatty both sitting down side by side as good as gold were going to have some fun with old bingo mr goon loses his temper ern had been very busy indeed while the others had gone to the village mr goon was in one of his worst tempers he always was when he had met fatty whom he disliked very much that fat boy he said to ern i dont trust him an inch never did its a pity hes not as stupid as he looks too clever by half he is he doesnt look stupid uncle said ern emptying some potatoes into a bowl of water to peel how could he when hes got such marvellous brains you should hear him talk luvaduck he knows pretty well everything ill luvaduck you if you dont get on with those potatoes ern said mr goon that fat boys a menace yes thats the word for him a menace whats a menace uncle asked ern anything to do with manners sounds a bit the same i dont know if youre being rude or just plain stupid ern said mr goon majestically but this i do know youll get a clip on the ear soon and one of these days my dog will bite you if you clip me cried ern almost at the end of his tether now uncle dont you come any nearer ill throw this bowl of potatoes over you if you do ern looked so fierce that goon retreated hurriedly now now he said dont take things so seriously ern cant you see a joke depends who makes it said ern feeling suddenly victorious then his spirits fell again as he remembered his dog where was old bingo had he run away for ever he sniffed a little as he went on peeling the potatoes and when he remembered how bingo ran to meet him and licked him lovingly each time he came home from school a tear fell plop into the potato bowl im a fathead thats what fatty would call me thought ern but i dunno theres something about a dog that gets you specially if its your own mr goon went off to the police station his boots well polished by ern and his helmet and uniform well brushed ern was glad to see him go as soon as his uncle was out of sight he thought he would whistle for bingo just to see if by any chance he would come so he whistled ern had a most piercing whistle shrill long and alarming it made everyone within hearing jump in surprise and annoyance ern stood at the front gate and whistled for at least five minutes no bingo arrived but a good many windows and doors were opened and people began looking out to see if anything was the matter they thought that it must be goon blowing his policewhistle for help a small boy arrived panting at the front gate any help wanted he asked we heard the policewhistle being blown that was only me whistling for my dog said ern astonished then seeing people looking out of windows and doors he shot inside goons house in a hurry theyll tell uncle i was using his policewhistle he thought desperately luvaduck what a day wish i was at home measles and all about halfpast five mr goon returned home to see if ern had put on the kettle and had made him some toast as he had commanded fortunately for ern he had everything ready ern was right down in the dumps no fatty had come back no buster no bets and certainly no bingo ern didnt want any tea at all a most unusual thing this toast is burnt said mr goon grumpily its not said ern its just right thats how my ma likes it anyway and youve put too much tea in the pot said mr goon peering in holding the lid in his hand it was hot and he had to drop it very suddenly it fell to the floor and broke he glared at ern as if he had dropped it ern gave a sudden giggle and his uncle went red in the face pick them pieces up he commanded and take that grin off your face ern i cant its stuck there said ern suddenly feeling cheeky ern said mr goon in a terrifying voice and stood up ern promptly stood up too and ran to the door he opened it and goon came after him ern went down the hall to the front door and opened that and then shot down the front path with his uncle on his heels at exactly the same moment as fatty and the rest with buster and bingo came in at the gate somehow or other mr goon became mixed up with the two excited dogs as they raced towards the front door and down he went with a thud bingo leapt up at the astonished ern and tried his hardest to lick him in as many places as he could barking madly all the time buster finding his old enemy goon on the ground and at his mercy sailed in gleefully to the attack it really was a sight to be seen bingo youve come back shouted ern in joy and lifted up the delighted dog who at once plastered his face with loving licks clear orf all of you roared poor mr goon trying to push buster away ill tell your parents of this will you order this dog away frederick trotteville one of these days ill clap you in a cell yes and the dog too get away you brute lemme get up ern help me up it was fatty who pulled the heavy policeman to his feet and dusted him down murmuring apologies in a polite voice that simply infuriated mr goon bad luck sir did you trip over your feet i say youll scare the girls if you roar like that buster behave yourself buster are you deaf stop dancing round poor mr goon here let me help you up sir up we come thats it upsadaisy you all right now mr goon mr goon glared he saw that quite a crowd had gathered round his front gate and some of them were daring to laugh laughing at the law what were things coming to most majestically mr goon went to the gate and scowled at everyone there whats all this clear orf now youre creating a nuisance you are move on there move on only a few people moved away fatty felt sorry for poor mr goon perhaps if you told them to move off instead of move on theyd understand better he suggested let me help you mr goon and fatty waved an imperious hand and shouted in a suddenly enormous voice move off will you move off and rather astonished the lookerson moved off at once fatty was rather astonished too he hadnt thought it would be so easy mr goon was more than astonished he was exceedingly angry think youre in the police force now do you he said fiercely well what about you moving off or on i dont care which funny how trouble always comes when youre about isnt it master trotteville now im going back to finish my tea in peace and quiet clear orf all of you im sick of the sight of you you get indoors ern and take that dog to the woodshed tripping me up like that you can consider him arrested and put into a cell see and there hell stay out in the woodshed night and day oh no uncle that would be cruel said ern upset fatty tell him he might listen to you you cant lock up a dog night and day all right then you go home stormed mr goon i do a kindness and take you in and that fatheaded dog too and this is what happens go on home catch the measles ern didnt know what to do but fatty did he whispered something in erns ear and erns face broke into a delighted smile he took hold of fattys hand and shook it hard youre a friend fatty yes thats what you are a friend said ern warmly ill go and get my things straightaway would you mind bingo for me till i come out uncles in such a temper he might whip him what a pity he tripped over bingo bets and daisy had been very scared by all the upset but the boys had rather enjoyed it fatty couldnt help feeling a little sorry for mr goon the policeman did not shine when things went wrong but fatty felt sure he would be sorry and feel guilty when he had had time to ponder over things that was the worst of a hot temper it led you into doing silly rash things you were sorry for afterwards and then it was probably too late ern had disappeared into his uncles bouse he was there about three minutes and then came out again carrying a canvas bag bingo trotted joyfully over to him ern was beaming all over his round face where are you going ern asked bets in surprise home but you cant go there with measles about they all went out of the gate together leaving mr goon staring after them he was just beginning to wish that he hadnt lost his temper ern come back you come and apologize and ill let you stay he shouted sorry uncle shouted back ern i cant stay where im not wanted or where my dog will be locked up night and day sorry uncle wheres ern going asked pip hes going to stay in my workroom till his family are clear of the measles said fatty and bingo as well nice dog bingo be good for buster to have company too the workroom is nice and warm and i can put a campbed there but nobody is to know see you are all to keep your mouths shut ern is our friend and weve got to stand by him oh good fatty you always think of some fine way out of things when they go wrong said bets squeezing fattys arm ern are you pleased pleased i feel like a tail with two dogs said ern looking down at buster and bingo trotting amicably together no i mean a dog with two tails coo luvaduck wasnt poor old uncle in a temper all because he fell over bingo to think im going to stay in your workroom fatty i feel honoured straight i do youre a friend and i cant say more than that can i no thats about the best thing anyone can say about anyone else said fatty with one of his grins he gave ern a little punch in the back i bet ill say that about you someday ern ern glowed he looked round gratefully at the little bunch of friends walking with him yes that was about the best thing that could happen to anyone to have friends whether they were twolegged or fourlegged and to be a friend to someone is just as good thought ern well maybe its even better ill have to ask fatty about it sometime hes sure to know fatty is a real friend the little company went in at the back gate of fattys garden and trooped down to the shed fattys cosy little workroom the two dogs trotted along amicably together bingo occasionally giving buster a friendly lick bingos tail never stopped wagging or waving youll wear it out if youre not careful bingo said ern as they went in close file down the path bingos tail slapping against the nearest legs bets laughed she didnt feel scared any longer just pleased and excited she was glad that ern had got away from unkind mr goon it would be nice to have him at their meetings the workroom felt warm when they opened the door and was full of a golden light from the sinking sun well here we are once more said fatty get out the toffees bets theyre in that cupboard ill just go up to the house and see if i can find a campbed or a spare mattress if not he disappeared and bets went to find the toffees trust fatty to have something to chew or suck or drink good old fatty to think about rescuing poor ern fatty was in the middle of hunting about for a campbed when bis mother appeared she was astonished to see him in the lumberroom what in the world do you want fatty she said er well i just wondered if there was a campbed to spare said fatty a campbed whatever for said his mother fatty i will not allow you to sleep out in the garden yet youd catch your death of cold mother dear im not thinking of such a thing said fatty i like my own warm bed much too much to want to shiver outside with beetles and frogs and ants all over me i just wondered if we had a campbed to spare thats all fatty why are you so mysterious about it asked his mother look at me why this sudden idea of a campbed darling mother you are always so curious said fatty taking her hand cant you trust me i dont want to steep on it i dont want to sell it i dont even want to take it off the premises i just want to borrow it im afraid if i told you why i want it someone might ask you questions and then youd answer and someone else might suffer please trust me mother and believe that like the boy scouts i am about to do a good deed i never in my life knew anyone who could wheedle things out of me like you frederick said his mother beginning to laugh all right i wont ask you any questions ill trust you as i always do dear theres a spare campbed in the cupboard under the stairs bless you mother youre a pet said fatty and gave her a smacking kiss on the cheek he went to the cupboard and found the campbed in no time at all he had carried it down the garden unseen and larry was helping him to take it through the door of the shed did you have any bother getting it asked larry i always have to go into long long explanations when i want to borrow anything like a campbed no fortunately my mother trusts me as much as i trust her said fatty putting up the campbed with ern nothing like trust in a family i can recommend it thoroughly ern stared at fatty what queer things fatty sometimes said but they were worth remembering ern thought nothing like trust in a family that meant trusting one another there was quite a lot in that idea ern decided to think about it when he was in bed he felt excited when he saw the campbed neatly made up in a corner of the workroom luvaduck he said its a miracle this me sleeping here all on my own safe as houses and my uncle not knowing a thing about it i dont know how to thank you enough fatty that i dont well dont try said fatty bets did you find the toffees ah yes i see a lump in your cheek and one in pips fatty can we do anything to help ern asked bets i mean bring food or something like that cook will always give us bits and pieces well i vote we all bring what we can without arousing any suspicions said fatty ern had better send a postcard to his mother saying getting on fine quite happy or something like that in case goon tells her that hes sent ern off but i dont somehow think he will hell imagine that ern has rushed back home with awful tales about him im going to enjoy myself said ern bouncing up and down on the campbed wish i could do something for somebody you bets for instance id do anything reely i would ive no doubt your chance will come someday said fatty now what about a game or shall we first of all decide what expeditions we are going to make this week it sounds as if we were explorers or something said pip how nice to be able to say what about exploring the sahara old man or i think we should row down the nile and count the number of crocodiles there dear fellow the others chuckled well lets take a vote on where we should go first said fatty taking two sheets of paper from a shelf here are the lists made out by pips father and larrys together with a few notes of my own i think well take a vote as to which two places we would prefer to visit we can always go and see the others afterwards if we want to he read out the list of places well there you are now just choose two of those each of you and scribble them down fold your papers in half and give them to me ill open them and see which places the majority of us want to visit soon they were all busy bets asked how to spell banshee so everyone at once knew one of her choices the notes were handed to fatty and he opened them well the two places that the majority of you want to see are the old watercaves at chillerbing and banshee towers on banshee hill bets im surprised you put down banshee towers i thought youd be scared of any places connected with banshees wailing in the night fatty i only chose banshee towers because you said there were magnificent seapictures there said bets i wont go if there are still banshees though unkind fairies wailing and foretelling horrible things id hate that dear bets banshees only belong to fairy tales said fatty seeing that bets looked rather scared we shant see or hear a single banshee but we shall see a magnificent set of seapictures i believe some of them reach from floor to ceiling we shall feel quite seasick if we gaze at them too long i shall take some seasick medicine with me then said bets solemnly ive some left a few pills everyone roared with laughter im only teasing you bets said fatty i say do look at those two dogs they all turned to look and there were buster and bingo both squeezed into busters basket fast asleep so entangled that as larry said tother couldnt be told from which pip glanced at fatty and ern both had such pleased admiring looks on their faces that pip laughed look at fatty and ern he said did you ever see such dippy looks on any faces except doglovers yes i did on yours on your birthday when granny gave you two white rabbits said bets at once you looked at them just like auntie sue looks when she goes to see if her twins are asleep quite dippy that made pip go red and everyone laughed youre getting quite smart young bets said fatty well to come back to banshee towers i see that four out of five have voted for that so well go there and three out of five have voted for the watercaves so those are our first two expeditions i voted for banshee towers too said ern to bets im mad on seapictures you see i want to go into the navy when im old enough so i had to vote for the seapicture place and dont you worry about banshees bets the moment i see one ill whistle like this see and ill make them so scared theyll fly out of the window and never come back and ern suddenly put two fingers into his mouth screwed up his face and gave a very sudden very long and extremely piercing whistle it made everyone jump violently and the two dogs in the basket leapt straight up into the air as if they had been shot buster barked and bingo howled and both dogs tore round and round the room after imaginary enemies ern was quite overcome at the commotion he had caused fatty glared at him ern do you want to bring all the policemen in the neighbourhood here that whistling of yours is exactly like a policewhistle youll have my father and my mother down here if you dont lookout luvaduck muttered ern trying to catch bingo as he tore past him for the third time really scared fatty heard a shout from somewhere outside and groaned somebody is coming he said switch off the light bets quick the switch is just behind you shut up barking buster you ass now no noise anyone well sit here in the dark and hope nobody comes to find out what on earth we are doing here shhhhhhh not a sound was to be heard in the darkened room except some rather heavy breathing from a scared ern suppose he was found here by his uncle or somebody and sent home ern wished and wished that he hadnt shown bets how he proposed to frighten a banshee after five minutes had ticked by fatty judged it safe to put on the lights again as he did so there came the sound of a gong from his house away up the garden he groaned thats my supper bell where has the evening gone to ill have to go you and pip ought to go too bets gosh and so had we said larry pulling daisy to her feet good thing our father and mother are out tonight and theres only cookie to see to us goodnight everyone sleep well ern so long bingodog be good wuff said bingo pleased to hear his name he accompanied everyone to the door his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen the two dogs gave each other a quick lick and buster trotted up the garden with fatty ern was left alone in the shed he was astonished to hear bingo growling softly twenty minutes later and horrified to hear soft footsteps coming to the door his heart sank was it his uncle coming to fetch him but how could he possibly know where he ern was the door opened and a torch shone in lighting up the darkness in which ern sat ern trembled and shook feeling most alarmed ern its me fatty ive come to bring you some supper and to tell you theres a torch in the table drawer if you want to see to eat or to read i shant be able to come down again to the shed tonight so goodnight and sleep well ill bring you some breakfast in the morning coo thanks youre a wonder fatty said the grateful ern and took the tray that fatty handed in theres a bone for old bingo from buster said fatty giving him a paper bag so long ern see you tomorrow so long said ern gratefully and sat down to eat a nice piece of fried fish mashed potatoes and greens he gave the bone to bingo who was thrilled he made such a noise gnawing it that ern felt sure it could be heard for miles around bingo old dog are you enjoying this said ern when at last he had undressed and slipped under the rug that fatty had left for the campbed come on under the rug with me well keep each other warm thats right snuggle down goodnight goodnight ern and bingo youre quite safe though somebody has peeped in at the window and knows you are there dont worry it was only the black cat next door and she fled as soon as she saw bingo sleep tight off to banshee hill ern had a happy but very restless night bingo kept imagining that he heard rats running round outside the shed trying to get in and leapt on and off the campbed every few minutes rushing to sniff round the corners of the shed his long tail waving in excitement bingo id much rather have rats nibbling my toes than you jumping off and on my tummy all night long said ern at last for goodness sake come and lie down tired out at last bingo cuddled under the rug and fell asleep era put an arm round him and went to sleep too dead to the world until morning he awoke to hear a stealthy knocking on the door and flew out of bed to open it fatty was there good old fatty his pockets bulging buster was with him and immediately went to rub noses with bingo hallo ern said fatty pushing his way in quickly to prevent the excited bingo from rushing out got to be a bit careful gardeners here this morning and hed better not see you in the shed he might tell goon ill be very careful then said ern as fatty pulled a hastilywrapped packet from one pocket and some apples from another here you are ern he said best i could do for the moment i didnt dare to take too much from the larder but there were plenty of eggs so that was something hows old bingo was he good last night well he seemed to be hunting round for rats for hours said ern unwrapping the packet fatty gave him coo hardboiled egg sandwiches smashing and two buttered rolls with honey inside youre a brick fatty straight you are youll find some little bottles of lemonade in that cupboard said fatty and an opener too i darent bring you a pot of tea mother would start asking questions ern sat happily munching his egg sandwiches a glass of lemonade beside him with bingo sitting expectantly at his feet buster went sniffing at the bottom of a second cupboard and fatty laughed he knows a packet of his biscuits is kept there and he wants to give old bingo some said fatty getting up am i right buster old thing woof said buster dancing round excitedly his tail wagging bingo joined him having heard the word biscuits soon he and buster were amiably sharing a packet crunching up the biscuits in delight buster was overjoyed to have bingo to play with he suddenly went completely mad and began to rush round and round the room at top speed barking wildly bingo joined him and the two boys hurriedly leapt out of the way shut up buster said fatty dont do your racehorse gallop in here gosh there goes the lemonade buster have you gone completely mad bingo oh my goodness hes got hold of the rug now said ern hell tear it to pieces look at them having a tugofwar fatty youll have to take buster away theyll wreck everything a cautious knock came at the door and the two dogs left their play and rushed to it barking madly come in yelled fatty mind the dogs it was little bets come to bring ern a packet of food ern gave her a hug and opened the packet bets had made him some potted meat sandwiches and brought him two currant buns as well and next time i come ill try and bring a pot of jam she said oh look at bingo hes sitting up and begging did you teach him that ern no said ern in surprise perhaps buster did good bingo good you can stop begging now those sandwiches are for me i brought bingo a ball said bets feeling in her coat pocket here bingo catch the ballgame became very boisterous as buster also joined in and soon chairs went flying and rugs slithered about in the middle of it fattys mother looked in at the door whatever is going on she said i knocked fatty but there was such a noise i suppose you didnt hear why ern you here already youre very early how is your uncle mr goon ern was rather takenaback er well he has a bit of a cough he said dear dear i hope he didnt cough all night poor man said mrs trotteville i dont know i didnt hear him coughing at all said ern truthfully you and bets are here very early today said fattys mother is there a meeting or are you going out together or something yes mother yes were all going off on an expedition said fatty hastily we shall be starting pretty soon er any chance of sandwiches for ern and me ill tell cook said mrs trotteville and disappeared up the garden path much to everyones relief fatty frowned at buster it was your silly barking and bingos that made mother come and see what was going on he said sit and you too bingo sit buster promptly sat looking up at fatty with pricked ears bingo took one look at him and did the same and now not another bark out of you see said fatty to buster and ern pointed his finger at bingo and said exactly the same bets giggled they look like two naughty little boys and do look bingo is putting his tongue out at you ern sure enough bingos tongue was lolling out of his open mouth as he sat panting on the rug his bright eyes were fixed lovingly on ern couple of fatheads said ern very proud of his dog now just keep sitting till we say you can get up look said fatty i rather think wed better set off on this first expedition of ours this morning as ive said we were going bets go and round up pip and larry and daisy will you tell them to be here in half an hour with bicycles sandwiches and drinks right fatty said bets happily and off she went an expedition all together to banshee towers it really would be fun in just over half an hour everyone was ready pip came with bets larry with daisy all on their bicycles now how could they get erns bicycle too it was in the shed at mr goons uncle will be at the police station by now said ern i could nip in and get it all right but for goodness sake dont get caught said fatty ern shot off and ran all the way to mr goons house he went to the woodshed opened it and was thankful to see his bicycle still there good thing uncle didnt think of it or hed have locked it up he thought and rode off at top speed keeping a wary eye out for goon fortunately he was safely at the police station very busy indeed soon they were all cycling away down the country lanes very happy to be going on a picnic to banshee hill the spring sun shone down the birds sang in the hedges and the sky was as blue as in summer i can feel some portry coming into my head said ern to bets who was riding beside him poetry said bets oh ern youre so clever at making up poetry do tell it to me how does it go ern loved making up what he called his portry he went on cycling his head full of the things he saw around him primroses in the ditches cowslips in the fields new green leaves on the hawthorn cows grazing pigeons cooing well it hasnt quite come yet he said but i know what im going to call it coo oh is it a song the doves are going to sing all about the spring said bets say it to me ern ern sailed along on his bicycle loudly chanting the portry that had suddenly come into his head coo look at them primroses down in the ditch smiling all over their faces coo listen to all the birds up in the hedge and larks in the big open spaces coo look at the cows and the cowslips too and and and what said bets do go on ern its wonderful cant seem to think of the end of it said ern frowning thats the worst of me when i think of portry bets it comes and goes and now its gone praps fatty can think of the ending well ask him when we have our lunch said bets look isnt that bannshee hill up there coo what a hill said ern sounding as if he were beginning his coo song again i bet well have to walk half way up it ill push your bike for you bets yes it was banshee hall a very high one running up steeply with a winding road twisting to the summit as they came near to it the sun suddenly went in and a great black cloud blew up behind it i suppose thats banshee towers right at the very top said bets queerlooking place it stands there as if its glowering down at us i dont like it very much especially with that black cloud behind it youre right said ern as they began to cycle slowly up the winding road that led to the top very bansheeish i should say looks as if it wants to grumble and growl and wail buck up young bets i believe its going to pour with rain here let me wheel your bike for you its too steep to ride just here fatty had just turned round to see if the girls were managing all right and was pleased to see ern wheeling bets bicycle for her ern might be rough and ready sometimes but he had very nice ways thought fatty he called to daisy want any help daisy no im all right said daisy panting i just hope well get to the top before it pours i say that looks a pretty grim place up on the hill doesnt it yes more like an old fortress than anything shouted back fatty look at the two dogs weve left them far behind never mind theyll catch us up sometime they arrived at the gloomy old place at last and stacked their bicycles in a convenient shed then they made their way to the entrance this way to the wailing banshee said larry grinning at daisy and bets make ready to run for your lives ass said fatty seeing bets alarmed face ill make you run for your life if you say any more larry come on we have to pay to go in so dub up inside banshee towers how much to go in please asked fatty one shilling each said the dourlooking man behind the turnstiles whew thats rather a lot for us children to pay said pip dont we go in for halfprice you do not said the man looking at them severely over the top of his spectacles do you charge for dogs asked fatty no they are not allowed in here said the man anyway you havent any dogs with you we seem to have lost them said fatty er do you charge for cats i can see one sitting in your office and what about horses said larry joining in any objection to horses or a sheep or two no horses and no sheep said the man and no silly asses either so be careful if you want to go in see hes smarter than he looks said fatty to the others when they were safely inside lets buy a catalogue shall we i say what a place and what a view said daisy going to one of the great windows that looked down over the countryside glorious you can see everything for miles around fatty come and look at this picture called bets its so real you can almost hear the swish of the waves they all went across the stone floor their feet clattering to a wall where a great picture was displayed a stormy sea the waves rising high the spray flying i feel as if my face is getting wet with spray when i look at that said bets in awe isnt it magnificent do buy a catalogue fatty i want to see what it says about this picture fatty went back to the man at the turnstiles took a catalogue and put down a shilling the man didnt even look up surly fellow thought fatty and went back to the others leafing through the catalogue to find a description of the picture that bets liked its called fury of the storm he said it says the artist is one of the most famous of seaartists and would you believe it that picture was painted more than a hundred years ago and yet it looks as fresh and clear as if it had been finished yesterday someone clattered over the stonefloor set down a stool and put an easel in front of a picture on the opposite wall he proceeded to set up a large canvas on the easel the children went over in curiosity hallo kids said the man a shockhaired fellow in a loose black painting overall come to worship at the shrine of seaart mind you dont bump into the banshee it wails one day a week you know so you may hear it i dont want to said bets at once anyway there isnt a banshee its just imaginary there was further clattering and three more artists came in carrying easels they set themselves down in front of various pictures fatty stared in surprise are you copying the pictures he asked the man beside him who was now sitting on a stool mixing colours on a palette yes we all belong to a school of art said the man those who are good enough are sent here to copy these pictures for practice we can sell them all right afterwards you know bets looked at the picture on the mans easel it didnt seem very good to her you havent painted that wave the right colour she said pointing well alter it for me said the man offering her an enormously long paintbrush oh i couldnt said bets see that fellow over there said the man pointing with his brush well hes the best of the lot he doesnt belong to our artschool though you go and see his work better than the original artists i sometimes think they went over to look at the picture the other man was copying he sat in front of a lovely seascape that shone on the wall opposite the man it was a picture of a blue sea swirling round the bottom of a high cliff tumbling over the rocks on his big canvas he was reproducing a marvellous copy he scowled at the children allez vous en he growled thats french for go away bets whispered to the surprised ern wed better go but ern wouldnt move he stood staring at the picture on the wall his face full of wonder and awe to think anyone could paint the sea like that why it was real you could almost hear the wind and the roar of the waves you could feel the spray and wake up ern said larry youll shout for a lifeboat if you look at that picture any more its smashing said ern absolutely smashing wish i could paint gosh if id painted that picture there id never do anything but sit and look at it all day long the french artist who was copying the picture suddenly lost his temper as ern breathed heavily down the back of his neck he leapt up drew his paintbrush across erns face and hissed at him with a long string of what sounded like complete gibberish to the startled ern come on weve upset the fellow said fatty seeing the alarm on bets face sorry sir but you shouldnt lash out with your brush like that ern come with me ern but ern was still staring at the picture on the wall absentmindedly rubbing at the paint that the artist had streaked across his face larry chuckled ern looked rather like a clown now fatty and larry took him firmly by the arms and led him to the opposite side of the great hall where other pictures were ern and bets could have stayed there all day staring at the pictures there seemed to be some magic about the seascapes that appealed to each of them in a way that the others did not feel soon they left bets and ern to themselves and wandered into the other rooms here there was old armour on the walls and old weapons in cases the four examined them with much interest and fatty longed to take down a great old pike from the wall and caper about with it i dont see why we shouldnt have our picnic in here do you said larry looking out of one of the great windows that enormous black cloud is now pouring down sheets of rain we cant picnic outofdoors we neednt make any mess at all and well take all our litter home with us i bet that badtempered fellow out at the turnstile wont let us stay said fatty whats it to do with him said larry weve paid havent we anyway im jolly hungry gosh was that thunder it was the children felt all the more determined to stay in banshee towers for shelter and have their lunch there ern was longing to not because of the lunch but because of the pictures he simply could not take his eyes off them the six sat down in a corner of one of the great rooms behind a kind of large settee now if that turnstile man looked in he wouldnt see them and turn them out wonder where the dogs are said fatty suddenly they ought to have been here long ago gone rabbiting halfway up the hill i expect said ern or else that turnstile man wouldnt let them in theyll be all right theyll either turn up or go home some of those artists are leaving said larry i can hear them packing up and shouting goodbye hallo who are these peep through the arms of the settee fatty visitors do you think yes they certainly looked like sightseers there were three women and a man and they ambled aimlessly round looking at the pictures and the old armour not worth a shilling to come in and see all this junk and i never did like seapictures said one woman all those picture waves that never break but just rear up and keep still gives me the willies to the childrens dismay the visitors sat down on the settee behind which they were hiding and began to rustle paper unpacking their lunch all them silly tales too about banshees wailing said the man weve wasted our shillings it would be worth a shilling to hear a banshee wail but there i never did believe in things like that it was at this moment that fatty suddenly felt impelled to be a banshee the idea came to him in a flash and he couldnt stop himself he opened his mouth and let out a marvellous wail eerie longdrawn highpitched and really terrifying eeeeoooooohhhhheeeeohoooooooooo the man and the three women leapt up from the settee as if they had rockets under them one of the women screamed and then they all four fled at top speed to the door and out into the great hall to the entrance where the turnstiles stood not only the visitors jumped almost out of their skin larry daisy pip bets and ern jumped too and clutched in fright at one another when the eerie wail echoed round them larry realized almost at once that it was fatty and he gave him a very hard punch fathead what did you do that for i almost died of fright look at poor bets shes trembling fatty overcome with laughter and shame at one and the same time couldnt say a word gradually the others joined him in laughter and the six of them rolled about trying not to laugh too loudly oh their faces groaned fatty oh what made me do it im awfully sorry but it just sort of came over me oh how they skedaddled and your faces too oh i must laugh again and ive such a stitch in my side i bet any artists left skedaddled too said pip wiping his eyes youre a horror fatty the things you think of honestly if it had been a real banshee wailing it couldnt have done it better i do think but what he thought the others never knew because a most extraordinary noise gradually began to echo all around highpitched wailing unhappy it went on and on and bets and daisy clutched at the boys in real terror fatty thats not you this time is it fatty said daisy in a shaking voice oh what is it i dont like it i dont i dont tell it to stop but the wailing went on and on mournful and miserable and soon the children huddled together in fear amazed and frightened at last it stopped and they all heaved a sigh of relief lets get out of here said larry its all right bets it was probably just a silly echo wailing round the hill cheer up fatty bring the lunch well have it somewhere else do come on a strange discovery fatty collected the lunch and they all crept out from behind the large old settee they walked with rather shaky legs across the room to the great hall where the artists had sat copying the pictures now only one was left the frenchman who had been copying the picture that ern had liked so much he was rolling up a canvas very carefully whistling below his breath he jumped when he saw the children coming in and looked annoyed so you have no fear of the banshee he said you are brave brave brave see all the others have gone ils avaient peur they were so so afraid but i i am not afraid of the banshees nor of how do you call it goosts ghosts said fatty do you really mean to say you werent scared no but today there was something something how do you say it queer first there was one banshee wailing and then there was a second i suppose mes enfants you know nothing of the first banshee fatty felt himself going red but he wasnt going to admit anything to this laughing man he didnt like him very much are you going asked fatty seeing the man tying the canvas he had been rolling up just to the village to my car and then back again to paint paint paint said the man and dug fatty in the chest with his roll of canvas and you you stay here to wail wail wail ah what a naughty boy and taking no notice of fattys angry face he strolled across the hall and vaulted over the turnstiles as easily as an acrobat i suppose he thinks hes very clever growled fatty not at all enjoying being laughed at by the artist listen its still pouring with rain we cant picnic on the hills well have to have it here banshee or no banshee dont look so scared bets a wailing cant hurt us the turnstile fellow has gone said larry looking across to where the man had sat when he took their money gone to his lunch i suppose well we should be pretty safe in this hall come on lets eat something well feel better then so they went over to where a great wooden seat stood beside an old oak table fatty unpacked the lunch and soon they were all sitting down eating it surprised to find that they were so hungry after their fright ern tell fatty your poem said bets suddenly seeing a piece of paper sticking out of erns pocket and feeling certain that ern had managed to find time to write down his pome poem said fatty surprised have you been going in for poetry again ern er well fatty its only a silly sort of pome i mean poem said ern blushing ive called it coo ah its about doves or pigeons then is it said fatty cooing well not exactly that sort of coo sad ern anxiously its reely the sort of coo you say when youre surprised like ive got it written down here i must say i feel like writing a pome about the sea too now after seeing all those seapictures youre a wonder ern said fatty and meant it come along wheres this poem i couldnt finish it fatty said ern looking at it thats the worst of me it all comes in a rush like and then fades out and i cant think of a good ending well read it ern said fatty so ern blushing again read out his pome at top speed coo look at them primroses down in the ditch smiling all over their faces coo listen to all the birds up in the hedge and larks in the big open spaces coo look at the cows and the cowslips too and and ern stopped and looked pleadingly at fatty i cant think of the end fatty i just cant oh yes ern theres only one possible ending said fatty and carried on at once coo look at the cows and the cowslips too and the lions so dandy and yellow and the cups full of butter for me and for you and hark where the bulrushes bellow coo look at the runner beans how fast they go and by this time the others were laughing so much that fatty had to stop for breath and laugh too ern stared at him in admiration how do you do it fatty he asked solemnly takes me ages to think of even one line and you just go rattling on and on coo id never have thought of that line look at the runner beans how fast they go thats right down funny fatty dear old ern your lines are poetry and mine are not said fatty clapping him on the back yours are just a bit too cooey thats all coo isnt a good word for poetry unless its said by a dove youre a wonder you are said ern remembering another of fattys lines lions so dandy and yellow you meant the yellow dandelions there didnt you honest fatty youre a genius lets change the subject said fatty feeling rather a fraud he could reel off verse without stopping ridiculous amusing and clever and could never think why everyone thought it wonderful everybody finished asked larry screwing up his papers theres a litter basket over there i say said pip suddenly what do you suppose has happened to buster and bingo they ought to be here by now surely oh i expect they turned tail and went home when they got too far behind said fatty they probably lost our trail we shant see them till we get home i only hope they are behaving themselves a sudden very familiar noise made them all jump woof woof golly that sounds like them said ern in amazement where are they i cant see them anywhere wuff woof theyre both about somewhere said fatty puzzled but their barks sound a bit muffled buster bingo where on earth are you a scrabbling noise came from the big fireplace and the children went over to it at once an old iron cauldron stood squarely in the middle of the wide hearth and the barking seemed to come from under there fatty lifted up the heavy old thing and gave a loud exclamation oho what have we here look a neat round trapdoor the dogs seem to be under it somewhere bets go and see if theres anyone about whose permission we can ask to pull up the trapdoor bets ran to the turnstile and looked all about there was no one to be seen she hurried back no fatty i cant see a soul i expect the turnstile man is away having his dinner and the artists havent come back yet though theyve left their easels here right then well have to yank up the trapdoor without permission said fatty help me ern there was now such a loud and excited barking coming from beneath the trapdoor that it seemed almost as if there might be half a dozen dogs below not just two how did they get there said larry watching fatty and ern heaving up the trapdoor they cant possibly have got down through the trapdoor so they must have found a way into the hill and gone up an underground tunnel to banshee towers oooh a secret passage said bets her eyes shining can we go down it here she comes said fatty panting hard as he and ern heaved the trapdoor out of its place immediately the two dogs hurled themselves out and fell upon ern and fatty in rhapsodies of joy barking licking pawing as if they had gone mad steady on steady on said fatty pushing buster down buster will you kindly tell me how you got here woof said buster dancing about happily and how did you get here bingo demanded ern whose dog seemed intent on licking every single inch of his face stop it bingo i shall have to borrow a towel from somewhere soon keep your tongue in your mouth for a bit oh goodness there he goes again larry was looking down the hole where the trapdoor had been he took out a small torch from his pocket and switched it on he gave a sudden exclamation look there are steps cut down from the hearth almost like ladder steps going down and down where on earth do they go to we might have time to explore a bit said fatty feeling thrilled to see the steps leading down into the darkness bets go and see if were still the only ones here bets ran off and then came back her face rather frightened fatty the turnstile man is coming up the hill hes nearly here put the trapdoor back quickly ern and fatty lifted the trapdoor into place and then put the heavy cauldron over it they were still kneeling down by the fireplace when the turnstile man came in munching an apple he gave an angry shout when he saw them quick pretend weve dropped a shilling said fatty in a low urgent voice look for it all of you in the hearth and on the carpet too quick so when the puzzled turnstile man ran up they were all apparently hunting feverishly for a lost shilling must find it fatty was saying simply must a shilling is a shilling where on earth did it go is that it over there bets oh so youve dropped some money have you said the man sure thats all youre up to let me have a look and down he dropped on hands and knees too he gave a sudden shout and picked something up ive got it here it is and he held up a shilling in triumph thanks said fatty and held out his hand but the man laughed in his face and slipped the coin into his trouser pocket findings keeping he said now you go off all of you youve been here long enough and how did those dogs get in you ought to pay for them you did oh arent they your dogs said ern in such a surprised voice that bets had to put her hand over her mouth to stop a laugh escaping my dogs i should think not i cant bear them said the man and made as if he were going to kick buster buster growled and showed his teeth and the man backed hurriedly away go on now you clear out he said thursdays my afternoon off and i want a bit of peace and very thankfully the children did clear out and went to fetch their bicycles the dogs gambolling round what a bit of luck a shilling had been dropped in that hearth sometime by somebody said ern as they all mounted dear ern i dropped it there myself grinned fatty i knew if that fellow found it as i meant him to he wouldnt worry about the trapdoor any more come on now home everyone home buster bingo home home again and a good long talk well that was a rather surprising expedition said fatty when they were well away from banshee towers i feel we have quite a lot to think about the wailing of the banshee i dont mean my wailing of course that wasnt a patch on the old banshees my word she could wail all right dont remind me of it said bets with a shudder i just want to put banshee towers behind me and ride away home down this hill as quickly as i can and then there was that queer trapdoor in the hearth said larry and the puzzle of how on earth the dogs arrived underneath it and i didnt like the look of that turnstile man at all announced daisy i thought he looked a villain oh not as bad as that said pip he just looked bored and badtempered and i must say i would too if i had a turnstile job on the top of a cold hill in a place where banshees wailed id like to get home and talk about it said larry i dont know what you think fatty but it all seems pretty queer to me a bit of a mystery you mean said fatty well its about time that the five findouters had a good juicy mystery to solve isnt it oh yes said pip in delight weve never had one with banshees in before well i could do without banshees really said bets what about telling the chief inspector you know inspector jenks he might bets we really cant tell him silly stories of banshees said fatty they dont really exist you know they all right well what was it that we heard this afternoon said bets i dont care what its name is it was as bad and weird and horrible as any banshee so there youre right bets it was pretty awful said pip i didnt like it myself real or unreal that banshee is most mysterious look out now were coming to a very steep bit go as slowly as you can all the way in case your brakes are weak away down the hill they sailed in a long line the the two dogs galloping manfully or dogfully as bets said after them what a day they had had and how they all longed to be down in fattys workroom and talk about it and make plans to solve yet another mystery bets shivered with excitement there always seemed to be a mystery of some sort when fatty was around everyone was glad to be in fattys cosy workroom especially the two dogs who were quite tired out with their long run buster flopped down in his basket panting and bingo fell on top of him too tired to play in half a second they were sound asleep one great basketful of dogs said bets smiling im glad theyre such friends its nice for bingo to have a friend like buster you know wellbroughtup like said ern i want bingo to have good manners hell learn from old buster real copycat bingo is no no said fatty gravely there you make a mistake ern not a copycat surely a copydog ha ha funny joke said pip who was tired and not in the mood for fattys quips im thirsty said larry any orange squash fatty plenty in my cupboard said fatty and glasses too and theres some chocolate somewhere buck up and get what you want im longing to discuss the strange happenings of this morning you know i think somethings going on up there up where asked ern banshee hill ass said fatty two things puzzle me that banshee wail and the hole under the hearth where that cauldron stands well whats puzzling about the banshee wail asked bets you said thats what banshees did wail and howl and cry yes but you heard what that artist in the black overall said went on fatty he said that the banshee only wailed one day a week well why only one day perhaps banshees only do wail one day a week suggested daisy i mean all that awful wailing must be a terrible strain on the throat i bet your throat felt sore after youd wailed at the top of your voice you sound a bit husky to me well im not said fatty i could wail like that for half an hour or more and not feel husky for goodness sake dont do anything of the sort said larry youd have the firebrigade here and the police and every doctor in the place do come back to the point larry said fatty why does the banshee only wail once a week there cant be a real banshee there there arent such things it must be somebody faking one but why for fun said bets yes but why on a certain day persisted fatty what on earth does it matter said pip getting tired of the subject it can wail every day of the week for all i care pip you should have a more alert enquiring mind said fatty solemnly you know thats a fake banshee and id jolly well like to find out whos working it and how and why i dont want to go up that hill again said bets i loved the pictures but i hated the wailing dont worry bets you neednt go but im going said fatty im going tomorrow i tell you i smell a mystery well you must have the most powerful nose anybody ever had said larry all i can smell is that oilstove smoking i suppose your nose is too high and mighty to smell ordinary things like that turn down the wick ern youre nearest ern turned down the wick carefully fatty he said could i come with you if you go to banshee hill tomorrow not to mess about in a mystery though just to see those seapictures again especially the one with the high cliffs and the blue sea swirling round it oh the one the french artist was copying said fatty yes that was a beauty all right ern you can come with me youll be company and while you stand and gloat over the pictures i can do a little snooping its just as well i should have someone with me who is obviously there to see the pictures oooh thanks fatty said ern i hope that banshee doesnt come wailing round me though it only wails once a week ern said fatty ill eat my cap if it wails tomorrow im pretty certain it has its pet day for some reason or other look wed better go daisy and i said larry getting up in a hurry gosh id quite forgotten our granny was coming to tea buck up daisy for goodness sake were going out for the day tomorrow fatty so we wont be seeing you so long they shot out of the shed door and the others heard them racing up the garden pip stood up then and yanked bets to her feet come along bets he said you look half asleep telephone us fatty when theres a meeting again i should think bets is tired out with the long bicycle ride said fatty giving bets a hug goodbye bets and dont dream of banshees tonight i hope im not being a nuisance to you fatty said ern when the others had gone staying here in your shed no no of course youre not a nuisance ern said fatty hallo whos this coming i seem to know those heavy footsteps its uncle said ern in alarm he must have heard that ive not gone home fatty hide me theres nowhere to hide you said fatty looking round hed look in that cupboard at once listen now ern ill lock the door and when your uncle comes knocking on it you slip quietly out of the window see ill hand bingo to you hide somewhere and come back when goon is gone bangbangbang that was goon at the shed door fatty had quickly turned the key in the lock so the policeman could not open it a roar came from the other side frederick trotteville you open this door i know youve got ern in there i saw him through the window you open this door or ill go to your father ern ern in here mr goon you must be seeing things shouted fatty going to the door wait a minute its locked shut up buster making that row buster and bingo were certainly making a terrific noise neither of them liked mr goon and they had recognized his voice at once ern was now getting out of the window at the side of the shed he patted the sill and bingo came running to him and leapt into his arms sh said ern no barking now he crept off to where a thick clump of bushes grew and squeezed into the middle of them fatty quietly shut the window after him and ran back to the door on which goon was still angrily hammering be patient mr goon said fatty the key seems to have stuck ah its all right now there we are he turned the key smartly and flung open the door the angry policeman stormed into the shed at once shouting at the top of his voice ern ern you come alonga me you never went home you disobeyed me you just wait and see what but goon didnt finish what he had to say because buster flung himself on him with enormous delight trying to nip his ankles through the thick trousers gah said mr goon kicking out that dog again wheres ern i saw him i know i did well have a good look round mr goon said fatty politely he may be under that stool or behind the books in the bookcase or in the dogs basket buster stop that row goon was quite at a loss as he stood staring round the room he had seen ern there he knew he had it didnt occur to him that ern had had time to slip out of the window he glared at fatty and glared at buster and turned to go buster gave a bloodcurdling growl and goon shot out of the door at top speed you wait he shouted as fatty shut the door ill get ern all right ho yes ill get him and away he went muttering to himself that toad of a boy too clever by half he is where is ern just wait till i get hold of him he wont sit down properly for a week that he wont banshee towers again when the policeman had gone ern crept out of the middle of the bush and went back to fattys shed grinning thanks fatty he said youre a pal i say youre sure you dont mind if i go up to banshee towers with you tomorrow be nice to have your company ern said fatty and meant it also you may be useful you see i do want to snoop around a bit and if there are people there you might be able to take up their attention somehow so that no one will be watching me but how do i take up anyones attention said ern alarmed im no good at playacting fatty you know that oh ern you can do a sudden bit of tap dancing or sing a little song or pretend to faint said fatty ill signal to you like this if i want you to turn peoples attention to you and away from me and fatty smoothed back his hair three times see dont look so alarmed nobody will lock you up or box your ears theyll just stay still in astonishment and forget all about me and what im doing all right fatty said ern in a mournful voice and settled down to read one of fattys books coo the books youve got fatty you must have over a thousand this ones smashing he was soon lost in the seastory he had found in fattys big bookcase bingo lay happily on erns feet and buster sat as close to fatty as he could ern came to the end of a chapter and looked up in great content he was perfectly happy he had a friend a dog a good book and somewhere quiet to read ern gave an enormous sigh and went back to his book thinking how lucky he was to have a clever friend like fatty next morning ern woke up feeling excited he sat up on the campbed in the shed trying to remember the reason for his excitement of course fatty and i are going up to that banshee place again and i shall see those grand pictures he thought in delight bingo do you hear that sh dont bark too loudly nobody must know were here ive told you that before bingo had snuggled down on erns feet all night long he sat up yawning wondering when his friend buster would come bingo thought the world of buster and copied him in every way he could even to rubbing his nose with his left paw instead of his right one he crawled over erns knees and gave him a smacking lick on the nose then he rolled over to be tickled do you know something bingo said ern solemnly right now i am feeling very very sorry for all those boys and girls who havent a dog of their own they just dont know what theyre missing now then thats enough licking go and fetch me that towel so that i can wipe my face good dog then clever dog you understand everything i say dont you now please take the towel back jolly good bingo fatty brought ern some breakfast and then disappeared to do a few jobs for his mother ill be back at ten and well set off he said well take lunch with us ill buy it on the way because cook is getting a bit suspicious of the enormous appetite i seem suddenly to have developed she said this morning that i seem to want enough for two people and she was right they set off just after ten and fatty stopped to buy some sandwiches new currant buns and oranges he had akeady put some lemonade and a cup into his bicycle basket ern gave a sudden cry of alarm as they rode up the village street fatty theres my uncle sure enough there was mr goon standing at the crossroads directing the busy traffic with a frown he couldnt believe his eyes when he saw ern cycling along with fatty stop he bawled ern you heard me stop but alas ern disobeyed the law and pedalled faster than ever leaving poor mr goon very angry indeed woof said a loud voice as they pedalled past mr goon and buster suddenly stuck his head out of a wooden box that fatty had tied to his rear mudguard bingo was in a similar box on the back of erns bicycle but he was so much afraid of mr goon that he didnt dare to venture even the smallest bark as he passed him he didnt want to be plucked away from his beloved ern by the loudvoiced mr goon good idea to take the dogs with us this way said ern i reckon its really too far for them to run all the way there and back they seem to like the ride dont they fatty gosh im enjoying it too as soon as they were out of the town fatty burst into song up the street on pedalling feet here we go ern and i and a song we sing with a tingalingling as we both go bicycling by our wheels go round with a swishity sound as fast as the wind we fly through village and town now up now down here we go ern and i ern almost fell off his bicycle in admiration coo fatty did you just make that up this very minute just like that it suddenly came into my head said fatty modestly it goes nicely with our pedalling ern doesnt it and the two of them sang the bicycling song as ern called it at the tops of their voices pedalling in strict time to the rhythm of the lines buster didnt like the singing and began to bark fatty turned round and addressed him no buster youve got the words wrong and the tune as well that made ern laugh they pedalled on happily and soon came to the steep hill up which they had to toil slowly banshee towers glowered at the top as if not welcoming them at all when they arrived there the boys put their bicycles into the racks provided in the shed and sauntered to the turnstile buster and bingo running at their heels oh you again said the man grumpily plus dogs didnt i say that no dogs were allowed id just like to know how those dogs got into banshee towers yesterday ive no idea said fatty they suddenly appeared one minute they were not there the next they were no one was more surprised than we were they can stay in that shed over there said the man but they cant go indoors see right said fatty paying out two shillings i say tell me one thing does the old banshee wail on one special day each week and if so why the legend says that it was on a thursday that calamity came to the lord of banshee towers said the man and so the banshee wails that same day oh so thursday is always the banshees great day said fatty very interesting have you any idea where your banshee lives dont ask daft questions said the turnstile man losing his temper go on in and dont come bothering me just one more question said fatty tell me when did the banshee first begin to wail in modern times it says in the catalogue that she used to wail a hundred years ago or so the legend went but hadnt been known to wail since i saw that the catalogue was printed six years ago what made the banshee begin to wail again did she conveniently find her voice six years ago when the catalogue was printed and this place was thrown open to the public are you trying to say that the banshee isnt real that shes a fraud said the man angrily well you ask the tall dark man youll see in the armour room today hell soon put you right he owns this place see and he ought to know about the banshee didnt he ah now thats information worth having said fatty looking pleased ill certainly have a chat with the man who owns the place and the banshee too thanks a lot whats his name hes an austrian said the man still very cross name of engler and i hope he wipes the floor with you you fat nuisance now now said fatty raising a finger in reproof just as if he were a nurse addressing a child now now mustnt be rude mustnt lose tempers dont want to put you into a corner and with that fatty marched off to put the dogs into the shed leaving a most irritated man behind him and accompanied by a rather scared but most admiring ern i dont know how you can hold your own like that fatty he said straight i dont look theres the frenchman we saw yesterday wonder how hes got on with the picture he was copying bonjour said fatty politely to the frenchman who was hurrying down the great hall carrying a rolledup canvas finished your picture ah bonjour mon ami said the frenchman you come back so soon well my friend here loves the seapictures said fatty you see he wants to go into the navy so anything to do with the sea attracts him even if its only pictures wont you show us the copy you made of that grand picture is that it you are carrying yes yes but i must hurry or i would show it to you said the frenchman giving a polite little bow someone awaits me outside au revoir we shall meet again if you come often to this place i am always here he scurried off fatty looked after him thoughtfully funny little man he looked round for the owner of the place the austrian called what was it now oh yes engler that must be the man over there in the armour room tall dark foreignlooking he looked a hard sort of man better be careful of him you go and have a look at your magnificent seapicture ern said fatty ill go and talk to the austrian owner i want to ask him a few questions about banshees right said ern and wandered off happily round the big room looking at this picture and that saving his favourite picture to the last he came to it eventually and stood in front of it gazing at the great high cliff the swirling waves the grim rocks he stared at the seagulls tossed by the tempestuous wind and imagined himself in a boat on that angry sea swept by foaming waves the wind howling in his ears ha if only he could paint a picture like that it would be almost better than going into the navy no on second thoughts hed rather go to sea ern stood for some time opposite the picture then suddenly a puzzled look came over his face he stood closer to the picture and peered at the sea from this side and that he scratched his head he stood further back then he went to one side and stood there and then to the other side screwing up his eyes as if he were trying to see something he shook his head and frowned ill have to find fatty he said at last its a puzzle this is cant make it out where is fatty oh there he is talking to that man fatty fatty here ive got something to ask you erns queer discovery fatty had studied the austrian owner of banshee towers and had decided that he didnt look to be the type that usually bought old places just because they were beautiful hes a sharp business man if i ever saw one thought fatty it beats me why he bought this outoftheway place he cant make much money out of visitors except for a month or two in the summer i wonder if he owns the pictures as well the austrian was sitting on the big settee behind which the children had hidden the day before he was studying a catalogue of some sort frowning over it he was big and burly with great eyebrows and a big nose fatty went up to him and spoke in his politest voice excuse me sir for interrupting but i believe you own this magnificent old place what er dear me you startled me said the man in a very deep voice with a decidedly foreign accent yes my boy i own it but alas it was a bad bargain so few visitors come to see it i suppose they come because they hope to hear the wailing banshee said fatty we heard it yesterday a very fine performance sir very fine best wailing i ever heard how is it done sir done my boy who knows anything about the poor poor unhappy banshees said the man who knows how or why they wail well in these days sir i expect they wail because their machinery is started up said fatty unexpectedly i mean modern banshees are all pretence arent they certainly not said the man angrily you think i am a fraud you think my banshee does not exist i own a very fine banshee poor poor thing how she wails it rends the heart let me see now banshees are supposed only to wail because they want to warn the owner of the place that something terrible is going to happen to him arent they said fatty putting on his most innocent expression you know sir i heard her wailing yesterday and i hoped somebody would warn you that trouble and unhappiness might be coming to you of course that wouldnt be so if it wasnt a real banshee but simply some kind of machinery sir but you are certain it isnt my boy i give you leave to go into every room in banshee towers and to look into every hole and corner and cranny there to see if there is any machinery said mr engler solemnly oh thank you sir thats very kind of you but ill take your word for it that youve no machinery hidden in any of the rooms said fatty lets change the subject sir what wonderful seapictures there are here what collection are they from sir i dont recognize any of them well you seem to be an intelligent boy said the austrian obviously struck by fattys ready conversation so ill tell you they are from a famous collection of pictures in count ludwigs castle in austria he is a cousin of mine and he has lent me the pictures to attract visitors to banshee towers a truly wonderful collection but alas few people look at the pictures just a few artists to copy them and one or two visitors like yourself notice them they are worth a lot of money i suppose said fatty oh yes yes thousands of pounds said mr engler i wonder you dare to risk the chance of some thief coming here to steal them said fatty now my boy use your sense said mr engler it is not easy to take great pictures like these from their frames and carry them off unnoticed ha would you be able to do it it was at this very moment that ern decided to go and find fatty mr engler jumped when erns voice came into the room sounding urgent fatty fatty here ive got something to ask you excuse me sir thats my friend id better go and see what he wants said fatty surprised to see ern looking so agitated thank you for giving me so much information very kind of you he went over to ern ern what is it now dont blurt it out at the top of your voice for goodness sake come into the hall and tell me quietly well fatty you know that seapicture i liked so much the one i showed you yesterday with the high cliffs and the swirling sea below yes i remember it quite well its still over there said fatty waving an arm towards it yes well theres something very queer about it today said ern agitated come and look what do you mean queer asked fatty surprised as they came up to the picture somethings gone out of it said ern something i noticed particularly yesterday fatty its not there today straight it isnt well what was it asked fatty exasperated the picture looks exactly the same to me fatty i promise you im telling the truth said ern i promise you now look see that rock there and the sea swirling up to it and that wave coming up behind well fatty yesterday there was a little red boat painted on that wave with two tiny sailors in it i noticed it particularly and i thought to meself well the artist put in that boat just sos people looking at his picture would realize how enormous the cliffs were and how grand the sea was swirling round the rocks see if the artist hadnt put a boat there i wouldnt have known how steep and high the cliffs were so so so the picture would have lost some of its grandeur you mean said fatty with much interest ern this is as you say very queer in fact most peculiar why did someone paint out that boat it must have been the frenchman who did it of course perhaps he doesnt like boats said ern maybe he gets seasick but fatty you cant see any marks where he might have washed the boat off the picture or painted it out with greens or blues thats what beats me it certainly is very strange said fatty extremely puzzled you really are quite sure ern that the boat was there yesterday well bets was with me when we looked carefully at the picture said ern she liked the painting too i expect shed remember the boat all right well ask her ern listen dont mention this to anyone not to anyone at all said fatty i cant at the moment think why anyone should remove or wash out a boat from a seapicture but id like to think about it before we tell anyone see right said ern now ill go and look at some of the others maybe all the boats have been removed but no those pictures that had boats in them still had their boats and their clouds and their waves ern could see nothing missing in them nor could fatty look theres the frenchman who was copying the picture yesterday said ern suddenly hes copying that small one over there now lets go and ask him if he removed that little boat from the big picture but before they could get to him mr engler the austrian had gone over to him and was in close conversation then the two men arose and went into the armour room finally disappearing into a small room beyond no banshee wailing today fatty said ern with a grin as they walked round the show of seapictures not the right day said fatty and immediately fell into such deep thought that he didnt hear a word of what ern was saying to him not the right day why was one special day of the week the right day fatty didnt believe in the banshee even although he had felt very scared when it had wailed the day before ern i have a feeling id like to go and have a look down that trapdoor hole again he said suddenly you keep watch for me see and give a whistle if you see anyone coming all the artists are gone except that frenchman and as far as i can see hes having a good hearttoheart talk with mr engler goodness knows what about i wish i did he and ern went into the armour room and ern stationed himself in the middle so that he could watch all doors and hear anyone approaching from any direction fatty went quietly to the great fireplace he managed to move the cauldron to one side and saw the trapdoor underneath as before he turned to ern everything safe he said and ern nodded not a footstep was to be heard anywhere coming across the stone floors not a voice echoed fatty pulled up the trapdoor lid and peered down yes there were steps leading downwards to what to the banshee and maybe her machinery where was the lower entrance to this passage through the hill the one the dogs must have found and taken to get up to banshee towers and scrabble about under the trapdoor it must be a very wellhidden one somewhere on the deserted hillside fatty wished he dared to go down the steps and see what he could find but he might be a long time gone and he couldnt leave ern behind nor did he want to take ern with him neither of them had torches and it would be dangerous he heard a sudden hiss from ern and stood up at once there was just time to shut the trapdoor and replace the great iron cauldron so that the trapdoor lid could not be seen just in time footsteps sounded in the little room beyond and voices mr engler and the artist were coming back fatty beckoned to ern and the two fled into the hall and then through the turnstiles the turnstile man was not there and to fattys surprise he suddenly saw him walking out of the hallentrance with mr engler and the artist so they are all three buddies thought fatty well i dont know what it means but it means something ive got to work all this out somehow its certainly adding up to a mystery of some sort but i cant for the life of me see what or why or how he and ern went to get the two dogs who tired of being in the shed were whining and pawing at the gate they barked frantically and joyfully when the two boys came up they hopped into their boxes on the rear mudguards and fatty and ern were soon sailing dangerously fast down the steep banshee hill i think ill call a meeting tomorrow fatty said to ern somethings going on up there that i cant make head or tail of if we get the others to hear what we have to say and we all talk about it we might see daylight good thing we went up ern or you wouldnt have spotted the missing boat im sure thats a clue to the mystery whatever it is but its just about the most puzzling clue weve ever had we dont even know what the mystery is or if the clue really belongs to it whew an interesting talk and a good idea fatty telephoned larry and daisy that night and also pip and bets he would not tell them why the meeting was being called and they all felt rather excited is it a mystery fatty oh do say its another mystery said bets have you any clues yet one said fatty and i dont even know what its a clue to or if it is a clue tell you all about it tomorrow be here at ten please actually its a clue ern found i didnt even notice it just before ten oclock there came knockings on the door of fattys workroom he had lighted the stove and had set out a variety of biscuits as fatty said its so much easier to talk when youve got something to eat as well in came larry daisy pip and bets looking eager and excited buster and bingo gave them a most uproarious greeting and upset the plate of biscuits now listen you two dogs said fatty sternly i dont know which of you had the bright idea of upsetting biscuits all over the floor but i tell you this not one biscuit do you have till weve finished our meeting i know dogs consider it clever to upset plates of biscuits and cats think it is smart to upset milk so that they can help themselves but im just a bit smarter than you are see sit the dogs sat eyeing the biscuits mournfully bets felt sorry for them and patted them do begin the meeting fatty she said were longing to hear about this new mystery is it really one well thats what were going to decide said fatty if it is we must make our plans to solve it if it isnt we just dont bother any more now listen to what ern discovered yesterday when we went up to banshee towers ern would you like to take over and tell what happened oh no thanks fatty said ern uneasily youre the one to talk theres nobody talks like you i could listen for ages my uncle mr goon always said you had the gift of the gab and hes right you could talk the hind leg off a donkey you could or the tail off a horse or the well really ern anyone would think you had the gift of the gab said larry surprised do go on no said ern and subsided so fatty took over and began the tale of erns strange discovery ern went to look at that big seapicture that he and bets liked so much he said do you remember it bets oh yes every bit of it it was lovely said bets well describe it said fatty and dont leave even the smallest detail out bets its important it was a picture of a stormy sea with waves lashing against a very high cliff said bets the sky was blue in parts and white in others it was so full of spray that it almost made me feel wet anything else asked fatty well no except that there was a tiny red boat bobbing on a wave said bets when i saw that i suddenly realized how enormous the cliff was and i thought the artist must have put it there on purpose to make the cliff grander and the sea more well more magnificent you know bets thats just what we wanted you to remember the boat said fatty because the boat is the only clue we have that little boat is no longer in the picture its gone it isnt there there was an astonished silence well whats happened to it said pip at last did some artist there wash it out or paint over it perhaps he didnt like it no he didnt wash it out it seems said fatty there are no marks and no erasures now isnt that a peculiar little mystery its impossible said pip perhaps bets and ern are mistaken the little boat must have been in another of the seapictures after all there are masses of them up in that big hall yes thats the solution said larry its obvious erns mistaking one picture for another there must be another picture there with the little boat in it there cant have been a boat in the one ern thinks there was yes i know that bets saw it as well but she too may have seen it in a different picture thats all after all she didnt go up with you and ern yesterday if she had she would probably have pointed out that it was in a different picture and even taken you to it i tell you said ern exasperated i tell you the boat was in that particular picture i saw yesterday and the day before i ought to know i stood in front of it for ages i feel as if i could almost paint the same picture myself all right ern calm down said fatty now findouters any ideas youre sure ern that its the same picture and is in exactly the same place asked daisy same cliffs same waves same sky same frame everything same everything said ern rather sulkily goodness knows i looked at it long enough its just the boat that is missing the little tiny boat well i simply dont see any answer to this particular puzzle said fatty its certainly a mystery but rather a silly little mystery with no rhyme or reason just a seapicture from which a very small red boat has gone we must give it up the smallest mystery weve ever had and the only one impossible to solve what a pity said larry i think we all ought to pop up to banshee towers and have a look round to see if by any chance the picture with the boat has been hung somewhere else said daisy after all some of the pictures look very alike they are all seapictures with waves and cliffs and skies and ships id rather like to solve this particular little mystery not leave it in the air its a nice day we could cycle up again yes lets do that said pip what do you say ern good idea said ern id like to find my little boat lets go now and before long the six children were on their bicycles once more on their way to banshee towers a little mystery like this was not going to beat the findouters they took the dogs too in the boxes on erns and fattys back wheels it was quite a little company cycling along up the hill to banshee towers they were there at last but what a shock there was a notice up that said closed for temporary repairs blow look at that said ern in dismay now we shant be able to find out about the boat it was indeed a blow panting up that steep hill all for nothing groaned pip is the turnstile man anywhere about hes a surly fellow but he might let us in if we told him we only want to be there for half a minute i wonder what repairs they are doing said fatty the place seemed in very good order to me look its probably pipes they are replacing said larry pointing to a pile of pipes of all sizes looks as if their watersystem has gone wrong these arc lead pipes like we have in our houses at home probably the place is damp and you cant have damp in a picturegallery ruins the pictures at once yes youre probably right said fatty examining the pipes well easter is over so they wont have many visitors till whitsun good time now to do any repairs well what shall we do shall we just look round to see if anyones about they wandered around but saw no one what a waste of a morning said larry what can we do now i tell you what we could do which would be rather fun said pip you remember how the dogs discovered some secret way up the hill that led to the great fireplace in the armour room they must have found an entrance somewhere on the hill a cave or a hole of some sort that had a passage leading to banshee towers cant we look for that well it would be fun said larry and the others nodded anyone brought a torch three of them had torches in their pockets good i dont expect theres much chance either of finding where the dogs made their way into the hill or of getting up any passages ourselves said fatty it was probably nothing more than a large rabbithole they found leading into some underground warren anyway lets have a shot at finding it the dogs will help said ern and away they went on their bicycles down the hill with bingo and buster racing behind halfway down fatty leapt off his bike and called to buster buster find find buster buster stood still with his ears pricked find what was he to find there were no rabbits here he and bingo hadnt sniffed the scent of a single one what could fatty mean find buster find the hole you discovered the other day ordered fatty find he pointed here and there over the hill buster still stood with his ears cocked his head on one side trying his hardest to understand what his master wanted it suddenly dawned on him that there was a hole somewhere the hole he and bingo had found perhaps that was what fatty wanted a hole he gave a sharp little bark and ran a little way uphill he stood there looking from side to side sniffing the wind bingo came to join him though he hadnt the faintest idea of what fatty wanted buster gave another short bark and ran to the right and then made for a great bush that overhung a steep part of the hill bingo followed yapping come on i think old buster has understood what i meant said fatty and he and the others climbed up the hill soon becoming out of breath for it was very steep just there they had carefully hidden their bicycles under some thick bushes a little lower down both dogs had disappeared fatty yelled loudly buster where are you buster buster appeared by the overhanging bush and barked bingo appeared and barked too what buster did he had to do as well come on said fatty i think busters found what we want whew look here under this bush a great hole i bet buster thought it was a giant rabbithole i have a feeling that this is where we disappear into the heart of the hill lets hope we come up in the right place follow me everybody and there they go one by one be careful fatty there may be danger ahead up the passage and a queer find the hole was quite a large one with long grass and some kind of creeping plant growing across the entrance fatty bent double pushed his way into it shining his torch in front of him he could hear buster and bingo scrabbling some way ahead giving little woofs as if chatting with each other the hole became much larger after a few yards and fatty was able to straighten himself a little and make his way more comfortably he soon saw that the passage he was in was now of rock not of earth it was very uneven and at times the roof came down so low that he had to bend almost double behind him came bets then larry then daisy ern and pip being the last two larry and pip held the other torches which gave a very good light in the black darkness of the strange passage ahead were the two dogs very pleased and excited to think that fatty and the others were using the passage they had found some days before my word isnt it steep shouted fatty and made the others jump for his voice sounded very strange in the narrow passage not at all like fattys usual voice it was muffled and mysterious and had a queer echo steepteeeep came the echo the dogs didnt like it they stopped pricked their ears and whined its all right buster said fatty only the echo carry on carryon arryon on on said the echo and the dogs barked angrily that was worse still of course the rocky passage was immediately full of wild barks and the dogs were very frightened indeed was this place full of hundreds of dogs they made their way back to fatty in alarm and he patted them and spoke quietly trying to defeat the curious echo now now its all right good dogs very good dogs go on now show us the way way said the echo also quietly waywaywaaaaay after they had all climbed a good while very glad indeed of their torches fatty stopped for a rest the last bit had been very steep indeed he waited until the others had come up close and then spoke we should be near banshee towers now he said you remember that there is a trapdoor under the old cauldron well that means that any noise we make now may echo up into the armour room so be very quiet please just in case anyone is there without a word and making as little noise as possible the six went climbing up fatty made the dogs keep close to him so that he could prevent them barking but before they came to the trapdoor they came to something that surprised them very much fatty saw it first of course because he was leading his torch suddenly showed him a big space just in front and he stopped in surprise the tunnel had widened out into a kind of underground room a room with an uneven rocky floor and equally uneven rocky walls fatty was able to stand completely upright he shone his torch round the underground room in surprise he gave a short whistle whew whats all this quick everyone come and look they crowded into the strange rocky room it was quite empty except for three things a piece of peculiarlooking machinery something that looked like a deflated balloon and a chair what on earth is all this said pip shining his torch on the machinery at a guess i should say it was the machinery that sets the dear old banshee wailing at the top of her voice said fatty are you sure said bets whats that balloon thing for shine your torch on it fatty i should think that this balloon is inflated by a pump worked by that bit of machinery said fatty and then when it deflates it makes that screaming wailing banshee noise but how is it that its heard all over banshee towers asked bets puzzled oh there are probably amplifiers in every room said fatty who always seemed to know everything you know things that magnify any sound and make it tremendously loud dont you remember how loud the wailing was when we heard it the other day and how clear and distinct it was oh yes said bets shivering as she remembered the horrible noise but fatty what a peculiar thing to do to fill the place with wails like that i should have thought it would frighten people away not bring them here yes it seems a bit odd when you put it like that bets said fatty fiddling about with the machinery i wonder how this works whats this wheel for he turned the wheel to the right nothing happened he turned it to the left and very suddenly indeed something began to work inside the machinery clank click clonk click clunk its working turn it off quick cried bets afraid of what might happen but fatty didnt he watched the machine a little grin on his face oh fatty fatty you know quite well what youve done the balloonthing began to move buster saw it trembling and he growled and showed his teeth bingo immediately did the same the balloon grew bigger and bigger and then came another loud click and something fell into place and began whining the children couldnt see what it was i bet thats the amplifier getting ready to work said fatty his eyes gleaming well hear something in a minute dont be scared little bets its only machinery ah here we go and then from the now fullyinflated balloon came a weird unhappy sound a wailing that held everyone spellbound it seemed so human bets took fattys hand at once frightened at the strange noise it sounded so very very heartrending its only a very clever trick bets said fatty in a low voice just a bit of machinery and a specially fittedup balloon and an amplifier to make the wails very loud indeed all fitted neatly into a most convenient underground hole in a rock i wonder if mr engler is at the bottom of this oh fatty please stop the machine begged bets i hate this wailing i hate it fatty pulled a little lever the machinery slowed down the balloon gradually deflated the wailing grew slower and softer and then stopped altogether there was a marvellous silence and everyone enjoyed the sudden peace bets heaved an enormous sigh ooooooooo i shall never hear a more horrible noise in all my life than that wailing fatty no real banshee could ever have wailed like that surely i should find it very difficult to believe in a real banshee bets said fatty examining the machinery carefully by the light of his torch i even find it difficult to believe in a man like engler who is wicked enough to rig up a thing like this but unfortunately hes real enough well what do we do now fatty please lets go up through the trapdoor if we can and have a look at those pictures again begged ern i do want to see if bets remembers the one that the boat was in if she does ill know im right about it if she doesnt well then theres no mystery im beginning to hope there isnt what with banshees and disappearing boats and hidden machinery i feel rather sick well dont be sick in here ern there really isnt room said fatty briskly right well go up through the trapdoor providing nobodys about but i think that if there had been we should have had a visitor down here pretty quickly trying to find out why the banshee wailed all on her own i have a feeling that the place really is shut up today fatty went to an opening in the furthest wall of the queer little rockroom and shone his torch into it just as i thought he announced steps steps cut into the rock just like a ladder i bet its the steps we saw leading down from that hole in the hearth where the trapdoor was the others crowded round him yes there were the steps that they had seen the other day from above ill go first said fatty better make no noise just in case anyones about but i feel certain there isnt or whoever was here would have come rushing to see why the banshee machinery was suddenly working everyone was silent as fatty climbed the rocky steps he soon came to the top but could see nothing above his head but the trapdoor set firmly in its place here goes said fatty and gave it a push upwards it upset the iron cauldron standing over it and this fell over on its side with a terrific clatter that scared fatty almost as much as it frightened the others down below he stood at the top of the steps listening to his enormous relief he could hear nothing no shouts of surprise no clatter of running feet nothing the place must be completely empty well thank goodness for that fatty climbed out of the trapdoor hole and looked round the place seemed absolutely deserted well now they could examine the pictures to their hearts content and maybe solve the mystery of the missing boat one by one he hauled the others up from the hole in the hearth the dogs were handed up last of all by ern and were very glad to scurry around and stretch their legs properly how they had hated that wailing i want to look at that lovely seapicture said bets at once ern come with me she and ern hurried through the armour room into the great hall where the pictures hung yes there they all were in their blues and greens sunshiny stormy windy some of them stretching from floor to ceiling heres that boatpicture called ern standing in front of it do you remember it bets oh yes said bets yes there was a little red boat thats not there now i know there was one ern it was on this wave here wasnt it and bets touched one of the waves not far from the bottom of the picture yes said ern triumphantly thats exactly where it was bets i told you that didnt i fatty now bets has told you too we cant both be wrong fatty where do you think the boat has gone said bets really puzzled it doesnt look as if its been washed out or painted over a big wave probably caught it and it sank to the bottom said pip solemnly thats the simplest explanation bets dont be so silly said bets quite worried over the vanished boat fatty id like to look at some of the other pictures too but before they could do that dogs who had been wandering happily about together suddenly stood still and began to growl their hackles rising on their necks fatty shushed everyone at once get back into the armour room girls somebodys coming he whispered buck up youll have to get down the trapdoor quickly and run for your lives we shall be in real trouble if were found here larry and pip look after the girls the two girls shot off into the armour room with pip and larry and were soon down the steps they wanted to wait for ern and fatty but larry wouldnt let them youre in my charge now he said quickly now get along underground fatty too went to the armour room with ern hoping there would be time for them both to slip down the hole but there wasnt he just managed to push the cauldron quickly over the trapdoor and step back on to the hearthrug footsteps came to the door of the room and a voice snapped out stand where you are whats all this how did you get in you boys answer me at once prisoners now what can be done it was mr engler who stood there shouting he looked extremely angry and his face was very red behind him stood the turnstile man a sneering smile on his face buster flew at them with bingo behind him and both dogs were kicked hard by the two men and howled in pain call off these dogs or ill kill them said mr engler pulling a great sword from the wall where it had been hanging sit buster sit bingo shouted fatty his heart cold with fear to his enormous relief both dogs sat at once growling savagely their hackles still up thank goodness buster had been trained to be instantly obedient thought fatty bingo of course had just copied buster how fierce they both looked showing their teeth longing to get at these two men who dared to shout at fatty and ern good thing they obey you said mr engler still holding the sword i like dogs or i wouldnt give them a chance now explain your presence here please the door was locked so i presume you came in through one of the windows i saw that one was open when i came the one on the first floor easy enough to climb up ivy isnt it easy to break into a place you boys will have to explain all that when you come before the police fatty was thankful that the man thought they had broken in through an open window he said nothing he was certainly not going to explain about the trapdoor in the hearth if the man didnt know of it well and good oh dont take us to the police sir blurted out ern thinking of goons face if he ern were taken to the police station please dont we werent doing any harm reely we werent we were just looking round like ive seen these kids before sir said the turnstile man cheeky lot they are too six of them have been coming up with these dogs i told them dogs werent allowed i was a bit afraid these kids might find out what we shut up flint you fool snapped mr engler clearly afraid that he was about to say something he didnt want the boys to hear go and begin to load the van and be sharp about it ill deal with whats not ready and you can fetch it later he turned to the two listening boys im afraid you are going to have a very poor weekend he said ive decided not to hand you over to the police but to leave you all alone here without food or drink for two or three days just to teach you what happens to lads who break into places oh you neednt think you can get out of the window you so easily slipped in by i shall tie you up and lock you in this room and when i come back on monday or maybe tuesday ill listen to your apologies and let you go perhaps but sir our parents will be so worried began fatty we havent done any harm we apologize now we do really dont we ern ooooh yes said ern fervently a little surprised to hear fatty talking in such a humble voice why fatty sounded scared first time ive ever seen him frightened thought ern you can apologize when you next see me and have had time to think what fools you have both been said mr engler the turnstile man grinned sarcastically he was very very glad to see that cheeky fat boy as he thought of him standing there caught so easily tie them up said mr engler to the turnstile man im going to see if poussin is there hes about due now fatty wondered who poussin was it was a french name so maybe it was the french artist he stood waiting for the turnstile man to tie up him and ern got to go and get some rope if you want me to tie them up said the man turning no use those curtain cords said mr englar i must go and see if poussin has come these boys are not to be left alone until their wrists are tied tightly behind their backs tightly i said flint and dont talk to them else ill talk to you do you hear me yes said flint sulkily and went to tear down the cords that pulled the great curtains open or shut he had soon tied the boys by their wrists and ankles very tightly indeed you know these cords are too tight said fatty between his teeth no need to be so brutal ha youre not so funny now are you said flint cheeking me out there you was dont feel like cheeking me now do you fatty heard another voice the french artists he was in the great hall with engler he was speaking in french which fatty understood perfectly he strained his ears to listen he was extremely surprised to hear noises as of a ladder being dragged along the hall and set up somewhere he listened hard that sounded like a knife being used to cut something what on earth were they doing not damaging the pictures surely then he thought he heard the sound of a brush being slapped over some surface a brush a paintbrush probably was the frenchman painting a picture out there his easel set up as usual no it couldnt be that he wouldnt slap the paint on flint the turnstile man finished tying erns wrists stood back and grinned at the two angry boys well happy dreams he said and may the rats and mice run all over you tonight this place is full of them you wait till we see you again said fatty well be handing you over to the police i hope what are you all up to beats me you wont see me again im off to the states said flint americas the place for me now well soon be off and the old banshee can wail her head off for us we shant hear her he went out banged the door and the boys heard the key being turned in the lock ern groaned as he lay trussed up on the floor beside fatty this is a nice howdoyoudo he said good thing the men dont guess we shut up ern hissed fatty they may be listening hoping well give something away can you stand up no said ern trying hallo bingo pity you cant untie me is buster clever enough to untie you fatty have you taught him things like that yet buster and bingo were puzzled and distressed to see fatty and ern rolling on the floor groaning as their cords seemed to get tighter and tighter they licked the boys faces and whined pitifully fatty rolled to a settee and by means of using his tied hands managed to get himself into a sitting position he then stood up on his tied feet and began to hop to a window that overlooked the yard outside he was interested to see a small van there a plain dark blue one flint the turnstile man must have just finished loading it for he was at that moment slamming the door at the back then he went to the front hopped into the drivers seat and started up the engine at the same time a car drove up behind it and the two drove off together fatty quickly memorized the numbers of the van and of the car jbl and por he muttered gosh i wish i could write those numbers down ill never remember them ern can you remember jbl and por i dont think so said poor ern i cant think of anything but my wrists and ankles fatty what are we going to do well never be able to get these cords off of course we shall said fatty i didnt want to get them off before those fellows went i was afraid they might come back at any moment but how can we get our hands free said ern the cords much too strong fatty hopped across to the wall where a curious foreign knife hung he raised his wrists behind his back and placed them so that the cords were against the edge of the knife very gently he began to rub the cords up and down the knife careful not to press too hard and cut himself ern watched him in admiration trust old fatty to think of something smart fatty worked away and finally felt one cord give then another he pulled hard and very thankfully felt the cords loosening and slipping off his hands my word my hands are all numb and stiff he said trying to bend them this way and that ill undo yours ern when i can feel some life in my fingers buster ran to him and licked fattys hands whining he knew fatty was in some kind of trouble and his doggy mind was upset and worried there didnt seem to be anything at all that he could do for fatty it was some time before fatty could use his hands and even then they were shockingly painful he spent ages trying to undo erns cords he dared not use the knife on them for his hands were now too numb to use a knife safely but at last erns cords were undone too his hands were worse than fattys for flint had tied them very viciously soon their ankles were untied as well and life began to seem a little brighter are we going to escape down the underground passage asked ern i dont think i can walk though my legs are all pins and needles and i cant feel my feet the girls and pip and larry will send help for us said fatty what id like to do is to get out of this room and wander round some of the upstairs rooms i have a feeling we might find something interesting there that fellow locked the door i heard him said ern i know but we might be able to get to it and unlock it from this side said fatty he walked unsteadily to the door and looked at the lock then he bent down and looked under the door ern watched him in interest what was old fatty up to now im going to use an old trick one ive used before ern said fatty he went to the table and took a catalogue from the pile there he tore out the middle pages leaving only the stiff outer covers these he took over to the door knelt down again and pushed them flat underneath it so that the greater part of the covers was on the other side of the door then he stood up and with the end of his penknife blade jiggled the key in the lock until it was in a position for him to give it a push and send it out on the other side of the door the key promptly fell out and there was a little thud as it landed on the floor at the bottom of the door buster and bingo barked loudly what was happening now good said fatty pulling at the piece of stiff cover showing under the door on his side carefully he pulled it towards him oh so gently and as the stiff covers came under the door the key lying on them came too there it was at last safely on their side of the door now said fatty we can unlock the door from our side and do a little exploring i come on ern can you walk all right fatty does a little detective work fatty picked up the key that he had so carefully pulled under the bottom of the door hope i can turn it he said making a face as he put the key in the lock my wrist feels as if it hasnt even the strength to turn a key if the lock is stiff but the key turned easily fatty opened the door and peered out cautiously into the picture hall he knew that he had seen the car and the van go off but he didnt want to run into anyone who might still be in the place all was quiet buster and bingo very much on guard stood close by the boys ready to growl and fly at anyone who might be going to hurt them there cant be anybody here now said fatty the dogs would be growling if there were hallo look theres a stepladder over there and a tin of something with a brush in it looks as if somebodys been up to something you remember we heard a ladder being pulled across the floor ern and the slapping of a brush they were puzzled when they came to the tin they had expected it to be full of paint but it wasnt its some kind of glueypaste said fatty dipping his finger into the tin my word dont get it on your clothes ern its about the strongest paste or glue ive ever felt i just cant get it off my finger now what on earth was it used for they gazed at the two seapictures on each side of the tin nothing to help them there but wait a minute fatty suddenly noticed a thin shining streak of what looked like something sticky down the inner side of one of the frames he touched it it was sticky he was very puzzled why had someone used glue of some kind had the frame cracked and needed a little glueing pictures werent glued into their frames they were backed with board and then the frames were neatly placed over them fatty gave up putting the strange fact into a corner of his mind to consider later come on fatty what are you dreaming about standing there gazing down at that tin of glue or whatever it is said ern impatiently i want to get out of this place so do the dogs bingo was whining he didnt like banshee towers he wanted to have a good long run and stretch his legs all right bingo old thing said fatty well soon be off and away i just want to have a little look round a snoop is a better name perhaps and see if i can unearth a few of mr englers queer little secrets they went to a big staircase that had a very large board at the bottom with the words private no entry fatty took not the slightest notice of the big board but went straight up the stairs he went rather slowly and so did ern for their ankles were still swollen and painful after the cruelly tight cords the dogs raced up before them barking they came to a big room there was a large desk there and a smaller one pictures and empty frames were stacked all over the place there was a great pile of catalogues on the big desk and a scattering of letters very interesting said fatty turning over the canvases on which various pictures had been painted all seapictures of course look here ern remember this one yes its a double of the one we saw in the frame by the tin of glue he said cant see any difference thats a copy i suppose done by that french artist thats all he did seems to me sit there and copy somebody elses pictures funny i should have thought a real artist wouldnt want to copy he might if he were well paid ern said fatty hallo heres a pile of letters all neatly stacked together and tied with pink tape lets have a look and see who theyre from do you think you ought to look at other peoples letters said ern uncomfortably oh i think that after the kind of treatment the spiteful mr engler served out to us he really cant complain of anything we do said fatty reading some of the letters in any case ern i intend to give them to inspector jenks he will be very pleased indeed to have them coo said ern astonished i wouldnt say that fatty he might lock you up for taking them better leave them here fatty took no notice he was absorbed in one or two of the letters ern peeped at the heading on each the hedling art gallery diddinghame usa was one art shows company new york usa was another grand pictures company hinkling usa a third gracious thought ern what does fatty think he can find in letters like that he peeped down a sheet that fatty was absorbed in reading but couldnt make head or tail if it just a list of pictures and prices and artists thought ern he spoke aloud fatty i reckon were just wasting time now lets go those fellows might come back sooner then we expect and anyway bets and the others might already be sending help to us you know thatd be a waste of time seeing that we can just walk out and go home when we want to right ern said fatty just let me make a list of the art galleries listed here that buy pictures from engler he scribbled quickly and then took a last look round well just peep in the room next door first i have a feeling we still havent seen quite all i expected to see they went into the next room a smaller one ern stared in surprise it was fitted up as a very comfortable bedroom a large wardrobe stood open showing many clothes hanging there thrown across an unmade bed was a dark painting overall covered with smudges of oilpaint a book lay on a table beside the bed fatty picked it up at a guess i should say this book was a french one he said he looked down at it and nodded yes all about famous continental pictures especially pictures of the sea fatty turned to the flyleaf at the beginning of the book and here the owner has kindly written his name it belongs to that french artist of course and here is his address francois henri ortalo rue carnot paris very nice of him to leave it so handy interesting to see that mr engler has given him such a nice room to live in too he must be very useful to him oh do stop messing about with books and letters said ern desparingly i want to go i hate this place at any moment i expect to hear that awful bansheewail all right ern well go said fatty scribbling quickly again in his notebook i think wed better make ourselves scarce anyway in case mr engler pops back again through the front door i dont feel inclined to meet him again today i dont like his manners hes a beast said ern my ankles still feel as if ive been running for miles they ache so where they were tied ah well said fatty snapping shut his notebook well soon forget our wrists and ankles actually im feeling rather bucked i think ive now got the whole mystery wrapped up very neatly indeed youre boasting fatty said ern disbelievingly what about the little painted boat that disappeared from that picture downstairs i bet you dont know how that happened well well see said fatty i really think im beginning to see daylight well go home now and find the others and tell them what weve found lets see they had to escape down that underground passage in the hill and find their bikes and then ride home well unless they stopped on the way to have icecreams or something they will be home before us said ern theyd hardly stop for icecreams when they knew we were in trouble said fatty no i forgot that said ern come on lets go downstairs slip out of the front door with the dogs and run down the hill to where we left our bikes underneath that bush they went down the stairs with the two excited dogs both wagging their tails madly though as ern pointed out bingos tail waved rather than wagged it was so very very long they opened the front door and slipped out shutting it quietly behind them they made their way cautiously down the hill keeping close to the hedges halfafraid of seeing mr engler and his companions somewhere about the two dogs sensing that all was not quite right with their masters pressed close to their heels and didnt even attempt to go sniffing for rabbits at last they came to where they had left their bicycles hidden in bushes they looked round for the bicycles belonging to the other four but they were gone good then they got down the banshee passage safely said fatty they cant really be very much in front of us now we were pretty quick down that hill they were soon riding fast down the rest of the hill the dogs bumping in their boxes behind it was a miracle that they didnt fall out for the boys went so fast what do we do when we get back shouted ern i hope you wont go and report everything to my uncle goon i wouldnt like that you know im in trouble with him dont worry ern we hold all the winning cards now shouted back fatty comfortably i rather think we ought to go over goons head and get in touch with chief inspector jenks we know him quite well enough this is a bit too big a thing for a village policeman to handle luvaduck said ern in awe but wont the chief inspector think its a bit cheeky of us to telephone him i mean hes a big noise he is well get back to my shed first said fatty freewheeling very fast and find out where the others are they cant have been back very long my word ern im beginning to feel bucked im seeing daylight the mystery is dissolving everything fits go on fatty said ern disbelievingly its just a muddle to me straight it is fits the only fits i know are the ones ill have when my uncle gets hold of me oooh fatty go slower old bingo nearly shot out of his box just then fatty a horrid shock fatty and ern arrived at fattys home safely much to busters relief part of the road had been so bumpy that poor buster had found himself wishing he had sharp catclaws to hold on with instead of his own blunt ones he had decided that he didnt want to go bicycling with fatty ever again bicycling and dogs didnt really go very well together he and bingo jumped gladly out of the boxes tied on to the back mudguards and buster went to see if anyone had put something good into his enamel bowl ah kind old cookie she had filled his bowl with some nice fresh meat bingo rushed up too and hungry as he was buster remembered his manners and allowed bingo to share good buster im pleased with you said fatty well buy a good dollop of meat for bingo and im sure hell share his with you too now you two dogs stay out here he opened the door of his shed no one was there where are the others he said looking round gosh i hope theyre all right whats happened to them we certainly didnt pass them on the way perhaps one of them had a puncture said ern and as it happened he was quite right larrys front tyre suddenly went flat and he and the others had stopped at a little opening in a nearby wood while larry mended the puncture ern and fatty had actually cycled past them and hadnt even seen them or heard their shouts you simply whizzed by complained larry when at last he and the others arrived at fattys workroom we yelled and shouted but you were gone psssst like that sixty miles an hour and the two dogs bumping up and down like apples in a basket fatty are you all right what happened when we left you said bets i was so afraid those men might hurt you oh we were all right said fatty hurriedly pulling his coat sleeves down as far as they would go to hide the painful red lines round his wrists we found out a whole lot of interesting things bets we must have a meeting at once but before they could really settle down to it someone came knocking at the shed door opened it and looked in frederick are you there theres someone on the telephone for you oh mother cant you say im busy or something said fatty exasperated were just starting a most important meeting really important all right dear ill go back and tell chief inspector jenks what you say said his mother and shut the door but fatty leapt up with a yell mother wait you didnt say it was inspector jenks mother im coming straightaway ern looked round at the others as fatty shot out of the door at top speed buster at his heels i bet the inspectors heard of our discoveries at banshee towers he said pleased i expect he wants to ask fatty a whole lot of questions funny how old fatty always seems to get in on things first isnt it my word you wait till fatty tells you what we discovered this morning fatty ran all the way up the garden to his house his mind conning over likely reasons for the chief inspectors telephone call probably hes heard about the banshee towers goingson the wailing banshee for instance and maybe hes suspicious of mr englers doing well i can certainly give him some uptodate information thought fatty feeling pleased he ran to the telephone and picked up the receiver chief inspector jenks frederick trotteville here sir sorry to keep you waiting frederick ill come to the point at once said the chief im sorry to say ive had a serious complaint about you i expect you have a perfectly good explanation and i sincerely hope you have fatty felt most alarmed whats all this about sir he asked bewildered well actually there are two complaints said the chief one not very serious from mr goon about ern who he says was put in his charge by erns mother and who has run away and is being harboured by you in your shed thats quite right sir said fatty at once and im sure you wont blame me sir goon went for poor old ern and he im afraid ern will have to go back to goon said the chief its his mothers wish and parents do have some rights you know all right sir ill see to it said fatty feeling very very sorry for ern the second complaint frederick said the clear voice down the telephone the second complaint is much more serious its been put in by a mr engler the owner of banshee towers he accuses you of breaking into the towers with another boy whose name he doesnt know and there are also two dogs complained of apparently dogs are not allowed inside and you were told this and yet you were found there with a couple whose is the second dog erns said fatty in a small voice his heart was sinking down and down and down erns i didnt even know he had a dog said the chief yes sir he has called bingo said fatty what on earth were you and ern and two dogs doing wandering about banshee towers demanded the chief apparently it was closed for the day and the doors were locked frederick surely you didnt break in anywhere well not exactly break in if you mean smash locks or windows or anything like that said poor fatty we certainly did get in we the chief gave a deep groan you are a very very foolish boy frederick you have played right into this fellow englers hands he is a smart spiteful clever crook weve been trying to pin something on him and now youve messed things up by putting yourself in his hands frederick i simply do not know how im going to get you out of this fix i know hes a crook sir said fatty in a small voice we were trying to catch him out sir that phoney banshee wailing for instance and you knew he was a crook said the chief very surprised how on earth look here frederick id better come round and see you i simply never know what you are up to the sooner you grow up and join the police force so that i can really keep my eye on you the better stay at home till i come thats an order see he slammed down the telephone and fatty put back his own receiver most surprised to find his hand shaking gosh this wasnt funny at all what in the world would his father say i suppose i must be getting a bit too big for my boots said fatty to himself my word ive never heard the chief go off the handle like that before did i feel a worm yes i certainly did i only wish i had a nice deep hole to go to he called to his mother mother the inspector will be along in a little while will you tell him were down in my shed please then away he went hoping that his mother wouldnt call him back and ask him awkward questions he opened the door of his shed and went in you look gloomy fatty whats up said bets at once fatty sank down dramatically into a chair sighed and passed his hand over his forehead well i rather think i may have to go to prison or to borstal or somewhere he said old man engler has put in a complaint about me charged me with breaking and entering banshee towers and mr goon has also put in a complaint that when ern ran away i harboured him you never harboured me said ern who hadnt the faintest idea of what harbouring really meant im not a ship you just gave me board and lodging fatty let me stay here in your shed well thats another way of saying that i harboured you gave you shelter said fatty ern jumped up at once ill go back to my uncles then he said i wont let you get punished because youve been kind to me fatty thats not fair sit down ern said fatty we cant do anything for the moment chief inspector jenks is coming along here soon ill have to wait for him id like you all to stay though is my uncle coming too said ern fearfully i dont think so said fatty gosh wouldnt i like to put in a complaint about your uncle ern in fact i can think of several complaints i could put in nothing to what i could think of said ern gloomily shouting at me and almost deafening me clipping me on the ear pushing me around taking my listen someones coming said fatty his ears even sharper just then than those of the dogs i heard a car draw up outside our front gate im sure you couldnt have fatty said larry its right down the garden and but just then the two dogs set up such a loud barking that nobody could hear anyone speak shut up shouted fatty making a dive for buster do you want me to be had up for creating a noisy disturbance buster ern get hold of bingo they both seem to have gone mad a loud knock came at the shed door and the two dogs almost barked the place down then the door opened and there stood chief inspector jenks tall burly keeneyed but not smiling as he usually was he looked round the little company oh so all the findouters are here are they he said and smiled fatty was most relieved to see that smile perhaps the inspector wasnt going to be too hard on him after all well little bets so youre here too are you said the chief inspector and patted her head she caught hold of his hand inspector jenks you wont take fatty to prison will you she said in a suddenly choky voice hes just been working hard on a mystery thats all we all have cheer up bets i couldnt take him if i tried said the chief hes not old enough still a kid you know bit too big for his boots sometimes thats all well now hows everybody my word heres a new dog whats your name sir bingo said ern with such pride in his voice that everyone smiled hes my dog sir my very own you should see him play with buster here theyre a pair they are hes a nice dog ern said the chief and patted bingo who immediately rolled over on his back in delight i gather your uncle doesnt like him i cant imagine why nor can i sir said ern sir you wont let my uncle take him away from me or anything like that will you well talk about you and bingo later said the inspector and see what can be done its frederick here im worried about this man engler frederick certainly has a sound complaint against you what do you know about him i know a great deal said fatty and very surprising it is sir the others dont yet know all the things i know theyll be surprised too i rather think youll turn your attention to mr engler sir and one or two others when ive finished telling my story inspector jenks looked most surprised he took out his pipe and began to light it puffing out smoke then he sat back comfortably in his chair tell your story fatty he said in a much more friendly tone im ready no embroidery mind just the plain facts ones that you are absolutely sure of buster sat up straight and bingo sat up straight too they were going to listen with as much interest as everyone else well sir said fatty in a very serious voice it all started with the disappearance of a tiny boat in a big picture fatty solves the mystery there was dead silence in the shed as fatty told the story of the banshee mystery it all started with the disappearance of a tiny boat in a big picture in the picturegallery at banshee towers he began a boat in a picture said the inspector astonished yes sir you see we thought wed make a few expeditions these holidays and that was one of them to banshee towers to see the lovely seapictures there went on fatty it was ern and i who really wanted to go said bets so we all went up on our bikes and paid a shilling to go in we had a look round the pictures were grand said fatty and ern here stood for ages in front of a very big one smashing it was said ern taking up the story and it had a tiny red boat sir painted on a wave near the bottom of the picture well what about it said the inspector well sir we went again the next day and i went to look at that picture agan and the boat was gone said ern and it wasnt painted out or anything it just wasnt there strange said inspector jenks you must have made a mistake looked at another picture perhaps no sir bets here can say the same as me said ern and bets nodded that was the beginning of the mystery said fatty i sort of smelt something fishy from that very moment i didnt much like the turnstile man and i certainly didnt like the owner of the pictures a man called mr engler and i didnt much like one of the artists there a frenchman oh there were artists there were there said the inspector copying the pictures yes sir but not awfully well in my opinion said fatty except the frenchman sir honestly he was very very good he wasnt very nice though he painted ern right across the face by slashing at him with his brush but he was a real artist sir the others were only artstudents from some artschool it said in the catalogue sir that the pictures there belonged to a count ludwig of austria who had lent them to this mr engler to show in his gallery mr engler is an austrian too i believe the artists were copying them just for practice or to sell as copies afterwards they were most of them awful i wouldnt have given ten shillings for any of them went on fatty frederick you may as well know that we have reason to believe engler is a crook said the chief please tell me straight out if you have any reason to believe he is and if so what reasons this is as important for you as for me all right sir i can give you plenty of reasons said fatty briskly im pretty sure that what he does is to get that french artist to copy the pictures he has had lent to him from various art galleries all over the place then he takes the original picture out of its frame and rolls it up and sticks the finished copy in its place and i must say that francois ortalo makes some wonderful copies he sells the originals somewhere for a large sum of money of course said inspector jenks just what we suspected but couldnt prove well you can prove it now sir said fatty that french artist made a big mistake when he copied that fine seapicture that ern and bets loved he forgot to put that tiny boat into the copied picture thats the only difference that ern and bets could see in the two pictures a very very small omission said inspector jenks one that might have gone unnoticed for years in fact it might never have been spotted i dont think anyone but sharpeyed children would notice and remember a tiny boat so clearly ern i congratulate you you may be the means of catching a very clever and remarkable swindler ern went as red as a beetroot tried to say something and couldnt of course went on the inspector we want to know quite a few more things before we can charge this rogue with stealing perhaps you can tell me some of them frederick well i dont know sir said fatty i can tell you a few things though the frenchmans real name and address for instance i found it in a book when i er broke into his bedroom everyone stared at fatty in surprise whats his name quick give it to me said the chief opening a notebook his name is francois henri ortalo of rue carnot paris said fatty he knows all about the famous pictures on the continent of europe i found his name in a book about them the chief gave a little whistle oho so francois ortalo has turned up here has he he said i wouldnt like to say how many different countries want him for swindling people over pictures good work fatty anything else well i know which art galleries in america buy the original pictures said fatty and gave inspector jenks the list he had written down that morning in the office at banshee towers bless my soul said the chief hardly able to believe his ears am i dreaming weve been looking everywhere for this information how in the world do you know this well i just happened to see mr englers office desk said fatty and i just glanced at a few things sir i can only hope frederick trotteville that when you are grownup you will join the policeforce and not the ranks of the burglars said the inspector i suppose you do know that you had no right to go snooping in that fellows desk rogue though he is well i wasnt sure sir said fatty with a twinkle in his eye but ern here was rather shocked werent you ern well yes i was said ern but then i didnt know that fatty was getting information to pass on to you sir is there really a count ludwig sir who lends these pictures to mr engler asked fatty oh yes said the inspector and he must be a poor judge of art because although engler never sends him back his valuable original pictures but only dud copies he has apparently never noticed the difference then he wont notice that the tiny little boat is missing when he gets the copy said bets amazed he certainly wont said the chief you are much smarter than he is little bets and ern too can you charge mr engler and the artist and perhaps the turnstile man with robbery and swindling asked fatty its difficult said the inspector id feel safer if i could find out how he gets the original pictures safely out of the art galleries he shows them in such as banshee towers for instance it isnt easy to smuggle big pictures out of a place you know or into one for that matter its been really puzzling us weve watched and watched that fellow not only here but in other places too and weve never been able to lay our hands on any pictures being smuggled out or in oh thats easy said fatty i guessed that early on sir fatty you never told us how did they get the pictures out said larry astonished do you remember that there were always lengths of fat lead pipes about supposed to be for repairs said fatty well i went and snooped down one and i saw something tightly rolled up in it i couldnt imagine then what it was but now im absolutely certain that it was a rolledup canvas a picture off the walls it wouldnt be missed for a copy would be immediately slapped into place fatty remember that ladder this morning and the cutting sound we heard when we were locked in that room and the slapping of a brush almost shouted ern halfleaping from his chair that was what they were doing then they climbed up the ladder to cut the picture out then they slapped some sort of gluey paste on the empty space and stretched the copy over it it stuck almost at once of course yes i remember said fatty youre quite right ern youve been pretty clever over this why didnt you tell us all these things said bets well i wasnt quite sure how everything fitted said fatty you know it was a bit like a jigsaw i couldnt see the whole picture or know what it meant till id found every bit of the jigsaw it wasnt till this morning that i found the last piece the pipes in the shed then at last i knew how they managed to get the pictures out without anyone guessing youve done remarkably well fatty but i rather fear the men have smelt a rat and gone said the chief shutting his notebook someone must have tipped them that we were on the watch they went away in a blue van and a car apparently the man we had on watch unfortunately wasnt quick enough to take the numbers so i fear we cant set up roadblocks anywhere or issue a general warning to the police we have to know the registration numbers of the vehicles oh those i nearly forgot said fatty i saw the numbers this morning now let me see yes one was pair of rogues and pair of rogues thats not a carnumber said larry and the other was jolly bad lot said fatty yes por and jbl sir for for pair of rogues and jbl for jolly bad lot easy way to remember those vehicles sir the letters described the occupants so well well i wont say what a marvel i think you are or you might get a swelled head said the inspector jotting down the numbers at once do you happen to have memorized the number of my car in the same way fatty yes sir your car number is vgf said fatty promptly er vgf stands for very good fellow sir well im glad to hear that said the inspector getting up thanks fatty thanks ern we can now pin down those three rogues and put them somewhere where i am pretty certain they will not see many beautiful pictures what about mr englers complaint about me sir asked fatty you know breaking and entering into banshee towers actually we didnt break in sir we came up that underground passage hm well in the circumstances considering that you have given me so much help in this case frederick i shall cross out that complaint in my books said inspector jenks with a very broad smile indeed and you neednt worry about mr goon i am going straight up to the police station to tell him of the unexpected and really astonishing help you have given me this morning i must say that i think the five findouters are remarkably good detectives what about ern asked bets anxiously will it be safe for him to go back to mr goons quite safe said the inspector i shall tell him that his nephew ern was clever enough to spot what is probably the only clue in existence that could lead to the arrest of a smart rogue like mr engler well done indeed ern and with that out went the inspector murmuring something to himself lets see now my cars number is vgf and fatty said it stood for very good fellow hm i just wonder what else fatty makes those letters stand for when im out of favour hes certainly worth watching is master frederick trotteville you never know what old fatty is up to mr goon was amazed to hear what inspector jenks had to say he simply couldnt believe his ears all those pictures copied and the originals sold that fellow engler must have made a fortune and you say ern ern my nephew was the one that spotted the first clue id never have thought it of ern never well goon i shouldnt be surprised if your nephew doesnt make a very fine policeofficer in some years time said inspector jenks briskly its a pity you scared him so much and he ran away he might have been of some use to you yes sir i sort of lost my temper said mr goon id like him back sir if hes going to be as brainy as you think he is well i wouldnt mind teaching him a few things myself sir that might be useful to him later on thats the way to talk goon said the chief getting up and clapping the policeman on the back youngsters nowadays have some fine stuff in them you know as for that boy frederick trotteville well i pity all the rogues and swindlers and thieves in a few years time once frederick gets those brains of his to work they wont have a chance i think ill go down to the trottevilles house and have a word with ern said goon getting up his mothers been after me about him when she heard he wasnt here downright angry she was not with ern but with me just like her sauce ah you just tell her how clever ern has been that will smooth her down said the inspector well goodbye goon ill let you know when we catch those swindlers youll have ern back of course and no hard words said on either side and by the way what a very nice wellbehaved dog he has hasnt he even sits when hes told im sure youll enjoy having bingo back too goon he departed leaving mr goon feeling rather like a pricked balloon with the air slowly departing from him well hed better go down and see those findouters as they called themselves silly name but no doubt about it somehow or other they did solve mysteries and find out extraordinary clues maybe its silly of me to go against them thought goon frowning be better if i was more friendly like then theyd tell me things that ern now whoever would have thought he had a brain in his head i cant believe it he set off on his bicycle to ride to fattys house keeping a sharp lookout for dogs it was a curious thing but as soon as dogs saw mr goon riding majestically down the road on his old bicycle they seemed to have but one thought in their doggy minds and that was to race out into the road at top speed barking at the top of their voices and leap at poor mr goons ankles as his feet went up and down on the pedals down in the shed no one guessed that mr goon was coming they were all talking about their adventures in banshee towers the most exciting part was where we set off the wailing banshee machinery said larry my word that was a clever stunt of mr englers wasnt it i wish we had that machinery here said fatty what a shock everyone would get in the middle of the night well if you particularly want to give your neighbours a shock you dont need banshee machinery said pip giving fatty a friendly punch all you need is your own frightful wail youre as good as any banshee fatty my word when you wailed in that armour room the first day we were there i nearly died of fright theres only one part of the mystery we didnt solve said larry and that was why the banshee apparently chose thursday for its weekly wail why thursday well apparently there really wasnt any mystery about that said fatty and i neednt have bothered my head over it thursday is the turnstile mans halfday off so he used to set the machinery going to clear everyone away early then hed be able to shut up the place and get off in good time and ive no doubt that the french artist used to do a bit of packing up then carefully putting the pictures into those lead pipes ready for collection sh someones coming said bets oh fatty its mr goon whatever is he here for to complain about me harbouring ern i suppose said fatty hurrying to the window at the back of the shed look im not seeing him this morning i might be a bit rude if he starts saying anything nasty about old ern now you others tell him that erns been marvellous and that even the banshee must have been pretty scared of ern and bangbang that was mr goon knocking at the shed door fatty immediately leapt out of the window with buster if you have any trouble with goon dont let it worry you he said popping his head through the window ill be listening out here and ill come to your help at once larry then opened the door and there stood mr goon not looking nearly so fierce as usual he stepped in and to everyones immense astonishment smiled and nodded good morning mr goon said bets politely the others muttered a greeting too well well said mr goon in an unexpectedly hearty voice here you all are oh except frederick i er came to congratulate him and you all on helping to solve the mystery of banshee towers ern i hear that you were quite clever at spotting a very important clue ern blushed bright red at this compliment and couldnt find a word to say there was an awkward silence bingo broke it by suddenly giving a loud bark and rushing at mr goons ankles mr goon gave a sickly smile and tried to push him away bingo said ern suddenly in a stem voice stop that sit and bingo meekly sat down at once though he still looked longingly at mr goons ankles ha welltrained dog that said mr goon surprised er ill be quite pleased to have him back again ern bring him with you when you come there was another awkward and astonished silence ern broke it do you really want me to come back uncle and bingo here too hes not a bad dog just a bit excitable at times but hes not much more than a pup oh hes a fine dog said mr goon in a hearty voice very fine obedient too my word he must have scared that old banshee ha ha ha nobody else laughed they were all still a bit wary of their old enemy of course you know said goon that banshee business is a bit of a fraud the sort of thing that frederick would make a lot of its said to wail i know but ive never heard it whenever ive been near the towers ho ho i bet it wouldnt dare to raise its voice if it saw me anywhere near well we heard it all right said bets it sounded like oh let me see like and then from outside the window came a little wail just a very little one at first then it became louder and pitched higher in tone and soon the little room was full of the most heartrending eerie wailing that goon had ever heard bets jumped at first but she and the others knew at once that it was only old fatty showing the disbelieving mr goon what a banshees wail was like pretend to be scared whispered larry to the others and at once they clutched one another and looked so frightened that mr goon felt as if he wanted to clutch at somebody too bingo was terrified and rushed round the room yelping at the top of his voice trying to find where the weird noise was coming from what with the wailing and the barking and everyones frightened looks mr goon was scared out of his life eeeeooooooooohohoh eeeeeeeeeeeee wailed fatty enjoying himself thoroughly outside the window buster began to yelp as soon as he heard bingo barking and when fatty began another set of wails mr goon could stand it no longer ill get help he panted someones in danger and out of the door he rushed and up the garden it was most unfortunate that fattys mother and the old cook were picking early daffodils in the garden just then they heard the wailing too and stood upright at once listening in fright one of the children had been hurt said mrs trotteville oh what terrible screams and wails quick we must see whats the matter so down to the shed they rushed at top speed just as mr goon was racing up the path as if wild tigers were after him they met at a corner and mr goon was knocked flying by the plump cook he sat down heavily in a bed of mint looking most astonished whats happened whats happened cried mrs trotteville has the shed stove fallen over has there been an accident but mr goon had no breath to reply he just went on sitting in the mint panting loudly hoping that a banshee wouldnt suddenly appear before him poor mr goon mrs trotteville and the cook ran to the shed feeling very anxious indeed but what in the world was this noise they heard now no wailing but shrieks of laughter ha ha ha ha oh i never thought goon could run like that ho ho ho good old banshee ha ha ho ho he he ho ho the laughter went on and on and didnt stop even when mrs trotteville walked into the shed and gazed round at everyone in indignation they had all collapsed into chairs or on the floor fatty had climbed back into the room through the window and was wiping tears from his eyes he had no breath left to be a wailing banshee any longer buster and bingo had gone completely mad and were barking and tearing round and round the room nonstop frederick what is all this demanded mrs trotteville in a very cross voice indeed she poked at fatty with a hard forefinger as he lay collapsed in a chair oh mother dont you know im ticklish said fatty mother i was only being a banshee why are you so cross its not against the law to wail like a banshee is it and off be went again into another roar of laughter i shall fetch your father said his mother astounded at fattys behaviour i really do not know what has come over you all or mr goon either goon whats he doing thats upset you mother asked fatty at once hes sitting down in the very middle of my mint bed if you want to know said his mother and serve him right too rushing straight into us like that sitting down in the mint bed mother oh this is too good to be true said fatty mother do you mean to say you pushed him over oh mother youll be put into prison if you do things like that poor goon hell smell of mint for weeks oh fatty please dont make me laugh too said his mother feeling a sudden desire to join in the merriment i dont know what to do with you fatty youre a bad lot go and help mr goon out of my mint bed im sure the poor man is still there yes there he is listening in amazement to the laughter coming from fattys shed whats happening now how is it something always happens when that fat boy is about he grunts pooh what a smell of mint one of these days master frederick trotteville ill get the better of you you see if i dont well well see next time theres a mystery to solve mr goon but dont be too sure of yourself will you you just never know what old fatty is up to
