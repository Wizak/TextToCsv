 chapter the world was white and bitter bitter cold exhausted he drooped in the saddle unable to do more than trust his horse to continue to trudge forward always forward he knew that to stop even for moments in this cruel and keening wind would mean death the pain in his side was a freezing burn and the only thing that kept him from sliding into oblivion he was lost in that white globe blinded by the endless miles of it that covered hill and tree and sky trapped in the frigid hell of vicious snow gone to icy shards in the whip of the gale though even the slow monotonous movements of his horse brought him agony he did not yield at first the cold had been a relief from the scorching yellow sun it had he thought cooled the fever the wound had sent raging through him the unblemished stretch of white had numbed his mind so that hed no longer seen the blood staining the battleground or smelled the stench of death for a time when the strength had drained out of him along with his blood hed thought he heard voices in the rising wind voices that had murmured his name had whispered another delirium hed told himself for he didnt believe the air could speak hed lost track of how long hed been traveling hours days weeks his first hope had been to come across a cottage a village where he could rest and have his wound treated now he simply wanted to find a decent place to die perhaps he was dead already and hell was endless winter he no longer hungered though the last time hed eaten had been before the battle the battle he thought dimly where hed emerged victorious and unscathed it had been foolish carelessly foolish of him to ride for home alone the trio of enemy soldiers had he was sure been trying to reach their own homes when they met him on that path in the forest his first instinct was to let them go the battle had been won and the invasion crushed but war and death were still in their eyes and when they charged him his sword was in his hand they would never see home now nor he feared would he as his mount plodded onward he fought to remain conscious and now he was in another forest he thought dully as he struggled to focus though how he had come to it how he had gotten lost when he knew his kingdom as intimately as a man knew a lovers face was a mystery to him he had never traveled here before the trees looked dead to him brittle and gray he heard no bird no brook just the steady swish of his horses hooves in the snow surely this was the land of the dead or the dying when he saw the deer it took several moments to register it was the first living thing hed seen since the flakes had begun to fall and it watched him without fear why not he mused with a weak laugh he hadnt the strength to notch an arrow when the stag bounded away kylar of mrydon prince and warrior slumped over the neck of his horse when he came to again the forest was at his back and he faced a white white sea or so it seemed just as it seemed in the center of that sea a silver island glittered through his hazy vision he made out turrets and towers on the topmost a flag flew in the wild wind a red rose blooming full against a field of white he prayed for strength surely where there was a flag flying there were people there was warmth he would have given half a kingdom to spend the last hour of his life by a fires light and heat but his vision began to go dark at the edges and his head swam through the waves of fatigue and weakness he thought he saw the rose red as blood moving over that white sea toward him gritting his teeth he urged his horse forward if he couldnt have the fire he wanted the sweet scent of the rose before he died he lacked even the strength to curse fate as he slid once more into unconsciousness and tumbled from the saddle into the snow the fall shot pain through him pushed him back to the surface where he clung as if under a thin veil of ice through it he saw a face leaning close to his lovely longlidded eyes green as the moss in the forests of his home smooth skin of rose and cream a soft full mouth he saw those pretty lips move but couldnt hear the words she spoke through the buzzing in his head the hood of her red cloak covered her hair and he reached up to touch the cloth youre not a flower after all no my lord only a woman well its better to die warmed by a kiss than a fire he tugged on the hood felt that soft full mouth meet hisone sweet tastebefore he passed out men deirdre thought as she eased back were such odd creatures to steal a kiss at such a time was surely beyond folly shaking her head she got to her feet and took in hand the horn that hung from the sash at her waist she blew the signal for help then removed her cloak to spread over him sitting again she cradled him as best she could in her arms and waited for stronger hands to carry the unexpected guest into the castle the cold had saved his life but the fever might snatch it back again on his side of the battle were his youth and his strength and deirdre thought herself she would do all in her power to heal him twice hed regained consciousness during his transport to the bedchamber and both times hed struggled weakly to be sure but enough to start the blood flowing from his wound again once he was warm in her brisk somewhat ruthless way shed ordered two of her men to hold him down while she doused him with a sleeping draught the cleaning and closing of the wound would be painful for him if he should wake again deirdre was a woman who brooked no nonsense but she disliked seeing anyone in pain she gathered her medicines and herbs pushed up the sleeves of the rough tunic she wore he lay naked on the bed in the thin light of the pale gold sun that filtered through the narrow windows shed seen unclothed men before just as shed seen what a sword could do to flesh hes so handsome cordelia the servant deirdre had ordered to assist her nearly sighed what he is is dying deirdres voice was sharp with command put more pressure on that cloth ill not have him bleed to death under my roof she selected her medicines and moving to the bed concentrated only on the wound in his side it ranged from an inch under his armpit down to his hip in one long vicious slice sweat dewed on her brow as she focused putting her mind into his body to search for damage her cheeks paled as she worked but her hands were steady and quick so much blood she thought as her breath came thick and ragged so much pain how could he have lived with this even with the cold slowing the flow of blood he should have been long dead she paused once to rinse the blood from her hands in a bowl to dry them but when she picked up the needle cordelia blanched my lady absently deirdre glanced over shed nearly forgotten the girl was there you may go you did well enough cordelia fled the room so quickly deirdre might have smiled the girl never moved so fast when there was work to be done deirdre turned back to her patient and began carefully skillfully to sew the wound closed it would scar she thought but he had others his was a warriors body tough and hard and bearing the marks of battle what was it she wondered that made men so eager to fight to kill what was it that lived inside them that they could find pride in both this one did she was sure of it it had taken strength and will and pride to keep him mounted and alive all the miles hed traveled to her island but how had he come this dark warrior and why she coated the stitched wound with a balm of her own making and bandaged it with her own hands then with the worse tended she examined his body thoroughly for any lesser wounds she found a few nicks and cuts and one more serious slice on the back of his shoulder it had closed on its own and was already scabbed over whatever battle hed fought she calculated had been two days ago perhaps three to survive so long with such grievous hurts to have traveled through the forgotten to reach help showed a strong will to live that was good he would need it when she was satisfied she took a clean cloth and began to wash and cool the fever sweat from his skin he was handsome she let herself study him now he was tall leanly muscled his hair black as midnight spilled over the bed linens away from a face that might have been carved from stone it suited the warrior she thought that narrow face with the sharp jut of cheekbones over hollowed cheeks his nose was long and straight his mouth full and somewhat hard his beard had begun to grow in a shadow of stubble that made him appear wicked and dangerous even unconscious his brows were black slashes she remembered his eyes were blue even dazed with pain fever fatigue they had been bold and brilliantly blue if the gods willed it they would open again she tucked him up warm laid another log on the fire then she sat down to watch over him for two days and two nights the fever raged in him at times he was delirious and had to be restrained lest his thrashing break open his wound again at times he slept like a man dead and she feared he would never rouse even her gifts couldnt beat back the fire that burned in him she slept when she could in the chair beside his bed and once when the chills racked him she crawled under the bedclothes with him to soothe him with her own body his eyes did open again but they were blind and wild the pity she tried to hold back when healing stirred inside her once when the night was dark and the cold rattled its bones against the windows she held his hand and grieved for him life was the most precious gift and it seemed cruel that he should come so far from home only to lose his to busy her mind she sewed or she sang when she trusted him to be quiet for a time she left him in the care of one of her women and tended to the business of her home and her people on the last night of his fever despair nearly broke her exhausted she mourned for his wife for his mother for those hed left behind who would never know of his fate there in the quiet of the bedchamber she used the last of her strength and her skill she laid hands on him the first and most vital of rules is not to harm i have not harmed you what i do now will end this one way or another kill or cure if i knew your nameshe brushed a hand gently over his burning browor your mind or your heart this would be easier for both of us be strong she climbed onto the bed to kneel beside him and fight with one hand over the wound that shed unbandaged the other over his heart she let what she was rush through her race through her blood her bone into him he moaned she ignored it it would hurt hurt both of them his body arched up and hers back there was a rush of images that stole her breath a grand castle blurring colors a jeweled crown she felt strengthhis and kindness a light flickered inside her nearly made her break away but it drew her in deeper and the light grew soft warm for deirdre it was the first time even in healing that she had looked into anothers heart and felt it brush and call her own then she saw very clearly a womans face her deepblue eyes full of pride and perhaps fear come back my son come home safe there was musicdrumbeatsthe laughter and shouts of men then a flash that was sun striking off steel and the smell of blood and battle choked her she muffled a cry as she caught a glimpse in her mind swords clashing the stench of sweat and death and fear he fought her thrashing striking out as she bore down with her mind later she would tend the bruises they gave each other in this final pitched battle for life her muscles trembled and part of her screamed to pull back pull away he was nothing to her still as her muscles trembled she pit her fire against the fever just as the enemy sword in his mind slashed against them both she felt the bite of it in her side steel into flesh the agony ripped a scream from her throat on its heels she tasted death his heart galloped under her hand and the wound on his side was like a flame against her palm but shed seen into his mind now and she fought to rise above the pain and use what shed been given what shed taken to save him his eyes were open glassy with shock in a face white as death kylar of mrydon she spoke clearly though each breath she took was a misery take what you need fire of healing and live the tension went out of his body his eyes blurred then fluttered shut she felt the sigh shudder through him as he slid into sleep but the light within her continued to glow what is this she murmured rubbing an unsteady hand over her own heart no matter no matter now i can do no more to help you live she said again then leaned down to brush her lips over his brow or die gently she started to climb down from the bed but her head spun when she fainted her head came to rest quite naturally on his heart chapter he drifted in and out there were times when he thought himself back in battle shouting commands to his men while his horse wheeled under him and his sword hacked through those who would dare invade his lands then he was back in that strange and icy forest so cold he feared his bones would shatter then the cold turned to fire and the part of him that was still sane prayed to die something cool and sweet would slide down his throat and somehow he would sleep again he dreamed he was home drifting toward morning with a willing woman in his bed soft and warm and smelling of summer roses he thought he heard music harpsong with a voice low and smooth matching pretty words to those plucked notes sometimes he saw a face mossgreen eyes a lovely wide mouth hair the color of dark rich honey that tumbled around a face both unbearably beautiful and unbearably sad each time the pain or the heat or the cold would become intolerable that face those eyes would be there once he dreamed she had called him by name in a voice that rang with command and those eyes had been dark and full of pain and power her hair had spilled over his chest like silk and hed slept once moredeeply peacefullywith the scent of her surrounding him he woke again to that scent drifted into it as a man might drift into a cool stream on a hot day there was a velvet canopy of deep purple over his head he stared at it as he tried to clear his mind one thought came through this was not home then another he was alive morning he decided the light through the windows was thin and very dull not long past dawn he tried to sit up and the movement made his side throb even as he hissed out a breath she was there carefully deirdre slid a hand behind his head to lift it gently as she brought a cup to his lips drink now she gave him no choice but to swallow before he managed to bring his hand to hers and nudge the cup aside what his voice felt rusty as if it would scrape his throat what is this place drink your broth prince kylar youre very weak he would have argued but to his frustration he was as weak as she said and she was not her hands were strong hard from labor he studied her as she urged more broth on him that honey hair fell straight as rain to the waist of a simple gray dress she wore no jewels no ribbons and still managed to look beautiful and wonderfully female a servant he assumed with some skill in healing he would find a way to repay her and her master your name sweetheart odd creatures indeed she thought as she arched a brow a man would flirt the moment he regained what passed for his senses i am deirdre im grateful deirdre would you help me up no my lord tomorrow perhaps she set the cup aside but you could sit up for a time while i tend your wound i dreamed of you weak yes he thought but he was feeling considerably better well enough to put some effort into flirting with a beautiful housemaid did you sing to me i sang to pass the time youve been here three days three he gritted his teeth as she helped him to sit up ive no memory of it thats natural be still now he frowned at her bent head as she removed the bandage though a generous man by nature he wasnt accustomed to taking orders certainly not from housemaids i would like to thank your master for his hospitality there is no master here it heals clean she murmured and probed gently with her fingers and is cool youll have a fine scar to add to your collection with quick competence she smeared on a balm theres pain yet i know but if you can tolerate it for now id prefer not to give you another sleeping draught apparently ive slept enough she began to bandage him again her body moving into his as she wrapped the wound fetching little thing he mused relieved that he was well enough to feel a tug of interest he skimmed a hand through her hair as she worked twined a lock around his finger ive never had a prettier physician save your strength my lord her voice was cool dismissive and made him frown again i wont see my work undone because youve a yen for a snuggle she stepped back eyeing him calmly but if youve that much energy you may be able to take some more broth and a bit of bread id rather meat im sure but you wont get it do you read kylar of mrydon yes of course i you call me by name he said cautiously how do you know it she thought of that dip shed taken into his mind what shed seen what shed felt neither of them she was sure was prepared to discuss it you told me a great many things during the fever she said and that was true enough ill see you have books bed rest is tedious reading will help she picked up the empty cup of broth and started across the chamber to the door wait what is this place she turned back this is rose castle on the isle of winter in the sea of ice his heart stuttered in his chest but he kept his gaze direct on hers thats a fairy tale a myth its as real as life and as death you my lord kylar are the first to pass this way in more than twenty years when youre rested and well well discuss how you came here wait he lifted a hand as she opened the thick carved door youre not a servant he wondered how he could ever have mistaken her for one the simple dress the lack of jewels the undressed hair did nothing to detract from her bearing her breeding i serve she countered and have all my life i am deirdre queen of the sea of ice when she closed the door behind her he continued to stare hed heard of rose castle the legend of it in boyhood the palace that stood on an island in what had once been a calm and pretty lake edged by lush forests and rich fields betrayal jealousy vengeance and witchcraft had doomed it all to an eternity of winter there was something about a rose trapped in a pillar of ice he couldnt quite remember how it all went such things were nonsense of course entertaining stories to be told to a child at bedtime and yet yet hed traveled through that world of white and bitter cold hed fought and won a battle in high summer then somehow had become lost in winter because he in his delirium had traveled far north perhaps into the lost mountains or even beyond them where the wild tribes hunted giant white bear and dragons still guarded caves hed talked with men who claimed to have been there who spoke of dark blue water crowded with islands of ice and of warriors tall as trees but none had ever spoken of a castle how much had he imagined or dreamed determined to see for himself he tossed back the bedcovers sweat slicked his skin and his muscles trembled appalling himscoring his prideas the simple task of shifting to sit on the side of the bed sapped his strength he sat for several moments more gathering it back when he managed to stand his vision wavered as if he was looking through water he felt his knees buckle but managed to grip the bedpost and stay on his feet while he waited to steady he studied the room it was simply appointed he noted tasteful certainly even elegant in its way unless you looked closely enough to see that the fabrics were fraying with age still the chests and the chairs gleamed with polish while the rug was faded with time its workmanship was lovely the candlesticks were gleaming silver and the fire burned quietly in a hearth carved from lapis as creakily as carefully as an aged grandfather he walked across the room to the window through it as far as he could see the world was white the sun was a dim haze behind the white curtain that draped the sky but it managed to sparkle a bit on the ice that surrounded the castle in the distance he saw the shadows of the forest hints of black and gray smothered in snow in the north far north mountains speared up white against white closer in at the feet of the castle the snow spread in sheets and blankets he saw no movement no tracks no life were they alone here he wondered he and the woman who called herself a queen then he saw her a regal flash of red against the white she walked with a long quick strideas a woman might he thought bustle off to the market as if she sensed him there she stopped turned looked up at his window he couldnt see her expression clearly but the way her chin angled told him she was displeased with him then she turned away again her fiery cloak swirling as she continued over that sea toward the forest he wanted to go after her to demand answers explanations but he could barely make it back to the bed before he collapsed trembling from the effort he buried himself under the blankets again and slept the day away my lady hes demanding to see you again deirdre continued to work in the precious dirt under the wide dome her back ached but she didnt mind it in this what she called her garden she grew herbs and vegetables and a few precious flowers in the false spring generated by the sun through the glass i have no time for him orna she hoed a trench it was a constant cycle replenishing tending harvesting the garden was life to her world and one of her few true pleasures between you and cordelia hes tended well enough orna pursed her lips she had nursed deirdre as a babe had tutored her tended her and since the death of queen fiona had stood when she could as mother she was one of the few in rose castle who dared to question the young queen its been three days since he woke the man is restless deirdre straightened rested her weight on the hoe is he in pain ornas weathered face creased with what might have been impatience he says not but hes a man after all he has pain despite it and his weakness he wont be kept to his chamber much longer the man is a prince my lady and used to being obeyed i rule here deirdre scanned her garden the earlier plantings were satisfactory she couldnt have the lush but she could have the necessary even she thought as she looked at her spindly sunstarved daisies the occasional indulgence one of the kitchen boys should gather cabbages for dinner she began have the cook choose two of the hens our guest needs meat why do you refuse to see him i dont refuse annoyed deirdre went back to her work she was avoiding the next meeting and she knew it something had come into her during the healing something she was unable to identify it left her uneasy and unsettled i stayed with him three days three nights she reminded orna its put me behind in my duties hes very handsome so is his horse deirdre said lightly and the horse is of more interest to me and strong orna continued stepping closer a prince from outside our world he could be the one there is no one deirdre tossed her head hope put no fuel in the fire nor food in the pot it was a luxury she above all could ill afford i want no man orna i will depend on no one but myself its womans foolishness womans need and mans deceit that have cursed us womans pride as much as foolishness orna laid a hand on the staff of the hoe will you let yours stop you from taking a chance for freedom i will provide for my people when the time comes i will lie with a man until i conceive i will make the next ruler train the child as i was trained love the child orna murmured my heart is so cold tired deirdre closed her eyes i fear there is no love in me how can i give what isnt mine youre wrong gently orna touched her cheek your heart isnt cold its only trapped as the rose is trapped in ice should i free it orna so it could be broken as my mothers was she shook her head that solves nothing food must be put on the table fuel must be gathered go now tell our guest that ill visit him in his chambers when time permits this seems like a fine time so saying kylar strode into the dome chapter hed never seen anything like the garden before but then kylar had seen a great deal of the unexpected in rose castle in a short time such as a queen dressed in mens clothingtrousers and a ragged tunic the result was odd and strangely alluring her hair was tied back but not with anything so female as a ribbon shed knotted it with a thin leather strap such as he did himself when doing some quick spot of manual labor her face was flushed from her work and as lovely as the flower hed first taken her for she did not look pleased to see him even as he watched her eyes chilled behold the ice queen he thought a man would risk freezing off important parts of his body should he try to thaw her i see youre feeling better my lord if youd spared me five minutes of your time youd have seen so before will you pardon us orna she knelt and began to plant the long eyes of potatoes harvested earlier in the year it was a distraction one she needed seeing him again stirred her in dangerous ways youll excuse me my lord if i continue with my task are there no servants to do such things there are fiftytwo of us in rose castle we all have our places and our duties he squatted beside her though it caused his side to weep taking her hand he turned it over and examined the ridge of callus then i would say my lady you have too many duties its not for you to question me you dont give answers so i must continue to question you healed me why do you resent me i dont know but i do know that i require both hands for this task when he released her she continued to plant im unused to strangers she began surely that was it she had never seen much less healed a stranger before wouldnt that explain why after looking into his mind into his heart she felt so drawn to him and afraid of him perhaps my manners are unpolished so i will beg your pardon for any slight theyre polished diamondbright he corrected and stab at a man she smiled a little some men i imagine are used to softer females i thought cordelia would suit your needs shes biddable enough and pretty enough which is why you have the dragon guarding her her smile warmed fractionally of course i wonder why i prefer you to either of them i couldnt say she moved down the row and when he started to move with her he gasped she cursed stubborn she rose reached down and to his surprise wrapped her arms around him hold on to me ill help you inside he simply buried his face in her hair your scent he told her it haunts me stop it i cant get your face out of my head even when i sleep her stomach fluttered alarming her sir i will not be trifled with im too damn weak to trifle with you hating the unsteadiness he leaned heavily against her but youre beautiful and im not dead when he caught his breath he eased away i should be ive had time to think that through he stared hard into her eyes ive seen enough battle to know when a wound is mortal mine was how did i cheat death deirdre are you a witch some would say because his color concerned her she unbent enough to put an arm around his waist you need to sit before you fall come back inside not to bed ill go mad shed tended enough of the sick and injured to know the truth of that to a chair well have tea god spare me brandy she supposed he was entitled she led him through a doorway down a dim corridor away from the kitchen she skirted the main hallway and moved down yet another corridor the room where she took him was small chilly and lined floor to ceiling with books she eased him into a chair in front of the cold fireplace then went over to open the shutters and let in the light the days are still long she said conversationally as she walked to the fireplace this one was framed in smooth green marble planting needs to be finished while the sun can warm the seeds she crouched in front of the fire set the logs to light is there grass in your world fields of it yes she closed her eyes a moment and trees that go green in spring he felt a wrench in his gut for homeand for her yes it must be like a miracle then she stood and her voice was brisk again i must wash and see to your brandy youll be warm by the fire i wont be long my lady have you never seen a field of grass in books in dreams she opened her mouth again nearly asked him to tell her what it smelled like but she wasnt sure she could bear to know i wont keep you waiting long my lord she was true to her word in ten minutes she was back her hair loose again over the shoulders of a dark green dress she carried the brandy herself our wine cellars were well stocked once my grandfather im told was shrewd in that area and in this one she added gesturing toward the books he enjoyed a glass of good wine and a good book and your the books often the wine rarely when she glanced toward the door he saw her smile fully warmly for the first time he could only stare at her as his throat went dry and his heart shuddered thank you magda i would have come for it youve enough to do my lady without carting trays the woman seemed ancient to kylar her face as withered as a winter apple her body bowed as if she carried bricks on her back but she set the tea tray on the sideboard and curtseyed with some grace should i pour for you my lady ill see to it how are your hands they dont trouble me overmuch deirdre took them in her own they were knotted and swollen at the joints youre using the ointment i gave you yes my lady twice daily it helps considerable keeping her eyes on magdas deirdre rubbed her thumbs rhythmically over the gnarled knuckles i have a tea that will help ill show you how to make it and youll drink a cup three times a day thank you my lady magda curtseyed again before she left the room kylar saw deirdre rub her own hands as if to ease a pain before she reached for the teapot ill answer your questions prince kylar and hope that youll answer some of mine in turn she brought him a small tray of cheese and biscuits then settled into a chair with her tea how do you survive to the point she thought we have the garden some chickens and goats for eggs and milk and meat when meat is needed theres the forest for fuel and if were lucky for game the young are trained in necessary skills we live simply she said sipping her tea and well enough why do you stay because this is my home you risked your life in battle to protect yours how do you know i didnt risk it to take what belonged to someone else she watched him over the rim of her cup yes he was handsome his looks were only more striking now that hed regained some of his strength one of the servants had shaved him and without the stubble of beard he looked younger but little less dangerous did you you know i didnt his gaze narrowed on her face you know how is that deirdre of the ice he reached out clamped a hand on her arm what did you do to me during the fever healed you with witchcraft i have a gift for healing she said evenly should i have used it or let you die there was no dark in it and you are not bound to me for payment then why do i feel bound to you her pulse jumped his hand wasnt gripping her arm now it caressed i did nothing to tie you i have neither desire nor the skill for it cautiously she moved out of reach you have my word when youre well enough to travel youre free to go how it was bitter where pity stirred in her swam into her eyes she remembered the face of the woman in his mind the love shed felt flow between them his mother she thought even now watching for his return home it wont be simple nor without risk but you have a horse and well give you provisions one of my men will travel with you as far as possible i can do no more than that he put it aside for now when the time came he would find his way home tell me how this came to be this place ive heard storiesbetrayal and witchcraft and cold spells over a land that was once fruitful and at peace so i am told she rose again to stir the fire when my grandfather was king there were farms and fields the land was green and rich the lake blue and thick with fish have you ever seen blue water i have yes how can it be blue she asked as she turned there was puzzlement on her face and more he thought an eagerness he hadnt seen before it made her look very young i havent thought about it he admitted it seems to be blue or green or gray it changes as the sky changes my sky never changes the eagerness vanished as she walked to the window well she said and straightened her shoulders well my grandfather had two daughters twinborn his wife died giving them life and its said he grieved for her the rest of his days the babes were named ernia who was my aunt and fiona who was my mother and on them he doted most parents dote on their children dont they my lord most he agreed so he did like their mother they were beautiful and like their mother they were gifted ernia could call the sun the rain the wind fiona could speak to the beasts and the birds they were im told competitive each vying for their fathers favor though he loved them both do you have siblings my lord a brother and a sister both younger she glanced back he had his mothers eyes she thought but her hair had been light perhaps his father had that inkblack hair that looked so silky do you love them your brother and your sister very much that is as it should be but ernia and fiona could not love each other perhaps it was because they shared the same face and each wanted her own who can say they grew from girl to woman and my grandfather grew old and ill he wanted them married and settled before his death ernia he betrothed to a king in a land beyond the elf hills and my mother he promised to a king whose lands marched with ours to the east rose castle was to be my mothers and the palace of sighs on the border of the elf hills my aunts in this way he divided his wealth and lands equally between them for he was im told a wise and fair ruler and a loving father she came back to sit and sip at tea gone cold in the weeks before the weddings a traveler came and was welcome here as all were in those days he was handsome and clever quick of tongue and smooth with charm a minstrel by trade its said he sang like an angel but fair looks are no mirror of the heart are they a pleasant face is only a face kylar lifted a shoulder deeds make a man or woman she added so i have always believed and so in this case it was in secret this handsome man courted and seduced both twins and both fell blindly in love with him he came to my mothers bed and to her sisters bearing a single red rose and promises never meant to be kept why do men lie when women love the question took him aback my lady not all men are deceivers perhaps not though she was far from convinced but he was one evening the sisters of the same mind wandered to the rose garden each wanted to pluck a red rose for her lover it was there the lies were discovered instead of comforting each other instead of raging against the man who had deceived them both they fought over him shewolves over an unworthy badger ernias temper called the wind and the hail and fionas had the beasts stalking out of the forest to snarl and howl jealousy is both a flawed and a lethal weapon she angled her head nodded well said my grandfather heard the clamor and roused himself from his sickbed neither marriage could take place now as both his daughters were disgraced the minstrel who had not slipped away quickly enough was locked in the dungeon until his punishment could be decided there was weeping and wailing from the sisters as that punishment would surely be banishment if not death but he was spared when it came to be known that my mother was with child his child for she had lain with no other you were the child yes so by becoming i saved my fathers life the grief of this the shame of this ended my grandfathers before he died he ordered ernia to the palace of sighs because of the child he decreed that my mother would marry the minstrel it was this that drove ernia mad and on the day the marriage took place the day her own father died in despair she cast her spell winter endless years of it a sea of ice to lock rose castle away from the world the rosebush where flowers had been plucked from lies would not bear bud the child her sister carried would never feel the warmth of summer sun on her face or walk in a meadow or see a tree bear fruit one faithless man three selfish hearts destroyed a world and so became the isle of winter in the sea of ice my lady he laid a hand on hers her life he thought the whole of it had been spent without the simple comfort of sunlight a spell cast can be broken you have power my gift is of healing i cannot heal the land because she wanted to turn her hand over in his link fingers feel that connection she drew away my father left my mother before i was born escaped later as she watched her people starve my mother sent messengers to the palace of sighs to ask for a truce to beg for one but they never came back perhaps they died or lost their way or simply rode on into the warmth and the sun no one who has left here has ever come back why would they ernia the witchqueen is dead dead deirdre stared into the fire youre sure of this she was feared and loathed there was great celebration when she died it was on the winter solstice and i remember it well shes been dead for nearly ten years deirdre closed her eyes as her sister has so they died together how odd and how apt she rose again to walk to the window ten years dead and her spell holds like a clenched fist how bitter her heart must have been and the faint and secret hope shed kept flickering inside that upon her aunts death the spell would break winked out she drew herself up what we cant change we learn to be content with she stared out at the endless world of white there is beauty here yes it was deirdre that kylar watched yes there is beauty here chapter he wanted to help her more kylar thought he wanted to save her if there had been something tangible to fighta man a beast an armyhe would have drawn his sword and plunged into battle for her she moved him attracted him fascinated him her steady composure in the face of her fate stirred in him both admiration and frustration this was not a woman to weep on a mans shoulder it annoyed him to find himself wishing that she would as long as the shoulder was his she was an extraordinary creature he wanted to fight for her but how did a man wage war on magic hed never had any real experience with it he was a soldier and though he believed in luck even in fate he believed more in wile and skill and muscle he was a prince would one day be a king he believed in justice in ruling with a firm touch on one hand and a merciful one on the other there was no justice here where a woman who had done no wrong should be imprisoned for the crimes and follies and wickedness of those who had come before she was too beautiful to be shut away from the rest of the world too small he mused too fragile to work her hands raw she should be draped in silks and ermine rather than homespun already after less than a week on the isle of winter he felt a restlessness a need for color and heat how had she stayed sane never knowing a single summer he wanted to bring her the sun she should laugh it troubled him that he had not once heard her laugh a smile surprisingly warm when it was real enough to reach her eyes that he had seen he would find a way to see it again he waded through the snow across what he supposed had once been a courtyard though his wound had troubled him on waking he was feeling stronger now he needed to be doing to find some work or activity to keep his blood moving and his mind sharp surely there was some task some bit of work he could undertake for her here it would repay her in some small way and serve to keep his mind and hands busy while his body healed he recalled the stag hed seen in the forest he would hunt then and bring her meat the wind that had thrashed ceaselessly for days had finally quieted though the utter stillness that followed it played havoc with the nerves it would make tracking through the forest possible he moved through a wide archway on the other side of the courtyard and stopped to stare this he realized with wonder had been the rose garden gnarled and blackened stalks tangled out of the snow once he imagined it would have been magnificent full of color and scent and humming bees now it was a great field of snow cased in ice bisecting that field were graceful paths of silver stone and someone kept them clear there were hundreds of bushes all brittle with death the stalks spearing out of their cold graves like blackened bones benches these too cleared of snow and ice stood in graceful curves of deep jewel colors ruby sapphire emerald they gleamed in the midst of the stark and merciless white there was a small pond in the shape of an open rose and its flower held a rippled sheet of ice dead branches with vicious thorns strangled iron arbors more spindly corpses climbed up the silver stone of the walls as if theyd sought to escape before winter murdered them in the center where all paths led was a towering column of ice under the glassy sheen he could see the arch of blackened branches studded with thorns and hundreds of withered flowers trapped forever in their moment of death the rosebush he thought where the flowers of lies had been plucked no he corrected as he moved toward it more a tree for it was taller than he was and spread wider than the span of both his arms he ran his fingertips over the ice found it smooth experimentally he took the dagger from his belt dragged its tip over the ice it left no mark it cannot be reached with force kylar turned and saw orna standing in the archway what of the rest why havent the dead branches been cleared and used for fire he asked her to do so would be to give up hope she had hope still and more when she looked into kylars eyes she saw what she needed there truth strength and courage she walks here why would she punish herself in such a way he demanded it reminds her i think of what was and what is but not orna feared of what might be once when my lady was but eight and the last of the dogs died breaking her heart she took her grandfathers sword in her grief and temper she tried to hack through that ice into the bush for nearly an hour she stabbed and sliced and beat at it and could not so much as scratch the surface in the end she went to her knees there where you stand now and wept as if shed die from it something in her did die that day along with the last of the dogs i have not heard her weep since i wish she would why do you wish for your ladys tears for then she would know her heart is not dead but like the rose only waiting he sheathed his dagger if force cant reach it what can she smiled for she knew he spoke of the heart as much as the rose you will make a good king in your time kylar of mrydon for you listen to what isnt said what cant be vanquished with sword or might can be won with truth with love with selflessness she is in the stables what is left of them she wouldnt ask for your company but would enjoy it the stables lined three sides of another courtyard but this one was crisscrossed with crooked paths dug through or trampled into the snow kylar saw the reason for it in the small troop of children waging a lively snow battle at the far end even in such a world he thought children found a way to be children as he drew closer to the stables he heard the low cackle of hens there were men on the roof working on a chimney they tipped their caps to him as he passed under the eaves and into the stables it was warmer thanks to carefully banked fires and clean as a parlor the queen he thought tended her goats and chickens well iron kettles heated over the fires water for the stock he concluded made from melted snow he noted barrows of manure for use in her garden he decided a wise and practical woman queen deirdre then he saw the wise and practical woman with her red hood tossed back her gold hair raining down as she cooed up at his warhorse when the horse shook its great head and blew she laughed the rich female sound warmed his blood more thoroughly than the fires his name is cathmor startled embarrassed deirdre dropped the hands shed lifted to stroke the horses muzzle she knew she shouldnt have lingered that he would come check on his horse as it had been reported he did twice daily but shed so wanted to see the creature herself you have a light step you were distracted he walked up beside her and to her surprise and delight the horse bumped his shoulder in greeting does that mean hes glad to see you it means hes hoping i have an apple deirdre fingered the small carrot from her garden shed tucked in her pocket perhaps this will do she pulled it out started to offer it to kylar he would enjoy being fed by a lady no not like that he took her hand and opening it laid the carrot on her palm have you never fed a horse ive never seen one she caught her breath as cathmor dipped his head and nibbled the carrot out of her palm hes bigger than i imagined and more handsome and softer unable to resist she stroked her hand down the horses nose some of the children have been keeping him company theyd make a pet of him if they could would you like to ride him ride he needs the exercise and so do i i thought i would hunt this morning come with me to ride a horse just the idea of it was thrilling i have duties i might get lost alone he brought her hand back up ran it under his along cathmors silky neck i dont know your forest and im still a bit weak her lips twitched your wits are strong enough i could send a man with you i prefer your company to ride a horse she thought again how could she resist why should she she was no fluttery girl who would fall into stutters and blushes by being alone with a man even this man all right what do i do first you wait until i saddle him she shook her head no show me how to do it when it was done she sent one of the boys scurrying off to tell orna she was riding out with the prince she neednt have bothered for as they walked the horse out of the stables her people began to gather at the windows in the courtyard when he vaulted into the saddle they cheered him like a hero its been a long time since theyve seen anyone ride she explained as cathmor pranced in place some of them like me never have she let out a breath its a long way up give me your hand he reached down to her trust me she would have to if she wanted this amazing treat she offered her hand then yelped in shock when he simply hauled her up in the saddle in front of him you might have warned me you intended to drag me up like a sack of turnips if youve opened your wound again quiet he whispered entirely too close to her ear for comfort and with her people cheering he kicked cathmor into a trot oh her eyes popped wide as her bottom bounced its not what i expected and hardly dignified with shouts and whoops children raced after them as they trotted out of the castle match the rhythm of your body to the gait of the horse he told her yes im trying must you be so close he grinned yes and im enjoying it you shouldnt be uneasy with a man deirdre when youve seen him naked seeing you naked hardly gives me cause to relax around you she shot back with a rolling laugh he urged the horse to a gallop her breath caught but with delight rather than fear wind rushed by her cheeks and snow flew up into the air like tattered lace she closed her eyes for an instant to absorb the sensation and the wild thrill made her dizzy so fast she thought so strong when they charged up a hill she wanted to throw her arms in the air and shout for the sheer joy of it her heart raced along with the horse continued to pound even when they slowed at the verge of the forest that had been known as the forgotten for the whole of her lifetime its like flying she mused oh thank you she leaned down to press her cheek to the horses neck ill never forget it hes a grand horse isnt he flushed with pleasure she turned his face was too close so close she felt the warmth of his breath on her cheek close enough that she saw a kind of heat kindling in his eyes no he caught her chin with his hand before she could turn away again dont i kissed you before when i thought i was dying his lips hovered a breath from hers i lived he had to taste her again it seemed his sanity depended on it but because he saw her fear he took her mouth gently skimming his lips over ones that trembled soothing as well as seducing he watched her eyes go soft before her lashes fluttered down kiss me back deirdre his hand slid down until his arm could band her waist and draw her closer this time kiss me back i dont know how but she already was her limbs went weak wonderfully weak even as her pulse danced madly warmth enveloped her reaching places inside that had never known its comfort the light that had sparked inside her when their hearts had brushed in healing spread on the isle of winter in the snowy rose garden beneath a shield of ice a tiny budtender greenformed on a blackened branch he nibbled at her lips until she parted them and when he deepened the kiss she felt for the first time in her life a true lance of heat in her belly yearning for more she eased back then indulged herself by letting her head rest briefly on his shoulder so its this she whispered its this that makes the women sing in the kitchen in the morning he stroked her hair rubbed his cheek against it its a bit more than that sweet he thought strong she was everything a man could want everything he realized that he wanted yes of course she sighed once more than that but it starts like this it cant for me it has he held her close when she would have drawn away it did the minute i saw you if i could love it would be you though im not sure why it would be you if i were free i would choose you she turned away again we came to hunt my people need meat he fought the urge to yank her around to plunder that lovely mouth until she yielded force wasnt the answer so hed been told there were better ways to win a woman chapter she spotted the tracks first they moved soundlessly through the trees and she was grateful for the need for silence how could she explain or ask him to understand when she couldnt understand herself her heart was frozen chilled to death by pride and duty and the fear that she might do her people more harm her father had made her in lies then had run away from his obligation her mother had done her duty and she had been kind but her heart had been broken into so many pieces there had been none left for her child and what sort of child was it who could grieve more truly for a dead dog than for her own dead mother she had nothing emotionally to give a man and wanted nothing from one in that way she would survive and keep her people alive life she reminded herself mattered most and what she felt for him was surely no more than a churning in the blood but how could she have known what it was like to be held by him to feel his heart beat so strong and fast against hers none of the books shed read had captured with their clever words the true thrill of lips meeting now that she understood it would be just another precious memory like a ride on horseback to tuck away for the endless lonely nights she would decide later she thought if the nights were longer lonelier with the memory than they were without it but today she couldnt allow herself to think like a woman softened by a mans touch she must think like a queen with people to provide for she caught the scent of the stag even before the horse did and held up a hand we should walk from here she said under her breath he didnt question her but dismounted then reached up to lift her down then his arms were around her again her hands on his shoulders and her face tilted up to his even as she shook her head he brushed his lips over her brow deirdre the fair he said softly such a pretty armful the male scent of him blurred the scent of the stag this is not the time because the catch in her voice was enough to satisfy him for now he reached over for his bow and quiver but when she held out her hands for them he lifted his eyebrows the bow is too heavy a draw for you when she continued to stare hands outstretched he shrugged and gave them to her so he thought he would indulge her theyd make do with more cabbage tonight then he was left blinking as she tossed aside her cloak and streaked through the trees in her mens clothes like a wraithsoundless and swift before he could tether his horse shed vanished and he could do no more than follow in her tracks he stopped when he caught sight of her she stood in the gloomy light nearly hipdeep in snow with a gesture smooth and polished as a warrior she notched the arrow drew back the heavy bow the sharp ping of the arrow flying free echoed then she lowered the bow and her head everyone misses sometimes he said as he started toward her her head came up her face cold and set i did not miss i find no pleasure in the kill my people need meat she handed the bow and quiver back to him then trudged through the snow to where the stag lay kylar saw shed taken it down fast mercifully fast with a single shot deirdre he called out do you ask yourself how game even so sparse come to be here where there is no food for them she continued walking my mother did what she could leaving a call that would draw them to the forest she hoped to teach me to do the same but its not my gift you have more than one he said ill get the horse once the deer was strapped onto the horse kylar cupped his hands to help deirdre mount put your right foot in my hands swing your left leg over the saddle there isnt room for both of us now you ride ill walk no ill walk its too far when youve yet to fully recover mount your horse she started to move past him but he blocked her path her shoulders straightened like an iron bar i said mount i am a queen and you merely a prince you will do as i bid im a man and you merely a woman he shocked her speechless by picking her up and tossing her into the saddle youll do what youre told however much she labored side by side with her people no one had ever disobeyed a command and no man had ever laid hands on her you dare im not one of your people he gathered the reins and began to walk the horse through the forest whatever our ranks im as royal as you though that doesnt mean a damn at the moment its difficult to think of you as a queen when youre garbed like a man and ive seen you handle a bow that my own squire can barely manage its difficult to think of you as a queen deirdre he added with a glance back at her furious face when ive held you in my arms then youd best remember what that felt like for you wont be allowed to do so again he stopped and turning ran his hand deliberately up her leg when she kicked out at him he caught her boot and laughed ah so theres a temper in there after all good i prefer bedding a woman with fire in her quick as a snake the dagger was out of her belt and in her hand and its killing point at his throat remove your hand he never flinched but realized to his own shock that this wasnt merely a woman he could want it was a woman he could love would you do it i wonder i think you might while the tempers on you but then youd regret it he brought his hand up slowly gripped her knife hand by the wrist wed both regret it i tell you i want to bed you i give you the truth do you want lies you can bed cordelia if shes willing i dont want cordelia willing or not he took the knife from her hand then brushed a kiss over her palm but i want you deirdre and i want you willing he handed her back the dagger hilt first can you handle a sword as well as you do a dagger i can youre a woman of marvels deirdre the fair he began to walk again i understand developing skill with the bow but what need have you for sword or dagger ignoring training in defense is careless and lazy the training itself is good for the body and the mind if my people are expected to learn how to handle a blade then so should i be agreed when he paused a second time her eyes narrowed in warning im going to shorten the stirrups so you can ride properly what happened to your horses those who left the first year took them she ordered herself to relax and pleased herself by stroking cathmors neck again there were cattle too and sheep those that didnt die of the cold were used as food there were cottages and farmhouses but people came to the castle for shelter for food or wandered off hoping to find spring now theyre under the snow and ice why do you want to bed me because youre beautiful she frowned down at him are men so simple really he laughed shook his head and her fingers itched to tangle in his silky black mane rather than the horses simple enough about certain matters but i hadnt finished the answer your beauty would be enough to make me want you for a night try this now heels down thats fine he gave her foot a friendly pat then walked back to the horses head your strength and your courage add layers to beauty they appeal to me your minds sharp and cleaves clean thats a challenge and a woman who can plant potatoes like a farmwife and draw a dagger like an assassin is a fascinating creature i thought when a man wanted to pleasure himself with a woman he softened her with pretty words and poetry and long looks full of pain and longing what a woman kylar mused hed never seen the like of her would you like that she considered it and was relaxed again it was easier to discuss the whole business as a practical matter i dont know you wouldnt trust them she smiled before she could stop it i wouldnt no have you bedded many women he cleared his throat and began to walk a bit faster that sweetheart isnt a question im comfortable answering why not because its its a delicate matter he decided would you be more comfortable telling me if youve killed many men i dont kill for sport or for pleasure he said and his voice turned as frigid as the air taking a mans life is no triumph my lady battle is an ugly business i wondered i meant no offense i would have let them go he spoke so softly that she had to lean forward to hear clearly who the three who set upon me after the battle had been won when i was for home i would have let them pass in peace what purpose was there in more blood shed already seen this inside him and knew it for truth he had not killed in hate nor in some fever of dark excitement he had killed to live they wouldnt let you pass in peace they were tired and one already wounded if id had an escort as i should they would have surrendered in the end it was their own fear and my carelessness that killed them im sorry for it more for the waste of their lives she realized than for his own wounds understanding this she felt something sigh inside her kylar it was the first time shed spoken his name as she might to a friend and she leaned down to touch his cheek with her fingertips as she might touch a lovers youll rule well she invited him to sup with her that night another first he dressed in the fresh doublet cordelia brought him one of soft linen that smelled lightly of lavender and rosemary he wondered from what chest it had been unearthed for his use but as it fit well enough he had no cause to complain but when he followed the servant into the dining hall he wished for his court clothes she wore green again but no simple dress of homespun the velvet gown poured down her body dipping low at the creamy rise of her breasts and sweeping out from her waist in soft deep folds her hair was long and loose but over it sparkled a crown glinting with jewels more draped in shimmering ropes around her throat she stood in the glow of candlelight beautiful as a vision and every inch a queen when she offered a hand he crossed to her bowed deeply before touching his lips to her knuckles your majesty your highness the room she said with a gesture she hoped hid the nerves and pleasure she felt upon seeing the open approval on his face is overlarge for two i hope youll be comfortable i see nothing but you she titled her head curious this flirting she decided and entertaining are these the pretty words and poetry theyre the truth they fall pleasantly on the ear its an indulgence to have a fire in here she began as she let him escort her to the table but tonight there is wine and venison and a welcome guest at the head of the long table were two settings silver and crystal and linen white as the snow outside the windows behind them the mammoth fire roared servants slipped in to serve wine and the soup course if hed been able to tear his gaze away from deirdre he might have seen the glint in their eyes the exchanged winks and quick grins she missed them as well as she concentrated on the experience of her first formal meal with someone from outside her world the fare is simple she began as good as a bounty and the company feeds me she studied him thoughtfully i do think i like pretty words but i have no skill in holding a conversation with them he took her hand why dont we practice her laugh bubbled out but she shook her head tell me of your home your family your sister she remembered is she lovely she is her name is gwenyth she married two years ago is there love yes he was friend and neighbor and they had a sweetness for each other since childhood when i last saw her she was great with her second babe the faintest cloud passed over his face id hoped to make my way home for the birthing and your brother riddock is young headstrong he can ride like the devil youre proud of him i am hed give you poetry kylar lifted his goblet he has a knack for it and loves nothing more than luring pretty maids out to the garden in the moonlight she asked questions casually so he would talk she was unsure of her conversational skills in this arena and it was such a pleasure to just sit and listen to him speak so easily of things that were to her a miracle summer and gardens swimming in a pond riding through a village where people went to market carts of glossy red appleswhat would they taste like baskets of flowers whose scent she could only dream of she had a picture of his home now as she had pictures in books she had a picture of him and it was more than anything shed ever found in a book willing to pay whatever it cost her later she lost herself in him in the way his voice rose and fell in his laugh she thought she could sit this way for days to talk like this with no purpose in it no niggling worries just to be with him by the warmth of the fire with wine sweet on her tongue and his eyes so intimately on hers she didnt object when he took her hand when his fingers toyed with hers if this was flirtation it was such a lovely way to pass the time they spoke of faraway lands and cultures of paintings and of plays youve put your library to good use he commented ive known few scholars as well read i can see the world through books and lives through the stories once a year on midsummer we put on a pageant we have music and games i choose a story and everyone takes a part as if it were a play surviving isnt enough there must be life and color there were times secretly when she pined near weeping for true color all the children are taught to read she continued and to do sums if you have only a window on the world you must look out of it one of my menwell hes just a boy reallyhe makes stories theyre quite wonderful she caught herself surprised at the sound of her own voice rambling ive kept you long enough no his hand tightened on hers he was beginning to realize it would never be long enough tell me more you play music dont you a harp i heard you playing singing it was like a dream you were feverish i play a little some skill inherited from my father i suppose id like to hear you play again will you play for me deirdre if you like but as she started to rise one of the men whod helped serve rushed in my lady my lady its young phelan whats happened he was playing with some of the boys on the stairs and fell we cant wake him my lady we fear hes dying chapter afraid to move him theyd left the boy covered with a blanket at the base of the stairs at first glance kylar thought the child for he was hardly more was already dead hed seen enough of death to recognize its face he judged the boy to be about ten with fair hair and cheeks still round with youth but those cheeks were gray and the hair was matted with blood those who circled and knelt around the boy made way when deirdre hurried through get back now she ordered give him room before deirdre could kneel a weeping woman broke free to fall at her feet and clutch at her skirts with bloodstained hands my baby oh please my lady help my little boy i will ailish of course i will knowing that time was precious deirdre bent down and firmly loosened the terrified womans hold on her you must be strong for him and trust let me see to him now he slipped my lady another youth came forward with a jerky step his eyes were dry but huge and there were tracks of tears still drying on his cheeks we were playing horse and rider on the stairs and he slipped all right too much grief she thought feeling waves of it pressing over her too much fear its all right now ill tend to him deirdre kylar kept his voice low so only she could hear over the mothers weeping theres nothing you can do here i can smell death on him as could she and so she knew she had little time what is the smell of death but the smell of fear she ran her hands gently over the crumpled body feeling the hurts finding so much broken in the little boy that her heart ached from it medicines would do no good here but still her face was composed as she looked up cordelia fetch my healing bag make haste the rest please leave us now leave me with him ailish go now oh no please my lady please i must stay with my boy do you trust me my lady she gripped deirdres hand wept on it i do then do as i bid you go now and pray his neck kylar began then broke off when deirdre whipped her head around and stared at him be silent help me or go but dont question me when ailish was all but carried away and the two of them were alone with the bleeding boy deirdre closed her eyes this will hurt him im sorry for it hold him down hold him as still as you can and do nothing to interfere nothing do you understand no but kylar shifted until he could clamp the boys arms block thoughts of death from your mind she ordered and fear and doubt block them out as you would in battle theres too much dark here already can you do this i can and because she asked it of him kylar let the cold come into him the cold that steeled the mind to face combat phelan she said young phelan the bard her voice was soft almost a crooning as she traced her hands over him again be strong for me she knew him already had watched him grow and learn and be she knew the sound of his voice the quick flash of his grin the lively turn of his mind he had been hers as all in rose castle were hers from the moment of his first breath and so she merged easily with him while her hands worked stroking kneading she slid into his mind she felt his laughter inside her as he pranced and raced with his friends up and down the narrow stone steps felt his heart leap inside her own as his feet slipped then the fear oh the terror an instant only before the horrible pain the snap of bone made her cry out softly had her head rearing back something inside her crushed like thin clay under a stone hammer and the sensation was beyond torment her eyes were open now kylar saw a deep and too brilliant green her breath came fast and hard sweat pearled on her brow and the boy screamed thinly straining under his grip both made a sound of agony as she slid a hand under the boy to cup his neck laid her other on his heart both shuddered both went pale as death kylar started to call out to her to reach for her as she swayed but he felt the heat a ferocious fist of it that seemed to pump out of her into the boy until the arms he held were like sticks of fire and the boys eyes opened stared up blindly take young phelan he voice was thick now echoed richly off the stone take what you need fire of healing she leaned down laid her lips gently on his live stay with us your mother needs you as kylar watched thunderstruck color seeped back into the boys face he would have sworn he felt death skitter back into the shadows my lady the boy said almost dreamily i fell yes i know sleep now she brushed her hand over his eyes and they closed on a sigh and heal let his mother in if you will she said to kylar and cordelia deirdre please the weakness threatened to drag her under and she wanted to be away in her own chamber before she lost herself to it let them in so i can tell them what must be done for him she stayed kneeling when kylar rose the sounds of her people were like the dull roar of the ocean in her head even as ailish collapsed next to her son to gather him close to kiss deirdres now trembling hand deirdre gave clear careful instructions for his care enough alarmed by her pallor kylar swept her off the floor and into his arms tend the boy im not finished deirdre managed yes by the blood you are the single glance he swept over those gathered challenged any to contradict him where is your chamber this way my lord prince orna led him through a doorway down a corridor to another set of stairs i know what to do for her my lord then youll do it he glanced down at deirdre as he carried her up the stairs she had swooned after all he noted her skin was like glass her eyes closed the boys blood was on her hands what did she risk by snatching the boy from death i cannot say my lord she opened a door hurried across a chamber to the bed i will care for her now i stay orna pressed her lips together as he laid deirdre on the bed i must undress her wash her struggling with temper he turned to stalk to the window then do so is this what she did for me i cannot say orna met his eyes directly when he turned back she did not speak of it to me she does not speak of it with anyone prince kylar i will ask you to turn your back until my lady is suitably attired in her night garb woman her modesty is not an issue with me but he turned stared out the window he had heard of those who could heal with the mind but he had not believed it not truly believed before tonight nor had he considered what price the healer paid to heal she will sleep orna said some time later i wont disturb her he came to the bed now gazed down there was still no color in her cheeks but it seemed to him her breathing was steadier nor will i leave her my lady is strong as valiant as ten warriors if i had ten as valiant there would never be another battle to fight pleased with his response orna inclined her head and my lady has despite what she believes a tender heart orna set a bottle and goblet on the table near the bed see that you dont bruise it when she wakes give her some of this tonic i will not be far should you need me alone kylar drew a chair near the bed and watched deirdre sleep for an hour and then two she was motionless and pale as marble in the firelight and he feared she would never wake but would sleep like the beauty in another legend for a hundred years even days before he would have deemed such things foolishness stories for children but now after what hed seen what hed felt anything seemed possible still side by side with the worry inside him anger bloomed she had risked her life he had seen death slide its cold fingers over her she had bargained her life for the childs and he was sure now for his own when she stirred just the slightest flutter of her lashes he poured the tonic orna had left into the cup drink this he lifted her head from the pillow dont speak just drink now she sipped and sighed the hand she lifted to his wrist slid limply away again phelan she whispered i dont know he brought the cup to her lips a second time drink more she obeyed then turned her head ask ask how young phelan fares please i must be sure drink first drink it all she did as he bade and kept her eyes open and on his now if shed had the strength she would have gone to find out herself but the weakness was still dragging at her and she could only trust kylar to the task please i wont be easy until i know his condition kylar set the empty cup aside then crossed the chamber to the door orna sat on a chair in the corridor sewing by candlelight she glanced up when she saw him tell my lady not to fret young phelan is resting healing she got to her feet if you would like to retire my lord i will sit with my lady go to your bed he said shortly i stay with her tonight orna bowed her head and hid a smile as you wish he stepped back inside closed the door and turning saw that deirdre was sitting up in bed with her hair spilling like honey over the white lawn of her nightdress your boy is resting and well at his words he saw color return to her face watched the dullness clear from her eyes he came to the foot of the bed which was draped in deep red velvet you recover quickly madam the tonic is potent indeed she now felt clear of mind and even the echoes of pain were fading from her body thank you for your help his mother and father would have been too distraught to assist their worry could have distracted me more fear feeds death she glanced around the room a little warily orna hadnt laid out her nightrobe if youd excuse me now ill go see for myself not tonight to her shock he sat on the side of the bed near her only pride kept her from shifting over or tugging up the blankets i have questions ive answered several of your questions already he lifted his brows now i have more the boy was dying his skull crushed his neck damaged if not broken his left arm was shattered yes she said calmly and inside his body more was harmed he bled inside himself so much blood for such a little boy but he has a strong heart our phelan he is particularly precious to me he would have been dead in minutes he is not dead why i cant answer restlessly she pushed at her hair i cant explain it to you wont cant when she would have turned her face away he caught her chin held it firmly try you overstep she said stiffly continually then you should be growing accustomed to it i held the boy he reminded her i watched and i felt life come back into him tell me what you did she wanted to dismiss him but he had helped her when shed needed his help so she would try its a kind of search and a merging an opening of both she lifted a hand let it fall it is a kind of faith if you will it caused you pain do you think fighting death is painless you know better to heal i must feel what he feels and bring him up she shook her head frustrated with words take him back to the pain then we ride it together so that i see feel know you rode more than pain you rode death i saw you we were stronger and if you hadnt been then death would have won she said simply and a mother would be grieving her firstborn tonight and you deirdre of the ice would your people be grieving you there is a risk do you turn from battle kylar or do you face it knowing your life might be the price paid at end of day would you not stand for any one of your people if they had need would you expect me to do less for one of mine i was not one of yours he took her hand before she could look away you rode death with me deirdre i remember i thought it a dream but i remember the pain as if the sword cut into me fresh that same pain mirrored in your eyes as you looked down at me the heat of your body the heat of your life pouring into me i was nothing to you you were a man you were hurt she reached out now laying her hand on his cheek why are you angry should i have let you die because my medicines werent enough to save you should i have stepped back from you and my own gift because it would cause me a moments pain to save you does your pride bleed now because a woman fought for your life perhaps it does he closed his hand over her wrist when i carried you in here i thought you would die and i was helpless you stayed with me that was kind he made some sound then pushed himself off the bed to pace when a man goes into battle deirdre its sword to sword lance to lance fist to fist these are tangible things what youve done magic or miracle is so much more and you were right i cant understand it it changes how you think of me yes she lowered her lashes hid the fresh pain there is no shame in it most men would not have stayed to help certainly not have stayed to speak with me im grateful now if youd excuse me id like to be alone slowly he turned back to her you misunderstand me before i thought of you as a womanbeautiful strong intelligent sad now i think of you as all of that and so much more you humble me you expect me to step away from you because of all you are i cant i want to be with you and i have no right with her heart unsteady she looked at him again is it gratitude that draws you to me i am grateful i owe you for every breath i take but it isnt gratitude i feel when i look at you she slid out of bed to stand on her own feet is it desire i desire you ive never had a mans arms around me in love i want them to be yours what right do i have when i cant stay with you i should already be gone both my family and my people wait you give me truth and truth means more than pretty words and empty promises i wondered about this and now i know when i healed you i felt something ive never felt before mixed with the pain and the cold that comes into me so bitter there was light watching him she spread her hands i said i did nothing to bind you to me and that is truth but something happened in me when i was part of you it angered me and it frightened me but now just now she drew a breath and spoke without a blush it excites me ive been so cold give me one night of warmth you said you wanted me willing she reached up tugged the ribbons loose from the bodice of the nightdress and i am she said as the white gown slid down to pool at her feet chapter she was a vision mote than he could have dreamed slim and small she stood in the glow of candle and firelight will you give me a night she asked him deirdre my love i would give you a lifetime i want no pledges that cant be kept no words but truth only give me what can be and it will be enough she replied somberly my lady he felt somehow that the step toward her was the most momentous of his life and when he took her hands that he was taking the world it is the truth why or how i dont know but never have i spoken cleaner truth she believed he meant it in this time in this place kylar lifetimes are for those who are free so she would be he promised himself whatever had to be done but now wasnt for plans and battles if you wont accept that pledge let me pledge this that i have loved no other as i love you tonight i can give that vow back to you i thought it would be for duty she lifted her hands to his face traced the shape of it with her fingers and i thought the first time it would be with fear she laughed a little my heart jumps can you feel it he laid a hand on her breast felt the shiver felt the leap i wont hurt you oh no she laid a hand on his heart in turn they had brushed once before she thought heart to heart nothing had been the same for her since nothing would be the same for her ever again you wont hurt me warm me kylar as a man warms his woman he drew her into his arms gently gently laid his lips on hers tenderly there once more she thought there that miracle of mouth against mouth sighing out his name she let herself melt into the kiss the first time you kissed me i thought you were foolish his lips curved on hers did you half frozen and bleeding and you would waste your last breath flirting with a woman such is a man not a waste he corrected but i can do better now with a flourish that pleased them both he swept her into his arms come to bed my lady as she had once longed to do she toyed with his silky black hair you must teach me what to do his muscles tightened nerves and thrills at the thought of her innocence tonight she would give him what she had given no other in the candle glow he saw her face saw that she gave him this treasure without fear without shame no he would not hurt her but would do all in his power to bring her joy he laid her on the bed rubbed his cheek against hers it will be my pleasure to instruct you ive seen the goats mate his burst of laughter was muffled in her hair this i can promise will be somewhat different than the mating of goats so pay attention he said grinning now as he lifted his head while i give you your first lesson he was a patient teacher and surely she thought as her skin began to shiver and sing under his hands a skilled one his mouth drank from hers deep then deeper until it was how she imagined it might be to slide bonelessly into a warm river surrounded floating then submerged his hands roamed over her breasts then cupped them as if he could hold her heartbeat in his palms the sensation of those strong hard hands on her flesh shimmered straight down to her belly his mouth skimmed the side of her throat nibbling how lovely she murmured it arching a little to invite more how clever for breasts to give pleasure as well as milk indeed his thumbs brushed over her nipples and made her gasp ive often thought the same oh but what do i her words her thoughts trailed off into a rainbow when that nibbling mouth found her breast she made a sound in her throat half cry half moan it thrilled him that sound of shocked pleasure the sudden shudder of her body the quick jolt of her heart under his lips as she arched again her fingers combed through his hair gripped there and pressed him closer the sweet taste of her filled him like warmed wine he rose over her to tug his doublet aside but before he could satisfy himself with that glorious slide of his flesh to her flesh she lifted her hands ran them experimentally over his chest wait she needed to catch her breath it was all running through her so quickly that it nearly blurred she wanted everything but clearly so that she might remember each stroke each taste each moment i touched you when you were hurt but this is different i looked at your body but didnt see it as i do now carefully she traced her finger along the scar running up his side does this trouble you he felt the line of heat took her hand quickly no even now he thought she would try to heal there will be no pain tonight for either of us he lowered to her took her mouth again there was a hint of urgency now a taste of need so much to feel she mused dreamily so much to know and with the warmth of him coursing through her she enfolded him there was a freedom here she discovered in being about to touch him stroke explore with no purpose other than pleasure the hard muscles the pucker in his smooth skin that was a scar of battle the strength of him excited her challenged her own so that her hands her mouth her movements under him became more demanding this was fire she realized the first true licks of flame that brought nothing but delight and a bright blinding need for more im not fragile indeed she felt alive with power nearly frantic with a kind of raging hunger show me more show me all no matter how his blood swam he would be careful with her but he could show her more his hands roamed down her body over her thighs as if she knew what they both needed she opened to him her breath came short shivering out with quick little moans her nails bit into his back as she began to writhe under him he lifted his head and watched her fly over that first peak of pleasure heat such heat she had never known such fire outside of healing magic and this somehow this went deeper spread wider her body was like a single wild flame she cried out the wanton sound of her own voice another shock to her system beyond control beyond reason she gripped his hips and called out his name when he plunged into her the glory of it was like a shaft of lightning bright and brilliant there was a storm of those glorious and violent shocks as he thrust inside her she locked herself around him her face pressed against his neck and repeated his name as that miraculous heat consumed her sweetheart when he could speak again he did so lazily with his head nuzzled between her breasts you are the most clever of students she felt golden beautiful and for the first time in her memory more woman than queen for one night she told herself one miraculous night she would be a woman im sure i could do better my lord with a few more lessons she was flushed all but glowing and her hair was a tangle of honeyed ropes over the white linen i believe youre right he grinned and nibbled his way up her throat lingered over her lips then shifted so that she lay curled beside him im so warm she told him i never knew what it was like to be so warm tell me kylar whats it like to have the sun on your face full and bright it can burn truly truly he began to toy with her hair and the skin reddens or browns from it he ran a fingertip down her arm pale as milk soft as satin it can dazzle the eyes he turned so he could look down at her you dazzle mine there was an old man who was my tutor when i was a child hed been all over the world he told me of great tombs in a desert where the sun beat like fury of green hills where flowers bloomed wild and the rain came warm of wide oceans where great fish swam that could swallow a boat whole and dragons with silver wings flew he taught me so many marvelous things but he never taught me the wonders that you have tonight theres never been another not like you not like this because she read the truth in his eyes she drew him closer show me more as they loved inside a case of ice the first green bud on a blackened stalk unfurled to a single tender leaf and a second began to form when he woke she was gone at first he was baffled for he slept like a soldier and a soldier slept light as a cat but he could see she had stirred the fire for him and had left his clothes folded neatly on the chest at the foot of the bed it occurred to him that hed slept only an hour or two but obviously like the dead the woman was tirelessbless herand had demanded a heroic number of lessons through the night a pity he mused she hadnt lingered in bed a bit longer that morning he believed he might have managed another he rose to draw back the hangings on the windows he judged it to be well into the morning as her people were about their chores he couldnt tell the time by the light here for it varied so little from dawn to dusk it was always soft and dull with that veil of white over sky and sun even now a thin snow was falling how did she bear it day after day of cold and gloom how did she stay sane and morecontent why should so good and loving a queen be cursed to live her life without warmth he turned studied the chamber hed paid little attention to it the night before hed seen only her now he noted that she lived simply the fabrics were rich indeed but old and growing thin there had been silver and crystal in the dining hall he recalled but here her candlestands were of simple metal the bowl for her washing a crude clay the bed the chest the wardrobe were all beautifully worked with carved roses but there was only a single chair and table he saw no pretty bottles no silks no trinket boxes shed seen to it that the appointments in his guest chamber were suited to his rank but for herself she lived nearly as spartanly as a peasant his mothers ladies had more fuss and fancy in their chambers than this queen then he glanced at the fire and with a clutching in his belly realized she would have used much of the furniture for fuel and fabric for clothes for her people shed worn jewels when they dined even now he could see how they gleamed and sparkled over her but what good were diamonds and pearls to her they couldnt be sold or bartered they put no food on the table a diamonds fire brought no warmth to chilled bones he washed in the bowl of water shed left for him and dressed there on the wall he saw the single tapestry faded with age her rose garden in full bloom and as magnificent in silk thread as hed imagined it alive with color and shape it was a lush paradise caught in a lush moment of summer there was a figure of a woman seated on the jeweled bench beneath the spreading branches of the great bush that bloomed wild and free and a man knelt at her feet offering a single red rose he trailed his fingers over the threads and thought he would give his life and more to be able to offer her one red rose he was directed by a servant to phelans room where the young bard had his quarters with a gaggle of other boys the other boys gone phelan was sitting up in the bed with deirdre for company the chamber was small kylar noted simple but warmer by far than the queens own she was urging a bowl of broth on phelan and laughing in delight at the faces he made a toad no my lady a monkey like the one in the book you lent me he bared his teeth and made her laugh again even a monkey must eat they eat the long yellow fruit then youll pretend this is the long yellow fruit she snuck a spoonful in his mouth he grimaced i dont like the taste i know the medicine spoils it a bit but my favorite monkey needs to regain his strength eat it for me wont you for you my lady on a heavy sigh the boy took the bowl and spoon himself then can i get up and play tomorrow you may get up for a short while my lady there was a wealth of horror and grief in the tone kylar could only sympathize hed once been a small boy and knew the tedium of being forced to stay idle in bed a wounded soldier must recover to fight another day kylar said as he crossed to the bed were you not a soldier when you rode the horse on the stairs phelan nodded staring up at kylar as if fascinated to him the prince was as magnificent and foreign as every hero in every story hed ever heard or read i was my lord well then do you know your lady kept me abed three full days when i came to her wounded he sat on the edge of the bed leaned over and sniffed at the bowl and forced the same broth on me its a cruelty but a soldier bears such hardships phelan will not be a soldier deirdre said firmly he is a bard ah kylar inclined his head in a bow there is no man of more import than a bard more than a soldier phelan asked with eyes wide a bard tells the tales and sings the songs without him we would know nothing im making a story about you my lord excited now phelan spooned up his broth about how you came from beyond traveled the forgotten wounded and near death and how my lady healed you id like to hear the story when youve finished it you can make the story while you rest and recover pleased that the bowl was empty deirdre took it as she stood then leaned over to kiss phelans brow will you come back my lady i will but now you rest and dream your story later ill bring you a new book be well young bard kylar took deirdres hand to lead her out you rose early he commented theres much to be done i find myself jealous of a tenyearold boy nearly twelve is phelan hes small for his age regardless you didnt sit and feed me broth or kiss my brow when i was well enough to sit up on my own you were not so sweetnatured a patient i would be now he kissed her surprised that she didnt flush and flutter as females were wont to do instead she answered his lips with a reckless passion that stirred his appetite put me to bed and ill show you she laughed and nudged him back that will have to wait i have duties ill help you her face softened you have helped me already but come ill give you work chapter there was no lack of work the prince of mrydon found himself tending goats and chickens shoveling manure hauling endless buckets of snow to a low fire carting precious wood to a communal pile the first day he labored he tired so quickly that it scored his pride on the second muscles that had gone unused during his recovery ached continually but the discomfort had the benefit of deirdre rubbing him everywhere with one of her balms and made the ensuing loving both merry and slippery she was a joy in bed and he saw none of the sadness in her eyes there her laughter the sound hed longed to hear came often he grew to know her people and was surprised and impressed by the lack of bitterness in them he thought them more like a family and though some were lazy some grim they shouldered together they knew he realized that the survival of the whole depended on each that he thought was another of deirdres gifts her people held the will to go on day after day because their lady did he couldnt imagine his own soldiers bearing the hardships and the tedium with half as much courage he came upon her in her garden though the planting and maintenance there was divided as all chores were in rose castle he knew she often chose to work or walk there alone she did so now carefully watering her plantings with snowmelt your goat herd has increased by one he glanced down at his stained tunic its the first such birthing ive attended deirdre straightened eased her back the kid and the shegoat are well well and fine yes why wasnt i called there was no need here let me he took the spouted bucket from her your people work hard deirdre but none as hard as their queen the garden is a pleasure to me so ive seen he glanced up at the wide dome a clever device my grandfathers doing since he was watering she knelt and began to harvest turnips he inherited a love for gardening from his mother im told it was she who designed and planted the rose garden im named for her when he was a young man he traveled and he studied with engineers and scientists and learned much i think he was a great man ive heard of him though i thought it all legend kylar looked back at her as she placed turnips in a sack its said he was a sorcerer her lips curved a little perhaps magic may come through the blood i dont know i do know he gathered many of the books in the library and built this dome for his mother when she was very old here she could start seedlings before the planting time and grow the flowers she loved even in the cold it must have given her great pleasure to work here when her roses and other flowers were dormant with winter she sat back on her heels looked over her rows and beyond to the sad and spindly daisies she prized like rubies i wonder if somehow he knew that his gift to his mother would one day save his people from starvation you run low on fuel yes the men will cut another tree in a few days it always pained her to order it for each tree cut meant one fewer left though the forest was thick and vast without new growth there would someday be no more deirdre how long can you go on this way as long as we must its not enough temper that he hadnt realized was building inside him burst out he cast the bucket aside and grabbed her hands shed been waiting for this through the joy through the sweetness shed known the storm would come the storm that would end the time out of time he was healed now and a warrior prince so healed could not abide monotony its enough she said calmly because its what we have for how much longer he demanded ten years fifty for as long as there is though she tried to pull away he turned her hands over you work them raw haul buckets like a milkmaid should i sit on my throne with soft white hands folded and let my people work there are other choices not for me come with me he gripped her arms now tight firm as if he held his own life oh shed dreamed of it in her most secret heart riding off with him flying through the forest and away to beyond toward the sun the green the flowers into summer i cant you know i cant well find the way out when were home ill gather men horses provisions ill come back for your people i swear it to you youll find the way out she laid her hands on his chest over the thunder of his heart i believe it if i didnt i would have you chained before id allow you to leave i wont risk your death but the way back she shook her head turned away from him when his grip relaxed you dont believe ill come back she closed her eyes because she didnt believe it not fully how could he turn his back on the sun and risk everything to travel here again for what hed known for only a few weeks even if you tried theres no certainty youd find us again your coming was a miracle your safe passage home will be another i dont ask for three in one lifetime she drew herself up i wont ask for your life nor will i accept it i will send a man with youmy best my strongestif you will take him if you will give him good horses and provisions i will send others if the gods show him the way back again but you wont leave im bound to stay as you are bound to go she turned back and though tears stung her throat her eyes were dry its said that if i leave here while winter holds this place rose castle will vanish from sight and all within will be trapped for eternity thats nonsense can you say that she gestured to the white sky above the dome can you be sure of it i am queen of this world and i am prisoner then bid me stay youve only to ask it of me i wont and you cant first youre destined to be king it is your fate and i have seen the crown youll wear inside your own mind and heart and more your family would grieve and your people mourn with that on your conscience the gift we found together would be forever tainted one day you would go in any case so little faith in me i ask you this do you love me her eyes filled sheened but the tears did not fall i care for you you brought light inside me care is a weak word do you love me my heart is frozen i have no love to give that is the first lie youve told me ive seen you cuddle a fretful babe in your arms risk your life to save a small boy that is a different matter ive been inside you frustrated fury ran over his face ive seen your eyes as you opened to me she began to tremble passion is not love surely my father had passion for my mother for her sister but love he had for neither i care for you i desire you that is all i have to give the gift of a heart woman to man has doomed me so because your father was feckless your mother foolish and your aunt vindictive you close yourself off from the only true warmth there is i cant give what i dont have then take this deirdre of the sea of ice i love you and i will never love another i leave tomorrow i ask you again come with me i cant i cant she repeated taking his arm i beg you our time is so short let us not have this chill between us ive given you more than ever i gave a man i pledge to you now there will never be another let it be enough it isnt enough if you loved youd know that one hand gripped the hilt of his sword as if he would draw it and fight what stood between them instead he stepped back from her you make your own prison my lady he said and left her alone deirdre nearly sank to her knees but despair she thought would solve no more than kylars bright sword would so she picked up the pail why didnt you tell him deirdre jolted nearly splashing water over the rim you have no right to listen to private words orna ignoring the stiff tone orna came forward to heft the bag of turnips hasnt he the right to know what may break the spell no she said it fiercely his choices his actions must be his own he is entitled to that he wont be influenced by a sense of honor for his honor runs through him like his blood i am no damsel who needs rescuing by a man you are a woman who is loved by one men love many women by the blood child will you let those who made you ruin you should i give my heart take his at the risk of sacrificing all who depend on me it doesnt have to be that way the curse i dont know love when she whirled around her face was bright with temper how can i trust what i dont know she who bore me couldnt love me he who made me never even looked on my face i know duty and i know the tenderness i feel for you and my people i know joy and sadness and i know fear its fear that traps you havent i the right to fear deirdre demanded when i hold lives in my hands day and night i cannot leave here no you cannot leave here the undeniable truth of that broke ornas heart but you can love and loving risk trapping him in this place this cold place harsh payment for what hes given me no he leaves on the morrow and what will be will be and if youre with child i pray i am for it is my duty her shoulders slumped i fear i am for then i will have imprisoned his child our child here she pressed a hand to her stomach i dreamed of a child orna nursing at my breast and watching me with my lovers eyes and what moved through me was so fierce and strong the woman i am would ride away with him to save what grows inside me the queen cannot you will not speak of this to him or anyone no my lady deirdre nodded send dilys to me and see that provisions are set aside for two men they will have a long and difficult journey i await dilys in the parlor she set the bucket aside and walked quickly away before going inside orna hurried through the archway and into the rose garden when she saw that the tiny leaf shed watched unfurl from a single green bud was withering she wept chapter even pride couldnt stop her from going to him when time was so short there was no room for pride in her world she brought him gifts she hoped he would accept and she brought him herself kylar she waited at his chamber door until he turned from the window where he stared out at the dark night so handsome she thought her dark prince would you speak with me im trying to understand you that alone that he would try lightened her heart i wish you could she came forward and laid what she carried on the chest by his bed ive brought you a cloak since yours was ruined it was my grandfathers and with its lining of fur is warmer than what you had it befits a prince and this brooch that was his will you take it he crossed to her picked up the gold brooch with its carved rose why do you give it to me because i treasure it she lifted a hand closed it over his on the brooch you think i dont cherish what youve given me what youve been to me i cant let you leave believing that i cant bear the thought of you going when theres anger and hard words between us there was a storm in his eyes as they met hers i could take you from here whether youre willing or not no one could stop me i would not allow it nor would my people he stepped closer and circled her throat with his hand with just enough force that the pulse against his palm fluttered with fear no one could stop me his free hand clamped over hers before she could draw her dagger not even you i would never forgive you for it nor lie willingly with you again anger makes you think of using force as an answer you know its not how can you be so calm and so sure deirdre im sure of nothing and i am not calm i want to go with you i want to run and never look back to live with you in the sunlight to once smell the grass to breathe the summer once she said in a fierce whisper and what would that make me my wife the hand under his trembled then steadied before she drew it away you honor me but i will never marry because of who made you how you were made he took her by the shoulders now so that their gazes locked can you be so wise so warm deirdre and at the same time so cold and closed i will never marry because my most sacred trust is to do no harm if i were to take a husband he would be king i would share the welfare of all my people with him this is a heavy burden do you think i would shirk it i dont no ive been inside your mind and heart you keep your promises kylar even if they harm you so you spurn me to save me spurn you i have lain with you i have shared with you my body my mind as i have never shared with another will never share again in my lifetime if i take your vow and keep you here if you keep your vow and stay how many will be harmed what destinies would we alter if you did not take your place as king in your own land and if i went with you my people would lose hope they would have no one to look to for guidance no one to heal them there is no one here to take my place she thought of the child she knew grew inside her i accept that you must go and honor you for it she said why cant you accept that i must stay you see only black and white i know only black and white her voice turned desperate now with a pleading hed never heard from her my life the whole of it has been here and one single purpose was taught to me to keep my people alive and well ive done this as best i can no one could have done better but it isnt finished you want to understand me now she moved to the window pulled the hangings over the black glass to shut out the dark and the cold when i was a babe my mother gave me to orna i never remember my mothers arms around me she was kind but she couldnt love me i have my fathers eyes and looking at me caused her pain i felt that pain she pressed her hands to her heart i felt it inside me the hurt and the longing and the despair so i closed myself off from it hadnt i the right there was no room for anger in him now she had no right to turn from you she did turn from me and that cant be changed i was tended well and taught i had duties and i had playmates and once when i was very young there were dogs they died off one by one when the last his name was griffena foolish name for a dog i suppose he was very old and i couldnt heal him when he died it broke something in me thats foolish too isnt it to be shattered by the death of a dog no you loved him oh i did she sat now with a weary sigh so much love i had for that old hound and so much fury when i lost him i was mad with grief and tried to destroy the ice rose i thought if i could chop it down hack it to bits all this would end somehow it would end for even death could never be so bleak but a sword is nothing against magic my mother sent for me there would be loss she told me i had to accept it i had duties and the most vital was to care for my people to put their wellbeing above my own she was right as a queen kylar agreed but not as a mother how could she give what she didnt have i realize now with her bond with the animals she must have felt grief as i did for the loss she was grief my mother i watched her pine and yearn for the man whod ruined her even as she died she wept for him his deceit his selfishness stole the color and warmth from her life and doomed her and her people to eternal winter yet she died loving him and i vowed that nothing and no one would ever rule my heart it is trapped inside me as frozen as the rose in the tower of ice outside this window if it were free kylar i would give it to you you trap yourself its not a sword that will cut through the ice its love what i have is yours i wish it could be more if i were not queen i would go with you on the morrow i would trust you to take me to beyond or would die fighting to get there with you but i cant go and you cant stay kylar i saw your mothers face my mother in your mind your heart when i healed you i would have given anything anything to have seen such love and pride for me in the eyes of the one who bore me you cant let her grieve for a son who still lives guilt clawed at him she would want me happy i believe she would but if you stay she will never know what became of you whatever you want for yourself you have too much inside you for her to leave her not knowing and too much honor to turn away from your duties to your family and your own land his fists clenched she had with the skill of a soldier outflanked him does it always come to duty were born what were born kylar neither you nor i could live well or happy if we cast off our duty i would rather face a battle without sword or shield than leave you weve been given these weeks if i ask you for one more night will you turn me away no he reached for her hand i wont turn you away he loved her tenderly then fiercely and at last when dawn trembled to life he loved her desperately when the night was over she didnt cling nor did she weep a part of him wished she would do both but the woman he loved was strong and helped him prepare for his journey without tears there are rations for two weeks she prayed it would be enough take whatever you need from the forest as he cinched the saddle on his horse deirdre slipped a hand under his cloak laid it on his side and he moved away no more than once during the night shed tried to explore his healing wound if i have pain its mine i wont have it be yours not again youre stubborn i bow before you my lady the queen of willful she managed a smile and laid a hand on the arm of the man shed chosen to guide the prince dilys you are prince kylars man now he was young tall as a tree and broad of shoulder my lady i am the queens man this time she touched his face they had grown up together and once had romped as children your queen asks that you pledge now your loyalty your fealty and your life to prince kylar he knelt in the deep and crusted snow if it is your wish my queen i so pledge she drew a ring from her finger pressed it into his hand live she bent to kiss both his cheeks and if you cannot return my lady if you cannot she continued lifting his head so their gazes met know you have my blessing and my wish for your happiness keep the prince safe she whispered do not leave him until hes safe it is the last i will ever ask of you she stepped back kylar prince of mrydon we wish you safe journey he took the hand she offered deirdre queen of the sea of ice my thanks for your hospitality and my good wishes to you and your people but he didnt release her hand instead he took a ring of his own and slid it onto her finger i pledge to you my heart kylar i pledge to you my life and before the people gathered in the courtyard he pulled her into his arms and kissed her long and deep ask me now one thing anything i will ask you this when youre safe again when you find summer pluck the first rose you see and think of me i will know and be content even now he thought she would not ask him to come back for her he touched a hand to the brooch pinned to his cloak every rose i see is you he vaulted onto his horse i will come back he spurred his horse toward the archway with dilys trotting beside him the crowd rushed after them calling cheering unable to resist deirdre climbed to the battlements stood in the slow drift of snow and watched him ride away from her his mounts hooves rang on the ice and his black cloak snapped in the frigid wind then he whirled his horse and reared high i will come back he shouted when his voice echoed back to her over her she nearly believed it she stood her red cloak drawn tight until he disappeared into the forest alone her legs trembling she made her way down to the rose garden there was a burning inside her chest and an ache deep deep within her belly when her vision blurred she stopped to catch her breath with a kind of dull surprise she reached up to touch her cheeks and found them wet tears she thought after so many years the burning inside her chest became a throbbing so she closed her eyes and stumbled forward so the frozen chamber that trapped her heart could melt after all and melting bring tears bring a pain that was like what came with healing she collapsed at the foot of the great ice rose buried her face in her hands i love she sobbed now rocking herself for comfort i love him with all i am or will ever be and it hurts how cruel to show me this to bring me this how bitter your heart must have been to drape cold over what should be warmth but you did not love i know that now steadying as best she could she turned her face up to the dull sky even my mother did not love for she willed him back with every breath i love and i wish the one who has my heart safe and whole and warm for i would not wish this barren life on him ill know when he feels the sun and plucks the rose and i will be content she laid a hand on her heart on her belly your cold magic cant touch whats inside me now and drawing herself up turning away she didnt see the delicate leaf struggling to live on a tiny green bud the world was wild and the air itself roared like wolves the storm sprang up like a demon hurling ice and snow like frozen arrows night fell so fast that there was barely time to gather branches for fuel wrapped in his cloak kylar brooded into the fire the trees were thick here tall as giants dead as stones they had gone beyond where deirdre harvested trees and into what was called the forgotten when the storm passes can you find your way back from here kylar demanded though they sat close to warm each other he was forced to shout to be heard over the screaming storm dilyss eyes all that showed beneath the cloak and hood blinked once yes my lord then when travel is possible again youll go back to rose castle no my lord it took kylar a moment you will do as i bid you have pledged your obedience to me my queen charged me to see you safe it was the last she said to me i will see you safe my lord ill travel more quickly without you i dont think this is so dilys said in his slow and thoughtful way i will see you home my lord you cannot go back to her until you have reached home my lady needs you to come back to her she doesnt believe i will why do you because you are meant to you must sleep now the road ahead is longer than the road behind the storm raged for hours it was still dark still brutal when kylar awoke snow covered him turning his hair and cloak white and even the fur did little to fight the canny cold he moved silently to his horse it would take he knew minutes only to move far enough from camp that his trail would be lost in such a hellish world you could stand all but shoulder to shoulder with another and not see him beside you the man dilys would have no choice but to return home when he woke and found himself alone but though he walked his horse soundlessly through the deep snow hed gone no more than fifty yards when dilys was once more trudging beside him brave of heart and loyal to the bone kylar thought deirdre had chosen her man well you have ears like a bat kylar said resigned now dilys grinned i do kylar stopped jumped down from the horse mount he ordered if were traveling through hell together well take turns riding when dilys only stood and stared kylar swore will you argue with me over everything or do as your lady commanded and i now bid i would not argue my lord but i dont know how to mount the horse kylar stood in the swirling snow cold to the marrow of his bones and laughed until he thought he would burst from it chapter on the fourth day of the journey the wind rose so fierce that they walked in blindness hoods cloaks even cathmors dark hide were white now snow coated dilyss eyebrows and the stubble of his beard making him look like an old man rather than a youth not yet twenty color kylar thought was a stranger to this terrible world warmth was only a dim memory in the forgotten when dilys rode kylar waded through snow that reached his waist at times he wondered if it would soon simply bury them both fatigue stole through him and with it a driving urge just to lie down to sleep his way to a quiet death but each time he stumbled he pulled himself upright again he had given her a pledge and he would keep it she had willed him to live through pain and through magic so he would live and he would go back to her walking or riding he slipped into dreams in dreams he sat with deirdre on a jeweled bench in a garden alive with roses brilliant with sunlight her hands were warm in his so they traveled a full week step by painful step through ice and wind through cold and dark do you have a sweetheart dilys sir a sweetheart taking his turn in the saddle kylar rode on a tiring cathmor with his chin on his chest a girl you love i do her name is wynne she works in the kitchens well wed when i return kylar smiled drifted the man never lost hope he thought nor wavered in his steady faith i will give you a hundred gold coins as a marriage gift my thanks my lord what is gold coins kylar managed a weak chuckle as useless just now as a bull with teats and what is a bull youd ask kylar continued anticipating his man for surely youve seen a teat in your day i have my lord and a wonder of nature they are to a man a bull i have heard of it is a beast is it not i read a story once dilys broke off raising his head sharply at the sound overhead with a shout he snagged the horses reins dragged at them roughly cathmor screamed and stumbled only instinct and a spurt of will kept kylar in the saddle as the great tree fell inches from cathmors rearing hooves ears like a bat kylar said a second time while his heart thundered in his ears the tree was fully six feet across more than a hundred in length one more step in its path and they would have been crushed it is a sign the shock roused kylar enough to clear his mind it is a dead tree broken by the weight of snow and ice it is a sign dilys said stubbornly its branches point there he gestured and still holding the reins he began to lead the horse to the left you would follow the branches of a dead tree kylar shook his head shrugged very well then how could it matter he dozed and dreamed for an hour walked blind and stiff for another but when they stopped for midday rations from their dwindling supply dilys held up a hand what is that sound the bloody wind is it never silent no my lord beneath the wind listen he closed his eyes it is like music i hear nothing and certainly no music there when dilys went off at a stumbling run kylar shouted after him furious that the man would lose himself without food or horse he mounted as quickly as he could manage and hurried after he found dilys standing kneedeep in snow one hand lifted and trembling what is it my lord what is this thing its only a stream concerned that the mans mind had snapped kylar leaped down from the horse its just a a stream he whispered as the import raced through him running water not ice but running water the snow he turned a quick circle its not so deep here and the air is it warmer its beautiful dilys was hypnotized by the clear water rushing and bubbling over rock it sings yes by the blood it is and it does come quick now we follow the stream the wind still blew but the snow was thinning he could see clearly now the shape of the trees and tracks from game he had only to find the strength to draw his bow and they would have meat there was life here rocks stumps brambles began to show themselves beneath the snow the first call of a bird had dilys falling to his knees in shock snow had melted from their hair their cloaks but now it was dilyss face that was white as ice its a magpie kylar told him both amused and touched when his stalwart man trembled at the sound a song of summer rise now weve left winter behind us soon cathmors hooves hit ground solid and springy and a single beam of light streamed through trees that were thick with leaves what magic is this sun kylar closed his hand over the rose brooch we found the sun he dismounted and on legs weak and weary walked slowly to a brilliant splash of color here at the edge of the forgotten grew wild roses red as blood he plucked one breathed in its sweet scent and said deirdre and she carrying a bucket of melted snow to her garden swayed she pressed a hand to her heart as it leaped with joy he is home she moved through her days now with an easy contentment her lover was safe and the child theyd made warm inside her the child would be loved would be cherished her heart would never be cold again if there was yearning in her it was natural but she would rather yearn than have him trapped in her world on the night she knew he was safe she gave a celebration with wine and music and dancing the story would be told she decreed of kylar of mrydon kylar the brave and of the faithful dilys and all of her people all who came after would know of it on a silver chain around her neck she wore his ring she hummed as she cleared the paths in her rose garden you sent men out to scout for dilys orna said it is probably too early but i know hell start for home as soon as hes able and prince kylar you dont look for him he doesnt belong here he has family in his world and one day a throne i found love with him and it blooms in meheart and womb so i wish for him health and happiness and one day when these memories have faded from his mind a woman who loves him as i do orna glanced toward the ice rose but said nothing of it do you doubt his love for you no her smile was warm and sweet as she said it but ive learned orna i believe he was sent to me to teach me what i never knew love cant come from cold if it does its selfish and is not love but simply desire it gives me such joy to think of him in the sunlight i dont wish for him as my mother wished for my father or curse him as my aunt cursed us all i no longer see my life here as prison or duty without it i would never have known him youre wiser than those who made you im luckier deirdre corrected then leaned on her shovel as phelan rushed into the garden my lady ive finished my story will you hear it i will fetch that shovel by the wall you can tell me while we work its a grand story he ran for the shovel and began heaving snow with great enthusiasm the best ive done and it begins like this once a brave and handsome prince from a faroff land fought a great battle against men who would plunder his kingdom and kill his people his name was kylar and his land was mrydon it is a good beginning phelan the bard yes my lady but it gets better kylar the brave defeated the invaders but sorely wounded became lost in the great forest known as the forgotten deirdre continued to work smiling as the boys words brought her memories back so clearly she remembered her first glimpse of those bold blue eyes that first foolish brush of lips she would give phelan precious paper and ink to scribe the story she would bind it herself in leather tanned from deer hide in this way she thought with pride her love would live forever one day their child would read the story and know what a man his father was she cleared the path past jeweled benches toward the great frozen rose while the boy told his tale and labored tirelessly beside her and the beautiful queen gave him a rose carved on a brooch that he wore pinned over his heart for days and nights with his faithful horse cathmor and the valiant and true dilys he fought the wild storms crossed the iced shadows of the forgotten it was his ladys love that sustained him you have a romantic heart young bard it is a true story my lady i saw it in my head he continued on entertaining and delighting her with words of dilyss stubborn loyalty of black nights and white days of a giant tree crashing and leading them toward a stream where water ran over rock like music sunlight struck the water and made it sparkle like diamonds a bit surprised by the description she glanced toward him do you think sun on water makes diamonds it makes tiny bright lights my lady it dazzles the eye something inside her heart trembled dazzles the eye she repeated on a whisper yes i have heard of this and at the edge of the forgotten grew wild roses firered the handsome prince plucked one as he had promised and when its sweetness surrounded him he said his ladys name its a lovely story it is not the end he all but danced with excitement tell me the rest then she started to smile to rest on her shovel then there came the sound of wild cheering and shouts from without the garden this is the end the boy threw his shovel carelessly aside and raced to the archway he is come who she began but couldnt hear her own voice over the shouts over the pounding of her blood suddenly the light went brilliant searing into her eyes so that with a little cry of shock she threw a hand up to shield them wild wind turned to breeze soft as silk and she heard her name spoken her hand trembled as she lowered it and her eyes blinked against a light shed never known she saw him in the archway of the garden surrounded by a kind of shimmering halo that gleamed like melted gold kylar her heart every chamber filled with joy bounded in her breast her shovel clattered on the path as she ran to him he caught her up spinning her in circles as she clung to him oh my love my heart how can this be her tears fell on his neck her kisses on his face you should not be here you should never have come back how can i let you go again look at me sweetheart look at me he tipped up her chin so there are tears now id hoped there would be i ask you again do you love me deirdre so much i could live on nothing else my whole life i would not have had to risk yours to come back she laid her palms on his cheeks then her lips trembled open her fingers shook you came back she whispered i would have crossed hell for you perhaps i did she closed her eyes that light what is that light it is the sun unveiled here take off your cloak feel the sun deirdre im not cold youll never be cold again open your eyes my love and look winter is over gripping his hand she turned to watch the snow melting away vanishing before her staring eyes blackened stalks began to crackle break out green and at their feet soft tender blades of grass spread in a shimmering carpet the sky dazed she reached up as if she could touch it its blue like your eyes feel it feel the sun she held her hands out to cup the warmth on a cry of wonder she knelt ran her hands over the soft grass brought her hands to her face to breathe in the scent though tears continued to fall she laughed and held those hands out to him is it grass it is oh she covered her face with her hands again as if she could drink it such perfume he knelt with her and would remember he knew the rapture on her face the first time she touched a simple blade of grass your roses are blooming my lady speechless she watched buds spear blooms unfold yellows pinks reds whites in petals that flowed from bud to flower and flowers so heavy they bent the graceful green branches the fragrance all but made her drunk roses her voice quivered as she reached out to touch felt the silky texture flowers and buried her face in blooms she squealed like a girl when a butterfly fluttered by her face and landed on a tender bud to drink oh there was so much almost too much and she was dizzy from it see how it moves its so beautiful in turn she tipped her face back and drank in the sunlight what is that across the blue of the sky that curve of colors its a rainbow watching her was like watching something be born and once again he thought she humbled him your first rainbow my love its lovelier than in the books in them it seemed false and impossible but its soft and its real i brought you a gift you brought me summer she murmured and this he snapped his fingers and through the arch down the path raced a fat brown puppy barking cheerfully it leaped into deirdres lap his name is griffen drowned in emotion she cradled the pup as she might a child pressed her face into its warm fur she felt its heartbeat and the quick wet lash of its tongue on her cheek im sorry she managed and broke down and sobbed weep then kylar bent to touch his lips to her hair as long as its for joy how can this be how can you bring me so much i turned you away without love no you let me go with love it took me time to understand thatand you to understand what it cost you there would have been no summer if i hadnt left you and returned he lifted her damp face now and the puppy wiggled free and began to race joyfully through the garden is that not so it is so only the greatest and truest love freely given could break the spell and turn away winter i knew when i plucked the rose i understood i watched summer bloom it came with me through the forest as i rode the trees behind me went into leaf brooks and streams sprang free of ice with every mile i put behind me every mile i came closer to you the world awoke others will come tomorrow i couldnt wait but how how did you come back so quickly my land is only a days journey from here it was magic that kept you hidden its love that frees you its more phelan wiggled his way through the crowd of people who gathered in the archway he gave a cry of delight as the pup leaped at him it is truth he began and sacrifice and honor all these tied by love are stronger than a shield of ice and break the spell of the winter rose when summer comes to rose castle the isle of winter becomes the isle of flowers and the sea of ice becomes the sea of hope and here the good queen gives hand and heart to her valiant prince it is a good ending kylar commented but perhaps you would wait until i ask the good queen for her hand and her heart she dashed tears from her cheeks her people her love would not see her weep at such a time you have my heart already then give me your hand be my wife she put her hand in his but because she must be a queen turned first to her people you are witness i pledge myself in love and in marriage for a lifetime to kylar prince of mrydon he will be your king and to him you will give your service your respect and your loyalty from this day his people will be your brothers and your sisters in time our lands will be one land she let them cheer let his name ring out along with hers into the wondrous blue bowl of sky and her hand was warm in kylars prepare a feast of celebration and thanks and make ourselves ready to welcome the guests that come on the morrow leave us now for i need a moment with my betrothed take the pup to the kitchen phelan and see that he is well fed keep him for me yes my lady his name is griffen her gaze met ornas and smiled as her people left her alone with her prince there is one last thing to be done she walked with him down the path to where the reddest roses bloomed on the tallest bush under thinning ice without a thought she plunged her hand through it and the shield shattered like glass she picked the first rose of her life offered it to him ive accepted you as queen that is duty now i give myself to you as a woman this is for love you brought light to my world you freed my heart now and forever that heart is yours she started to kneel and he stopped her you wont kneel to me her brows lifted and command once again cloaked her i am queen of this place i do as i wish she knelt i am yours queen and woman from this hour this day will be known and celebrated as prince kylars return with a gleam in his eye he knelt as well and made her lips twitch you will be a willful wife this is truth i would not have it otherwise kiss me deirdre the fair she put a hand on his chest first i have a gift for you it can wait i lived on dreams of your kisses for days in the cold this gift cant wait kylar i have your child in me a child made from love and warmth the hand that had touched her face slid bonelessly to her shoulder a child weve made life between us a miracle beyond magic our child his palm spread over her belly rested there as his lips took hers it pleases you for an answer he leaped up hoisted her high until her laughter rang out she threw her arms toward the sky toward the sun the sky the rainbow and the roses grew and bloomed until branches and flowers reached over the garden wall tumbled down and filled the air with the promise of summer the end
