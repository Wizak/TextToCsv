end woes and all duke merchant of siracusa plead no more i am not partiall to infringe our lawes the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants our welldealing countrimen who wanting gilders to redeeme their liues haue seald his rigorous statutes with their blouds excludes all pitty from our threatning lookes for since the mortall and intestine iarres twixt thy seditious countrimen and vs it hath in solemne synodes beene decreed both by the siracusians and our selues to admit no trafficke to our aduerse townes nay more if any borne at ephesus be seene at any siracusian marts and fayres againe if any siracusian borne come to the bay of ephesus he dies his goods confiscate to the dukes dispose vnlesse a thousand markes be leuied to quit the penalty and to ransome him thy substance valued at the highest rate cannot amount vnto a hundred markes therefore by law thou art condemnd to die mer yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the euening sonne duk well siracusian say in briefe the cause why thou departedst from thy natiue home and for what cause thou camst to ephesus mer a heauier taske could not haue beene imposd then i to speake my griefes vnspeakeable yet that the world may witnesse that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence ile vtter what my sorrow giues me leaue in syracusa was i borne and wedde vnto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap beene bad with her i liud in ioy our wealth increast by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamium till my factors death and he great care of goods at randone left drew me from kinde embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not sixe moneths olde before her selfe almost at fainting vnder the pleasing punishment that women beare had made prouision for her following me and soone and safe arriued where i was there had she not beene long but she became a ioyfull mother of two goodly sonnes and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguishd but by names that very howre and in the selfesame inne a meane woman was deliuered of such a burthen male twins both alike those for their parents were exceeding poore i bought and brought vp to attend my sonnes my wife not meanely prowd of two such boyes made daily motions for our home returne vnwilling i agreed alas too soone wee came aboord a league from epidamium had we saild before the alwaies windeobeying deepe gaue any tragicke instance of our harme but longer did we not retaine much hope for what obscured light the heauens did grant did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes a doubtfull warrant of immediate death which though my selfe would gladly haue imbracd yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and pitteous playnings of the prettie babes that mournd for fashion ignorant what to feare forst me to seeke delayes for them and me and this it was for other meanes was none the sailors sought for safety by our boate and left the ship then sinking ripe to vs my wife more carefull for the latter borne had fastned him vnto a small spare mast such as seafaring men prouide for stormes to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had beene like heedfull of the other the children thus disposd my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt fastned our selues at eyther end the mast and floating straight obedient to the streame was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sonne gazing vpon the earth disperst those vapours that offended vs and by the benefit of his wished light the seas waxt calme and we discouered two shippes from farre making amaine to vs of corinth that of epidarus this but ere they came oh let me say no more gather the sequell by that went before duk nay forward old man doe not breake off so for we may pitty though not pardon thee merch oh had the gods done so i had not now worthily tearmd them mercilesse to vs for ere the ships could meet by twice fiue leagues we were encountred by a mighty rocke which being violently borne vp our helpefull ship was splitted in the midst so that in this vniust diuorce of vs fortune had left to both of vs alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poore soule seeming as burdened with lesser waight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the winde and in our sight they three were taken vp by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seizd on vs and knowing whom it was their hap to saue gaue healthfull welcome to their shipwrackt guests and would haue reft the fishers of their prey had not their backe beene very slow of saile and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus haue you heard me seuerd from my blisse that by
