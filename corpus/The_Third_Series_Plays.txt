weve got to face the facts clare i thought i was george the facts are that were married for better or worse and certain things are expected of us its suicide for you and folly for me in my position to ignore that you have all you can reasonably want and i dont dont wish for any change if you could bring anything against me if i drank or knocked about town or expected too much of you im not unreasonable in any way that i can see clare well i think weve talked enough she again moves towards the curtained door george look here clare you dont mean youre expecting me to put up with the position of a man whos neither married nor unmarried thats simple purgatory you ought to know clare yes i havent yet have i george dont go like that do you suppose were the only couple whove found things arent what they thought and have to put up with each other and make the best of it clare not by thousands george well why do you imagine they do it clare i dont know george from a common sense of decency clare very george by jove you can be the most maddening thing in all the world taking up a pack of cards he lets them fall with a long slithering flutter after behaving as you have this evening you might try to make some amends i should think clare moves her head from side to side as if in sight of something she could not avoid he puts his hand on her arm clare no no no george dropping his hand cant you make it up clare i dont feel very christian she opens the door passes through and closes it behind her george steps quickly towards it stops and turns back into the room he goes to the window and stands looking out shuts it with a bang and again contemplates the door moving forward he rests his hand on the deserted card table clutching its edge and muttering then he crosses to the door into the hall and switches off the light he opens the door to go out then stands again irresolute in the darkness and heaves a heavy sigh suddenly he mutters no crosses resolutely back to the curtained door and opens it in the gleam of light clare is standing unhooking a necklet he goes in shutting the door behind him with a thud curtain act ii the scene is a large whitewashed disordered room whose outer door opens on to a corridor and stairway doors on either side lead to other rooms on the walls are unframed reproductions of fine pictures secured with tintacks an old winecoloured armchair of low and comfortable appearance near the centre of the room is surrounded by a litter of manuscripts books ink pens and newspapers as though some one had already been up to his neck in labour though by a grandfathers clock it is only eleven on a smallish table close by are sheets of paper cigarette ends and two claret bottles there are many books on shelves and on the floor an overflowing pile whereon rests a soft hat and a black knobby stick malise sits in his armchair garbed in trousers dressinggown and slippers unshaved and uncollared writing he pauses smiles lights a cigarette and tries the rhythm of the last sentence holding up a sheet of quarto ms malise not a word not a whisper of liberty from all those excellent frockcoated gentlemen not a sign not a grimace only the monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant tyranny while he speaks a substantial woman a little over middleage in old dark clothes and a black straw hat enters from the corridor she goes to a cupboard brings out from it an apron and a bissell broom her movements are slow and imperturbable as if she had much time before her her face is broad and dark with chinese

me to find my sons wife clare his woman lady dedmond will you listen to reginald clare i have lady dedmond havent you any religious sense at all clare clare none if its religion to live as we do lady dedmond its terrible this state of mind its really terrible clare breaks into the soft laugh of the other evening as if galvanized by the sound sir charles comes to life out of the transfixed bewilderment with which he has been listening sir charles for gods sake dont laugh like that clare stops lady dedmond with real feeling for the sake of the simple right clare clare right whatever else is right our life is not she puts her hand on her heart i swear before god that ive tried and tried i swear before god that if i believed we could ever again love each other only a little tiny bit id

speak to clare my dear if you feel like this i can only say as a as a gentleman lady dedmond charles sir charles let me alone i can only say that damme i dont know that i can say anything he looks at her very grieved then turns and marches out followed by lady dedmond whose voice is heard without answered by his what in the doorway as they pass george is standing he comes in george going up to clare who has recovered all her selfcontrol will you come outside and speak to me clare no george glances at malise who is leaning against the wall with folded arms george in a low voice clare clare well george you try me pretty high dont you forcing me to come here and speak before this fellow most men would think the worst finding you like this clare you need not have come or thought at all george did you imagine i was going to let you vanish without an effort clare to save me george for gods sake be just ive come here to say certain things if you force me to say them before him on your head be it will you appoint somewhere else clare no george why not clare i know all those certain things you must come back it is your duty you have no money your friends wont help you you cant earn your living you are making a scandal you might even say for the moment your room shall be respected george well its true and youve no answer clare oh suddenly our lifes a lie its stupid its disgusting im tired of it please leave me alone george you rather miss the point im afraid i didnt come here to tell you what you know perfectly well when youre sane i came here to say this anyone in her senses could see the game your friend here is playing it wouldnt take a baby in if you think that a gentleman like that his stare travels round the dishevelled room till it rests on malise champions a pretty woman for nothing you make a fairly bad mistake clare take care but malise after one convulsive movement of his hands has again become rigid george i dont pretend to be subtle or that kind of thing but i have ordinary common sense i dont attempt to be superior to plain facts clare under her breath facts george oh for goodness sake drop that hifalutin tone it doesnt suit you look here if you like to go abroad with one of your young sisters until the autumn ill let the flat and go to the club clare put the fire out with a penny hose slowly i am not coming back to you george the farce is over george taken aback for a moment by the finality of her tone suddenly fronts malise then there is something between you and this fellow malise dangerously but without moving i beg your pardon clare there is nothing george looking from one to the other at all events i wont i wont see a woman who once clare makes a sudden effacing movement with her hands i wont see her go to certain ruin without lifting a finger clare that is noble george with intensity i dont know that you deserve anything of me but on my honour as a gentleman i came here this morning for your sake to warn you of what youre doing he turns suddenly on malise and i tell this precious friend of yours plainly what i think of him and that im not going to play into his hands malise without stirring from the wall looks at clare and his lips move clare shakes her head at him then to george will you go please george i will go when you do malise a man of the world should know better than that george are you coming malise that is inconceivable george im not speaking to you sir malise you are right your words and mine will never kiss each other george will you come clare shakes her head george with fury dyou mean to stay in this pigsty with that rhapsodical swine malise transformed by god if you dont go ill kill you george as suddenly calm that remains to be seen malise with most deadly quietness yes i will kill you he goes stealthily along the wall takes up from where it lies on the pile of books the great black knobby stick and stealthily approaches george his face quite fiendish clare with a swift movement grasping the stick please malise resigns the stick and the two men perfectly still glare at each other clare letting the stick fall puts her foot on it then slowly she takes off her hat and lays it on the table clare now will you go there is silence george staring at her hat you mad little fool understand this if youve not returned home by three oclock ill divorce you and you may roll in the gutter with this highsouled friend of yours and mind this you sir i wont spare you by god your pocket shall suffer thats the only thing that touches fellows like you turning he goes out and slams the door clare and malise remain face to face her lips have begun to quiver clare horrible she turns away shuddering and sits down on the edge of the armchair covering her eyes with the backs of her hands malise picks up the stick and fingers it lovingly then putting it down he moves so that he can see her face she is sitting quite still staring straight before her malise nothing could be better clare i dont know what to do i dont know what to do malise thank the stars for your good fortune clare he means to have revenge on you and its all my fault malise let him let him go for his divorce get rid of him have done with him somehow she gets up and stands with face averted then swiftly turning to him clare if i must bring you harm let me pay you back i cant bear it otherwise make some use of me if you dont mind malise my god she puts up her face to be kissed shutting her eyes malise you poor he clasps and kisses her then drawing back looks in her face she has not moved her eyes are still closed but she is shivering her lips are tightly pressed together her hands twitching malise very quietly no no this is not the house of a gentleman clare letting her head fall and almost in a whisper im sorry malise i understand clare i dont feel and without i cant cant malise bitterly quite right youve had enough of that there is a long silence without looking at him she takes up her hat and puts it on malise not going clare nods malise you dont trust me clare i do but i cant take when im not giving malise i beg i beg you what does it matter use me get free somehow clare mr malise i know what i ought to be to you if i let you in for all this i know what you want or will want of course why not malise i give you my solemn word clare no if i cant be that to you its not real and i cant it isnt to be manufactured is it malise it is not clare to make use of you in such a way no she moves towards the door malise where are you going clare does not answer she is breathing rapidly there is a change in her a sort of excitement beneath her calmness malise not back to him clare shakes her head thank god but where to your people again clare no malise nothing desperate clare oh no malise then what tell me come clare i dont know women manage somehow malise but you poor dainty thing clare its all right dont be unhappy please malise seizing her arm dyou imagine theyll let you off out there you with your face come trust me trust me you must clare holding out her hand goodbye malise not taking that hand this great damned world and you listen the sound of the traffic far down below is audible in the stillness into that alone helpless without money the men who work with you the men you make friends of dyou think theyll let you be the men in the streets staring at you stopping you pudgy bullnecked brutes devils with hard eyes senile swine and the chivalrous men like me who dont mean you harm but cant help seeing youre made for love or suppose you dont take covert but struggle on in the open society the respectable the pious even those who love you will they let you be hue and cry the hunt was joined the moment you broke away it will never let up covert to covert till theyve run you down and youre back in the cart and god pity you clare well ill die running malise no no let me shelter you let me clare shaking her head and smiling im going to seek my fortune wish me luck malise i cant let you go clare you must he looks into her face then realizing that she means it suddenly bends down to her fingers and puts his lips to them malise good luck then good luck he releases her hand just touching his bent head with her other hand clare turns and goes malise remains with bowed head listening to the sound of her receding footsteps they die away he raises himself and strikes out into the air with his clenched fist curtain act iii malises sittingroom an afternoon three months later on the table are an open bottle of claret his hat and some tea things down in the hearth is a kettle on a lighted spirit stand near the door stands haywood a short roundfaced man with a tobaccocoloured moustache malise by the table is contemplating a piece of blue paper haywood sorry to press an old customer sir but a year and an alf without any return on your money malise your tobacco is too good mr haywood i wish i could see my way to smoking another haywood well sir thats a funny remedy with a knock on the halfopened door a boy appears malise yes what is it boy your copy for the watchfire please sir malise motioning him out yes wait the boy withdraws malise goes up to the pile of books turns them over and takes up some volumes malise this is a very fine unexpurgated translation of boccaccios decameron mr haywood illustrated i should say you would get more than the amount of your bill for them haywood shaking his head them books worth three pound seven malise its scarce and highly improper will you take them in discharge haywood torn between emotions well i ardly know what to say no sir i dont think id like to ave to do with that malise you could read them first you know haywood dubiously ive got my wife at ome malise you could both read them haywood brought to his bearings no sir i couldnt malise very well ill sell them myself and you shall have the result haywood well thank you sir im sure i didnt want to trouble you malise not at all mr haywood its for me to apologize haywood so long as i give satisfaction malise holding the door for him certainly good evening haywood good evenin sir no offence i hope malise on the contrary doubtfully haywood goes and malise stands scratching his head then slipping the bill into one of the volumes to remind him he replaces them at the top of the pile the boy again advances into the doorway malise yes now for you he goes to the table and takes some sheets of ms from an old portfolio but the door is again timidly pushed open and haywood reappears malise yes mr haywood haywood about that little matter sir if if its any convenience to you ive thought of a place where i could malise read them youll enjoy them thoroughly haywood no sir no where i can dispose of them malise holding out the volumes it might be as well haywood takes the books gingerly i congratulate you mr haywood its a classic haywood oh indeed yes sir in the event of there being any malise anything over carry it to my credit your bill he hands over the blue paper send me the receipt good evening haywood nonplussed and trying to hide the books in an evening paper fumbles out good evenin sir and departs malise again takes up the sheets of ms and cons a sentence over to himself gazing blankly at the stolid boy malise man of the world good form your god poor buttonedup philosopher the boy shifts his feet inbred to the point of cretinism and founded to the bone on fear of ridicule the boy breathes heavily you are the slave of facts there is a knock on the door malise who is it the door is pushed open and reginald huntingdon stands there huntingdon i apologize sir can i come in a minute malise bows with ironical hostility huntingdon i dont know if you remember me clare dedmonds brother malise i remember you he motions to the stolid boy to go outside again huntingdon ive come to you sir as a gentleman malise some mistake there is one i believe on the first floor huntingdon its about my sister malise d n you dont you know that ive been shadowed these last three months ask your detectives for any information you want huntingdon we know that you havent seen her or even known where she is malise indeed youve found that out brilliant huntingdon we know it from my sister malise oh so youve tracked her down huntingdon mrs fullarton came across her yesterday in one of those big shops selling gloves malise mrs fullarton the lady with the husband well youve got her clap her back into prison huntingdon we have not got her she left at once and we dont know where shes gone malise bravo huntingdon taking hold of his bit look here mr malise in a way i share your feeling but im fond of my sister and its damnable to have to go back to india knowing she must be all adrift without protection going through god knows what mrs fullarton says shes looking awfully pale and down malise struggling between resentment and sympathy why do you come to me huntingdon we thought malise who huntingdon my my father and myself malise go on huntingdon we thought there was just a chance that having lost that job she might come to you again for advice if she does it would be really generous of you if youd put my father in touch with her hes getting old and he feels this very much he hands malise a card this is his address malise twisting the card let there be no mistake sir i do nothing that will help give her back to her husband shes out to save her soul alive and i dont join the hue and cry thats after her on the contrary if i had the power if your father wants to shelter her thats another matter but shed her own ideas about that huntingdon perhaps you dont realize how unfit my sister is for rough and tumble shes not one of this new sort of woman shes always been looked after and had things done for her pluck shes got but thats all and shes bound to come to grief malise very likely the first birds do but if she drops halfway its better than if shed never flown your sister sir is trying the wings of her spirit out of the old slave market for women as for men theres more than one kind of dishonour captain huntingdon and worse things than being dead as you may know in your profession huntingdon admitted but malise we each have our own views as to what they are but they all come to death of our spirits for the sake of our carcases anything more huntingdon my leaves up i sail tomorrow if you do see my sister i trust you to give her my love and say i begged she would see my father malise if i have the chance yes he makes a gesture of salute to which huntingdon responds then the latter turns and goes out malise poor fugitive where are you running now he stands at the window through which the evening sunlight is powdering the room with smoky gold the stolid boy has again come in malise stares at him then goes back to the table takes up the ms and booms it at him he receives the charge breathing hard malise man of the world product of a material age incapable of perceiving reality in motions of the spirit having no use as you would say for sentimental nonsense accustomed to believe yourself the national spine your position is unassailable you will remain the idol of the country arbiter of law parson in mufti darling of the playwright and the novelist god bless you while waters lap these shores he places the sheets of ms in an envelope and hands them to the boy malise youre going straight back to the watchfire boy stolidly yes sir malise staring at him youre a masterpiece dyou know that boy no sir malise get out then he lifts the portfolio from the table and takes it into the inner room the boy putting his thumb stolidly to his nose turns to go in the doorway he shies violently at the figure of clare standing there in a darkcoloured dress skids past her and goes clare comes into the gleam of sunlight her white face alive with emotion or excitement she looks round her smiles sighs goes swiftly to the door closes it and comes back to the table there she stands fingering the papers on the table smoothing malises hat wistfully eagerly waiting malise returning you clare with a faint smile not very glorious is it he goes towards her and checks himself then slews the armchair round malise come sit down sit down clare heaving a long sigh sinks down into the chair teas nearly ready he places a cushion for her and prepares tea she looks up at him softly but as he finishes and turns to her she drops that glance clare do you think me an awful coward for coming she has taken a little plain cigarette case from her dress would you mind if i smoked malise shakes his head then draws back from her again as if afraid to be too close and again unseen she looks at him malise so youve lost your job clare how did you malise your brother you only just missed him clare starts up they had an idea youd come hes sailing tomorrow he wants you to see your father clare is father ill malie anxious about you clare ive written to him every week excited theyre still hunting me malise touching her shoulder gently its all right all right she sinks again into the chair and again he withdraws and once more she gives him that soft eager look and once more averts it as he turns to her clare my nerves have gone funny lately its being always on ones guard and stuffy air and feeling people look and talk about you and dislike your being there malise yes that wants pluck clare shaking her head i curl up all the time the only thing i know for certain is that i shall never go back to him the more ive hated what ive been doing the more sure ive been i might come to anything but not that malise had a very bad time clare nodding im spoilt its a curse to be a lady when you have to earn your living its not really been so hard i suppose ive been selling things and living about twice as well as most shop girls malise were they decent to you clare lots of the girls are really nice but somehow they dont want me cant help thinking ive got airs or something and in here she touches her breast i dont want them malise i know clare mrs fullarton and i used to belong to a society for helping reduced gentlewomen to get work i know now what they want enough money not to work thats all suddenly looking up at him dont think me worse than i amplease its working under people its having to do it being driven i have tried ive not been altogether a coward really but every morning getting there the same time every day the same stale dinner as they call it every evening the same good evening miss clare good evening miss simpson good evening miss hart good evening miss clare and the same walk home or the same bus and the same men that you mustnt look at for fear theyll follow you she rises oh and the feelingalways always that theres no sun or life or hope or anything it was just like being ill the way ive wanted to ride and dance and get out into the country her excitement dies away into the old clipped composure and she sits down again dont think too badly of me it really is pretty ghastly malise gruffly hm why a shop clare references i didnt want to tell more lies than i could help a married woman on strike cant tell the truth you know and i cant typewrite or do shorthand yet and chorus i thought you wouldnt like malise i what have i he checks himself have men been brutes clare stealing a look at him one followed me a lot he caught hold of my arm one evening i just took this out she draws out her hatpin and holds it like a dagger her lip drawn back as the lips of a dog going to bite and said will you leave me alone please and he did it was rather nice and there was one quite decent little man in the shop i was sorry for him such a humble little man malise poor devil its hard not to wish for the moon at the tone of his voice clare looks up at him his face is turned away clare softly how have you been working very hard malise as hard as god will let me clare stealing another look have you any typewriting i could do i could learn and ive still got a brooch i could sell which is the best kind malise i had a catalogue of them somewhere he goes into the inner room the moment he is gone clare stands up her hands pressed to her cheeks as if she felt them flaming then with hands clasped she stands waiting he comes back with the old portfolio malise can you typewrite where you are clare i have to find a new room anyway im changing to be safe she takes a luggage ticket from her glove i took my things to charing cross only a bag and one trunk then with that queer expression on her face which prefaces her desperations you dont want me now i suppose malise what clare hardly above a whisper because if you still wanted me i do now etext editors note in the revision years after this edition i do now is changed to i could now a significant change in meaning dw malise staring hard into her face that is quivering and smiling you mean it you do you care clare ive thought of you so much but only if youre sure he clasps her and kisses her closed eyes and so they stand for a moment till the sound of a latchkey in the door sends them apart malise its the housekeeper give me that ticket ill send for your things obediently she gives him the ticket smiles and goes quietly into the inner room mrs miler has entered her face more chinese than ever shows no sign of having seen malise that lady will stay here mrs miler kindly go with this ticket to the cloakroom at charing cross station and bring back her luggage in a cab have you money mrs miler arf a crown she takes the ticket then impassively in case you dont know theres two o them men about the stairs now the moment she is gone malise makes a gesture of maniacal fury he steals on tiptoe to the outer door and listens then placing his hand on the knob he turns it without noise and wrenches back the door transfigured in the last sunlight streaming down the corridor are two men close together listening and consulting secretly they start back malise with strange almost noiseless ferocity youve run her to earth your jobs done kennel up hounds and in their faces he slams the door curtain scene ii scene ii the same early on a winter afternoon three months later the room has now a certain daintiness there are curtains over the doors a couch under the window all the books are arranged on shelves in small vases over the fireplace are a few violets and chrysanthemums malise sits huddled in his armchair drawn close to the fore paper on knee pen in hand he looks rather grey and drawn and round his chair is the usual litter at the table now nearer to the window clare sits working a typewriter she finishes a line puts sheets of paper together makes a note on a card adds some figures and marks the total clare kenneth when this is paid i shall have made two pound seventeen in the three months and saved you about three pounds one hundred and seventeen shillings at tenpence a thousand is

the cover on the typewriter and straps it clare im quite packed shall i pack for you he nods cant we have more than three days at the sea he shakes his head going up to him you did sleep last night malise yes i slept clare bad head malise nods by this time the day after to morrow the case will be heard and done with youre not worrying for me except for my poor old dad i dont care a bit malise heaves himself out of the chair and begins pacing up and down clare kenneth do you understand why he doesnt claim damages after what he said that dayhere looking suddenly at him it is true that he

to gnaw my way out child clare stands looking at him in distress then goes quickly into the room behind her malise takes up his paper and pen the paper is quite blank malise feeling his head full of smoke he drops paper and pen and crossing to the room on the left goes in clare reenters with a small leather box she puts it down on her typing table as malise returns followed by mrs miler wearing her hat and carrying his overcoat mrs miler put your coat on its a bitter wind he puts on the coat clare where are you going malise to the watchfire the door closes behind him and mrs miler goes up to

prepared to receive you again the proposal forgive my saying so remarkably quixotic is made to save the scandal to his family and your own it binds you to nothing but the abandonment of your present

says mournfully goodbye my child if you can then goes clare almost in a whisper repeats the words love you said at the sound of a latchkey she runs as if to escape into the bedroom but changes her mind and stands blotted against the curtain of the door malise enters for a moment he does not see her standing there against the curtain that is much the same colour as her dress his face is that of a man in the grip of a rage that he feels to be impotent then seeing her he pulls himself together walks to his armchair and sits down there in his hat and coat clare well the watchfire you may as well tell me malise nothing to tell you child at that touch of tenderness she goes up to his chair and kneels down beside it mechanically malise takes off his hat clare then you are to lose that too

fine he puts his hat on and rises thats the last groan they get from me class are you going out again he nods where malise blackberrying our trains not till six he goes into the bedroom clare gets up and stands by the fire looking round in a dazed way she puts her hand up and mechanically gathers together the violets in the little vase suddenly she twists them to a buttonhole and sinks down into the armchair which he must pass there she sits the violets in her hand malise comes out and crosses towards the outer door she puts the violets up to him he stares at them shrugs his shoulders and passes on for just a moment clare sits motionless clare quietly give me a kiss he turns and kisses her but his lips after that kiss have the furtive bitterness one sees on the lips of those who have done what does not suit their mood he goes out she is left motionless by the armchair her throat working then feverishly she goes to the little table seizes a sheet of paper and writes looking up suddenly she sees that mrs miler has let herself in with her latchkey mrs miler ive settled the baker the milk the washin an the groceries this eres whats left she counts down a fivepound note four

mrs miler has come back into the room clare still stands there mrs miler pointing to the typewriter dyou want this ere too clare yes mrs miler carries it out then from the doorway gazing at clare taking her last look she sobs suddenly at sound of that sob clare throws up her head clare dont its all right goodbye she walks out and away not looking back mrs miler chokes her sobbing into the black stuff of her thick old jacket curtain act iv suppertime in a small room at the gascony on derby day through the windows of a broad corridor out of which the door opens is seen the dark blue of a

peaches two bottles of champagne in ice pails and a small barrel of oysters in a gilded tub arnaud the waiter slim dark quick his face seamed with a quiet soft irony is opening oysters and listening to the robust joy of a distant supperparty where a man is playing the last bars of do ye ken john peel on a horn as the sound dies away he murmurs tres joli and opens another oyster two ladies with bare shoulders and large hats pass down the corridor their talk is faintly wafted in well i never like derby night the boys do get so bobbish that horn vulgar i call it arnauds eyebrows rise the corners of his mouth droop a lady with bare shoulders and crimson roses in her hair comes along the corridor and stops for a second at the window for a man to join her they come through into the room arnaud has sprung to attention but with lets go in here shall we they pass through into the further room the manager a gentleman with neat moustaches and buttoned into a frockcoat has appeared brisk

lord arnaud arnaud is already at the table between screen and palm and there ensconced the couple take their seats seeing them safely landed the manager brisk and noiseless moves away in the corridor a lady in black with a cloak falling open seems uncertain whether to come in she advances into the doorway it is clare arnaud pointing to the other table as he flies with dishes nice table madame clare moves to the corner of it an artist in observation of his clients arnaud takes in her face very pale under her wavy simplydressed hair shadowy beneath the eyes not powdered her lips not reddened without a single ornament takes in her black dress finely cut her arms and neck beautifully white and at her breast three gardenias and as he nears her she lifts her eyes it is very much the look of something lost appealing for guidance arnaud madame is waiting for some one she shakes her head then madame will be veree well here veree well i take madames cloak he takes the cloak gently and lays it on the back of the chair fronting the room that she may put it round her when she wishes she sits down languid voice from the corner waiter arnaud milord languid voice the roederer arnaud at once milord clare sits tracing a pattern with her finger on the cloth her eyes lowered once she raises them and follows arnauds dark rapid figure arnaud returning madame feels the eat he scans her with increased curiosity you wish something madame clare again giving him that look must i order arnaud non madame it is not necessary a glass of water he pours it out i have not the pleasure of knowing madames face clare faintly smiling no arnaud madame will find it veree good ere veree quiet languid voice waiter arnaud pardon he goes the barenecked ladies with large hats again pass down the corridor outside and again their voices are wafted in tottie not she oh my goodness she has got a pride on her bobbiell never stick it look here dear galvanized by those sounds clare has caught her cloak and halfrisen they die away and she subsides arnaud back at her table with a quaint shrug towards the corridor it is not rowdy here madame as a rule not as in some places tonight a little noise madame is fond of flowers he whisks out and returns almost at once with a bowl of carnations from some table in the next room these smell good clare you are very kind arnaud with courtesy not at all madame a pleasure he bows a young man tall thin hard straight with closecropped sandyish hair and moustache a face tanned very red and one of those small long lean heads that only grow in britain clad in a thin dark overcoat thrown open an opera hat pushed back a white waistcoat round his lean middle he comes in from the corridor he looks round glances at clare passes her table towards the further room stops in the doorway and looks back at her her eyes have just been lifted and are at once cast down again the young man wavers catches arnauds eye jerks his head to summon him and passes into the further room arnaud takes up the vase that has been superseded and follows him out and clare sits alone in silence broken by the murmurs of the languid lord and his partner behind the screen she is breathing as if she had been running hard she lifts her eyes the tall young man divested of hat and coat is standing by her table holding out his hand with a sort of bashful hardiness young man how dyou do didnt recognize you at first so sorry awfully rude of me clares eyes seem to fly from him to appeal to him to resign herself all at once something in the young man responds he drops his hand clare faintly how dyou do young man stammering you you been down there today clare where young man with a smile the derby what dont you generally go down he touches the other chair may i clare almost

clare it doesnt matter young man respectfully of course if i if you were waiting for anybody or anything i he half rises clare its all right thank you the young man sits down again uncomfortable nonplussed there is silence broken by the inaudible words of the languid lord and the distant merriment of the supperparty arnaud brings the plovers eggs young man the wine quick arnaud at once sare young man abruptly dont you ever go racing then clare no arnaud pours out champagne young man i remember awfully well my first day it was pretty thick lost every blessed bob and my watch and chain

things having beginnings did you mean anything clare nods young man what dyou mean its really the first clare nods the champagne has flicked her courage young man by george he leans back ive often wondered arnaud again filling the glasses monsieur finds young man abruptly its all right he drains his glass then sits bolt upright chivalry and the camaraderie of class have begun to stir in him

glass le vin est tire il faut le boire she drinks the french words which he does not too well understand completing his conviction that she is a lady he remains quite silent frowning as clare held up her glass two gentlemen have entered the first is blond of good height and a comely insolence his crisp fair hair and fair brushedup moustache are just going grey an eyeglass is fixed in one of two eyes that lord it over every woman they see his face is broad and coloured with air and wine his companion is a tall thin dark bird of the night with sly roving eyes and hollow cheeks they stand looking round then pass into the further room but in passing they have stared unreservedly at clare young man seeing her wince look here im afraid you must feel me rather a brute you know clare no i dont really young man are you absolute stoney clare nods but looking at her frock and cloak youre so awfully well clare i had the sense to keep them young man more and more disturbed i say you know i

nothing she leans her bare elbows on the table and her face on her hands clare first of june this day last year i broke covert ive been running ever since young man i dont understand a bit you must have had a a some one but there is such a change in her face such rigidity of her whole body that he stops and averts his eyes when he looks again she is drinking she puts the glass down and gives a little laugh young man with a sort of awe anyway it must have been like riding at a pretty stiff fence for you to come here tonight clare yes whats the other side the young man puts out his hand and touches her arm it is meant for sympathy but she takes it for attraction clare shaking her head not yet please im enjoying this may i have a cigarette he takes out his case and gives her one clare letting the smoke slowly forth yes im enjoying it had a pretty poor time lately not enough to eat sometimes young man not really how damnable i say do have something more substantial clare gives a sudden gasp as if going off into hysterical laughter but she stifles it and shakes her head young man a peach arnaud brings peaches to the table clare smiling thank you he fills their glasses and retreats clare raising her glass eat and drink for tomorrow we listen from the supperparty comes the sound of an abortive chorus with a hey ho chivy hark forrard hark forrard tantivy jarring out into a discordant whoop it sinks clare this day a stag must die jolly old song young man rowdy lot suddenly i say i admire your pluck clare shaking her head havent kept my end up lots of women do you see

young man turns to look for the waiter but arnaud is not in the room he gets up young man feverishly d n that waiter wait half a minute if you dont mind while i pay the bill as he goes out into the corridor the two gentlemen reappear clare is sitting motionless looking straight before her dark one a fiver you dont get her to blond one done he advances to her table with his inimitable insolence and taking the cigar from his mouth bends his stare on her and says charmed to see you lookin so well will you have supper with me here tomorrow night startled out of her reverie clare looks up she sees those eyes she sees beyond him the eyes of his companionsly malevolent amusedwatching and she just sits gazing without a word at that regard so clear the blond one does not wince but rather suddenly he says thats arranged then halfpast eleven so good of you goodnight he replaces his cigar and strolls back to his companion and in a low voice says pay up then at a languid hullo charles they turn to greet the two in their nook behind the screen clare has not moved nor changed the direction of her gaze suddenly she thrusts her hand into the pocket of the cloak that hangs behind her and brings out the little blue bottle which six months ago she took from malise she pulls out the cork and pours the whole contents into her champagne she lifts the glass holds it before her smiling as if to call a toast then puts it to her lips and drinks still smiling she sets the empty glass down and lays the gardenia flowers against her face slowly she droops back in her chair the drowsy smile still on her lips the gardenias drop into her lap her arms relax her head falls forward on her breast and the voices behind the screen talk on and the sounds of joy from the supperparty wax and wane the waiter arnaud returning from the corridor passes to his servicetable with a tall beribboned basket of fruit putting it down he goes towards the table behind the screen and sees he runs up to clare arnaud madame madame he listens for her breathing then suddenly catching sight of the little bottle smells at it bon dieu at that queer sound they come from behind the screen all four and look the dark night bird says hallo fainted arnaud holds out the bottle languid lord taking it and smelling good god the woman bends over clare and lifts her hands arnaud rushes to his servicetable and speaks into his tube arnaud the boss quick looking up he sees the young man returning monsieur elle a fui elle est morte languid lord to the young man standing there aghast whats this friend of yours young man my god she was a lady thats all i know about her languid lord a lady the blond and dark gentlemen have slipped from the room and out of the supperpartys distant laughter comes suddenly a long shrill gone away and the sound of the horn playing the seven last notes of the old song this day a stag must die from the last note of all the sound flies up to an octave higher sweet and thin like a spirit passing till it is drowned once more in laughter the young man has covered his eyes with his hands arnaud is crossing himself fervently the languid lord stands gazing with one of the dropped gardenias twisted in his fingers and the woman bending over clare kisses her forehead curtain end of this project gutenberg etext of the fugitive play by john galsworthy the pigeon a fantasy

to shake his head and mutter as he moves towards the fire wellwyn bad lot low type no backbone no stability there comes a fluttering knock on the outer door as the sound slowly enters his consciousness he begins to wince as though he knew but would not admit its significance then he sits down covering his ears the knocking does not cease wellwyn drops first one then both hands rises and begins to sidle towards the door the knocking becomes louder wellwyn ah dear tt tt tt after a look in the direction of anns disappearance he opens the street door a very little way by the light of

monsieur pardon wellwyn recoils spasmodically a figure moves from the lamppost to the doorway he is seen to be young and to have ragged clothes he speaks again you do not remember me monsieur my name

dirty wing card as inch by inch he has advanced into the doorway the light from within falls on him a tall gaunt young pagan with fair hair and reddish golden stubble of beard a long ironical nose a little to one side and large grey rather prominent eyes there is a certain grace in his figure and movements his clothes are nearly dropping off him wellwyn yielding to a pleasant memory ah yes by the fountain i was sitting there and you came and ate a roll and drank the water ferrand with faint eagerness my breakfast i was in poverty veree bad off you gave me ten francs i thought i had a little

wellwyn rather handing his tobacco pouch roll yourself one ferrand rapidly rolling a cigarette if i had not found you monsieur i would have been a little hole in the river tonight i was so discouraged he inhales and puffs a long luxurious whif of smoke very bitterly life he disperses the puff of smoke with his finger and stares before him and to think that in a few minutes he will be born monsieur he gazes intently at wellwyn the world would reproach you for your goodness to me wellwyn looking uneasily at the door into the house you think so ah ferrand monsieur if he himself were on earth now there would be a little heap of gentlemen writing to the journals every day to call him sloppee sentimentalist and what is veree funny these gentlemen they would all be most strong christians he regards wellwyn deeply but that will not trouble you monsieur i saw well from the first that you are no christian you have so kind a face wellwyn oh indeed ferrand you have not enough the pharisee in

door is still open can you make these do for the moment ferrand je vous remercie monsieur pointing to the screen may i retire wellwyn yes yes ferrand goes behind the screen wellwyn closes the door into the house then goes to the window to draw the curtains he suddenly recoils and stands petrified with doubt wellwyn good lord there is the sound of tapping on glass against the windowpane is pressed the face of a man wellwyn motions to him to go away he does not go but continues tapping wellwyn opens the door there enters a square old man with a red pendulous jawed shaking face under a

you wont want this will you ferrand merci monsieur wellwyn switches off the light ferrand bon soir monsieur wellwyn the devil er goodnight he hesitates rumples his hair and passes rather suddenly away ferrand to himself poor pigeon looking long at old timson espece de type anglais he sits down in the firelight curls up a foot on his knee and taking out a knife rips the stitching of a turnedup end of trouser pinches the cloth double and puts in the preliminary stitch of a new hem all with the swiftness of one well accustomed then as if hearing a sound behind him he gets up quickly and slips behind the screen mrs megan attracted by the cessation of voices has opened the door and is creeping from the models room towards the fire she has almost reached it before she takes in the torpid crimson figure of old timson she halts and puts her hand to her chest a queer figure in the firelight garbed in the canarycoloured bath gown and rabbits wool slippers her black matted hair straggling down on her neck having quite digested the fact that the old man is in a sort of stupor mrs megan goes close to the fire and sits on the little stool smiling sideways at old timson ferrand coming quietly up behind examines her from above drooping his long nose as if enquiring with it as to her condition in life then he steps back a yard or two ferrand gently pardon mamoiselle mrs megan springing to her feet oh ferrand all right all right we are brave gents timson faintly roused old up there ferrand trust in me mamoiselle mrs megan responds by drawing away ferrand gently we must be

glass which falls with a crash mrs megan let go my hand please ferrand relinquishing it and staring into the fore gravely there is one thing i have never done urt a woman that is hardly in my character then drawing a little closer he looks into her face tell me mamoiselle what is it you think of all day long mrs megan i dunno lots i thinks of ferrand shall i tell you her eyes remain fixed on his the strangeness of him preventing her from telling him to get along he goes on in his ironic voice it is of the streets the lights the faces it is of all which moves and is warm it is of colour it is he brings his face quite close to hers of love that is for you what the road is for me that is for you what the rum is for that old he jerks his thumb back at timson then bending swiftly forward to the girl see i kiss you ah he draws her forward off the stool there is a little struggle then she resigns her lips the little stool overturned falls with a clatter they spring up and move apart the door opens and ann enters from the house in a blue dressinggown with her hair loose and a candle held high above her head taking in the strange halfcircle round the stove she recoils then standing her ground calls in a voice sharpened by fright daddy daddy timson stirring uneasily and struggling to his feet all right im comin ferrand have no fear madame in the silence that follows a clock begins loudly striking twelve ann remains as if carved in atone her eyes fastened on the strangers there is the sound of someone falling downstairs and wellwyn appears also holding a candle above his head ann look wellwyn yes yes my dear it it happened ann with a sort of groan oh daddy in the renewed silence the church clock ceases to chime ferrand softly in his ironic voice he is come monsieur appy christmas bon noel there is a sudden chime of bells the stage is blotted dark curtain act ii it is four oclock in the afternoon of new years day on the raised dais mrs megan is standing in her rags with bare feet and ankles her dark hair as if blown about her lips parted holding out a dishevelled bunch of violets before his easel wellwyn is painting her behind him at a table between the cupboard and the door to the models room timson is washing brushes with the movements of one employed upon relief works the samovar is hissing on the table by the stove the tea things are set out wellwyn open your mouth mrs megan opens her mouth ann in hat and coat entering from the house daddy wellwyn goes to her and released from restraint mrs megan looks round at timson and grimaces wellwyn well my dear they speak in low voices ann holding out a note this note from canon bentley hes going to bring her husband here this afternoon she looks at mrs megan wellwyn oh he also looks at mrs megan ann and i

and turns a painters glance towards the skylight dash lights gone off you get child dont tempt me mrs megan descends passing towards the door of the models room she stops and stealthily looks at the picture timson ah would yer wellwyn wheeling round want to have a look well come on he takes her by the arm and they stand before the canvas after a stolid moment she giggles wellwyn oh you think so

get your feet on mrs megan youve give me arf a crown wellwyn cut away now mrs megan smiling at the coin goes towards the models room she looks back at wellwyn as if to draw his eyes to her but he is gazing at the picture then catching old timsons sour glance she grimaces at him kicking up her feet with a little squeal but when wellwyn turns to the sound she is demurely passing through the doorway timson in his voice of dubious sobriety ive finished these yer brushes sir its not a mans work ive been thinkin if youd keep an orse i could give yer satisfaction wellwyn would the horse timson timson looking him up and down i knows of one that would just suit yer reel orse youd like im wellwyn shaking his head afraid not timson awfully sorry though to have nothing better for you than this at

a man as always beared inspection wellwyn with a welldirected smile so i see timson curving himself round the bottle its not for me to say nothing but i can tell a genleman as quick as ever i can tell an orse wellwyn painting i find it safest to assume that every man is a gentleman and every woman a lady saves no end of selfcontempt give me the little brush timson handing him the brush after a considerable introspective pause would yer like me to stay and wash it for yer again with great resolution i will ill do it for you never grudged workin for a genleman wellwyn with sincerity thank you

certainly sir i quite understand im not that sort as i think ive proved to yer comin here regular day after day all the week theres one thing i ought to warn you perhaps i might ave to give this job up any day he makes a faint demonstration with the little brush then puts it absentmindedly into his pocket wellwyn gravely id never stand in the way of your bettering yourself timson and by the way my daughter spoke to a friend about you today i think something may come of it timson oh oh she did well it might do me a bit o good he makes for the outer door but stops that foreigner e sticks in my gizzard its not as if there wasnt plenty o pigeons for im to pluck in is own gawdforsaken country reglar jay thats what i calls im i could tell yer something he has opened the door and suddenly sees that ferrand himself is standing there sticking out his lower lip timson gives a roll of his jaw and lurches forth into the street owing to a slight miscalculation his face and raised arms are plainly visible through the window as he fortifies himself from his battle against the cold ferrand having closed the door stands with his thumb acting as pointer towards this spectacle he is now remarkably dressed in an artists squashy green hat a frock coat too small for him a bright blue tie of knitted silk the grey trousers that were torn wellworn brown boots and a tan waistcoat wellwyn what luck today ferrand with a shrug again i have beaten all london monsieur not one bite contemplating himself i think perhaps that for the bourgeoisie there is a little too much colour in my costume wellwyn contemplating him lets see i believe ive an old top hat somewhere ferrand ah monsieur merci but that i could not it is scarcely in my character wellwyn true ferrand i have been to merchants of wine of tabac to hotels to leicester square i have been to a society for spreading christian knowledge i thought there i would have a chance perhaps as interpreter toujours meme chose we regret we have no situation for you same thing everywhere it seems there is nothing doing in this town wellwyn ive noticed there never is ferrand i was thinking monsieur that in aviation there might be a career for me but it seems one must be trained wellwyn afraid so ferrand ferrand approaching the picture ah you are always working at this you will have something of very good there monsieur you wish to fix the type of wild savage existing ever amongst our high civilisation cest tres chic ca wellwyn manifests the quiet delight of an english artist actually understood in the figures of these good citizens to whom she offers her flower you would give the idea of all the cage doors open to catch and make tame the wild bird that will surely die within tres gentil believe me monsieur you have there the greatest comedy of life how anxious are the tame birds to do the wild birds good his voice changes for the wild birds it is not funny there is in some human souls monsieur what cannot be made tame wellwyn i believe you ferrand the face of a young man appears at the window unseen suddenly ann opens the door leading to the house ann daddy i want you wellwyn to ferrand excuse me a minute he goes to his daughter and they pass out ferrand remains at the picture mrs megan dressed in some of anns discarded garments has come out of the models room she steals up behind ferrand like a cat reaches an arm up and curls it round his mouth he turns and tries to seize her she disingenuously slips away he follows the chase circles the tea table he catches her lifts her up swings round with her so that her feet fly out kisses her bentback face and sets her down she stands there smiling the face at the window darkens ferrand la valse he takes her with both hands by the waist she puts her hands against his shoulders to push him of and suddenly they are whirling as they whirl they bob together once or twice and kiss then with a warning motion towards the door she wrenches herself free and stops beside the picture trying desperately to appear demure wellwyn and ann have entered the face has vanished ferrand pointing to the picture one does not comprehend all this monsieur without well studying i was in train to interpret for mamoiselle the chiaroscuro wellwyn with a queer look dont take it too seriously ferrand ferrand it is a masterpiece wellwyn my daughters just spoken to a friend professor calway hed like to meet you could you come back a little later ferrand certainly mamoiselle that will be an opening for me i trust he goes to the street door ann paying no attention

whistle ann whats the matter wellwyn didnt you say you spoke to sir thomas too suppose he comes in while the professors here theyre cat and dog ann blankly oh as wellwyn strikes a match the samovar is

fraud wellwyn in and on mark my words hell restore the bottles bertley but my dear wellwyn that is stealing wellwyn we all have our discrepancies vicar ann daddy discrepancies wellwyn well ann my

the professors knock while ann sits down to make tea he goes to the door and opens it there dressed in an ulster stands a thin cleanshaved man with a little hollow sucked into either cheek who taking off a grey squash hat discloses a majestically bald forehead which completely dominates all that comes below it wellwyn come in professor so awfully good of you you know canon bentley i think calway

wish me to ann rather its quite safe he cant see you calway but he might come out ann puts her back against the door calway mounts the chair dubiously and raises his head cautiously bending it more and more downwards ann well calway he appears to be sitting on the floor wellwyn yes thats all right bertley covers his lips calway to ann descending by the look of his face as far as one can see it i

thomas calway sir thomas hoxton wellwyn nodding awfully sorry professor you see we calway not at all only i must decline to be involved in argument with him please bertley he has experience we might

resolute hoxton afraid i didnt make myself heard wellwyn so good of you to come sir thomas canon bertley they greet professor calway you know i think hoxton ominously i do they almost greet an awkward pause ann blurting it out that old cabman i told you ofs been drinking fathers rum bertley we were just discussing whats to be done with him sir thomas one wants to do the very best of course the question of reform is always delicate calway i beg your pardon there is no question here hoxton abruptly oh is he in the house ann in there hoxton works for you eh wellwyn er yes hoxton lets have a

of disgusting to be spied at ann ann you cant daddy hes drunk hoxton never mind miss wellwyn hundreds of these fellows before me in my time at calway the only thing is a sharp lesson calway i disagree ive seen the man what he requires is steady control and the bobbins treatment wellwyn approaches them with fearful interest hoxton not a bit of it he wants one for his knob brace em up its the only thing bertley personally i think that if he were spoken to seriously calway i cannot walk arm in arm with a crab hoxton approaching calway i beg your pardon calway moving back a little youre moving backwards sir thomas ive told you before convinced reactionaryism in these days there comes a single knock on the street door bertley looking at his watch dyou know im rather afraid this may be our young husband wellwyn i told him halfpast four wellwyn oh ah yes going towards the two reformers shall we go into the house professor and settle the question quietly while the vicar sees a young man calway pale with uncompleted statement and gravitating insensibly in the direction indicated the merest sense of continuity a simple instinct for order hoxton following the only way to get order sir is to bring the disorderly up with a round turn calway turns to him in the doorway you people without practical experience calway if youll listen to me a minute hoxton i can show you in a mo they vanish through the door wellwyn i was afraid of it bertley the two points of view pleasant to see such keenness i may want you wellwyn and ann perhaps had better not be present wellwyn relieved quite

presence they all turn timson waking up and looking round him well praps id better go assisted by wellwyn he lurches gingerly off the dais towards the door which wellwyn holds open for him timson mechanically where to sir receiving no answer he passes out touching his hat and the door is closed wellwyn ann ann goes back whence she came bertley steadily regarding mrs megan who has put her arm up in front of her face beckons to ferrand and the young man comes gravely forward bertley young people this is very dreadful mrs megan lowers her arm a little and looks at him over it very sad mrs

little bow any reason that you wish monsieur i will do my possible mrs megan i could get an unfurnished room if she slides her eyes round at wellwyn i ad the money to furnish it bertley but suppose i can induce your husband to forgive you and take you back mrs megan shaking her head ed it me bertley i said to forgive mrs megan that wouldnt make no difference with a flash at bertley an i aint forgiven him bertley that is sinful mrs megan im a catholic bertley my good child what difference does that make ferrand monsieur if i might interpret for her bertley silences him with a gesture mrs megan sliding her eyes towards wellwyn if i ad the money to buy some fresh stock bertley yes yes never mind the money what i want to find in you both is repentance mrs megan with a flash up at him i cant get me livin off of repentin bertley now now never say what you know to be wrong ferrand monsieur her soul is very simple bertley severely i do not know sir that we shall get any great assistance

the blame it is all mine ann entering suddenly from the house daddy theyre having an awful the voices of professor calway and sir thomas hoxton are distinctly heard calway the question is a much wider one sir thomas hoxton as wide as you like youll never wellwyn pushes ann back into the house and closes the door behind her the voices are still faintly heard arguing on the threshold bertley let me go in here a minute wellyn i must finish speaking to her he motions mrs megan towards the models room we cant leave the matter thus ferrand suavely do you desire my company monsieur bertley with a prohibitive gesture of his hand shepherds the reluctant mrs megan into the models room wellwyn sorrowfully you shouldnt have done this ferrand it wasnt the square thing ferrand with dignity monsieur i feel that i am in the wrong it was stronger than me as he speaks sir thomas hoxton and professor calway enter from the house in the dim light and the full cry of argument they do not notice the figures at the fire sir thomas hoxton leads towards the street door hoxton no sir i repeat if the country once commits itself to your views of reform its as good as doomed calway i seem to have heard that before sir thomas and let me say at once that your hittymissy cartload of bricks regime hoxton is a deuced sight better sir than your grandmotherly methods what the old fellow wants is a shock with all this socialistic mollycoddling youre losing sight of the individual calway swiftly you sir with your devil take the hindmost have never even seen him sir thomas hoxton throwing back a gesture of disgust steps out into the night and falls heavily professor calway hastening to his rescue falls more heavily still timson momentarily roused from slumber on the doorstep sits up hoxton struggling to his knees damnation calway sitting how simultaneous wellwyn and ferrand approach hastily ferrand pointing to timson monsieur it was true it seems they had lost sight of the individual a policeman has appeared under the street lamp he picks up hoxtons hat constable anything wrong sir hoxton recovering his feet wrong great scott constable why do you let things lie about in the street like this look here wellyn they all scrutinize timson wellwyn its only the old fellow whose reform you were discussing hoxton how did he come here constable drunk sir ascertaining timson to be in the street just off the premises by good luck come along father timson assisted to his feetdrowsily certnly by no means take my arm they move from the doorway hoxton and calway reenter and go towards the fire ann entering from the house whats happened calway might we have a brush hoxton testily let it dry he moves to the fire and stands before it professor calway following stands a little behind him ann returning begins to brush the professors sleeve wellwyn turning from the door where he has stood looking after the receding timson poor old timson ferrand softly must be philosopher monsieur they will but run him in a little from the models room mrs megan has come out shepherded by canon bertley bertley lets see your christian name is mrs megan guinevere bertley oh ah ah ann take gui take our little friend into the study a minute i am going to put her into service we shall make a new woman of her yet ann handing canon bertley the brush and turning to mrs megan come on she leads into the house and mrs megan follows stolidly bertley brushing calways back have you fallen calway yes bertley dear me how was that hoxton that old ruffian drunk on the doorstep hope theyll give him a sharp dose these ragtags he looks round and his angry eyes light by chance on ferrand ferrand with his eyes on hoxton softly monsieur something tells me it is time i took the road again wellwyn fumbling out a sovereign take this then ferrand refusing the coin non monsieur to abuse ospitality is not in my character bertley we must not despair of anyone hoxton who talked of despairing treat him as i say and youll see calway the interest of the state hoxton the interest of the individual citizen sir bertley come a little of both a little of both they resume their brushing ferrand you are now debarrassed of us three monsieur i leave you instead these sirs he points au revoir monsieur motioning towards the fire appy new year he slips quietly out wellwyn turning contemplates the three reformers they are all now brushing away scratching each others backs and gravely hissing as he approaches them they speak with a certain unanimity hoxton my theory calway my theory bertley my theory they stop surprised wellwyn makes a gesture of discomfort as they speak again with still more unanimity hoxton my calway my bertley my they stop in greater surprise the stage is blotted dark curtain act iii it is the first of april a white spring day of gleams and driving showers the street door of wellwyns studio stands wide open and past it in the street the wind is whirling bits of straw and paper bags through the door can be seen the butt end of a stationary furniture van with its flap let down to this van three humblemen in shirt sleeves and aprons are carrying out the contents of the studio the hissing samovar the teapot the sugar and the nearly empty decanter of rum stand on the low round table in the fastbeinggutted room wellwyn in his ulster and soft hat is squatting on the little stool in front of the blazing fire staring into it and smoking a handmade cigarette he has a moulting air behind him the humblemen pass embracing busts and other articles of vertu chief hman stopping and standing in the attitude of expectation weve about pinched this little lot sir shall we take the reservoir he indicates the samovar wellwyn ah abstractedly feeling in his pockets and finding coins thanks thanks heavy work im afraid hman receiving the coins a little surprised and a good deal pleased thankee sir much obliged im sure well ave to come back for this he gives the dais a vigorous push with his foot not a fixture as i understand perhaps youd like us to leave these ere for a bit he indicates the tea things wellwyn ah do the humblemen go out there is the sound of horses being started and the butt end of the van disappears wellwyn stays on his stool smoking and brooding over the fare the open doorway is darkened by a figure canon bertley is standing there bertley wellwyn wellwyn turns and rises its ages since i saw you no idea you were moving this is very dreadful wellwyn yes ann found this too exposed that tall house in flight street were going there seventh floor bertley lift wellwyn shakes his head bertley dear me no lift fine view no doubt wellwyn nods youll be greatly missed wellwyn so ann thinks vicar whats become of that little flowerseller i was painting at christmas you took her into service bertley not we exactly some dear friends of ours painful subject wellwyn oh bertley yes she got the footman into trouble wellwyn did she now bertley disappointing i consulted with calway and he advised me to try a certain institution we got her safely in excellent place but dyou know she broke out three weeks ago and since ive heard he holds his hands up hopeless im afraid quite wellwyn i thought i saw her last night you cant tell me her address i suppose bertley shaking his head the husband too has quite passed out of my ken he betted on horses you remember im sometimes tempted to believe theres nothing for some of these poor folk but to pray for death ann has entered from the house her hair hangs from under a knitted cap she wears a white wool jersey and a loose silk scarf bertley ah ann i was telling your father of that poor little mrs megan ann is she dead bertley worse i fear by the way what became of her accomplice ann we havent seen him since she looks searchingly at wellwyn at least have you daddy wellwyn rather hurt no my dear i have not bertley and the old gentleman who drank the rum ann he got fourteen days it was the fifth time bertley dear me ann when he came out he got more drunk than ever rather a score for professor calway wasnt it bertley i remember he and sir thomas took a kindly interest in the old fellow ann yes they fell over him the professor got him into an institution bertley indeed ann he was perfectly sober all the time he was there wellwyn my dear they only allow them milk ann well anyway he was reformed wellwyn yeyes ann terribly daddy youve been seeing him wellwyn with dignity my dear i have not ann how do you know then wellwyn came across sir thomas on the embankment yesterday told me old timso had been had up again for sitting down in front of a brewers dray ann why wellwyn well you see as soon as he came out of the what dyou call em he got drunk for a week and it left him in low spirits bertley do you mean he deliberately sat down with the intention of er wellwyn said he was tired of life but they didnt believe him ann rather a score for sir thomas i suppose hed told the professor what did he say wellwyn well the professor said with a quick glance at bertley he felt there was nothing for some of these poor devils but a lethal chamber bertley shocked did he really he has not yet caught wellwyn s glance wellwyn and sir thomas agreed historic occasion and you vicar hm bertley winces ann to herself well there isnt bertley and yet some good in the old fellow no doubt if one could put ones finger on it preparing to go youll let us know then when youre settled what was the address wellwyn takes out and hands him a card ah yes goodbye ann goodbye wellyn the wind blows his hat along the street what a wind he goes pursuing ann who has eyed the card askance daddy have you told those other two where were going wellwyn which other two my dear ann the professor and sir thomas wellwyn well ann naturally i ann jumping on to the dais with disgust oh dear when im trying to get you away from all this atmosphere i dont so much mind the vicar knowing because hes got a weak heart she jumps off again wellwyn to himself seventh floor i felt there was something ann preparing to go im going round now but you must stay here till the van comes back and dont forget you tipped the men after the first load wellwyn oh yes yes uneasily good sorts they look those fellows ann scrutinising him what have you done wellwyn nothing my dear really ann what wellwyn i i rather think i may have tipped them twice ann drily daddy if it is the first of april its not necessary to make a fool of oneself thats the last time you ever do these ridiculous things wellwyn eyes her askance im going to see that you spend your money on yourself you neednt look at me like that i mean to as soon as ive got you away from here and all these wellwyn dont rub it in ann ann giving him a sudden hug then going to the door with a sort of triumph deeds not words daddy she goes out and the wind catching her scarf blows it out beneath her firm young chin wellwyn returning to the fire stands brooding and gazing at his extinct cigarette wellwyn to himself bad lot low type no method no theory in the open doorway appear ferrand and mrs megan they stand unseen looking at him ferrand is more ragged if possible than on christmas eve his chin and cheeks are clothed in a reddish golden beard mrs megans dress is not so woebegone but her face is white her eyes darkcircled they whisper she slips back into the shadow of the doorway wellwyn turns at the sound and stares at ferrand in amazement ferrand advancing enchanted to see you monsieur he looks round the empty room you are leaving wellwyn nodding then taking the young mans hand how goes it ferrand displaying himself simply as you see monsieur i have done of my best it still flies from me wellwyn sadly as if against his will ferrand it will always fly the young foreigner shivers suddenly from head to foot then controls himself with a great effort ferrand dont say that monsieur it is too much the echo of my heart wellwyn forgive me i didnt mean to pain you ferrand drawing nearer the fire that old cabby monsieur you remember they tell me he nearly succeeded to gain happiness the other day wellwyn nods ferrand and those sirs so interested in him with their theories he has worn them out wellwyn nods that goes without saying and now they wish for him the lethal chamber wellwyn startled how did you know that there is silence ferrand staring into the fire monsieur while i was on the road this time i fell ill of a fever it seemed to me in my illness that i saw the truth how i was wasting in this world i would never be good for any one nor any one for me all would go by and i never of it fame and fortune and peace even the necessities of life ever mocking me he draws closer to the fire spreading his fingers to the flame and while he is speaking through the doorway mrs megan creeps in to listen ferrand speaking on into the fire and i saw monsieur so plain that i should be vagabond all my days and my days short i dying in the end the death of a dog i saw it all in my fever clear as that flame there was nothing for us others but the herb of death wellwyn takes his arm and presses it and so monsieur i wished to die i told no one of my fever i lay out on the ground it was verree cold but they would not let me die on the roads of their parishes they took me to an institution monsieur i looked in their eyes while i lay there and i saw more clear than the blue heaven that they thought it best that i should die although they would not let me then monsieur naturally my spirit rose and i said so much the worse for you i will live a little more one is made like that life is sweet monsieur wellwyn yes ferrand life is sweet ferrand that little girl you had here monsieur wellwyn nods in her too there is something of wildsavage she must have joy of life i have seen her since i came back she has embraced the life of joy it is not quite the same thing he lowers his voice she is lost monsieur as a stone that sinks in water i can see if she cannot as wellwyn makes a movement of distress oh i am not to blame for that monsieur it had well begun before i knew her wellwyn yes yes i was afraid of it at the time mrs megan turns silently and slips away feerrand i do my best for her monsieur but look at me besides i am not good for her it is not good for simple souls to be with those who see things clear for the great part of mankind to see anything is fatal wellwyn even for you it seems ferrand no monsieur to be so near to death has done me good i shall not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave since i saw you monsieur i have been in three institutions they are palaces one may eat upon the floor though it is true for kings they eat too much of skilly there one little thing they lack those palaces it is understanding of the uman heart in them tame birds pluck wild birds naked wellwyn they mean well ferrand ah monsieur i am loafer waster what you like for all that bitterly poverty is my only crime if i were rich should i not be simply veree original ighly respected with soul above commerce travelling to see the world and that young girl would she not be that charming ladee veree chic you know and the old tims good oldfashioned gentleman drinking his liquor well eh bien what are we now dark beasts despised by all that is life monsieur he stares into the fire wellwyn were our own enemies ferrand i can afford it you cant quite true ferrand earnestly monsieur do you know this you are the sole being that can do us good we hopeless ones wellwyn shaking his head not a bit of it im hopeless too ferrand eagerly monsieur it is just that you understand when we are with you we feel something here he touches his heart if i had one prayer to make it would be good god give me to understand those sirs with their theories they can clean our skins and chain our abits that soothes for them the aesthetic sense it gives them too their good little importance but our spirits they cannot touch for they nevare understand without that monsieur all is dry as a parched skin of orange wellwyn dont be so bitter think of all the work they do ferrand monsieur of their industry i say nothing they do a good work while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame old and the good unfortunate deserving above all to the little children but monsieur when all is done there are always us hopeless ones what can they do with me monsieur with that girl or with that old man ah monsieur we too ave our qualities we others it wants you courage to undertake a career like mine or like that young girls we wild ones we know a thousand times more of life than ever will those sirs they waste their time trying to make rooks white be kind to us if you will or let us alone like mees ann but do not try to change our skins leave us to live or leave us to die when we like in the free air if you do not wish of us you have but to shut your pockets and your doors we shall die the faster wellwyn with agitation but that you know we cant do now can we ferrand if you cannot how is it our fault the harm we do to others is it so much if i am criminal dangerous shut me up i would not pity myself nevare but we in whom something moves like that flame monsieur that cannot keep still we others we are not many that must have motion in our lives do not let them make us prisoners with their theories because we are not like them it is life itself they would enclose he draws up his tattered figure then bending over the fire again i ask your pardon i am talking if i could smoke monsieur wellwyn hands him a tobacco pouch and he rolls a cigarette with his yellowstained fingers ferrand the good god made me so that i would rather walk a whole month of nights hungry with the stars than sit one single day making round business on an office stool it is not to my advantage i cannot help it that i am a vagabond what would you have it is stronger than me he looks suddenly at wellwyn monsieur i say to you things i have never said wellwyn quietly go on go on there is silence ferrand suddenly monsieur are you really english the english are so civilised wellwyn and am i not ferrand you treat me like a brother wellwyn has turned towards the street door at a sound of feet and the clamour of voices timson from the street take her in ere i knows im through the open doorway come a police constable and a loafer bearing between them the limp white faced form of mrs megan hatless and with drowned hair enveloped in the policemans waterproof some curious persons bring up the rear jostling in the doorway among whom is timson carrying in his hands the policemans dripping waterproof leg pieces ferrand starting forward monsieur it is that little girl wellwyn whats happened constable whats happened the constable and loafer have laid the body down on the dais with wellwyn and ferrand they stand bending over her constable tempted sooicide sir but she hadnt been in the water arf a minute when i got hold of her he bends lower cant understand her collapsin like this wellwyn feeling her heart i dont feel anything ferrand in a voice sharpened by emotion let me try monsieur constable touching his arm you keep off my lad wellwyn no constable let him hes her friend constable releasing ferrand to the loafer here you cut off for a doctorsharp now he pushes back the curious persons now then stand away there please we cant have you round the body keep back clear out now he slowly moves them back and at last shepherds them through the door and shuts it on them timson being last ferrand the rum wellwyn fetches the decanter with the little there is left ferrand chafes the girls hands and forehead and pours some between her lips but there is no response from the inert body ferrand her soul is still away monsieur wellwyn seizing the decanter pours into it tea and boiling water constable its never drownin sir her head was hardly under i was on to her like knife ferrand rubbing her feet she has not yet her philosophy monsieur at the beginning they often try if she is dead in a voice of awed rapture what fortune constable with puzzled sadness true enough sir that wed just begun to know er if she as been taken her best friends couldnt wish er better wellwyn applying the decanter to her dips poor little thing ill try this hot tea ferrand whispering la mort le grand ami wellwyn look look at her shes coming round a faint tremor passes over mrs megans body he again applies the hot drink to her mouth she stirs and gulps constable with intense relief thats brave good lass shell pick up now sir then seeing that timson and the curious persons have again opened the door he drives them out and stands with his back against it mrs megan comes to herself wellwyn sitting on the dais and supporting her as if to a child there you are my dear there there better now thats right drink a little more of this tea mrs megan drinks from the decanter ferrand rising bring her to the fire monsieur they take her to the fire and seat her on the little stool from the moment of her restored animation ferrand has resumed

woman absorbed in thoughts of her own the voices are tuned to the pitch of heated discussion as the curtain rises the dean i disagree with you stephen absolutely entirely disagree more i cant help it mendip remember a certain war stephen were your chivalrous notions any good then and what was winked at in an obscure young member is anathema for an under secretary of state you cant afford more to follow my conscience thats new mendip mendip idealism can be out of place my friend the dean the government is dealing here with a wild lawless race on whom i must say i think sentiment is rather wasted more god made them dean mendip i have my doubts the dean they have proved themselves faithless we have the right to chastise more if i hit a little man in the eye and he hits me back have i the right to chastise him sir john we didnt begin this business more what with our missionaries and our trading the dean it is news indeed that the work of civilization may be justifiably met by murder have you forgotten glaive and morlinson sir john yes and that poor fellow groome and his wife more they went into a wild country against the feeling of the tribes on their own business what has the nation to do with the mishaps of gamblers sir john we cant stand by and see our own flesh and blood illtreated the dean does our rule bring blessing or does it not stephen more sometimes but with all my soul i deny the fantastic superstition that our rule can benefit a people like this a nation of one race as different from ourselves as dark from light in colour religion every mortal thing we can only pervert their natural instincts the dean that to me is an unintelligible point of view mendip go into that philosophy of yours a little deeper stephen it spells stagnation there are no fixed stars on this earth nations cant let each other alone more big ones could let little ones alone mendip if they could thered be no big ones my dear fellow we know little nations are your hobby but surely office should have toned you down sir john ive served my country fifty years and i say she is not in the wrong more i hope to serve her fifty sir john and i say she is mendip there are moments when such things cant be said more more theyll be said by me tonight mendip mendip in the house more nods katherine stephen mendip mrs more you mustnt let him its madness more rising you can tell people that tomorrow mendip give it a leader in the parthenon mendip political lunacy no man in your position has a right to fly out like this at the eleventh hour more ive made no secret of my

for advertisement mendip you will get it more must speak the truth sometimes even at that risk sir john it is not the truth mendip the greater the truth the greater the libel and the greater the resentment of the person libelled the dean trying to bring matters to a blander level my dear stephen even if you were right which i deny about the initial merits there surely comes a point where the individual conscience must resign it self to the countrys feeling this has become a question of national honour sir john well said james more nations are bad judges of their honour dean the dean i shall not follow you there more no its an awkward word katherine stopping the dean uncle james please more looks at her intently sir john so youre going to put yourself at the head of the cranks ruin your career and make me ashamed that youre my soninlaw more is a man only to hold beliefs when theyre popular youve stood up to be shot at often enough sir john sir john never by my country your speech will be in all the foreign presstrust em for seizing on anything against us a showup before other countries more you admit the showup sir john i do not sir the dean the position has become impossible the state of things out there must be put an end to once for all come katherine back us up more my country right or wrong guilty still my country mendip that begs the question katherine rises the dean too stands up the dean in a low voice quem deus volt perdere sir john unpatriotic more ill have no truck with tyranny katherine father doesnt admit tyranny nor do any of us stephen hubert julian a tall soldierlike man has come in helen hubert she gets up and goes to him and they talk together near the door sir john what in gods name is your idea weve forborne long enough in all conscience more sir john we great powers have got to change our ways in dealing with weaker nations the very dogs can give us lessons watch a big dog with a little one mendip no no these things are not so simple as all that more theres no reason in the world mendip why the rules of chivalry should not apply to nations at least as well as to dogs mendip my dear friend are you to become that hapless kind of outcast a champion of lost causes more this cause is not lost mendip right or wrong as lost as ever was cause in all this world there was never a time when the word patriotism stirred mob sentiment as it does now ware mob stephen ware mob more because general sentiments against me i a public man am to deny my faith the point is not whether im right or wrong mendip but whether im to sneak out of my conviction because its unpopular the dean im afraid i must go to katherine goodnight my dear ah hubert he greets hubert mr mendip i go your way can i drop you mendip thank you goodnight mrs more stop him its perdition he and the dean go out katherine puts her arm in helens and takes her out of the room hubert remains standing by the door sir john i knew your views were extreme in many ways stephen but i never thought the husband of my daughter would be a peaceatany price man more i am not but i prefer to fight some one my own size sir john well i can only hope to god youll come to your senses before you commit the folly of this speech i must get back to the war office goodnight hubert hubert goodnight father sir john goes out hubert stands motionless dejected hubert weve got our orders more what when dyou sail hubert at once more poor helen hubert not married a year pretty bad luck more touches his arm in sympathy well weve got to put feelings in our

katherine in two more youre not shirking your duty because of your wife hubert well youre riding for a fall and a godless mucker itll be thisll be no picnic we shall get some nasty knocks out there wait and see the feeling here when weve had a force or two cut up in those mountains its awful country those fellows have got modern arms and are jolly good fighters do drop it stephen more must risk something sometimes hubert even in my profession as he speaks katherine comes in hubert but its hopeless my dear chap absolutely more turns to the window hubert to his sister then with a gesture towards more as though to leave the matter to her he goes out katherine stephen are you really going to speak he nods i ask you not more you know my feeling katherine but its our own country we cant stand apart from it you wont stop anything only make people hate you i cant bear that more i tell you kit some one must raise a voice two or three reverses certain to come and the whole country will go wild and one more little nation will cease to live katherine if you believe in your country you must believe that the more land and power she has the better for the world more is that your faith katherine yes more i respect it i even understand it but i cant hold it katherine but stephen your speech will be a rallying cry to all the cranks and every one who has a spite against the country theyll make you their figurehead more smiles they will your chance of the cabinet will go you may even have to resign your seat more dogs will bark these things soon blow over katherine no no if you once begin a thing you always go on and what earthly good more history wont say and this they did without a single protest from their public men katherine there are plenty who more poets katherine do you remember that day on our honeymoon going up ben lawers you were lying on your face in the heather you said it was like kissing a loved woman there was a lark singing you said that was the voice of ones worship the hills were very blue thats why we had blue here because it was the best dress of our country you do love her more love her katherine youd have done this for me then more would you have asked me then kit katherine yes the countrys our country oh stephen think what itll be like for me with hubert and the other boys out there and poor helen and father i beg you not to make this speech more kit this isnt fair do you want me to feel myself a cur katherine breathless i i almost feel youll be a cur to do it she looks at him frightened by her own words then as the footman henry has come in to clear the table very low i ask you not he does not answer and she goes out more to the servant later please henry later the servant retires more still stands looking down at the diningtable then putting his hand to his throat as if to free it from the grip of his collar he pours out a glass of water and drinks it of in the street outside the bay window two street musicians a harp and a violin have taken up their stand and after some twangs and scrapes break into music more goes towards the sound and draws aside one curtain after a moment he returns to the table and takes up the notes of the speech he is in an agony of indecision more a cur he seems about to tear his notes across then changing his mind turns them over and over muttering his voice gradually grows louder till he is declaiming to the empty room the peroration of his speech more we have arrogated to our land the title champion of freedom foe of oppression is that indeed a bygone glory is it not worth some sacrifice of our pettier dignity to avoid laying another stone upon its grave to avoid placing before the searchlight eyes of history the spectacle of yet one more piece of national cynicism we are about to force our will and our dominion on a race that has always been free that loves its country and its independence as much as ever we love ours i cannot sit silent tonight and see this begin as we are tender of our own land so we should be of the lands of others i love my country it is because i love my country that i raise my voice warlike in spirit these people may be but they have no chance against ourselves and war on such however agreeable to the blind moment is odious to the future the great heart of mankind ever beats in sense and sympathy with the weaker it is against this great heart of mankind that we are going in the name of justice and civilization we pursue this policy but by justice we shall hereafter be judged and by civilization condemned while he is speaking a little figure has flown along the terrace outside in the direction of the music but has stopped at the sound of his voice and stands in the open window listening a darkhaired darkeyed child in a blue dressing gown caught up in her hand the street musicians having reached the end of a tune are silent in the intensity of mores feeling a wineglass gripped too strongly breaks and falls in pieces onto a fingerbowl the child starts forward into the room more olive olive who were you speaking to daddy more staring at her the wind sweetheart olive there isnt any more what blew you down then olive mysteriously the music did the wind break the wine glass or did it come in two in your hand more now my sprite upstairs again before nurse catches you fly fly olive oh no daddy with confidential fervour it feels like things tonight more youre right there olive pulling him down to her and whispering i must get back again in secret hsh she suddenly runs and wraps herself into one of the curtains of the bay window a young man enters with a note in his hand more hello steel the street musicians have again begun to play steel from sir john by special messenger from the war office more reading the note the ball is opened he stands brooding over the note and steel looks at him anxiously he is a dark sallow thinfaced young man with the eyes of one who can attach himself to people and suffer with them steel im glad its begun sir it would have been an awful pity to have made that speech more you too steel steel i mean if its actually started more tearing tie note across yes keep that to yourself steel do you want me any more more takes from his breast pocket some papers and pitches them down on the bureau more answer these steel going to the bureau fetherby was simply sickening he begins to write struggle has begun again in more not the faintest recognition that there are two sides to it more gives him a quick look goes quietly to the diningtable and picks up his sheaf of notes hiding them with his sleeve he goes back to the window where he again stands hesitating steel chief gem imitating we must show impudence at last that dignity is not asleep more moving out on to the terrace nice quiet night steel this to the cottage hospital shall i say you will preside more no steel writes then looking up and seeing that more is no longer there he goes to the window looks to right and left returns to the bureau and is about to sit down again when a thought seems to strike him with consternation he goes again to the window then snatching up his hat he passes hurriedly out along the terrace as he vanishes katherine comes in from the hall after looking out on to the terrace she goes to the bay window stands there listening then comes restlessly back into the room olive creeping quietly from behind the curtain clasps her round the waist katherine o my darling how you startled me what are you doing down here you wicked little sinner olive i explained all that to daddy we neednt go into it again need we katherine where is daddy olive gone katherine when olive oh only just and mr steel went after him like a rabbit the music stops they

only she gives olive a coin who runs with it to the bay window opens the aide casement and calls to the musicians olive catch please and would you play just one more she returns from the window and seeing her mother lost in thought rubs herself against her olive have you got an ache katharine right through me darling olive oh the musicians strike up a dance olive oh mummy i must just dance she kicks off her lisle blue shoes and begins dancing while she is capering hubert comes in from the hall he stands watching his little niece for a minute and katherine looks at him hubert stephen gone katherine yes stop olive olive are you good at my sort of dancing uncle hubert yes chick awfully katherine now olive the musicians have suddenly broken off in the middle of a bar from the street comes the noise of distant shouting olive listen uncle isnt it a particular noise hubert and katherine listen with all their might and olive stares at their faces hubert goes to the window the sound comes nearer the shouted words are faintly heard pyper warour force crosses frontier sharp fightinpyper katherine breathless yes it is the street cry is heard again in two distant voices coming from different directions war pyper sharp fightin on the frontier pyper katherine shut out those ghouls as hubert closes the window nurse wreford comes in from the hall she is an elderly woman endowed with a motherly grimness she fixes olive with her eye then suddenly becomes conscious of the street cry nurse oh dont say its begun hubert comes from the window nurse is the regiment to go mr hubert hubert yes nanny nurse oh dear my boy katherine signing to where olive stands with wide eyes nurse hubert ill look after him nurse nurse and him keepin company and you not married a year ah mr hubert now do

smothering emotion under a blunt manner we sail on friday kit be good to helen old girl katherine oh i wish why cant women fight hubert yes its bad for you with stephen taking it like this but hell come round now its once begun katherine shakes her head then goes suddenly up to him and throws her arms round his neck it is as if all the feeling pent up in her were finding vent in this hug the door from the hall is opened and sir johns voice is heard outside all right ill find her katherine father sir john comes in sir john stephen get my note i sent it over the moment i got to the war office katherine i expect so seeing the torn note on the table yes sir john theyre shouting the news now thank god i stopped that crazy speech of his in time katherine have you stopped it sir john what he wouldnt be such a sublime donkey katherine i think that is just what he might be going to the window we shall know soon sir john after staring at her goes up to hubert sir john keep a good heart my boy the countrys first they exchange a handsqueeze katherine backs away from the window steel has appeared there from the terrace breathless from running steel mr more back katherine no has he spoken steel yes katherine against steel yes sir john what after sir john stands rigid then turns and marches straight out into the hall at a sign from katherine hubert follows him katherine yes mr steel steel still breathless and agitated we were here he slipped away from me somehow he must have gone straight down to the house i ran over but when i got in under the gallery he was speaking already they expected something i never heard it so still there he gripped them from the first word deadly every syllable it got some of those fellows but all the time under the silence you could feel a sort of of current going round and then sherratt i think it was began it and you saw the anger rising in them but he kept them down his quietness the feeling ive never seen anything like it there then there was a whisper all over the house that fighting had begun and the whole thing broke out regular riot as if they could have killed him some one tried to drag him down by the coattails but he shook him off and went on then he stopped dead and walked out and the noise dropped like a stone the whole thing didnt last five minutes it was fine mrs more like like lava he was the only cool person there i wouldnt have missed it for anything it was grand more has appeared on the terrace behind steel katherine goodnight mr steel steel startled oh goodnight he goes out into the hall katherine picks up olives shoes and stands clasping them to her breast more comes in katherine youve cleared your conscience then i didnt think youd hurt me so more does not answer still living in the scene he has gone through and katherine goes a little nearer to him katherine im with the country heart and soul stephen i warn you while they stand in silence facing each other the footman henry enters from the hall footman these notes sir from the house of commons katherine taking them you can have the room directly the footman goes out more open them katherine opens one after the other and lets them fall on the table more well katherine what you might expect three of your best friends its begun more ware mob he gives a laugh i must write to the chief katherine makes an impulsive movement towards him then quietly goes to the bureau sits down and takes up a pen katherine let me make the rough draft she waits yes more dictating july th dear sir charles after my speech tonight embodying my most unalterable convictions katherine turns and looks up at him but he is staring straight before him and with a little movement of despair she goes on writing i have no alternative but to place the resignation of my undersecretaryship in your hands my view my faith in this matter may be wrong but i am surely right to keep the flag of my faith flying i imagine i need not enlarge on the reasons the curtain falls act ii before noon a few days later the open windows of the dining room let in the sunlight on the table a number of newspapers are littered helen is sitting there staring straight before her a newspaper boy runs by outside calling out his wares at the sound she gets up anti goes out on to the terrace hubert enters from the hall he goes at once to the terrace and draws helen

little and then you must go up olive goes reluctantly out on to the terrace steel awful news this morning of that pass and have you seen these reading from the newspaper we will have no truck with the jargon of the degenerate who vilifies his country at such a moment the member for toulmin has earned for himself the contempt of all virile patriots he takes up a second journal there is a certain type of public man who even at his own expense cannot resist the itch to advertise himself we would at moments of national crisis muzzle such persons as we muzzle dogs that we suspect of incipient rabies theyre in full cry after him katherine i mind much more all the creatures who are always flinging mud at the country making him their hero suddenly you know whats in his mind steel oh we must get him to give up that idea of lecturing everywhere against the war mrs more we simply must katherine listening the deputations come go and fetch him mr steel hell be in his room at the house steel goes out and katherine stands at bay in a moment he opens the door again to usher in the deputation then retires the four gentlemen have entered as if conscious of grave issues the first and most picturesque is james home a thin tall greybearded man with plentiful hair contradictious eyebrows and the halfshy halfbold manners alternately rude and over polite of one not accustomed to society yet secretly much taken with himself he is dressed in rough tweeds with a red silk tie slung through a ring and is closely followed by mark wace a waxy roundfaced man of middleage with sleek dark hair traces of whisker and a smooth way of continually rubbing his hands together as if selling something to an esteemed customer he is rather stout wears dark clothes with a large gold chain following him comes charles shelder a lawyer of fifty with a bald eggshaped head and gold pincenez he has little side whiskers a leathery yellowish skin a rather kind but watchful and dubious face and when he

of this little people banning steal their freedom thats rather running before the hounds more ah banning now we come to it in your hearts youre none of you for that neither by force nor fraud and yet you all know that weve gone in there to stay as weve gone into other lands as all we big powers go into other lands when theyre little and weak the prime ministers words the other night were these if we are forced to spend this blood and money now we must never again be forced what does that mean but swallowing this country shelder well and quite frankly itd be no bad thing home we dont want their wretched country were forced more we are not forced shelder my dear more what is civilization but the logical inevitable swallowing up of the lower by the higher types of man and what else will it be here more we shall not agree there shelder and we might argue it all day but the point is not whether you or i are right the point is what is a man who holds a faith with all his heart to do please tell me there is a silence banning simply i was just thinkin of those poor fellows in the pass more i can see them as well as you banning but imagine up in our own country the black valley twelve hundred foreign devils dead and dying the crows busy over them in our own country our own valley ours ours violated would you care about the poor fellows in that pass invading stealing dogs kill them

terrace till more is left alone he turns to the bay window the music is swelling coming nearer more leaves the window his face distorted by the strafe of his emotions he paces the room taking in some sort the rhythm of the march slowly the music dies away in the distance to a drumtap and the tramp of a company more stops at the table covering his eyes with his hands the deputation troop back across the terrace and come in at the french windows their faces and manners have quite changed katherine follows them as far as the window home in a strange almost threatening voice it wont do mr more give us your word to hold your peace shelder come more wace yes indeed indeed banning we must have it more without lifting his head i i the drumtap of a regiment marching is heard banning can you

a piece of orangepeel strike more across the face he takes no notice rough voice thats it give im some encouragement the jeering laughter is changed to anger by the contemptuous smile on mores face a tall youth traitor a voice dont stand there like a stuck pig a rough lets ave im dahn off that under cover of the applause that greets this he strikes more across the legs with a belt steel starts forward more flinging out his arm turns him back and resumes his tranquil staring at the crowd in whom the sense of being foiled by this silence is fast turning to rage the crowd speak up or get down get off get away there or well make you go on more remains immovable a youth in a lull of disconcertion ill make im speak see he darts forward and spits defiling mores hand more jerks it up as if it had been stung then stands as still as ever a spurt of laughter dies into a shiver of repugnance at the action the shame is fanned again to fury by the sight of mores scornful face tall youth out of

bravo more stick to it a rough give im another a voice no a girls voice let im alone come on billy this aint no fun still looking up at more the whole crowd falls into an uneasy silence broken only by the shuffling of feet then the big navvy in the front rank turns and elbows his way out to the edge of the crowd the navvy let im be with halfsullen and halfshamefaced acquiescence the crowd breaks up and drifts back whence it came till the alley is nearly empty more as if coming to out of a trancewiping his hand and dusting his coat well steel and followed by steel he descends the steps and moves away two policemen pass glancing up at the broken glass one of them stops and makes a note the curtain falls scene ii the windowend of katherines bedroom panelled in creamcoloured wood the light from four candles is falling on katherine who is sitting before the silver mirror of an old oak dressingtable brushing her hair a door on the left stands ajar an oak chair against the wall close to a recessed window is all the other furniture through this window the blue night is seen where a mist is rolled out flat amongst trees so that only dark clumps of boughs show here and there beneath a moonlit sky as the curtain rises katherine with brush arrested is listening she begins again brushing her hair then stops and taking a packet of letters from a drawer of her dressingtable reads through the just open door behind her comes the voice of olive olive mummy im awake but katherine goes on reading and olive steals into the room in her nightgown olive at katherines elbow examining

it gently stands looking for amoment then with the words my lamb she goes in noiselessly and closes the door katherine turns back to her glass puts back her hair and smooths her lips and eyes the door from the corridor is opened and helens voice says kit youre not in bed katherine no helen too is in a wrapper with a piece of lace thrown over her head her face is scared and miserable and she runs into katherines arms katherine my dear what is it helen ive seen a vision katherine hssh youll wake olive helen staring before her id just fallen asleep and i saw a plain that seemed to run into the sky like that fog and on it there were dark things one grew into a body without a head and a gun by its side and one was a man sitting huddled up nursing a wounded leg he had the face of huberts servant wreford and then i saw hubert his face was all dark and thin and he had a wound an awful wound here she touches her breast the blood was running from it and he kept trying to stop it oh kit by kissing it she pauses stifled by emotion then i heard wreford laugh and say vultures didnt touch live bodies and there came a voice from somewhere calling out oh god im dying and wreford began to swear at it and i heard hubert say dont wreford let the poor fellow be but the voice went on and on moaning and crying out ill lie here all night dying and then ill die and wreford dragged himself along the ground his face all devilish like a man whos going to kill katherine my dear how ghastly helen still that voice went on and i saw wreford take up the dead mans gun then hubert got upon his feet and went tottering along so feebly so dreadfully but before he could reach and stop him wreford fired at the man who was crying and hubert called out you brute and fell right down and when wreford saw him lying there he began to moan and sob but hubert never stirred then it all got black again and i could see a dark woman thing creeping first to the man without a head then to wreford then to hubert and it touched him and sprang away and it cried out aaiah pointing out at the mist look out there the dark things katherine putting her arms round her yes dear yes you must have been looking at the mist helen strangely calm hes dead katherine it was only a dream helen you didnt hear that cry she listens thats stephen forgive me kit i oughtnt to have upset you but i couldnt help

he goes quickly to her katherine ah she has mastered her emotion more let me look at you he draws her from the window to the candlelight and looks long at her more what have you done to your hair

the sweat from his forehead katherine remains some seconds on her knees gazing up at him not realizing then her head droops she too gets up and stands apart with her wrapper drawn close round her it is as if a cold and deadly shame had come to them both quite suddenly more turns and without looking back feebly makes his way out of the room when he is gone katherine drops on her knees and remains there motionless huddled in her hair the curtain falls act iv it is between lights the following day in the diningroom of mores house the windows are closed but curtains are not drawn steel is seated

entering says sir john julian maam sir john comes in a newspaper in his hand katherine at last a victory sir john thank god he hands her the paper katherine oh dad she tears the paper open and feverishly reads katherine at last the distant hum in the street is rising steadily but sir john after the one exultant moment when he handed her the paper stares dumbly at the floor katherine suddenly conscious of his gravity father sir john there is other news katherine one of the boys hubert sir john bows his head katherine killed sir john again bows his head katherine the dream she

yourself bankrupt of affection alone as the last man on earth if this business ends in your utter ruin and destruction as it must i shall not pity i cannot pity you goodnight he marches to the door opens it and goes out more is left standing perfectly still the stir and murmur of the street is growing all the time and slowly forces itself on his consciousness he goes to the bay window and looks out then rings the bell it is not answered and after turning up the lights he rings again katherine comes in she is wearing a black hat and black outdoor coat she speaks coldly without looking up katherine you rang more for them to shut this room up katherine the servants have gone out theyre afraid of the house being set on fire more i see katherine they have not your ideals to sustain them

to him and draws his eyes on her without a sound she puts her whole strength into that look stephen give it up come down to me the festive sounds from the street grow louder there can be heard the blowing of whistles and bladders and all the sounds of joy more and drown in that katherine turns swiftly to the door there she stands and again looks at him her face is mysterious from the conflicting currents of her emotions more so youre going katherine in a whisper yes she bends her head opens the door and goes more starts forward as if to follow her but olive has appeared in the doorway she has on a straight little white coat and a round white cap olive arent you coming with us daddy more shakes his head olive why not more never mind my dicky bird olive the motorll have to go very slow there are such a lot of people in the street are you staying to stop them setting the house on fire more nods may i stay a little too more shakes his head why more putting his hand on her head go along my pretty olive oh love me up daddy more takes and loves her up olive ooo more trot my soul she goes looks back at him turns suddenly and vanishes more follows her to the door but stops there then as full realization begins to dawn on him he runs to the bay window craning his head to catch sight of the front door there is the sound of a vehicle starting and the continual hooting of its horn as it makes its way among the crowd he turns from the window more alone as the last man on earth suddenly a voice rises clear out of the hurlyburly in the street voice there e is thats im more traitor more a shower of nutshells orangepeel and harmless missiles begins to rattle against the glass of the window many voices take up the groaning more traitor blackleg more and through the window can be seen waving flags and lighted chinese lanterns swinging high on long bamboos the din of execration swells more stands unheeding still gazing after the cab then with a sharp crack a flung stone crashes through one of the panes it is followed by a hoarse shout of laughter and a hearty groan a second stone crashes through the glass more turns for a moment with a contemptuous look towards the street and the flare of the chinese lanterns lights up his face then as if forgetting all about the din outside he moves back into the room looks round him and lets his head droop the din rises louder and louder a third stone crashes through more raises his head again and clasping his hands looks straight before him the footman henry entering hastens to the french windows more ah henry i thought youd gone footman i came back sir more good fellow footman theyre trying to force the terrace gate sir theyve no business coming on to private property no matter what in the surging entrance of the mob the footman henry who shows fight is overwhelmed hustled out into the crowd on the terrace and no more seen the mob is a mixed crowd of revellers of both sexes medical students clerks shop men and girls and a boy scout or two many have exchanged hats some wear masks or false noses some carry feathers or tin whistles some with bamboos and chinese lanterns swing them up outside on the terrace the medley of noises is very great such ringleaders as exist in the confusion are a group of students the chief of whom conspicuous because unadorned is an athletic hatless young man with a projecting underjaw and heavy coalblack moustache who seems with the swing of his huge arms and shoulders to sway the currents of motion when the first surge of noise and movement subsides he calls out to him boys chair the hero the students rush at the impassive more swing him roughly on to their shoulders and bear him round the room when they have twice circled the table to the music of their confused singing groans and whistling the chief of the students calls out put him down obediently they set him down on the table which has been forced into the bay window and stand gaping up at him chief student speech speech the noise ebbs and more looks round him chief student now then you sir more in a quiet voice very well you are here by the law that governs the action of all mobs the law of force by that law you can do what you like to this body of mine a voice and we will too more i dont doubt it but before that ive a word to say a voice youve always that another voice raises a donkeys braying more you mob are the most contemptible thing under the sun when you walk the street god goes in chief student be careful you sir voices down him down with the beggar more above the murmurs my fine friends im not afraid of you youve forced your way into my house and youve asked me to speak put up with the truth for once his words rush out you are the thing that pelts the weak kicks women howls down free speech this today and that tomorrow brain you have none spirit not the ghost of it if youre not meanness theres no such thing if youre not cowardice there is no cowardice above the growing fierceness of the hubbub patriotism there are two kinds that of our soldiers and this of mine you have neither chief student checking a dangerous rush hold on hold on to more swear to utter no more blasphemy against your country swear it crowd ah ay ah more my country is not yours mine is that great country which shall never take toll from the weakness of others above the groaning ah you can break my head and my windows but dont think that you can break my faith you could never break or shake it if you were a million to one a girl with dark eyes and hair all wild leaps out from the crowd and shakes her fist at him girl youre friends with them that killed my lad more smiles down at her and she swiftly plucks the knife from the belt of a boy scout beside her smile you cur a violent rush and heave from behind flings more forward on to the steel he reels staggers back and falls down amongst the crowd a scream a sway a rush a hubbub of cries the chief student shouts above the riot steady another my god hes got it chief student give him air the crowd falls back and two students bending over more lift his arms and head but they fall like lead desperately they test him for life chief student by the lord its over then begins a scared swaying out towards the window some one turns out the lights and in the darkness the crowd fast melts away the body of more lies in the gleam from a single chinese lantern muttering the words poor devil he kept his end up anyway the chief student picks from the floor a little abandoned union jack and lays it on mores breast then he too turns and rushes out and the body of more lies in the streak of light and flee noises in the street continue to rise the curtain falls but rises again almost at once aftermath a late spring dawn is just breaking against trees in leaf and blossom with the houses of a london square beyond suffused by the spreading glow is seen a dark lifesize statue on a granite pedestal in front is the broad dustdim pavement the light grows till the central words around the pedestal can be clearly read erected to the memory of stephen more faithful to his ideal high above the face of more looks straight before him with a faint smile on one shoulder and on his bare head two sparrows have perched and from the gardens behind comes the twittering and singing of birds the curtain falls
