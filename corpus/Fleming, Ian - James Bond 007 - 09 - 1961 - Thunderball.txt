thunderball by ian fleming thunderball by ian fleming copyright glidrose productions ltd to ernest cunйomuse the story is based on a screen treatment by k mcclory j whittingham and the author take it easy mr bond it was one of those days when it seemed to james bond that all life as someone put it was nothing but a heap of six to four against to begin with he was ashamed of himself a rare state of mind he had a hangover a bad one with an aching head and stiff joints when he coughed smoking too much goes with drinking too much and doubles the hangover a cloud of small luminous black spots swam across his vision like amoebae in pond water the one drink too many signals itself unmistakably his final whisky and soda in the luxurious flat in park lane had been no different from the ten preceding ones but it had gone down reluctantly and had left a bitter taste and an ugly sensation of surfeit and although he had taken in the message he had agreed to play just one more rubber five pounds a hundred as its the last one he had agreed and he had played the rubber like a fool even now he could see the queen of spades with that stupid mona lisa smile on her fat face slapping triumphantly down on his knave the queen as his partner had so sharply reminded him that had been so infallibly marked with south and that had made the difference between a grand slam redoubled for him and four hundred points above the line for the opposition in the end it had been a twentypoint rubber ј against him important money again bond dabbed with the bloodstained styptic pencil at the cut on his chin and despised the face that stared sullenly back at him from the mirror above the wash basin stupid ignorant bastard it all came from having nothing to do more than a month of paper work ticking off his number on stupid dockets scribbling minutes that got spikier as the weeks passed and snapping back down the telephone when some harmless section officer tried to argue with him and then his secretary had gone down with the flu and he had been given a silly and worse ugly bitch from the pool who called him sir and spoke to him primly through a mouth full of fruit stones and now it was another monday morning another week was beginning the may rain thrashed at the windows bond swallowed down two phensics and reached for the enos the telephone in his bedroom rang it was the loud ring of the direct line with headquarters james bond his heart thumping faster than it should have done despite the race across london and a fretful wait for the lift to the eighth floor pulled out the chair and sat down and looked across into the calm gray damnably clear eyes he knew so well what could he read in them good morning james sorry to pull you along a bit early in the morning got a very full day ahead wanted to fit you in before the rush bonds excitement waned minutely it was never a good sign when m addressed him by his christian name instead of by his number this didnt look like a job more like something personal there was none of the tension in ms voice that heralded big exciting news ms expression was interested friendly almost benign bond said something noncommittal havent seen much of you lately james how have you been your health i mean m picked up a sheet of paper a form of some kind from his desk and held it as if preparing to read suspiciously trying to guess what the paper said what all this was about bond said im all right sir m said mildly thats not what the mo thinks james just had your last medical i think you ought to hear what he has to say bond looked angrily at the back of the paper now what the hell he said with control just as you say sir m gave bond a careful appraising glance he held the paper closer to his eyes this officer he read remains basically physically sound unfortunately his mode of life is not such as is likely to allow him to remain in this happy state despite many previous warnings he admits to smoking sixty cigarettes a day these are of a balkan mixture with a higher nicotine content than the cheaper varieties when not engaged upon strenuous duty the officers average daily consumption of alcohol is in the region of half a bottle of spirits of between sixty and seventy proof on examination there continues to be little definite sign of deterioration the tongue is furred the blood pressure a little raised at the liver is not palpable on the other hand when pressed the officer admits to frequent occipital headaches and there is spasm in the trapezius muscles and socalled fibrositis nodules can be felt i believe these symptoms to be due to this officers mode of life he is not responsive to the suggestion that overindulgence is no remedy for the tensions inherent in his professional calling and can only result in the creation of a toxic state which could finally have the effect of reducing his fitness as an officer i recommend that no should take it easy for two to three weeks on a more abstemious regime when i believe he would make a complete return to his previous exceptionally high state of physical fitness m reached over and slid the report into his out tray he put his hands flat down on the desk in front of him and looked sternly across at bond he said not very satisfactory is it james bond tried to keep impatience out of his voice he said im perfectly fit sir everyone has occasional headaches most weekend golfers have fibrositis you get it from sweating and then sitting in a draft aspirin and embrocation get rid of them nothing to it really sir m said severely thats just where youre making a big mistake james taking medicine only suppresses these symptoms of yours medicine doesnt get to the root of the trouble it only conceals it the result is a more highly poisoned condition which may become chronic disease all drugs are harmful to the system they are contrary to nature the same applies to most of the food we eat white bread with all the roughage removed refined sugar with all the goodness machined out of it pasteurized milk which has had most of the vitamins boiled away everything overcooked and denaturized why m reached into his pocket for his notebook and consulted it do you know what our bread contains apart from a bit of overground flour m looked accusingly at bond it contains large quantities of chalk also benzol peroxide powder chlorine gas sal ammoniac and alum m put the notebook back in his pocket what do you think of that bond mystified by all this said defensively i dont eat all that much bread sir maybe not said m impatiently but how much stoneground whole wheat do you eat how much yoghurt uncooked vegetables nuts fresh fruit bond smiled practically none at all sir its no laughing matter m tapped his forefinger on the desk for emphasis mark my words there is no way to health except the natural way all your troubles bond opened his mouth to protest but m held up his hand the deepseated toxemia revealed by your medical are the result of a basically unnatural way of life ever heard of bircherbrenner for instance or kneipp preissnitz rikli schroth gossman bilz no sir just so well those are the men you would be wise to study those are the great naturopaths the men whose teaching we have foolishly ignored fortunately ms eyes gleamed enthusiastically there are a number of disciples of these men practicing in england nature cure is not beyond our reach james bond looked curiously at m what the hell had got into the old man was all this the first sign of senile decay but m looked fitter than bond had ever seen him the cold gray eyes were clear as crystal and the skin of the hard lined face was luminous with health even the irongray hair seemed to have new life then what was all this lunacy m reached for his in tray and placed it in front of him in a preliminary gesture of dismissal he said cheerfully well thats all james miss moneypenny has made the reservation two weeks will be quite enough to put you right you wont know yourself when you come out new man bond looked across at m aghast he said in a strangled voice out of where sir place called shrublands run by quite a famous man in his line wain joshua wain remarkable chap sixtyfive doesnt look a day over forty hell take good care of you very uptodate equipment and hes even got his own herb garden nice stretch of country near washington in sussex and dont worry about your work here put it right out of your mind for a couple of weeks ill tell to take care of the section bond couldnt believe his ears he said but sir i mean im perfectly all right are you sure i mean is this really necessary no m smiled frostily not necessary essential if you want to stay in the doubleo section that is i cant afford to have an officer in that section who isnt onehundredpercent fit m lowered his eyes to the basket in front of him and took out a signal file thats all he didnt look up the tone of voice was final bond got to his feet he said nothing he walked across the room and let himself out closing the door with exaggerated softness outside miss moneypenny looked sweetly up at him bond walked over to her desk and banged his fist down so that the typewriter jumped he said furiously now what the hell penny has the old man gone off his rocker whats all this bloody nonsense im damned if im going hes absolutely nuts miss moneypenny smiled happily the managers been terribly helpful and kind he says he can give you the myrtle room in the annex he says its a lovely room it looks right over the herb garden theyve got their own herb garden you know i know all about their bloody herb garden now look here penny bond pleaded with her be a good girl and tell me what its all about whats eating him miss moneypenny who often dreamed hopelessly about bond took pity on him she lowered her voice conspiratorially as a matter of fact i think its only a passing phase but it is rather bad luck on you getting caught up in it before its passed you know hes always apt to get bees in his bonnet about the efficiency of the service there was the time when all of us had to go through that physicalexercise course then he had that headshrinker in the psychoanalyst man you missed that you were somewhere abroad all the heads of section had to tell him their dreams he didnt last long some of their dreams must have scared him off or something well last month m got lumbago and some friend of his at blades one of the fat drinking ones i suppose miss moneypenny turned down her desirable mouth told him about this place in the country this man swore by it told m that we were all like motor cars and that all we needed from time to time was to go to a garage and get decarbonized he said he went there every year he said it only cost twenty guineas a week which was less than what he spent in blades in one day and it made him feel wonderful well you know m always likes trying new things and he went there for ten days and came back absolutely sold on the place yesterday he gave me a great talkingto all about it and this morning in the post i got a whole lot of tins of treacle and wheat germ and heaven knows what all i dont know what to do with the stuff im afraid my poor poodlell have to live on it anyway thats whats happened and i must say ive never seen him in such wonderful form hes absolutely rejuvenated he looked like that blasted man in the old kruschen salts advertisements but why does he pick on me to go to this nuthouse miss moneypenny gave a secret smile you know he thinks the world of you or perhaps you dont anyway as soon as he saw your medical he told me to book you in miss moneypenny screwed up her nose but james do you really drink and smoke as much as that it cant be good for you you know she looked up at him with motherly eyes bond controlled himself he summoned a desperate effort at nonchalance at the throwaway phrase its just that id rather die of drink than of thirst as for the cigarettes its really only that i dont know what to do with my hands he heard the stale hangover words fall like clinker in a dead grate cut out the schmaltz what you need is a double brandy and soda miss moneypennys warm lips pursed into a disapproving line about the hands thats not what ive heard now dont you start on me penny bond walked angrily toward the door he turned round any more tickingoff from you and when i get out of this place ill give you such a spanking youll have to do your typing off a block of dunlopillo miss moneypenny smiled sweetly at him i dont think youll be able to do much spanking after living on nuts and lemon juice for two weeks james bond made a noise between a grunt and a snarl and stormed out of the room shrublands james bond slung his suitcase into the back of the old chocolatebrown austin taxi and climbed into the front seat beside the foxy pimpled young man in the black leather windcheater the young man took a comb out of his breast pocket ran it carefully through both sides of his ducktail haircut put the comb back in his pocket then leaned forward and pressed the selfstarter the play with the comb bond guessed was to assert to bond that the driver was really only taking him and his money as a favor it was typical of the cheap selfassertiveness of young labor since the war this youth thought bond makes about twenty pounds a week despises his parents and would like to be tommy steele its not his fault he was born into the buyers market of the welfare state and into the age of atomic bombs and space flight for him life is easy and meaningless bond said how far is it to shrublands the young man did an expert but unnecessary racing change round an island and changed up again bout half an hour he put his foot down on the accelerator and neatly but rather dangerously overtook a lorry at an intersection you certainly get the most out of your bluebird the young man glanced sideways to see if he was being laughed at he decided that he wasnt he unbent fractionally my dad wont spring me something better says this old crate was okay for him for twenty years so its got to be okay for me for another twenty so im putting money by on my own halfway there already bond decided that the comb play had made him overcensorious he said what are you going to get volkswagen minibus do the brighton races that sounds a good idea plenty of money in brighton ill say the young man showed a trace of enthusiasm only time i ever got there a couple of bookies had me take them and a couple of tarts to london ten quid and a fiver tip piece of cake certainly was but you can get both kinds at brighton you want to watch out for being mugged and rolled there are some tough gangs operating out of brighton whats happened to the bucket of blood these days never opened up again after that case they had the one that got in all the papers the young man realized that he was talking as if to an equal he glanced sideways and looked bond up and down with a new interest you going into the scrubs or just visiting scrubs shrublands wormwood scrubs scrubs said the young man laconically youre not like the usual ones i get to take there mostly fat women and old geezers who tell me not to drive so fast or itll shake up their sciatica or something bond laughed ive got fourteen days without the option doctor thinks itll do me good got to take it easy what do they think of the place round here the young man took the turning off the brighton road and drove westward under the downs through poynings and fulking the austin whined stolidly through the inoffensive countryside people think theyre a lot of crackpots dont care for the place all those rich folk and they dont spend any money in the area tearooms make a bit out of them specially out of the cheats he looked at bond youd be surprised grown people some of them pretty big shots in the city and so forth and they motor around in their bentleys with their bellies empty and they see a tea shop and go in just for their cups of tea thats all theyre allowed next thing they see some guy eating buttered toast and sugar cakes at the next table and they cant stand it they order mounds of the stuff and hog it down just like kids whove broken into the larder looking round all the time to see if theyve been spotted youd think people like that would be ashamed of themselves seems a bit silly when theyre paying plenty to take the cure or whatever it is and thats another thing the young mans voice was indignant i can understand charging twenty quid a week and giving you three square meals a day but how do they get away with charging twenty quid for giving you nothing but hot water to eat doesnt make sense i suppose there are the treatments and it must be worth it to the people if they get well guess so said the young man doubtfully some of them do look a bit different when i come to take them back to the station he sniggered and some of them change into real old goats after a week of nuts and so forth guess i might try it myself one day what do you mean the young man glanced at bond reassured and remembering bonds worldly comments on brighton he said well you see we got a girl here in washington racy bird sort of local tart if you see what i mean waitress at a place called the honey bee tea shop or was rather she started most of us off if you get my meaning quid a go and she knows a lot of french tricks regular sport well this year the word got round up at the scrubs and some of these old goats began patronizing polly polly grace thats her name took her out in their bentleys and gave her a roll in a deserted quarry up on the downs thats been her pitch for years trouble was they paid her five ten quid and she soon got too good for the likes of us priced her out of our market so to speak inflation sort of and a month ago she chucked up her job at the honey bee and you know what the young mans voice was loud with indignation she bought herself a beatup austin metropolitan for a couple of hundred quid and went mobile just like the london tarts in curzon street they talk about in the papers now shes off to brighton lewes anywhere she can find the sports and in between whiles she goes to work in the quarry with these old goats from the scrubs would you believe it the young man gave an angry blast on his klaxon at an inoffensive couple on a tandem bicycle bond said seriously thats too bad i wouldnt have thought these people would be interested in that sort of thing on nut cutlets and dandelion wine or whatever they get to eat at this place the young man snorted thats all you know i mean he felt he had been too emphatic thats what we all thought one of my pals hes the son of the local doctor talked the thing over with his dad in a roundabout way sort of and his dad said no he said that this sort of diet and no drink and plenty of rest what with the massage and the hot and cold sitz baths and what have you he said that all clears the blood stream and tones up the system if you get my meaning wakes the old goats up makes em want to start cutting the mustard again if you know the song by that rosemary clooney bond laughed he said well well perhaps theres something to the place after all a sign on the right of the road said shrublands gateway to health first right silence please the road ran through a wide belt of firs and evergreens in a fold of the downs a high wall appeared and then an imposing mockbattlemented entrance with a victorian lodge from which a thin wisp of smoke rose straight up among the quiet trees the young man turned in and followed a gravel sweep between thick laurel bushes an elderly couple cringed off the drive at a blare from his klaxon and then on the right there were broad stretches of lawn and neatly flowered borders and a sprinkling of slowly moving figures alone and in pairs and behind them a redbrick victorian monstrosity from which a long glass sun parlor extended to the edge of the grass the young man pulled up beneath a heavy portico with a crenelated roof beside a varnished ironstudded arched door stood a tall glazed urn above which a notice said no smoking inside cigarettes here please bond got down from the taxi and pulled his suitcase out of the back he gave the young man a tenshilling tip the young man accepted it as no less than his due he said thanks you ever want to break out you can call me up pollys not the only one and theres a tea shop on the brighton road has buttered muffins so long he banged the gears into bottom and ground off back the way he had come bond picked up his suitcase and walked resignedly up the steps and through the heavy door inside it was very warm and quiet at the reception desk in the big oakpaneled hall a severely pretty girl in starched white welcomed him briskly when he had signed the register she led him through a series of somberly furnished public rooms and down a neutralsmelling white corridor to the back of the building here there was a communicating door with the annex a long low cheaply built structure with rooms on both sides of a central passage the doors bore the names of flowers and shrubs she showed him into myrtle told him that the chief would see him in an hours time at six oclock and left him it was a roomshaped room with furnitureshaped furniture and dainty curtains the bed was provided with an electric blanket there was a vase containing three marigolds beside the bed and a book called nature cure explained by alan moyle mnba bond opened it and ascertained that the initials stood for member british naturopathic association he turned off the central heating and opened the windows wide the herb garden row upon row of small nameless plants round a central sundial smiled up at him bond unpacked his things and sat down in the single armchair and read about eliminating the waste products from his body he learned a great deal about foods he had never heard of such as potassium broth nut mince and the mysteriously named unmalted slippery elm he had got as far as the chapter on massage and was reflecting on the injunction that this art should be divided into effleurage stroking friction kneading petrissage tapotement and vibration when the telephone rang a girls voice said that mr wain would be glad to see him in consulting room a in five minutes mr joshua wain had a firm dry handshake and a resonant encouraging voice he had a lot of bushy gray hair above an unlined brow soft clear brown eyes and a sincere and christian smile he appeared to be genuinely pleased to see bond and to be interested in him he wore a very clean smocklike coat with short sleeves from which strong hairy arms hung relaxed below were rather incongruous pinstripe trousers he wore sandals over socks of conservative gray and when he moved across the consulting room his stride was a springy lope mr wain asked bond to remove all his clothes except his shorts when he saw the many scars he said politely dear me you do seem to have been in the wars mr bond bond said indifferently near miss during the war really war between peoples is a terrible thing now just breathe in deeply please mr wain listened at bonds back and chest took his blood pressure weighed him and recorded his height and then after asking him to lie face down on a surgical couch handled his joints and vertebrae with soft probing fingers while bond replaced his clothes mr wain wrote busily at his desk then he sat back well mr bond nothing much to worry about here i think blood pressure a little high slight osteopathic lesions in the upper vertebrae theyll probably be causing your tension headaches by the way and some right sacroiliac strain with the right ilium slightly displaced backwards due to a bad fall some time no doubt mr wain raised his eyebrows for confirmation bond said perhaps inwardly he reflected that the bad fall had probably been when he had had to jump from the arlberg express after heinkel and his friends had caught up with him around the time of the hungarian uprising in well now mr wain drew a printed form toward him and thoughtfully ticked off items on a list strict dieting for one week to eliminate the toxins in the blood stream massage to tone you up irrigation hot and cold sitz baths osteopathic treatment and a short course of traction to get rid of the lesions that should put you right and complete rest of course just take it easy mr bond youre a civil servant i understand do you good to get away from all that worrying paper work for a while mr wain got up and handed the printed form to bond treatment rooms in half an hour mr bond no harm in starting right away thank you bond took the form and glanced at it whats traction by the way a mechanical device for stretching the spine very beneficial mr wain smiled indulgently dont be worried by what some of the other patients tell you about it they call it the rack you know what wags some people are yes bond walked out and along the whitepainted corridor people were sitting about reading or talking in soft tones in the public rooms they were all elderly middleclass people mostly women many of whom wore unattractive quilted dressing gowns the warm close air and the frumpish women gave bond claustrophobia he walked through the hall to the main door and let himself out into the wonderful fresh air bond walked thoughtfully down the trim narrow drive and smelled the musty smell of the laurels and the laburnums could he stand it was there any way out of this hellhole short of resigning from the service deep in thought he almost collided with a girl in white who came hurrying round a sharp bend in the thickly hedged drive at the same instant as she swerved out of his path and flashed him an amused smile a mauve bentley taking the corner too fast was on top of her at one moment she was almost under its wheels at the next bond with one swift step had gathered her up by the waist and executing a passable veronica with a sharp swivel of his hips had picked her body literally off the hood of the car he put the girl down as the bentley dryskidded to a stop in the gravel his right hand held the memory of one beautiful breast the girl said oh and looked up into his eyes with an expression of flurried astonishment then she took in what had happened and said breathlessly oh thank you she turned toward the car a man had climbed unhurriedly down from the driving seat he said calmly i am so sorry are you all right recognition dawned on his face he said silkily why if it isnt my friend patricia how are you pat all ready for me the man was extremely handsome a darkbronzed womankiller with a neat mustache above the sort of callous mouth women kiss in their dreams he had regular features that suggested spanish or south american blood and bold hard brown eyes that turned up oddly or as a woman would put it intriguingly at the corners he was an athleticlooking six foot dressed in the sort of casually wellcut beige herringbone tweed that suggests anderson and sheppard he wore a white silk shirt and a dark red polkadot tie and the soft dark brown vnecked sweater looked like vicuna bond summed him up as a goodlooking bastard who got all the women he wanted and probably lived on them and lived well the girl had recovered her poise she said severely you really ought to be more careful count lippe you know there are always patients and staff walking down this drive if it hadnt been for this gentleman she smiled at bond youd have run me over after all there is a big sign asking drivers to take care i am so sorry my dear i was hurrying i am late for my appointment with the good mr wain i am as usual in need of decarbonization this time after two weeks in paris he turned to bond he said with a hint of condescension thank you my dear sir you have quick reactions and now if you will forgive me he raised a hand got back into the bentley and purred off up the drive the girl said now i really must hurry im terribly late together they turned and walked after the bentley bond said examining her do you work here she said that she did she had been at shrublands for three years she liked it and how long was he staying the smalltalk continued she was an athleticlooking girl whom bond would have casually associated with tennis or skating or showjumping she had the sort of firm compact figure that always attracted him and a fresh openair type of prettiness that would have been commonplace but for a wide rather passionate mouth and a hint of authority that would be a challenge to men she was dressed in a feminine version of the white smock worn by mr wain and it was clear from the undisguised curves of her breasts and hips that she had little on underneath it bond asked her if she didnt get bored what did she do with her time off she acknowledged the gambit with a smile and a quick glance of appraisal ive got one of those bubble cars i get about the country quite a lot and there are wonderful walks and ones always seeing new people here some of them are very interesting that man in the car count lippe he comes here every year he tells me fascinating things about the far east china and so on hes got some sort of a business in a place called macao its near hong kong isnt it yes thats right so those turnedup eyes were a dash of chinaman it would be interesting to know his background probably portuguese blood if he came from macao they had reached the entrance inside the warm hall the girl said well i must run thank you again she gave him a smile that for the benefit of the watching receptionist was entirely neutral i hope you enjoy your stay she hurried off toward the treatment rooms bond followed his eyes on the taut swell of her hips he glanced at his watch and also went down the stairs and into a spotlessly white basement that smelled faintly of olive oil and an aerosol disinfectant beyond a door marked gentlemens treatment he was taken in hand by an indiarubbery masseur in trousers and singlet bond undressed and with a towel round his waist followed the man down a long room divided into compartments by plastic curtains in the first compartment side by side two elderly men lay the perspiration pouring down their strawberry faces in electric blanketbaths in the next were two massage tables on one the pale dimpled body of a youngish but very fat man wobbled obscenely beneath the pummeling of his masseur bond his mind recoiling from it all took off his towel and lay down on his face and surrendered himself to the toughest deep massage he had ever experienced vaguely against the jangling of his nerves and the aching of muscles and tendons he heard the fat man heave himself off his table and moments later another patient take his place he heard the mans masseur say im afraid well have to have the wristwatch off sir the urbane silky voice that bond at once recognized said with authority nonsense my dear fellow i come here every year and ive been allowed to keep it on before id rather keep it on if you dont mind sorry sir the masseurs voice was politely firm you must have had someone else doing the treatment it interferes with the flow of blood when i come to treat the arm and hand if you dont mind sir there was a moments silence bond could almost feel count lippe controlling his temper the words when they came were spat out with what seemed to bond ludicrous violence take it off then the damn you didnt have to be uttered it hung in the air at the end of the sentence thank you sir there was a brief pause and then the massage began the small incident seemed odd to bond obviously one had to take off ones wristwatch for a massage why had the man wanted to keep it on it seemed very childish turn over please sir bond obeyed now his face was free to move he glanced casually to his right count lippes face was turned away from him his left arm hung down toward the floor where the sunburn ended there was a bracelet of almost white flesh at the wrist in the middle of the circle where the watch had been there was a sign tattooed on the skin it looked like a small zigzag crossed by two vertical strokes so count lippe had not wanted this sign to be seen it would be amusing to ring up records and see if they had a line on what sort of people wore this little secret recognition sign under their wristwatches the rack at the end of the hours treatment bond felt as if his body had been eviscerated and then run through a wringer he put on his clothes and cursing m climbed weakly back up the stairs into what by comparison with the world of nakedness and indignities in the basement were civilized surroundings at the entrance to the main lounge were two telephone booths the switchboard put him through to the only headquarters number he was allowed to call on an outside line he knew that all such outside calls were monitored as he asked for records he recognized the hollowness on the line that meant the line was bugged he gave him number to head of records and put his question adding that the subject was an oriental probably of portuguese extraction after ten minutes head of records came back to him its a tong sign his voice sounded interested the red lightning tong unusual to find anyone but a fullblooded chinaman being a member its not the usual semireligious organization this is entirely criminal station h had dealings with it once theyre represented in hong kong but their headquarters are across the bay in macao station h paid big money to get a courier service running into peking worked like a dream so they gave the line a trial with some heavy stuff it bounced badly lost a couple of hs top men it was a doublecross turned out that redland had some sort of a deal with these people hell of a mess since then theyve cropped up from time to time in drugs gold smuggling to india and topbracket white slavery theyre big people wed be interested if youve got any kind of a line bond said thanks records no ive got nothing definite first time ive heard of these red lightning people let you know if anything develops so long bond thoughtfully put back the receiver how interesting now what the hell could this man be doing at shrublands bond walked out of the booth a movement in the next booth caught his eye count lippe his back to bond had just picked up the receiver how long had he been in there had he heard bonds inquiry or his comment bond had the crawling sensation at the pit of his stomach he knew so well the signal that he had probably made a dangerous and silly mistake he glanced at his watch it was seventhirty he walked through the lounge to the sun parlor where dinner was being served he gave his name to the elderly woman with a wardress face behind a long counter she consulted a list and ladled hot vegetable soup into a plastic mug bond took the mug he said anxiously is that all the woman didnt smile she said severely youre lucky you wouldnt be getting as much on starvation and you may have soup every day at midday and two cups of tea at four oclock bond gave her a bitter smile he took the horrible mug over to one of the little cafй tables near the windows overlooking the dark lawn and sat down and sipped the thin soup while he watched some of his fellow inmates meandering aimlessly weakly through the room now he felt a grain of sympathy for the wretches now he was a member of their club now he had been initiated he drank the soup down to the last neat cube of carrot and walked abstractedly off to his room thinking of count lippe thinking of sleep but above all thinking of his empty stomach after two days of this bond felt terrible he had a permanent slight nagging headache the whites of his eyes had turned rather yellow and his tongue was deeply furred his masseur told him not to worry this was as it should be these were the poisons leaving his body bond now a permanent prey to lassitude didnt argue nothing seemed to matter any more but the single orange and hot water for breakfast the mugs of hot soup and the cups of tea which bond filled with spoonfuls of brown sugar the only variety that had mr wains sanction on the third day after the massage and the shock of the sitz baths bond had on his program osteopathic manipulation and traction he was directed to a new section of the basement withdrawn and silent when he opened the designated door he expected to find some hairy hman waiting for him with flexed muscles he stopped in his tracks the girl patricia something whom he had not set eyes on since his first day stood waiting for him beside the couch he closed the door behind him and said good lord is this what you do she was used to this reaction of the men patients and rather touchy about it she didnt smile she said in a businesslike voice nearly ten per cent of osteopaths are women take off your clothes please everything except your shorts when bond had amusedly obeyed she told him to stand in front of her she walked round him examining him with eyes in which there was nothing but professional interest without commenting on his scars she told him to lie face downward on the couch and with strong precise and thoroughly practiced holds went through the handling and jointcracking of her profession bond soon realized that she was an extremely powerful girl his muscled body admittedly unresistant seemed to be easy going for her bond felt a kind of resentment at the neutrality of this relationship between an attractive girl and a halfnaked man at the end of the treatment she told him to stand up and clasp his hands behind her neck her eyes a few inches away from his held nothing but professional concentration she hauled strongly away from him presumably with the object of freeing his vertebrae this was too much for bond at the end of it when she told him to release his hands he did nothing of the sort he tightened them pulled her head sharply toward him and kissed her full on the lips she ducked quickly down through his arms and straightened herself her cheeks red and her eyes shining with anger bond smiled at her knowing that he had never missed a slap in the face and a hard one at that by so little he said its all very well but i just had to do it you shouldnt have a mouth like that if youre going to be an osteopath the anger in her eyes subsided a fraction she said the last time that happened the man had to leave by the next train bond laughed he made a threatening move toward her if i thought there was any hope of being kicked out of this damn place id kiss you again she said dont be silly now pick up your things youve got half an hours traction she smiled grimly that ought to keep you quiet bond said morosely oh all right but only on condition you let me take you out on your next day off well see about that it depends how you behave at the next treatment she held open the door bond picked up his clothes and went out almost colliding with a man coming down the passage it was count lippe in slacks and a gay windcheater he ignored bond with a smile and a slight bow he said to the girl here comes the lamb to the slaughter i hope youre not feeling too strong today his eyes twinkled charmingly the girl said briskly just get ready please i shant be a moment putting mr bond on the traction table she moved off down the passage with bond following she opened the door of a small anteroom told bond to put his things down on a chair and pulled aside plastic curtains that formed a partition just inside the curtains was an oddlooking kind of surgical couch in leather and gleaming aluminum bond didnt like the look of it at all while the girl fiddled with a series of straps attached to three upholstered sections that appeared to be on runners bond examined the contraption suspiciously below the couch was a stout electric motor on which a plate announced that this was the hercules motorized traction table a power drive in the shape of articulated rods stretched upward from the motor to each of the three cushioned sections of the couch and terminated in tension screws to which the three sets of straps were attached in front of the raised portion where the patients head would lie and approximately level with his face was a large dial marked in lbspressure up to after lbs the numerals were in red below the headrest were grips for the patients hands bond noted gloomily that the leather on the grips was stained with presumably sweat lie face downward here please the girl held the straps ready bond said obstinately not until you tell me what this thing does i dont like the look of it the girl said patiently this is simply a machine for stretching your spine youve got mild spinal lesions it will help to free those and at the base of your spine youve got some right sacroiliac strain itll help that too you wont find it bad at all just a stretching sensation its very soothing really quite a lot of patients fall asleep this one wont said bond firmly what strength are you going to give me why are those top figures in red are you sure im not going to be pulled apart the girl said with a touch of impatience dont be silly of course if there was too much tension it might be dangerous but i shall be starting you only at pounds and in a quarter of an hour i shall come and see how youre getting on and probably put you up to now come along ive got another patient waiting reluctantly bond climbed up on the couch and lay on his face with his nose and mouth buried in a deep cleft in the headrest he said his voice muffled by the leather if you kill me ill sue he felt the straps being tightened round his chest and then round his hips the girls skirt brushed the side of his face as she bent to reach the control lever beside the big dial the motor began to whine the straps tightened and then relaxed tightened and relaxed bond felt as if his body was being stretched by giant hands it was a curious sensation but not unpleasant with difficulty bond raised his head the needle on the dial stood at now the machine was making a soft iron heehawing like a mechanical donkey as the gears alternatively engaged and disengaged to produce the rhythmic traction are you all right yes he heard the girl pass through the plastic curtains and then the click of the outer door bond abandoned himself to the soft feel of the leather at his face to the relentless intermittent haul on his spine and to the hypnotic whine and drone of the machine it really wasnt too bad how silly to have had nerves about it a quarter of an hour later he heard again the click of the outside door and the swish of the curtains all right fine the girls hand came into his line of vision as she turned the lever bond raised his head the needle crept up to now the pull was really hard and the voice of the machine was much louder the girl put her head down to his she laid a reassuring hand on his shoulder she said her voice loud above the noise of the gears only another quarter of an hour to go all right bonds voice was careful he was probing the new strength of the giant haul on his body the curtains swished now the click of the outside door was drowned by the noise of the machine slowly bond relaxed again into the arms of the rhythm it was perhaps five minutes later when a tiny movement of the air against his face made bond open his eyes in front of his eyes was a hand a mans hand reaching softly for the lever of the accelerator bond watched it at first fascinated and then with dawning horror as the lever was slowly depressed and the straps began to haul madly at his body he shouted something he didnt know what his whole body was racked with a great pain desperately he lifted his head and shouted again on the dial the needle was trembling at his head dropped back exhausted through a mist of sweat he watched the hand softly release the lever the hand paused and turned slowly so that the back of the wrist was just below his eyes in the center of the wrist was the little red sign of the zigzag and the two bisecting lines a voice said quietly close up against his ear you will not meddle again my friend then there was nothing but the great whine and groan of the machine and the bite of the straps that were tearing his body in half bond began to scream weakly while the sweat poured from him and dripped off the leather cushions onto the floor then suddenly there was blackness tea and animosity it is just as well that the body retains no memory of pain yes it hurt that abscess that broken bone but just how it hurt and how much is soon forgotten by the brain and the nerves it is not so with pleasant sensations a scent a taste the particular texture of a kiss these things can be almost totally recalled bond gingerly exploring his sensations as life came flooding back into his body was astonished that the web of agony that had held his body so utterly had now completely dissolved it was true that his whole spine ached as if it had been beaten each vertebra separately with wooden truncheons but his pain was recognizable something within his knowledge and therefore capable of control the searing tornado that had entered his body and utterly dominated it replacing his identity with its own had gone how had it been what had it been like bond couldnt remember except that it had reduced him to something lower in the scale of existence than a handful of grass in the mouth of a tiger the murmur of voices grew more distinct but what told you first that something was wrong miss fearing it was the noise the noise of the machine i had just finished a treatment a few minutes later i heard it id never heard it so loud i thought perhaps the door had been left open i wasnt really worried but i came along to make sure and there it was the indicator up to i tore down the lever and got the straps off and ran to the surgery and found the coramine and injected it into the vein one cc the pulse was terribly weak then i telephoned you you seem to have done everything possible miss fearing and im sure you bear no responsibility for this terrible thing mr wains voice was doubtful it really is most unfortunate i suppose the patient must have jerked the lever somehow perhaps he was experimenting he might easily have killed himself we must tell the company about this and have some safety arrangement installed a hand gingerly clasped bonds wrist feeling for his pulse bond thought it was time to reenter the world he must quickly get himself a doctor a real one not one of these gratedcarrot merchants a sudden wave of anger poured through him this was all ms fault m was mad he would have it out with him when he got back to headquarters if necessary he would go higher to the chiefs of staff the cabinet the prime minister m was a dangerous lunatic a danger to the country it was up to bond to save england the weak hysterical thoughts whirled through his brain mixed themselves up with the hairy hand of count lippe the mouth of patricia fearing the taste of hot vegetable soup and as consciousness slipped away from him again the diminishing voice of mr wain no structural damage only considerable surface abrasion of the nerve ends and of course shock you will take personal charge of the case miss fearing rest warmth and effleurage is that under rest warmth and effleurage when bond came round again he was lying face downward on his bed and his whole body was bathed in exquisite sensation beneath him was the soft warmth of an electric blanket his back glowed with the heat from two large sun lamps and two hands clad in what felt to be some particularly velvety fur were rhythmically passing one after the other up and down the whole length of his body from his neck to the backs of his knees it was a most gentle and almost piercingly luxurious experience and bond lay and bathed himself in it presently he said sleepily is that what they call effleurage the girls voice said softly i thought youd come round the whole tone of your skin suddenly changed how are you feeling wonderful id be still better for a double whisky on the rocks the girl laughed mr wain did say dandelion tea would be best for you but i thought a little stimulant might be good i mean just this once so i brought the brandy with me and theres plenty of ice as im going to give you an icepack presently would you really like some wait ill put your dressing gown over you and then you can see if you can turn over ill look the other way bond heard the lamps being pulled away gingerly he turned on his side the dull ache returned but it was already wearing off he cautiously slipped his legs over the side of the bed and sat up patricia fearing stood in front of him clean white comforting desirable in one hand was a pair of heavy mink gloves but with the fur covering the palm instead of the back in the other was a glass she held out the glass as bond drank and heard the reassuring reallife tinkle of the ice he thought this is a most splendid girl i will settle down with her she will give me effleurage all day long and from time to time a good tough drink like this it will be a life of great beauty he smiled at her and held out the empty glass and said more she laughed mostly with relief that he was completely alive again she took the glass and said well just one more then but dont forget its on an empty stomach it may make you dreadfully tight she paused with the brandy bottle in her hand suddenly her gaze was cool clinical and now you must try and tell me what happened did you accidentally touch the lever or something you gave us all a dreadful fright nothing like that has ever happened before the traction tables really perfectly safe you know bond looked candidly into her eyes he said reassuringly of course i was just trying to get more comfortable i heaved about and i do remember that my hand hit something rather hard i suppose it must have been the lever then i dont remember any more i must have been awfully lucky you came along so quickly she handed him the fresh drink well its all over now and thank heavens nothings badly strained another two days of treatment and youll be right as rain she paused she looked rather embarrassed oh and mr wain asks if you could possibly keep all this all this trouble to yourself he doesnt want the other patients to get worried i should think not thought bond he could see the headlines patient torn nearly limb from limb at nature clinic rack machine goes berserk ministry of health steps in he said of course i wont say anything it was my fault anyway he finished his drink handed back the glass and cautiously lay back on the bed he said that was marvelous now how about some more of the mini treatment and by the way will you marry me youre the only girl ive ever met who knows how to treat a man properly she laughed dont be silly and turn over on your face its your back that needs treatment how do you know two days later bond was once more back in the halfworld of the nature cure the routine of the early morning glass of hot water the orange carefully sliced into symmetrical pigs by some ingenious machine wielded no doubt by the wardress in charge of diets then the treatments the hot soup the siesta and the blank aimless walk or bus ride to the nearest tea shop for the priceless strengthgiving cups of tea laced with brown sugar bond loathed and despised tea that flat soft timewasting opium of the masses but on his empty stomach and in his febrile state the sugary brew acted almost as an intoxicant three cups he reckoned had the effect not of hard liquor but of just about half a bottle of champagne in the outside world in real life he got to know them all these dainty opium dens rose cottage which he avoided after the woman charged him extra for emptying the sugar bowl the thatched barn which amused him because it was a real den of iniquity large plates of sugar cakes put on ones table the piercing temptation of the smell of hot scones the transport cafe where the indian tea was black and strong and the lorry drivers brought in a smell of sweat and petrol and the great world and a dozen other cottagey raftery nooks where elderly couples with ford populars and morris minors talked in muted tones about children called len and ron and pearl and ethel and ate in small mouthfuls with the points of their teeth and made not a sound with the tea things it was all a world whose ghastly daintiness and propriety would normally have sickened him now empty weak drained of all the things that belonged to his tough fast basically dirty life through banting he had somehow regained some of the innocence and purity of childhood in this frame of mind the naпvetй and total lack of savor surprise excitement of the dimity world of the nicecupoftea of the homemade cakes and the onelumportwo were perfectly acceptable and the extraordinary thing was that he could not remember when he had felt so well not strong but without any aches and pains clear of eye and skin sleeping ten hours a day and above all without that nagging sense of morning guilt that one is slowly wrecking ones body it was really quite disturbing was his personality changing was he losing his edge his point his identity was he losing the vices that were so much part of his ruthless cruel fundamentally tough character who was he in process of becoming a soft dreaming kindly idealist who would naturally leave the service and become instead a prison visitor interest himself in youth clubs march with the hbomb marchers eat nut cutlets try and change the world for the better james bond would have been more worried as day by day the hcure drew his teeth if it had not been for three obsessions which belonged to his former life and which would not leave him a passionate longing for a large dish of spaghetti bolognese containing plenty of chopped garlic and accompanied by a whole bottle of the cheapest rawest chianti an overwhelming desire for the strong smooth body of patricia fearing and a deadly concentration on ways and means to wring the guts of count lippe the first two would have to wait though tantalizing schemes for consuming both dishes on the day of his release from shrublands occupied much of his mind so far as count lippe was concerned work had started on the project from the moment bond took up again the routine of the cure with the cold intensity he would have employed against an enemy agent say in a hotel in stockholm or lisbon during the war james bond set about spying on the other man he became garrulous and inquisitive chatting with patricia fearing about the various routines at shrublands but when do the staff find time to have lunch that man lippe looks very fit oh hes worried about his waistline arent the electric blanketbaths good for that no i havent seen the turkish bath cabinet must have a look at it sometime and to his masseur havent seen that big chap about lately count something ripper hipper oh yes lippe oh noon every day i think i must try and get that time as well nice being clear for the rest of the day and id like to have a spell in the turkish bath thing when youve finished the massage need a good sweat innocently fragment by fragment james bond built up a plan of operations a plan that would leave him and lippe alone among the machinery of the soundproof treatment rooms for there would be no other opportunity count lippe kept to his room in the main building until his treatment time at noon in the afternoons he swished away in the violet bentley to bournemouth it seemed where he had business the night porter let him in around eleven each night one afternoon in the siesta hour bond slipped the yale lock on count lippes room with a straight piece of plastic cut off a childs airplane he had bought for the purpose in washington he went over the room meticulously and drew a blank all he learned from the clothes was that the count was a muchtraveled man shirts from charvet ties from tripler dior and hardy amies shoes from peel and rawsilk pajamas from hong kong the dark red morocco suitcase from mark cross might have contained secrets and bond eyed the silk linings and toyed with the counts wilkinson razor but no better that revenge if it could be contrived should come out of a clear sky that same afternoon drinking his treacly tea bond scraped together the meager scraps of his knowledge of count lippe he was about thirty attractive to women and physically to judge from the naked body bond had seen very strong his blood would be portuguese with a dash of chinaman and he gave the appearance of wealth what did he do what was his profession at first glance bond would have put him down as a tough maquereau from the ritz bar in paris the palace at st moritz the carlton at cannes good at backgammon polo waterskiing but with the yellow streak of the man who lives on women but lippe had heard bond making inquiries about him and that had been enough for an act of violence an inspired act that he had carried out swiftly and coolly when he finished his treatment with the fearing girl and knew from her remark that bond would be alone on the traction table the act of violence might only have been designed to warn but equally since lippe could only guess at the effect of a pound pull on the spine it might have been designed to kill why who was this man who had so much to hide and what were his secrets bond poured the last of his tea on to a mound of brown sugar one thing was certain the secrets were big ones bond never seriously considered telling headquarters about lippe and what he had done to bond the whole thing against the background of shrublands was so unlikely and so utterly ridiculous and somehow bond the man of action and resource came out of it all as something of a ninny weakened by a diet of hot water and vegetable soup the ace of the secret service had been tied to some kind of a rack and then a man had come along and just pulled a lever up a few notches and reduced the hero of a hundred combats to a quivering jelly no there was only one solution a private solution man to man later perhaps to satisfy his curiosity it might be amusing to put through a good trace on count lippe with sis records with the cid with the hong kong station but for the time being bond would stay quiet keep out of count lippes way and plan meticulously for just the right kind of payoff by the time the fourteenth day the last day came bond had it all fixed the time the place and the method at ten oclock mr joshua wain received bond for his final checkup when bond came into the consulting room mr wain was standing by the open window doing deepbreathing exercises with a final thorough exhalation through the nostrils he turned to greet bond with an ah bisto expression on his healthily flushed face his smile was elastic with goodfellowship and hows the world treating you mr bond no ill effects from that unhappy little accident no quite so the body is a most remarkable piece of mechanism extraordinary power of recovery now then shirt off please and well see what shrublands has managed to do for you ten minutes later bond blood pressure down to weight reduced by ten pounds osteopathic lesions gone clear of eye and tongue was on his way down to the basement rooms for his final treatment as usual it was clammily quiet and neutralsmelling in the white rooms and corridors from the separate cubicles there came an occasional soft exchange between patient and staff and in the background intermittent plumbing noises the steady whir of the ventilation system created the impression of the deep innards of a liner in a dead calm it was nearly twelvethirty bond lay face down on the massage table and listened for the authoritative voice and the quick slap of the naked feet of his prey the door at the end of the corridor sighed open and sighed shut again morning beresford all ready for me make it good and hot today last treatment three more ounces to lose right very good sir the gym shoes of the chief attendant followed by the slapping feet came down the corridor outside the plastic curtain of the massage room and on to the end room of all the electric turkish bath the door sighed shut and a few minutes later sighed again as the attendant having installed count lippe came back down the corridor twenty minutes went by twentyfive bond rolled off the table well thanks sam youve done me a power of good ill be back to see you again one of these days i expect ill just go along and have a final salt rub and a sitz bath you cut along to your carrot cutlets dont worry about me ill let myself out when ive finished bond wrapped a towel round his waist and moved off down the corridor there was a flurry of movement and voices as the attendants got rid of their patients and made their way through the staff door for the luncheon break the last patient a reformed drunk called back from the entrance see you later irrigator somebody laughed now the pettyofficer voice of beresford sounded down the corridor making certain that everything was shipshape windows bill okay your next is mr dunbar at two sharp len tell the laundry we shall need more towels after lunch ted ted you there ted well then sam look after count lippe would you turkish bath bond had listened to this routine for a whole week noting the men that cut minutes off their duty and got off early to lunch noting the ones that stayed to do their full share of the last chores now from the open door of the empty shower room he called back in sams deep voice okay mr beresford and waited for the crisp squeak of the gym shoes on the linoleum there it was the brief pause halfway down the corridor and then the double sigh as the staff door opened and shut now there was dead silence save for the hum of the fans the treatment rooms were empty now there was only james bond and count lippe bond waited a moment and then came out of the shower room and softly opened the door to the turkish bath he had had one session in the place just to get the geography clear in his mind and the scene was exactly as he remembered it was a white cubicle treatment room like all the others but in this one the only object was a big cream metalandplastic box about five feet tall by four feet square it was closed on all sides but the top the front of the big cabinet was hinged to allow a patient to climb in and sit inside and there was a hole in the top with a foamrubber support for the nape of the neck and the chin through which the patients head emerged the rest of his body was exposed to the heat from many rows of naked electric bulbs inside the cabinet and the degree of heat was thermostatically controlled by a dial at the back of the cabinet it was a simple sweat box designed as bond had noticed on his previous visit to the room by the medikalischer maschinenbau gmbh franziskanerstrasse ulm bavaria the cabinet faced away from the door at the hiss of the hydraulic fastener count lippe said angrily goddammit beresford let me out of this thing im sweating like a pig you said you wanted it hot sir bonds amiable voice was a good approximation to the chief attendants dont argue goddammit let me out of here i dont think you quite realize the value of heat in the hcure sir heat resolves many of the toxins in the blood stream and for the matter of that in the muscle tissue also a patient suffering from your condition of pronounced toxemia will find much benefit from the heat treatment bond found the hlingo rattling quite easily off the tongue he was not worried about the consequences to beresford he would have the solid alibi of luncheon in the staff canteen dont give me that crap i tell you let me out of here bond examined the dial on the back of the machine the needle stood at what should he give the man the dial ran up to degrees that much might roast him alive this was only to be a punishment not a murder perhaps would be a just retribution bond clicked the knob up to he said i think just half an hour of real heat will do you the world of good sir bond dropped the sham voice he added sharply and if you catch fire you can sue the dripping head tried to turn failed bond moved toward the door count lippe now had a new voice controlled but desperate he said woodenly concealing the knowledge and the hate give you a thousand pounds and were quits he heard the hiss of the open door ten thousand all right then fifty bond closed the door firmly behind him and walked quickly down the corridor to put on his clothes and get out behind him deeply muffled came the first shout for help bond closed his ears there was nothing that a painful week in hospital and plenty of gentian violet or tannic acid jelly wouldnt cure but it did cross his mind that a man who could offer a bribe of fifty thousand pounds must be either very rich or have some very urgent reason for needing freedom of movement it was surely too much to pay just for avoidance of pain james bond was right the outcome of this rather childish trial of strength between two extremely tough and ruthless men in the bizarre surroundings of a nature clinic in sussex was to upset if only in a minute fashion the exactly timed machinery of a plot that was about to shake the governments of the western world spectre the boulevard haussmann in the viiith and ixth arrondissements stretches from the rue du faubourg st honorй to the opйra it is very long and very dull but it is perhaps the solidest street in the whole of paris not the richest the avenue diйna has that distinction but rich people are not necessarily solid people and too many of the landlords and tenants in the avenue diйena have names ending in escu ovitch ski and stein and these are sometimes not the endings of respectable names moreover the avenue diйna is almost entirely residential the occasional discreet brass plates giving the name of a holding company in liechtenstein or in the bahamas or the canton de vaud in switzerland are there for tax purposes only the cover names for private family fortunes seeking alleviation from the punitive burden of the revenue or more briefly taxdodging the boulevard haussmann is not like that the massive turnofthecentury bastard second empire buildings in heavily ornamented brick and stucco are the sieges the seats of important businesses here are the head offices of the gros industriels from lille lyons bordeaux clermont ferrand the locaux of the gros lйgumes the big vegetables in cotton artificial silk coal wine steel and shipping if among them there are some flybynights concealing a lack of serious capital des fonds sйrieux behind a good address it would only be fair to admit that such men of paper exist also behind the even solider frontages of lombard and wall streets it is appropriate that among this extremely respectable company of tenants suitably diversified by a couple of churches a small museum and the french shakespeare society you should also find the headquarters of charitable organizations at no bis for instance a discreetly glittering brass plate says firco and underneath fraternitй internationale de la rйsistance contre loppression if you were interested in this organization either as an idealist or because you were a salesman of say office furniture and you pressed the very clean porcelain bell button the door would in due course be opened by an entirely typical french concierge if your business was serious or obviously wellmeaning the concierge would show you across a rather dusty hall to tall bogus directoire double doors adjoining the overornamented cage of a shakylooking lift inside the doors you would be greeted by exactly what you had expected to see a large dingy room needing a fresh coat of its cafйaulait paint in which half a dozen men sat at cheap desks and typed or wrote amidst the usual accouterments of a busy organization in and out baskets telephones in this case the oldfashioned standard ones that are typical of such an office in this part of paris and dark green metal filing cabinets in which drawers stand open if you were observant of small details you might register that all the men were of approximately the same age group between thirty and forty and that in an office where you would have expected to find women doing the secretarial work there were none inside the tall door you would receive the slightly defensive welcome appropriate to a busy organization accustomed to the usual proportion of cranks and timewasters but in response to your serious inquiry the face of the man at the desk near the door would clear and become cautiously helpful the aims of the fraternity we exist monsieur to keep alive the ideals that flourished during the last war among members of all resistance groups no monsieur we are entirely unpolitical our funds they come from modest subscriptions from our members and from certain private persons who share our aims you have perhaps a relative a member of a resistance group whose whereabouts you seek certainly monsieur the name gregor karlski last heard of with mihailovitch in the summer of jules karlski gregor mihailovitch jules would go to a cabinet and there would be a brief pause then the reply might come back dead killed in the bombing of the generals headquarters october st i regret monsieur is there anything further we can do for you then perhaps you would care to have some of our literature forgive me for not having time to spare to give you more details of firco myself but you will find everything there this happens to be a particularly busy day this is the international refugee year and we have many inquiries such as yours from all over the world good afternoon monsieur pas de quoi so or more or less so it would be and you would go out on to the boulevard satisfied and even impressed with an organization that was doing its excellent if rather vague work with so much dedication and efficiency on the day after james bond had completed his nature cure and had left for london after the night before scoring a most satisfactory left and right of spaghetti bolognese and chianti at luciens in brighton and of miss patricia fearing on the squab seats from her bubble car high up on the downs an emergency meeting of the trustees of firco was called for seven oclock in the evening the men for they were all men came from all over europe by train or car or airplane and they entered no bis singly or in pairs some by the front door and some by the back at intervals during the late afternoon and evening each man had his allotted time for arriving at these meetings so many minutes up to two hours before zero hour and each man alternated between the back and the front door from meeting to meeting now there were two concierges for each door and other less obvious security measures warning systems closedcircuit television scanning of the two entrances and complete sets of dummy firco minutes backed up one hundred per cent by the current business of the firco organization on the ground floor thus if necessary the deliberations of the trustees could in a matter only of seconds be switched from clandestine to overt as solidly overt as any meeting of principals in the boulevard haussmann could possibly be at seven oclock precisely the twenty men who made up this organization strode lounged or sidled each according to his character into the workmanlike board room on the third floor their chairman was already in his seat no greetings were exchanged they were ruled by the chairman to be a waste of breath and in an organization of this nature hypocritical the men filed round the table and took their places at their numbers the numbers from one to twentyone that were their only names and that as a small security precaution advanced round the rota by two digits at midnight on the first of every month nobody smoked drinking was taboo and smoking frowned upon and nobody bothered to glance down at the bogus firco agenda on the table in front of him they sat very still and looked up the table at the chairman with expressions of the sharpest interest and what in lesser men would have been obsequious respect any man seeing no for that was the chairmans number of the month even for the first time would have looked at him with some degree of the same feelings for he was one of those men one meets perhaps only two or three in a lifetime who seem almost to suck the eyes out of your head these rare men are apt to possess three basic attributes their physical appearance is extraordinary they have a quality of relaxation of inner certainty and they exude a powerful animal magnetism the herd has always recognized the otherworldliness of these phenomena and in primitive tribes you will find that any man singled out by nature in this fashion will also have been chosen by the tribe to be their chief certain great men of history perhaps genghis khan alexander the great napoleon among the politicians have had these qualities perhaps they even explain the hypnotic sway of an altogether more meager individual the otherwise inexplicable adolf hitler over eighty million of the most gifted nation in europe certainly no had these qualities and any man in the street would have recognized them let alone these twenty chosen men for them despite the deep cynicism ingrained in their respective callings despite their basic insensitivity toward the human race he was however reluctantly their supreme commander almost their god this mans name was ernst stavro blofeld and he was born in gdynia of a polish father and a greek mother on may th after matriculating in economics and political history at the university of warsaw he studied engineering and radionics at the warsaw technical institute and at the age of twentyfive obtained a modest post in the central administration of the ministry of posts and telegraphs this would seem a curious choice for such a highly gifted youth but blofeld had come to an interesting conclusion about the future of the world he had decided that fast and accurate communication lay in a contracting world at the very heart of power knowledge of the truth before the next man in peace or war lay he thought behind every correct decision in history and was the source of all great reputations he was doing very well on this theory watching the cables and radiograms that passed through his hands at the central post office and buying or selling on margin on the warsaw bourse only occasionally when he was absolutely certain but then very big when the basic nature of the postal traffic changed now poland was mobilizing for war and a spate of munition orders and diplomatic cables poured through his department blofeld changed his tactics this was valuable stuff worth nothing to him but priceless to the enemy clumsily at first and then more expertly he contrived to take copies of cables choosing for the ciphers hid their contents from him only those prefixed most immediate or most secret then working carefully he built up in his head a network of fictitious agents these were real but small people in the various embassies and armament firms to whom most of the traffic was addressed a junior cipher clerk in the british embassy a translator working for the french private secretaries real ones in the big firms these names were easily obtained from the diplomatic lists by ringing up a firm and asking inquiries for the name of the chairmans private secretary he was speaking for the red cross they wished to discuss the possibility of a donation from the chairman and so on when blofeld had all his names right he christened his network tartar and made a discreet approach to the german military attache with one or two specimens of its work he was rapidly passed on to the representative of amt iv of the abwehr and from then on things were easy when this pot was bubbling merrily and the money coming in he proceeded to widen his market he considered the russians but dismissed them and the czechs as probable non or at any rate slow payers instead he chose the americans and the swedes and money positively showered in on him he soon realized for he was a man of almost mimosaic sensibility in matters of security that the pace could not possibly last there would be a leak perhaps between the swedish and german secret services who he knew were working closely together in some territories or through allied counterespionage or their cryptographic services or else one of his notional agents would die or be transferred without his knowledge while he continued to use the name as a source anyway by now he had and there was the added spur that the war was getting too close for comfort it was time for him to be off into the wide world into one of the safe bits of it blofeld carried out his withdrawal expertly first he slowly petered off the service security he explained was being tightened up by the english and the french perhaps there had been a leak he looked with mild reproof into the eyes of his contact this secretary had had a change of heart that one was asking too much money then he went to his friend on the bourse and after sealing his lips with a thousand dollars had all his funds invested in shell bearer bonds in amsterdam and thence transferred to a numbered safe deposit box with the diskonto bank in zurich before the final step of telling his contacts that he was brulй and that the polish deuxiиme bureau was sniffing at his heels he paid a visit to gdynia called on the registrar and on the church where he had been baptized and on the pretext of looking up details of an invented friend neatly cut out the page recording his own name and birth it remained only to locate the passport factory that operates in every big seaport and purchase a canadian seamans passport for then he was off to sweden by the next boat after a pause in stockholm for a careful look round the world and some cool thinking about the probable course of the war he flew to turkey on his original polish passport transferred his money from switzerland to the ottoman bank in istanbul and waited for poland to fall when in due course this happened he claimed refuge in turkey and spent a little money among the right officials in order to get his claim established then he settled down ankara radio was glad to have his expert services and he set up rahir another espionage service built on the lines of tartar but rather more solidly blofeld wisely waited to ascertain the victor before selling his wares and it was only when rommel had been kicked out of africa that he plumped for the allies he finished the war in a blaze of glory and prosperity and with decorations or citations from the british americans and french then with half a million dollars in swiss banks and a swedish passport in the name of serge angstrom he slipped off to south america for a rest some good food and a fresh think and now ernst blofeld the name to which he had decided it was perfectly safe to return sat in the quiet room in the boulevard haussmann gazed slowly round the faces of his twenty men and looked for eyes that didnt squarely meet his blofelds own eyes were deep black pools surrounded totally surrounded as mussolinis were by very clear whites the dolllike effect of this unusual symmetry was enhanced by long silken black eyelashes that should have belonged to a woman the gaze of these soft dolls eyes was totally relaxed and rarely held any expression stronger than a mild curiosity in the object of their focus they conveyed a restful certitude in their owner and in their analysis of what they observed to the innocent they exuded confidence a wonderful cocoon of confidence in which the observed one could rest and relax knowing that he was in comfortable reliable hands but they stripped the guilty or the false and made him feel transparent as transparent as a fishbowl through whose sides blofeld examined with only the most casual curiosity the few solid fish the grains of truth suspended in the void of deceit or attempted obscurity blofelds gaze was a microscope the window on the world of a superbly clear brain with a focus that had been sharpened by thirty years of danger and of keeping just one step ahead of it and of an inner selfassurance built up on a lifetime of success in whatever he hadattempted the skin beneath the eyes that now slowly mildly surveyed his colleagues was unpouched there was no sign of debauchery illness or old age on the large white bland face under the square wiry black crewcut the jaw line going to the appropriate middleaged fat of authority showed decision and independence only the mouth under a heavy squat nose marred what might have been the face of a philosopher or a scientist proud and thin like a badly healed wound the compressed dark lips capable only of false ugly smiles suggested contempt tyranny and cruelty but to an almost shakespearian degree nothing about blofeld was small blofelds body weighed about two hundred and eighty pounds it had once been all muscle he had been an amateur weightlifter in his youth but in the past ten years it had softened and he had a vast belly that he concealed behind roomy trousers and wellcut doublebreasted suits tailored that evening out of beige doeskin blofelds hands and feet were long and pointed they were quickmoving when they wanted to be but normally as now they were still and reposed for the rest he didnt smoke or drink and he had never been known to sleep with a member of either sex he didnt even eat very much so far as vices or physical weaknesses were concerned blofeld had always been an enigma to everyone who had known him the twenty men who looked up the long table at this man and waited patiently for him to speak were a curious mixture of national types but they had certain characteristics in common they were all in the thirtytoforty agegroup they all looked extremely fit and nearly all of them there were two who were different had quick hard predatory eyes the eyes of the wolves and the hawks that prey upon the herd the two who were different were both scientists with scientists otherworldly eyes kotze the east german physicist who had come over to the west five years before and had exchanged his secrets for a modest pension and retirement in switzerland and maslov formerly kandinsky the polish electronics expert who in had resigned as head of the radio research department of philips ag of eindhoven and had then disappeared into obscurity the other eighteen men consisted of cells of three from six national groups and within these groups from six of the worlds great criminal and subversive organizations there were three sicilians from the top echelon of the unione siciliano the mafia three corsican frenchmen from the union corse the secret society contemporary with and similar to the mafia that runs nearly all organized crime in france three former members of smersh the soviet organization for the execution of traitors and enemies of the state that had been disbanded on the orders of khrushchev in and replaced by the special executive department of the mwd three of the top surviving members of the former sonderdienst of the gestapo three tough yugoslav operatives who had resigned from marshal titos secret police and three highland turks formerly members of blofelds rahir and subsequently responsible for krystal the important middle east heroin pipeline whose outlet is beirut these eighteen men all experts in conspiracy in the highest ranges of secret communication and action and above all of silence also shared one supreme virtue every man had a solid cover every man possessed a valid passport with uptodate visas for the principal countries in the world and an entirely clean sheet with interpol and with their respective national police forces that factor alone the factor of each mans cleanliness after a lifetime in big crime was his highest qualification for membership of spectre the special executive for counterintelligence terrorism revenge and extortion the founder and chairman of this private enterprise for private profit was ernst stavro blofeld violetscented breath blofeld completed his inspection of the faces as he had anticipated only one pair of eyes had slid away from his he had known he was right the doublechecked reports had been entirely circumstantial but his own eyes and his intuition had to be the seal he slowly put both hands under the table one hand remained flat on his thigh the other went to a side pocket and drew out a thin gold vinaigrette and placed it on the table in front of him he prised open the lid with his thumbnail took out a violetscented cachou and slipped it into his mouth it was his custom when unpleasant things had to be said to sweeten his breath blofeld tucked the cachou under his tongue and began to talk in a soft resonant and very beautifully modulated voice i have a report to make to members about the big affair about plan omega but before i proceed to that matter for securitys sake i propose to touch upon another topic blofeld looked mildly round the table the same pair of eyes evaded his he continued in a narrative tone of voice the executive will agree that the first three years of our experience have been successful thanks in part to our german section the recovery of himmlers jewels from the mondsee was successfully accomplished in total secrecy and the stones disposed of by our turkish section in beirut income ј the disappearance of the safe with its contents intact from the mwd headquarters in east berlin has never been traced to our russian section and the subsequent sale to the american central intelligence agency yielded the interception of one thousand ounces of heroin in naples the property of the pastori circuit when sold to the firpone interests in los angeles brought in the british secret service paid ј for the czech germwarfare phials from the state chemical factory in pilsen the successful blackmail of former ss gruppenfьhrer sonntag living under the name of santos in havana yielded a meager unfortunately all the man possessed and the assassination of peringue the french heavywater specialist who went over to the communists through berlin added thanks to the importance of his knowledge and the fact that we got him before he had talked one billion francs from the deuxiиme bureau in round sums as the special executive knows from our accounts the total income to date not counting our last and undistributed dividend has amounted to approximately one and a half million pounds sterling in the swiss francs and venezuelan bolivars in which for reasons of prudence they continue to be the hardest currencies in the world we convert all our takings this income as the special executive will be aware has been distributed in accordance with our charter as to ten per cent for overheads and working capital ten per cent to myself and the remainder in equal shares of four per cent to the members a profit to each member of approximately ј this amount i regard as a barely adequate remuneration for members services ј a year is not in accordance with our expectations but you will be aware that plan omega will yield sufficient to provide each of us with a considerable fortune and will allow us if we wish to do so to wind up our organization and transfer our respective energies to other pursuits blofeld looked down the table he said amiably any questions the twenty pairs of eyes on this occasion all of them gazed stolidly unemotionally back at their chairman each man had made his own calculation knew his own mind there was no comment to be extracted from these good though narrow minds they were satisfied but it was not a part of their harsh personalities to say so these were known things that their chairman had spoken it was time for the unknown blofeld slipped a second cachou into his mouth maneuvered it under his tongue and continued then so be it and now to the last operation completed a month ago and yielding one million dollars blofelds eyes moved down the lefthand rank of members to the end of the row he said softly stand up no marius domingue of the union corse a proud chunky man with slow eyes who was wearing readymade rather sharp clothes that probably came from the galleries barbes in marseilles got slowly to his feet he looked squarely down the table at blofeld his big rough hands hung relaxed at the seams of his trousers blofeld appeared to answer his gaze but in fact he was noting the reaction of the corsican next to no no pierre borraud this man sat directly facing blofeld at the far end of the long table it was his eyes that had been evasive during the meeting now they were not now they were relaxed assured whatever the eyes had feared had passed blofeld addressed the company this operation you will recall involved the kidnaping of the seventeenyearold daughter of magnus blomberg owner of the principality hotel in las vegas and participant in other american enterprises through his membership of the detroit purple gang the girl was abducted from her fathers suite in the hotel de paris in monte carlo and taken by sea to corsica this part of the operation was executed by the corsican section one million dollars ransom was demanded mr blomberg was willing and in accordance with the instructions of spectre the money in an inflated life raft was dropped at dusk off the italian coast near san remo at nightfall the raft was recovered by the ship operated by our sicilian section this section is to be commended for detecting the transistorized radio transmitter concealed in the raft which it was intended should allow a unit of the french navy to directionfind our ship and hunt it down on receipt of the ransom money and in accordance with our undertaking the girl was returned to her parents apparently suffering from no ill effects except for the hair dye that had been necessary to transfer her from corsica to a wagonlit in the blue train from marseilles i say apparently from a source in the police commissariat at nice i now learn that the girl was violated during her captivity in corsica blofeld paused to allow this intelligence time to sink in he continued it is the parents who maintain that she was violated it is possible that only carnal knowledge with her consent was involved no matter this organization undertook that the girl would be returned undamaged without splitting hairs about the effect of sexual knowledge on a girl i am of the opinion that whether the act was voluntary or involuntary on the girls part she was returned to her parents in a damaged or at least used condition blofeld rarely employed gestures now he slowly opened the left hand that lay on the table he said in the same even tone of voice we are a large and powerful organization i am not concerned with morals or ethics but members will be aware that i desire and most strongly recommend that spectre shall conduct itself in a superior fashion there is no discipline in spectre except selfdiscipline we are a dedicated fraternity whose strength lies entirely in the strength of each member weakness in one member is the deathwatch beetle in the total structure you are aware of my views in this matter and on the occasions when cleansing has been necessary you have approved my action in this case i have already done what i considered necessary visavis this girls family i have returned half a million dollars with an appropriate note of apology this despite the matter of the radio transmitter which was a breach of our contract with the family i dare say they knew nothing of the ruse it was typical police behavior a pattern that i was expecting the dividend for all of us from this operation will be correspondingly reduced regarding the culprit i have satisfied myself that he is guilty i have decided on the appropriate action blofeld looked down the table his eyes were fixed on the man standing on no the corsican marius domingue looked back at him steadily he knew he was innocent he knew who was guilty his body was still with tension but it was not fear he had faith as they all had in the rightness of blofeld he could not understand why he had been singled out as a target for all the eyes that were now upon him but blofeld had decided and blofeld was always right blofeld noted the mans courage and sensed the reasons for it he also observed the sweat shining on the face of no the man alone at the head of the table good the sweat would improve the contact under the table blofelds right hand came up off his thigh found the knob and pulled the switch the body of pierre borraud seized in the iron fist of volts arced in the airchair as if it had been kicked in the back the rough mat of black hair rose sharply straight up on his head and remained upright a gollywog fringe for the contorted bursting face the eyes glared wildly and then faded a blackened tongue slowly protruded between the snarling teeth and remained hideously extended thin wisps of smoke rose from under the hands from the middle of the back and from under the thighs where the concealed electrodes in the chair had made contact blofeld pulled back the switch the lights in the room that had dimmed to orange making a dull supernatural glow brightened to normal the roastedmeat and burnedfabric smell spread slowly the body of no crumpled horribly there was a sharp crack as the chin hit the edge of the table it was all over blofelds soft even voice broke the silence he looked down the table at no he noted that the stanch impassive stance had not quavered this was a good man with good nerves blofeld said sit down no i am satisfied with your conduct it was necessary to distract the attention of no he knew that he was under suspicion there might have been an untidy scene some of the men round the table nodded their understanding as usual blofelds reasoning made good sense no one was greatly perturbed or surprised by what he had witnessed blofeld always exercised his authority meted out justice in full view of the members there had been two previous occasions of this nature both at similar meetings and both on security or disciplinary grounds which affected the cohesion the inner strength of the whole team in one the offender had been shot by blofeld through the heart with a thick needle fired from a compressedair pistol no mean feat at around twelve paces in the other the guilty man who had been seated next to blofeld on his left hand had been garroted with a wire noose casually flicked over his head and then with two swift steps by blofeld pulled tight over the back of the mans chair those two deaths had been just necessary so had this death the third now the members ignoring the heap of death at the end of the table settled in their chairs it was time to get back to business blofeld snapped shut the gold vinaigrette and slipped it into a waistcoat pocket the corsican section he said softly will put forward recommendations for a replacement for no but that can wait until after completion of plan omega on this matter there are certain details to be discussed suboperator g recruited by the german section has made an error a serious error which radically affects our time table this man whose membership of the red lightning tong in macao should have made him expert in conspiracy was instructed to make his headquarters at a certain clinic in the south of england an admirable refuge for his purposes his instructions were to keep intermittent contact with the airman petacchi at the notfardistant boscombe downs airfield where the bomber squadron is under training he was to report at intervals on the airmans fitness and morale his reports have been satisfactory and the airman by the way continues to be willing but suboperator g was also required to post the letter on d plus one or three days from now unfortunately this foolish man took it upon himself to become embroiled in a hotheaded fashion with some fellow patient at the clinic as a result of which and i need not go into details he is now in brighton central hospital suffering from seconddegree burns he is thus out of action for at least a week this will involve an irritating but fortunately not a serious delay in plan omega fresh instructions have been issued the airman petacchi has been provided with a phial of influenza virus of sufficient strength for him to remain on the sick list for one week during which he will be unable to accept his test flight he will take the first flight after his recovery and alert us accordingly the date of his flight will be communicated to suboperator g and he will by that time be recovered and will post the letter according to plan the special executive blofeld glanced round the table will readjust their flight schedules to area zeta in accordance with the new operational schedule as for suboperator g blofeld bent his gaze one by one on the three exgestapo men this is an unreliable agent the german section will make arrangements for his elimination within twentyfour hours of the posting of the letter is that understood the three german faces stood unanimously to attention yes sir for the rest continued blofeld all is in order no has solidly established his cover in area zeta the treasurehunting myth continues to be built up and has already gained full credence the crew of the yacht all handpicked suboperators are accepting the discipline and the security regulations better than had been expected a suitable land base has been secured it is remote and not easily accessible it belongs to an eccentric englishman the nature of whose friends and personal habits demands seclusion your arrival in area zeta continues to be minutely planned your wardrobe awaits you in areas f and d according to your various flight plans this wardrobe down to the smallest detail will be in accordance with your identities as financial backers of the treasure hunt who have demanded to visit the scene and take part in the adventure you are not gullible millionaires you are the kind of rich middleclass rentiers and businessmen who might be expected to be taken in by such a scheme you are all shrewd so you have come to watch over your investment and ensure that not one doubloon goes astray you are all aware of the part you have to play and i trust that you have studied your respective roles with close attention there was a careful nodding of heads round the table these men were all satisfied that not too much had been asked of them in the matter of their cover this one was a rich cafe proprietor from marseilles that one had vineyards in yugoslavia that one had smuggled cigarettes from tangier all of them had been given covers that would stand up at least to seconddegree inspection in the matter of aqualung training continued blofeld i would like reports from each section blofeld looked at the yugoslav section on his left satisfactory satisfactory echoed the german section and the word was repeated round the table blofeld commented the safety factor is paramount in all underwater operations has this factor received sufficient attention in your respective training schedules affirmative and exercises with the new co underwater gun again all sections reported favorably and now continued blofeld i would like a report from the sicilian section on the preparations for the bullion drop fidelio sciacca was a gaunt cadaverous sicilian with a closed face he might have been and had been a schoolmaster with communist leanings he spoke for the section because his english the compulsory language of the special executive was the best he said in a careful expository tone of voice the chosen area has been carefully reconnoitered it is satisfactory i have here he touched the briefcase on his lap the plans and detailed time table for the information of the chairman and members briefly the designated area area t is on the northwest slopes of mount etna above the tree line that is to say between the altitudes of two thousand and three thousand meters this is an uninhabited and uncultivated area of black lava on the upper slopes of the volcano more or less above the small town of bronte for the purpose of the drop an area approximately two kilometers square will be marked out by the torches of the recovery team in the center of this area will be positioned a decca aircraft homing signal as an additional navigational aid the bullion flight which i estimate conservatively will consist of five mark iv transport comets should make their run in at ten thousand feet at an air speed of three hundred miles per hour having regard to the weight of each consignment multiple parachutes will be needed and owing to the harsh nature of the terrain very careful packing in foam rubber will be essential the parachutes and the packings should be coated in dayglo or some phosphorescent paint to assist recovery no doubt the man opened his hands the spectre memorandum of dropping instructions will include these and other details but very careful planning and coordination by those responsible for the flight will be necessary and the recovery team blofelds voice probed softly but with an urgent edge to it the capo mafiosi of the district is my uncle he has eight grandchildren to whom he is devoted i have made it clear that the whereabouts of these children is known to my associates the man understood at the same time as instructed i made him the offer of one million pounds for total recovery and safe delivery to the depot at catania this is a most important sum for the funds of the unione the capo mafiosi agreed to these terms he understands that the robbery of a bank is in question he wishes to know no more the delay that has been announced will not affect the arrangements it will still be within the fullmoon period suboperator is a most capable man he has been provided with the hallicraftor set issued to me for the purpose and he will listen on megacycles in accordance with the schedule meanwhile he remains in touch with the capo mafiosi to whom he is related by marriage blofeld was silent for a long two minutes he slowly nodded i am satisfied so far as the next step is concerned the disposal of the bullion this will be in the hands of suboperator of whom we have had full experience he is a man to be trusted the mv mercurial will load at catania and proceed through the suez canal to goa in portuguese india en route at a designated crossbearing in the arabian gulf she will rendezvous with a merchant ship owned by a consortium of the chief bombay bullion brokers the bullion will be transferred to this ship in exchange for the equivalent value at the ruling gold bullion price in used swiss francs dollars and bolivars these large amounts of currency will be broken up into the allotted percentages and will then be transferred from goa by chartered plane to twentytwo different swiss banks in zurich where they will be placed in deposit boxes the keys to these numbered boxes will be distributed to members after this meeting from that moment on and subject of course to the usual security regulations regarding injudicious spending and display these deposits will be entirely at the disposal of members blofelds slow calm eyes surveyed the meeting is this procedure considered satisfactory there were cautious nods no kandinsky the polish electronics expert spoke up he spoke without diffidence there was no diffidence between these men this is not my province he said seriously but is there not danger that one of the navies concerned will intercept this ship the mercurial and remove the bullion it will be clear to the western powers that the bullion will have to be removed from sicily various patrols of the air and sea would be an easy matter you forget blofelds voice was patient that neither the first nor if need be the second bomb will be rendered safe until the money is in the swiss banks there will be no risk on that score nor another possibility that i had envisaged is there likely to be danger of our ship being pirated on the high seas by some independent operator i envisage that complete secrecy will be enforced by the western powers any leakage would result in panic any other questions bruno bayer one of the german section said stiffly it is fully understood that no will be in immediate control in area zeta is it correct that he will have full powers delegated by yourself is it that he will so to speak be supreme commander in the field how typical thought blofeld the germans will always obey orders but they wish to be quite clear where final authority resides the german generals would only obey the supreme command if they knew hitler approved the supreme command he said firmly i have made it clear to the special executive and i repeat no is already by your unanimous vote my successor in case of my death or incapacity so far as plan omega is concerned he is deputy supreme commander of spectre and since i shall remain at headquarters to keep watch over reactions to the letter no will be supreme commander in the field his orders will be obeyed as if they were my own i hope we are fully agreed in this matter blofelds eyes sharply focused swept the meeting everyone signified his agreement so said blofeld then the meeting is now closed i will instruct the disposal squad to take care of the remains of no no please connect me with no on megacycles that waveband will have been unoccupied by the french post office since eight oclock fasten your lapstrap james bond scraped the last dregs of yoghurt out of the bottom of the carton that said goatmilk culture from our own goat farm at stanway glos the heart of the cotswolds according to an authentic bulgarian recipe he took an energen roll sliced it carefully they are apt to crumble and reached for the black treacle he masticated each mouthful thoroughly saliva contains ptyalin thorough mastication creates ptyalin which helps to convert starches into sugar to supply energy for the body ptyalin is an enzyme other enzymes are pepsin found in the stomach and trypsin and erepsin found in the intestine these and other enzymes are chemical substances that break up the food as it passes through the mouth the stomach and the digestive tract and help absorb it directly into the blood stream james bond now had all these important facts at his fingertips he couldnt understand why no one had told him these things before since leaving shrublands ten days before he had never felt so well in his life his energy had doubled even the paper work he had always found an intolerable drudgery was now almost a pleasure he ate it up sections after a period of being only surprised were now becoming slightly irritated by the forceful clearheaded minutes that came shooting back at them from the doubleo section bond awoke so early and so full of beans that he had taken to arriving at his office early and leaving late much to the irritation of his secretary the delectable loelia ponsonby who found her own private routines being put seriously out of joint she also was beginning to show signs of irritation and strain she had even taken upon herself to have a private word with miss moneypenny ms private secretary and her best friend in the building miss moneypenny swallowing her jealousy of loelia ponsonby had been encouraging its all right lil she had said over coffee in the canteen the old man was like that for a couple of weeks after he had got back from that damned naturecure place it was like working for gandhi or schweitzer or someone then a couple of bad cases came up and rattled him and one evening he went to blades to take his mind off things i suppose and the next day he felt awful and looked it and from then on hes been all right again i suppose he got back on the champagne cure or something its really the best for men it makes them awful but at least theyre human like that its when they get godlike one cant stand them may bonds elderly scottish treasure came in to clear the breakfast things away bond had lit up a duke of durham kingsize with filter the authoritative consumers union of america rates this cigarette the one with the smallest tar and nicotine content bond had transferred to the brand from the fragrant but powerful morland balkan mixture with three gold rings round the paper that he had been smoking since his teens the dukes tasted of almost nothing but they were at least better than vanguards the new tobaccoless cigarette from america that despite its healthprotecting qualities filled the room with a faint burning leaves smell that made visitors to his office inquire whether something was on fire somewhere may was fiddling about with the breakfast things her signal that she had something to say bond looked up from the center news page of the times anything on your mind may mays elderly severe features were flushed she said defensively i have that she looked straight at bond she was holding the yoghurt carton in her hand she crumpled it in her strong fingers and dropped it among the breakfast things on the tray its not my place to say it mister james but yere poisoning yersel bond said cheerfully i know may youre quite right but at least ive got them down to ten a day im not talking about yer wee bitty smoke im talking bout this may gestured at the tray

theyll be bringing ye home in a hearse thats what theyll be doing in the old days james bond would have told may to go to hell and leave him in peace now with infinite patience and good humor he gave may a quick run through the basic tenets of live as against dead foods you see may he said reasonably all these denaturized foods white flour white sugar white rice white salts whites of egg these are dead foods either theyre dead anyway like whites of egg or theyve had all the nourishment refined out of them theyre slow poisons like fried foods and cakes and coffee and heaven knows how many of the things i used to eat and anyway look how wonderfully well i am i feel absolutely a new man since i took to eating the right things and gave up drink and so on i sleep twice as well ive got twice as much energy no headaches no muscle pains no hangovers why a month ago there wasnt a week went by but that on at least one day i couldnt eat anything for breakfast but a couple of aspirins and a prairie oyster and you know quite well that that used to make you cluck and tuttut all over the place like an old hen well bond raised his eyebrows amiably what about that may was defeated she picked up the tray and with a stiff back made for the door she paused on the threshold and turned round her eyes were bright with angry tears well all i can say is mr james that mebbe yere right and mebbe yere wrong what worries the life out of me is that yere not yersel any more she went out and banged the door bond sighed and picked up the paper he said the magical words that all men say when a middleaged woman makes a temperamental scene change of life and went back to reading about the latest reasons for not having a summit meeting the telephone the red one that was the direct line with headquarters gave its loud distinctive jangle bond kept his eyes on the page and reached out a hand with the cold war easing off it was not like the old days this would be nothing exciting probably canceling his shoot at bisley that afternoon with the new fn rifle bond speaking it was the chief of staff bond dropped his paper on the floor he pressed the receiver to his ear trying as in the old days to read behind the words at once please james m something for me something for everyone crash dive and ultra hush if youve got any dates for the next few weeks better cancel them youll be off tonight see you the line went dead bond had the most selfish car in england it was a mark ii continental bentley that some rich idiot had married to a telegraph pole on the great west road bond had bought the bits for ј and rolls had straightened the bend in the chassis and fitted new clockwork the mark iv engine with compression then bond had gone to mulliners with ј which was half his total capital and they had sawn off the old cramped sports saloon body and had fitted a trim rather square convertible twoseater affair poweroperated with only two large armed bucket seats in black leather the rest of the blunt end was all knifeedged rather ugly trunk the car was painted in rough not gloss battleship gray and the upholstery was black morocco she went like a bird and a bomb and bond loved her more than all the women at present in his life rolled if that were feasible together but bond refused to be owned by any car a car however splendid was a means of locomotion and it must at all times be ready to locomote no garage doors to break ones nails on no pampering with mechanics except for the quick monthly service the locomotive slept out of doors in front of his flat and was required to start immediately in all weathers and after that stay on the road the twin exhausts bond had demanded twoinch pipes he hadnt liked the old soft flutter of the marque growled solidly as the long gray nose topped by a big octagonal silver bolt instead of the winged b swerved out of the little chelsea square and into kings road it was nine oclock too early for the bad traffic and bond pushed the car fast up sloane street and into the park it would also be too early for the traffic police so he did some fancy driving that brought him to the marble arch exit in three minutes flat then there came the slow roundthehouses into baker street and so into regents park within ten minutes of getting the hurry call he was going up in the lift of the big square building to the eighth and top floor already as he strode down the carpeted corridor he smelled emergency on this floor besides ms offices was housed communications and from behind the gray closed doors there came a steady zing and crackle from the banks of transmitters and a continuous machinegun rattle and clack from the cipher machines it crossed bonds mind that a general call was going out what the hell had happened the chief of staff was standing over miss moneypenny he was handing her signals from a large sheaf and giving her routing instructions cia washington personal for dulles cipher triple x by teleprinter mathis deuxiиme bureau same prefix and route station f for head of nato intelligence personal standard route through head of section this one by safe hand to head of mi personal copy to commissioner of police personal and these he handed over a thick batch personal to heads of stations from m cipher double x by whitehall radio and portishead all right clear them as quick as you can theres a good girl therell be more coming were in for a bad day miss moneypenny smiled cheerfully she liked what she called the shotandshell days it reminded her of when she had started in the service as a junior in the cipher department she leaned over and pressed the switch on the intercom s here sir she looked up at bond youre off the chief of staff grinned and said fasten your lapstrap the red light went on above ms door bond walked through here it was entirely peaceful m sat relaxed sideways to his desk looking out of the broad window at the distant glittering fretwork of londons skyline he glanced up sit down have a look at these he reached out and slid some foolscapsized photostats across the desk take your time he picked up his pipe and began to fill it absentminded fingers dipping into the shellbase tobacco jar at his elbow bond picked up the top photostat it showed the front and back of an addressed envelope dusted for fingerprints which were all over its surface m glanced sideways smoke if you like bond said thanks sir im trying to give it up m said humpf put his pipe in his mouth struck a match and inhaled a deep lungful of smoke he settled himself deeper in his chair the gray sailors eyes gazed through the window introspectively seeing nothing the envelope prefixed personal and most immediate was addressed to the prime minister by name at no downing street whitehall london sw every detail of the address was correct down to the final pc to denote that the prime minister was a privy councillor the punctuation was meticulous the stamp was postmarked brighton am on june it crossed bonds mind that the letter might therefore have been posted under cover of night and that it would probably have been delivered some time in the early afternoon of the same day yesterday a typewriter with a bold rather elegant type had been used this fact together with the generous by ѕinch envelope and the spacing and style of the address gave a solid businesslike impression the back of the envelope showed nothing but fingerprints there was no sealing wax the letter equally correct and well laid out ran as follows mr prime minister you should be aware or you will be if you communicate with the chief of the air staff that since approximately pm yesterday nd june a british aircraft carrying two atomic weapons is overdue on a training flight the aircraft is villiers vindicator onbr from no raf experimental squadron based at boscombe down the ministry of supply identification numbers on the atomic weapons are mosbdmk v and mos bdmk v there are also usaf identification numbers in such profusion and of such prolixity that i will not weary you with them this aircraft was on a nato training flight with a crew or five and one observer it carried sufficient fuel for ten hours flying at mph at a mean altitude of feet this aircraft together with the two atomic weapons is now in the possession of this organization the crew and the observer are deceased and you have our authority to inform the nextofkin accordingly thus assisting you in preserving on the grounds that the aircraft has crashed the degree of secrecy you will no doubt wish to maintain and which will be equally agreeable to ourselves the whereabouts of this aircraft and of the two atomic weapons rendering them possible of recovery will be communicated to you in exchange for the equivalent of ј in gold bullion one thousand or not less than nine hundred and ninetynine fine instructions for the delivery of the gold are contained in the attached memorandum a further condition is that the recovery and disposal of the gold will not be hampered and that a free pardon under your personal signature and that of the president of the united states will be issued in the name of this organization and all its members failure to accept these conditions within seven days from pm gmt on june rd ie not later than pm gmt on june th will have the following consequences immediately after that date a piece of property belonging to the western powers valued at not less than the aforesaid ј will be destroyed there will be loss of life if within hours after this warning willingness to accept our terms is still not communicated there will ensue without further warning the destruction of a major city situated in an undesignated country of the world there will be very great loss of life moreover between the two occurrences this organization will reserve to itself the right to communicate to the world the hour time limit this measure which will cause widespread panic in every major city will be designed to hasten your hand this mr prime minister is a single and final communication we shall await your reply every hour on the hour gmt on the megacycle waveband signed spectre james bond read through the letter again and put it carefully down on the desk in front of him he then turned to the second page a detailed memorandum for the delivery of the gold northwestern slopes of mount etna in sicily decca navigational aid transmitting on full moon period between midnight and gmt individual quarterton consignments packed in onefootthick foam rubber minimum of three parachutes per consignment nature of planes and flight schedule to be communicated on the megacycle waveband not later than hours before the operation any countermeasures initiated will be considered a breach of contract and will result in the detonation of atomic weapon no or no as the case may be the typed signature was the same both pages had one last line copy to the president of the united states of america by registered airmail posted simultaneously bond laid the photostat quietly down on top of the others he reached into his hip pocket for the gunmetal cigarette case that now contained only nine cigarettes took one and lit it drawing the smoke deep down into his lungs and letting it out with a long reflective hiss m swiveled his chair round so they were facing each other well bond noticed that ms eyes three weeks before so clear and vital were now bloodshot and strained no wonder he said if this plane and the weapons really are missing i think it stands up sir i think they mean it i think its a true bill m said so does the war cabinet so do i he paused yes the plane with the bombs is missing and the stock numbers on the bombs are correct big fleas have little fleas bond said what is there to go on sir damned little practically speaking nothing nobodys ever heard of these spectre people we know theres some kind of independent unit working in europe weve bought some stuff from them so have the americans and mathis admits now that goltz that french heavywater scientist who went over last year was assassinated by them for big money as a result of an offer he got out of the blue no names were mentioned it was all done on the radio the same megacycles thats mentioned in the letter to the deuxiиme communications section mathis accepted on the offchance they did a neat job mathis paid up a suitcase full of money left at a michelin road sign on n but no one can tie them in with these spectre people when we and the americans dealt there were endless cutouts really professional ones and anyway we were more interested in the end product than the people involved we both paid a lot of money but it was worth it if its the same group working this theyre a serious outfit and ive told the pm so but thats not the point the plane is missing and the two bombs just as the letter says all details exactly correct the vindicator was on a nato training flight south of ireland and out into the atlantic m reached for a bulky folder and turned over some pages he found what he wanted yes it was to be a sixhour flight leaving boscombe down at eight pm and due back at two am there was an raf crew of five and a nato observer an italian man called petacchi giuseppi petacchi squadron leader in the italian air force seconded to nato fine flyer apparently but theyre checking on his background now he was sent over here on a normal tour of duty the top pilots from nato have been coming over for months to get used to the vindicator and the bombrelease routines this planes apparently going to be used for the nato longrange striking force anyway m turned over a page the plane was watched on the screen as usual and all went well until it was west of ireland at about forty thousand feet then contrary to the drill it came down to around thirty thousand and got lost in the transatlantic air traffic bomber command tried to get in touch but the radio couldnt or wouldnt answer the immediate reaction was that the vindicator had hit one of the transatlantic planes and there was something of a panic but none of the companies reported any trouble or even a sighting m looked across at bond and that was the end of it the plane just vanished bond said did the american dew line pick it up their defense early warning system theres a query on that the only grain of evidence weve got ap parently about five hundred miles east of boston there was some evidence that a plane had peeled off the inward route to idlewild and turned south but thats another big traffic lane for the northern traffic from montreal and gander down to bermuda and the bahamas and south america so these dew operators just put it down as a boac or transcanada plane it certainly sounds as if theyve got the whole thing worked out pretty well hiding in these traffic lanes could the plane have turned northwards in the middle of the atlantic and made for russia yes or southwards theres a big block of space about five hundred miles out from both shores thats out of radar range better still it could have turned on its tracks and come back in to europe on any of two or three air lanes in fact it could be almost anywhere in the world by now thats the point but its a huge plane it must need special runways and so on it must have come down somewhere you cant hide a plane of that size just so all these things are obvious by midnight last night the raf had checked with every single airport every one in the world that could have taken it negative but the cas says of course it could be crashlanded in the sahara for instance or on some other desert or in the sea in shallow water wouldnt that explode the bombs no theyre absolutely safe until theyre armed apparently even a direct drop like that one from the b over north carolina in would only explode the tnt trigger to the thing not the plutonium how are these spectre people going to explode them then m spread his hands they explained all this at the war cabinet meeting i dont understand it all but apparently an atomic bomb looks just like any other bomb the way it works is that the nose is full of ordinary tnt with the plutonium in the tail between the two theres a hole into which you screw some sort of a detonator a kind of plug when the bomb hits the tnt ignites the detonator and the detonator sets off the plutonium so these people would have to drop the bomb to set it off apparently not they would need a man with good physics knowledge who understood the thing but then all hed have to do would be to unscrew the nose cone on the bomb the ordinary detonator that sets off the tnt and fix on some kind of time fuse that would ignite the tnt without it being dropped that would set the thing off and its not a very bulky affair you could get the whole thing into something only about twice the size of a big golf bag very heavy of course but you could put it into the back of a big car for instance and just run the car into a town and leave it parked with the time fuse switched on give yourself a couple of hours start to get out of range at least a hundred miles away and that would be that bond reached in his pocket for another cigarette it couldnt be yet it was so just what his service and all the other intelligence services in the world had been expecting to happen the anonymous little man in the raincoat with a heavy suitcase or golf bag if you like the left luggage office the parked car the clump of bushes in a park in the center of a big town and there was no answer to it in a few years time if the experts were right there would be even less answer to it every tinpot little nation would be making atomic bombs in their backyards so to speak apparently there was no secret now about the things it had only been the prototypes that had been difficult like the first gunpowder weapons for instance or machine guns or tanks today these were everybodys bows and arrows tomorrow or the day after the bows and arrows would be atomic bombs and this was the first blackmail case unless spectre was stopped the word would get round and soon every criminal scientist with a chemical set and some scrap iron would be doing it if they couldnt be stopped in time there would be nothing for it but to pay up bond said so thats about it commented m from every point of view including politics not that they matter all that much but neither the pm nor the president would last five minutes if anything went wrong but whether we pay or dont pay the consequences will be endless and all bad thats why absolutely everything has got to be done to find these people and the plane and stop the thing in time the pm and the president are entirely agreed every intelligence man all over the world whos on our side is being put on to this operation operation thunderball theyre calling it planes ships submarines and of course moneys no object we can have everything whenever we want it the cabinet have already set up a special staff and a war room every scrap of information will be fed into it the americans have done the same some kind of a leak cant be helped its being put about that all the panic and it is panic is because of the loss of the vindicator bombs included whatever fuss that may cause politically only the letter will be absolutely secret all the usual detective work fingerprints brighton writing paper thesell be looked after by scotland yard with the fbi interpol and all the nato intelligence organizations helping where they can only a segment of the paper and the typing will be used a few innocent words this will all be quite separate from the search for the plane thatll be handled as a top espionage matter no one should be able to connect the two investigations mi will handle the background to all the crew members and the italian observer that will be a natural part of the search for the plane as for the service weve teamed up with the cia to cover the world alien dulles is putting every man hes got onto it and so am i just sent out a general call now all we can do is sit back and wait bond lit another cigarette his sinful third in one hour he said putting unconcern into his voice where do i come in sir m looked vaguely at bond as if seeing him for the first time then he swiveled his chair and gazed again through the window at nothing finally he said in a conversational tone of voice i have committed a breach of faith with the pm in telling you all this i was under oath to tell no one what i have just told you i decided to do what i have done because i have an idea a hunch and i wish this idea to be pursued by a he hesitated by a reliable man it seemed to me that the only grain of possible evidence in this case was the dew radar plot a doubtful one i admit of the plane that left the eastwest air channel over the atlantic and turned south towards bermuda and the bahamas i decided to accept this evidence although it has not aroused much interest elsewhere i then spent some time studying a map and charts of the western atlantic and i endeavored to put myself in the minds of spectre or rather for there is certainly a master mind behind all this in the mind of the chief of spectre my opposite number so to speak and i came to certain conclusions i decided that a favorable target for bomb no and for bomb no if it comes to that would be in america rather than in europe to begin with the americans are more bombconscious than we in europe and therefore more susceptible to persuasion if it came to using bomb no installations worth more than ј and thus targets for bomb no are more numerous in america than in europe and finally guessing that spectre is a european organization from the style of the letter and from the paper which is dutch by the way and also from the ruthlessness of the plot it seemed to me at least possible that an amerrican rather than a european target might have been chosen anyway going on these assumptions and assuming that the plane could not nave landed in america itself or off american shores the coastal radar network is too good i looked for a neighboring area which might be suitable and m glanced round at bond and away again i decided on the bahamas the group of islands many of them uninhabited surrounded mostly by shoal water over sand and possessing only one simple radar station and that one concerned only with civilian air traffic and manned by local civilian personnel south towards cuba jamaica and the caribbean offers no worthwhile targets anyway it is too far from the american coastline northwards towards bermuda has the same disadvantages but the nearest of the bahama group is only two hundred miles only six or seven hours in a fast motorboat or yacht from the american coastline bond interrupted if youre right sir why didnt spectre send their letter to the president instead of the pm for the sake of obscurity to make us do what we are doing hunting all round the world instead of only in one part of it and for maximum impact spectre would realize that the arrival of the letter right on top of the loss of the bomber would hit us in the solar plexus it might they would reason even shake the money out of us without any further effort the next stage of their operation attacking target no is going to be a nasty business for them its going to expose their whereabouts to a considerable extent theyd like to collect the money and close the operation as quickly as possible thats what weve got to gamble on weve got to push them as close to the use of no bomb as we dare in the hope that something will betray them in the next six and threequarter days its a slim chance im pinning my hopes on my guess m swung his chair round to the desk and on you well he looked hard at bond any comments if not youd better get started youre booked on all new york planes from now until midnight then on by boac i thought of using an raf canberra but i dont want your arrival to make any noise youre a rich young man looking for some property in the islands thatll give you an excuse to do as much prospecting as you want well all right sir bond got to his feet id rather have had somewhere more interesting the iron curtain beat for instance i cant help feeling this is a bigger operation than a small unit could take on for my money this looks more like a russian job they get the experimental plane and the bombs they obviously want them and throw dust in our eyes with all this spectre ballyhoo if smersh was still in business id say theyd got a finger in it somewhere just their style but the eastern stations may pick up something on that if theres anything in the idea anything else sir who do i cooperate with in nassau the governor knows youre coming theyve got a welltrained police force cia are sending down a good man i gather with a communications outfit theyve got more of that sort of machinery than we have take a cipher machine with the triple x setting i want to hear every single detail you turn up personal to me right right sir bond went to the door and let himself out there was nothing more to be said this looked like the biggest job the service had ever been given and in bonds opinion for he didnt give much for ms guess he had been relegated to the back row of the chorus so be it he would get himself a good sunburn and watch the show from the wings when bond walked out of the building carrying the neat leather cipher case an expensive movie camera perhaps slung over his shoulder the man in the beige volkswagen stopped scratching the burnscab under his shirt loosened for the tenth time the longbarrelled in the holster under his arm started the car and put it in gear he was twenty yards behind bonds parked bentley he had no idea what the big building was he had simply obtained bonds home address from the receptionist at shrublands and as soon as he got out of the brighton hospital he had carefully tailed bond the car was hired under an assumed name when he had done what had to be done he would go straight to london airport and take the first plane out to any country on the continent count lippe was a sanguine individual the job the private score he had to settle presented no problem to him he was a ruthless vengeful man and he had eliminated many obstreperous and perhaps dangerous people in his life he reasoned that if they every came to hear of this spectre would not object the overheard telephone conversation on that first day at the clinic showed that his cover had been broached however slightly and it was just conceivable that he could be traced through his membership in the red lightning tong from there to spectre was a long step but suboperator g knew that once a cover began to run it ran like an old sock apart from that this man must be paid off count lippe had to be quits with him bond was getting into his car he had slammed the door suboperator g watched the blue smoke curl from the twin exhausts he got moving on the other side of the road and a hundred yards behind the volkswagen spectre no slipped his goggles down over his eyes stamped the cc triumph into gear and accelerated down the road he swerved neatly through the traffic he had been a test rider for dkw at one time in his postwar career and stationed himself ten yards behind the off rear wheel of the volkswagen and just out of the drivers line of vision in the windscreen mirror he had no idea why suboperator g was following the bentley nor whom the bentley belonged to his job was to kill the driver of the volkswagen he put his hand into the leather satchel he carried slung over his shoulder took out the heavy grenade it was twice the normal military size and watched the traffic ahead for the right pattern to allow his getaway suboperator g was watching for a similar pattern he also noted the spacing on the lampposts on the pavement in case he might be blocked and have to run off the road now the cars ahead were sparse he stamped his foot into the floor and driving with his left hand drew out the colt with his right now he was up with the bentleys rear bumper now he was alongside the dark profile was a sitting target with a last quick glance ahead he raised the gun it was the cheeky iron rattle of the volkswagens aircooled engine that made bond turn his head and it was this minute reduction of the target area that saved his jaw if he had then accelerated the second bullet would have got him but some blessed instinct made his foot stamp the brake at the same time as his head ducked so swiftly that his chin hit the horn button nearly knocking him out almost simultaneously instead of a third shot there came the roar of an explosion and the remains of his windshield already shattered cascaded around him the bentley had stopped the engine stalled brakes screamed there were shouts and the panicky screams of horns bond shook his head and cautiously raised it the volkswagen one wheel still spinning lay on its side in front and broadside to the bentley most of the roof had been blown off inside and half sprawling into the road was a horrible glinting mess flames were licking at the blistered paintwork people were gathering bond pulled himself together and got quickly out of his car he shouted stand back the petrol tankll go almost as he said the words there came a dull boom and a cloud of black smoke the flames spurted in the distance sirens sounded bond edged through the people and strode quickly back toward his headquarters his thoughts racing the inquiry made bond lose two planes to new york by the time the police had put out the fire and had transported the bits of man and the bits of machinery and bomb casing to the morgue it was quite clear that they would have nothing to go on but the shoes the number on the gun some fibers and shreds of clothing and the car the carhire people remembered nothing but a man with dark glasses a drivers license in the name of johnston and a handful of fivers the car had been hired three days before for one week plenty of people remembered the motorcyclist but it seemed that he had no rear number plate he had gone like a bat out of hell toward baker street he wore goggles medium build nothing else bond had not been able to help he had seen nothing of the volkswagen driver the roof of the volkswagen had been too low there had only been a hand and the glitter of a gun the secret service asked for a copy of the police report and m instructed that this should be sent to the thunderball war room he saw bond briefly again rather impatiently as if it had all been bonds fault then he told bond to forget about it it was probably something to do with one of his past cases a hangover of some kind the police would get to the bottom of it in time the main thing was operation thunderball bond had better get a move on by the time bond left the building for the second time it had begun to rain one of the mechanics from the car pool at the back of the building had done what he could knocking out the remains of the bentleys windscreen and cleaning the bits out of the car but when he got home at lunch time bond was soaked to the skin he left the car in a nearby garage telephoned rolls and his insurance company and then went home and had a bath and changed into his dark blue tropical worsted he packed carefully one large suitcase and a holdall for his underwater swimming gear and went through to the kitchen may was looking rather contrite it seemed as if she might make another speech bond held up his hand dont tell me may you were right i cant do my work on carrot juice ive got to be off in an hour and i need some proper food be an angel and make me your kind of scrambled eggs four eggs four rashers of that american hickorysmoked bacon if weve got any left hot buttered toast your kind not wholemeal and a big pot of coffee double strength and bring in the drink tray may looked at him relieved but aghast whatever happened mr james bond laughed at the expression on her face nothing may it just occurred to me that lifes too short plenty of time to watch the calories when one gets to heaven bond left may tuttutting at this profanity and went off to look to his armament multiple requiem so far as spectre was concerned plan omega had gone exactly as blofeld had known it would and phases i to iii in their entirety had been completed on schedule and without a hitch giuseppe petacchi the late giuseppe petacchi had been well chosen at the age of eighteen he had been copilot of a fockewulf from the adriatic antisubmarine patrol one of the few handpicked italian airmen who had been allowed to handle these german planes the group was issued with the latest german pressure mines charged with the new hexogen explosive just when the tide had turned in the allied battle up the spine of italy petacchi had known where his destiny lay and had gone into business for himself on a routine patrol he had shot the pilot and the navigator very carefully with one bullet in the back of the head for each of them and had brought the big plane skimming in just above the waves to avoid the antiaircraft fire to the harbor of bari then he had hung his shirt out of the cockpit as a token of surrender and had waited for the raf launch he had been decorated by the english and the americans for this exploit and had been awarded ј from special funds for his presentation to the allies of the pressure mine he had told a highly colored story to the intelligence people of having been a oneman resistance ever since he had been old enough to join the italian air force and he emerged at the end of the war as one of italys most gallant resistance heroes from then on life had been easy pilot and later captain in alitalia when it got going again and then back into the new italian air force as colonel his secondment to nato followed and then his appointment as one of the six italians chosen for the advance striking force but he was now thirtyfour and it occurred to him that he had had just about enough of flying he especially did not care for the idea of being part of the spearhead of nato defenses it was time for younger men to provide the heroics and all his life he had had a passion for owning things flashy exciting expensive things he had most of what he desired a couple of gold cigarette cases a solid gold rolex oyster perpetual chronometer on a flexible gold bracelet a white convertible lancia gran turismo plenty of sharp clothes and all the girls he wanted now he desired and what he desired he often got a particular ghiabodied gt maserati he had seen at the milan motor show he also wanted out out of the pale green corridors of nato out of the air force and therefore off to new worlds with a new name rio de janeiro sounded just right but all this meant a new passport plenty of money and organismo the vital organismo the organismo turned up and turned up bearing just those gifts that petacchi lusted for it came in the shape of an italian named fonda who was at that time no in spectre and who had been casing the personnel of nato via versailles and paris night clubs and restaurants for just such a man it had taken one whole very careful month to prepare the bait and inch it forward toward the fish and when it was finally presented no had been almost put off by the greed with which it had been gobbled there was delay while the possibility of a doublecross was probed by spectre but finally all the lights were green and the full proposition was laid out for inspection petacchi was to get on the vindicator training course and highjack the plane in exchange petacchi would receive a new passport in any name and nationality he chose and immediate onward passage from the point of delivery to rio de janeiro many details were discussed and perfected and when at eight oclock in the evening of that june nd the vindicator screamed off down the runway and out over st albans head petacchi was tense but confident for the training flights a couple of ordinary civil aircraft seats had been fixed inside the roomy fuselage just back of the large cockpit and petacchi sat quietly for a whole hour and watched the five men at work at the crowded dials and instruments when it came to his turn to fly the plane he was quite satisfied that he could dispense with all five of them once he had set george there would be nothing to do but stay awake and make certain from time to time that he was keeping exactly at feet just above the transatlantic air channel there would be a tricky moment when he turned off the eastwest channel on to the northsouth for the bahamas but this had all been worked out for him and every move he would have to make was written down in the notebook in his breast pocket the landing was going to need very steady nerves but for the steady nerves would be summoned for the tenth time petacchi consulted the rolex now he verified and tested the oxygen mask in the bulkhead beside him and laid it down ready next he took the little redringed cylinder out of his pocket and remembered exactly how many turns to give the release valve then he put it back in his pocket and went through into the cockpit hullo seppy enjoying the flight the pilot liked the italian they had gone out together on one or two majestic thrashes in bournemouth sure sure petacchi asked some questions verified the course set on george checked the air speed and altitude now everyone in the cockpit was relaxed almost drowsy five more hours to go rather a bind missing north by northwest at the odeon but one would catch up with it at southampton petacchi stood with his back to the metal map rack that held the log and the charts his right hand went to his pocket felt for the release valve and gave it three complete turns he eased the cylinder out of his pocket and slipped it behind him and down behind the books petacchi stretched and yawned is time for a zizz he said amiably he had got the slang phrase pat it rolled easily off the tongue the navigator laughed what do they call it in italian zizzo petacchi grinned cheerfully he went through the open hatch got back to his chair clamped on his oxygen mask and turned the control regulator to per cent oxygen to cut out the air bleed then he made himself comfortable and watched they had said it would take under five minutes sure enough in about two minutes the man nearest to the map rack the navigator suddenly clutched his throat and fell forward gargling horribly the radio operator dropped his earphones and started forward but with his second step he was down on his knees he lurched sideways and collapsed now the three other men began to fight for air briefly terribly the copilot and the flight engineer writhed off their stools together they clawed vaguely at each other and then fell back spreadeagled the pilot groped up toward the microphone above his head said something indistinctly got half to his feet turned slowly so that his bulging eyes already dead seemed to stare through the hatchway into petacchis and then thudded down on top of the body of his copilot petacchi glanced at his watch four minutes flat give them one more minute when the minute was up he took rubber gloves out of his pocket put them on and pressing the oxygen mask tight against his face and trailing the flexible tube behind him went forward reached down into the map rack and closed the valve on the cylinder of cyanide he verified george and adjusted the cabin pressurization to help clear the poison gas he then went back to his seat to wait for fifteen minutes they had said fifteen would be enough but at the last moment he gave it another ten and then still with his oxygen mask on he went forward again and began slowly for the oxygen made him rather breathless to pull the bodies back into the fuselage when the cockpit was clear he took a small phial of crystals out of his trousers pocket took out the cork and sprinkled the cabin floor with them he went down on his knees and watched the crystals they kept their white color he eased his oxygen mask away and took a small cautious sniff there was no smell but still when he took over the controls and began easing the plane down to and then slightly northwestbywest to get into the traffic lane he kept the mask on the giant plane whispered on into the night the cockpit bright with the yellow eyes of the dials was quiet and warm in the deafening silence in the cockpit of a big jet in flight there was only the faint buzz of an invector as he verified the dials the click of each switch seemed as loud as a smallcaliber pistol shot petacchi again checked george with the gyro and verified each fuel tank to see that they were all feeding evenly one tank pump needed adjustment the jetpipe temperatures were not overheating satisfied petacchi settled himself comfortably in the pilots seat and swallowed a benezedrine tablet and thought about the future one of the headphones scattered on the floor of the cockpit began to chirrup loudly petacchi glanced at his watch of course boscombe air traffic control was trying to raise the vindicator he had missed the third of the halfhourly calls how long would air control wait before alerting air sea rescue bomber command and the air ministry there would first be checks and doublechecks with the southern rescue center they would probably take another half hour and by that time he would be well out over the atlantic the chirrup of the headphones went quiet petacchi got up from his seat and took a look at the radar screen he watched it for some time noting the occasional blip of planes being overhauled below him would his own swift passage above the air corridor be noted by the planes as he passed above them unlikely the radar on commercial planes has a limited field of vision in a forward cone he would almost certainly not be spotted until he crossed the defense early warning line and dew would probably put him down as a commercial jet that had strayed above its normal channel petacchi went back to the pilots seat and again minutely checked the dials he weaved the plane gently to get the feel of the controls behind him the bodies on the floor of the fuselage stirred uneasily the plane answered perfectly it was like driving a beautiful quiet motor car petacchi dreamed briefly of the maserati what color better not his usual white or anything spectacular dark blue with a thin red line along the coachwork something quiet and respectable that would fit in with his new quiet identity it would be fun to run her in some of the trials and road races even the mexican but that would be too dangerous supposing he won and his picture got into the papers no he would have to cut out anything like that he would only drive the car really fast when he wanted to get a girl they melted in a fast car why was that the sense of surrender to the machine to the man whose strong sunburned hands were on the wheel but it was always so you turned the car into a wood after ten minutes at and you would almost have to lift the girl out and lay her down on the moss her limbs would be so trembling and soft petacchi pulled himself out of the daydream he glanced at his watch the vindicator was already four hours out at mph one certainly covered the miles the coastline of america should be on the screen by now he got up and had a look yes there miles away was the coastline map already in high definition the bulge that was boston and the silvery creek of the hudson river no need to check his position with weather ships delta or echo that would be somewhere below him he was dead on course and it would soon be time to turn off the eastwest channel petacchi went back to his seat munched another benezedrine tablet and consulted his chart he got his hands to the controls and watched the eerie glow of the gyro compass now he eased the controls gently round in a fairly tight curve then he flattened out again edged the plane exactly on to its new course and reset george now he was flying due south now he was on the last lap a bare three hours to go it was time to start worrying about the landing petacchi took out his little notebook watch for the lights of grand bahama to port and palm beach to starboard be ready to pick up the navigational aids from no s yacht dotdotdash dotdotdash jettison fuel lose height to around feet for the last quarter of an hour kill speed with the air brakes and lose more height watch out for the flashing red beacon and prepare for the final approach flaps down only at the check altitude with about knots indicated depth of water will be feet you will have plenty of time to get out of the escape hatch you will be taken on board no s yacht there is a bahamas airways flight to miami at on the next morning and then braniff or real airlines for the rest of the way no will give you the money in dollar bills or in travellers cheques he will have both available also the passport in the name of enrico valli company director petacchi checked his position course and speed only one more hour to go it was three am gmt nine pm nassau time a full moon was coming up and the carpet of clouds feet below was a snowfield petacchi dowsed the collision lights on his wingtips and fuselage he checked the fuel gallons including the reserve tanks he would need for the last four hundred miles he pulled the release valve on the reserve tanks and lost gallons with the loss of weight the plane began to climb slowly and he corrected back to now there was twenty minutes to go time to begin the long descent down through the cloud base the moments of blindness and then far below the sparse lights of north and south bimini winked palely against the silver sheen of the moon on the quiet sea there were no whitecaps the met report he had picked up from vero beach on the american mainland had been right dead calm light airs from the northeast visibility good no immediate likelihood of change and a check on the fainter nassau radio had confirmed the sea looked as smooth and as solid as steel this was going to be all right petacchi dialed channel on the pilots command set to pick up no s navigational aid he had a moments panic when he didnt hit it at once but then he got it faint but clear dotdotdash dotdotdash it was time to get right down petacchi began to kill his speed with the air brakes and cut down the four jets the great plane began a shallow dive the radio altimeter became vocal threatening petacchi watched it and the sea of quicksilver below him he had a moment when the horizon was lost there was so much reflection off the moonlit water then he was on and over a small dark island it gave him confidence in the feet indicated on the altimeter he pulled out of the shallow dive and held the plane steady now no s beacon was coming in loud and clear soon he would see the red flashing light and there it was perhaps five miles dead ahead petacchi inched the great nose of the plane down any moment now it was going to be easy his fingers played with the controls as delicately as if they were the erotic trigger points on a woman five hundred feet four hundred three two there was the pale shape of the yacht lights dowsed he was dead on line with the red flash of the beacon would he hit it never mind inch her down down down be ready to switch off at once the belly of the plane gave a jolt up with the nose crash a leap in the air and then crash again petacchi unhinged his cramped fingers from the controls and gazed numbly out of the window at the foam and small waves by god he had done it he giuseppe petacchi had done it now for the applause now for the rewards the plane was settling slowly and there was a hiss of steam from the submerging jets from behind him came the rip and crack of tearing metal as the tail section gaped open where the back of the plane had broken petacchi went through into the fuselage the water swirled around his feet the filtering moonlight glittered white on the upturned face of one of the corpses now soggily awash at the rear of the plane petacchi broke the perspex cover to the handle of the port side emergency exit and jerked the handle down the door fell outward and petacchi stepped through and walked out along the wing the big jollyboat was almost up with the plane there were six men in it petacchi waved and shouted delightedly one man raised a hand in reply the faces of the men milkwhite under the moon looked up at him quietly curiously petacchi thought these men are very serious very businesslike it is right so he swallowed his triumph and also looked grave the boat came alongside the wing now almost awash and one man climbed up on to the wing and walked toward him he was a short thick man with a very direct gaze he walked carefully his feet well apart and his knees flexed to keep his balance his left hand was hooked in his belt petacchi said happily good evening good evening i am delivering one plane in good condition please sign here he held out his hand the man from the jollyboat took the hand in a strong grasp braced himself and pulled sharply petacchis head was flung back by the quick jerk and he was looking full into the eyes of the moon as the stiletto flashed up and under the offered chin through the roof of the mouth into the brain he knew nothing but a moments surprise a sear of pain and an explosion of brilliant light the killer held in the knife for a moment the back of hand feeling the stubble on petacchis chin then lowered the body onto the wing and withdrew the knife he carefully rinsed the knife in the sea water and wiped the blade on petacchis back and put the knife away then he hauled the body along the wing and thrust it under water beside the escape hatch the killer waded back along the wing to the waiting jollyboat and laconically raised a thumb by now four of the men had pulled on their aqualungs one by one with a last adjustment of their mouthpieces they clumsily heaved themselves over the side of the rocking boat and sank in a foam of small bubbles when the last man had gone the mechanic at the engine carefully lowered a huge underwater searchlight over the side and paid out the cable at a given moment he switched the light on and the sea and the great sinking hulk of the plane were lit up with a mist of luminescence the mechanic slipped the idling motor into gear and backed away paying out cable as he went at twenty yards out of range of the suction of the sinking plane he stopped and switched off his engine he reached into his overalls and took out a packet of camels he offered one to the killer who took it broke it carefully in half put one half behind his ear and lit the other half the killer was a man who rigidly controlled his weaknesses the disco volante on board the yacht no put down his night glasses took a charvet handerkerchief out of the breast pocket of his white sharkskin jacket and dabbed gently at his forehead and temples the musky scent of schiaparellis snuff was reassuring reminding him of the easy side of life of dominetta who would now be sitting down to dinner everyone kept spanish hours in nassau and cocktails would not have finished before ten with the raffish but rather gay saumurs and their equally frivolous guests of the early game that would already be under way at the casino of the calypsos thudding into the night from the bars and night clubs on bay street he put the handkerchief back in his pocket but this also was good this wonderful operation like clockwork he glanced at his watch just tenfifteen the plane had been a bare thirty minutes late a nasty halfhour to have to wait but the landing had been perfect vargas had done a good quick job on the italian pilot what was his name so that now they were running only fifteen minutes late if the recovery group didnt have to use oxyacetylene cutters to get out the bombs they would soon make that up but one mustnt expect no hitch at all there was a good eight hours of darkness to go calm method efficiency in that order calm method efficiency no ducked down off the bridge and went into the radio cabin it smelled of sweat and tension anything from the nassau control tower any report of a lowflying plane of a possible crash into the sea off bimini then keep watching and get me no quick please its just on the quarter no lit a cigarette and watched the yachts big brain get to work scanning the ether listening searching the operator played the dials with insect fingers pausing verifying hastening on through the sound waves of the world now he suddenly stopped checked minutely adjusted the volume he raised his thumb no spoke into the sphere of wire mesh that rose before his mouth from the base of the headset no speaking no listening the voice was hollow the words waxed and waned but it was blofeld all right no knew that voice better than he remembered his fathers successful tenfifteen next phase tenfortyfive continuing over thank you out the sound waves went dead the interchange had taken fortyfive seconds no conceivable fear of interception in that time on that waveband no went through the big stateroom and down into the hold the four men of b team their aqualungs beside them were sitting around smoking the wide underwater hatch just above the keel of the yacht was open moonlight reflected off the white sand under the ship shone up through the six feet of water in the hold stacked on the grating beside the men was the thick pile of tarpaulin painted a very pale cafйaulait with occasional irregular blotches of dark green and brown no said all is going very well the recovery team is at work it should not be long now how about the chariot and the sled one of the men jerked his thumb downward they are down there outside on the sand so it will be quicker correct no nodded toward a cranelike contraption fastened to a bulkhead above the hold the derrick took the strain all right that chain could handle twice the weight the pumps in order they will clear the hold in seven minutes good well take it easy it will be a long night no climbed the iron ladder out of the hold and went up on deck he didnt need his night glasses two hundred yards away to starboard the sea was empty save for the jollyboat riding at anchor above the golden submarine glow the red marker light had been taken into the boat the rattle of the little generator making current for the big searchlight was loud it would carry far across a sea as still as this but accumulators would have been too bulky and might have exhausted themselves before the work was finished the generator was a calculated risk and a small one at that the nearest island was five miles away and uninhabited unless someone was having a midnight picnic on it the yacht had stopped and searched it on the way to the rendezvous everything had been done that could be done every precaution taken the wonderful machine was running silently and full out there was nothing to worry about now except the next step no went through the hatch into the enclosed bridge and bent over the lighted chart table emilio largo no was a big conspicuously handsome man of about forty he was a roman and he looked like a roman not from the rome of today but from the rome of the ancient coins the large long face was sunburned a deep mahogany brown and the light glinted off the strong rather hooked nose and the cleancut lantern jaw that had been meticulously shaved before he had started out late that afternoon in contrast to the hard slowmoving brown eyes the mouth with its thick rather downcurled lips belong to a satyr ears that from dead in front looked almost pointed added to an animalness that would devastate women the only weakness in the fine centurion face lay in the overlong sideburns and the too carefully waved black hair that glistened so brightly with pomade that it might almost have been painted onto the skull there was no fat on the bigboned frame largo had fought for italy in the olympic foils was almost an olympicclass swimmer with the australian crawl and only a month before had won the senior class in the nassau waterski championships and the muscles bulged under the exquisitely cut sharkskin jacket an aid to his athletic prowess were his hands they were almost twice the normal size even for a man of his stature and now as they walked across the chart holding a ruler and a pair of dividers they looked extruding from the white sleeves that rested on the white chart almost like large brown furry animals quite separate from their owner largo was an adventurer a predator on the herd two hundred years before he would have been a pirate not one of the jolly ones of the story books but a man like blackbeard a bloodstained cutthroat who scythed his way through people toward gold but blackbeard had been too much of a bully and a roughneck and wherever he went in the world he left behind a telltale shambles largo was different there was a cool brain and an exquisite finesse behind his actions that had always saved him from the herds revenge from his postwar debut as head of the black market in naples through five lucrative years smuggling from tangier five more masterminding the wave of big jewel robberies on the french riviera down to his last five with spectre always he got away with it always he had seen the essential step ahead that would have been hidden from lesser men he was the epitome of the gentleman crook a man of the world a great womanizer a high liver with the entrйe to cafй society in four continents and the last survivor conveniently enough of a once famous roman family whose fortune so he said he had inherited he also benefited from having no wife a spotless police record nerves of steel a heart of ice and the ruthlessness of a himmler he was the perfect man for spectre and the perfect man rich nassau playboy and all to be supreme commander of plan omega one of the crew knocked on the hatch and came in they have signaled the chariot and sled are on the way thank you in the heat and excitement of any operation largo always created calm however much was at stake however great the dangers and however urgent the need for speed and quick decisions he made a fetish of calm of the pause of an almost judolike inertia this was an act of will to which he had trained himself he found it had an extraordinary effect on his accomplices it tied them to him and invoked their obedience and loyalty more than any other factor in leadership that he a clever and cunning man should show unconcern at particularly bad or as in this case particularly good news meant that he already knew that what had happened would happen with largo consequences were foreseen one could depend on him he never lost balance so now at this splendid news largo deliberately picked up his dividers again and made a trace an imaginary trace on the chart for the sake of the crew member he then put down the dividers and strolled out of the airconditioning into the warm night a tiny worm of underwater light was creeping out toward the jollyboat it was a twoman underwater chariot identical with those used by the italians during the war and bought with improvements from ansaldo the firm that had originally invented the oneman submarine it was towing an underwater sled a sharp prowed tray with negative buoyancy used for the recovery and transport of heavy objects under the sea the worm of light merged with the luminescence from the searchlight and minutes later reemerged on its way back to the ship it would have been natural for largo to have gone down to the hold to witness the arrival of the two atomic weapons typically he did nothing of the sort in due course the little headlight reappeared going back over its previous course now the sled would be loaded with the huge tarpaulin camouflaged to merge in with just this piece of underwater terrain with its white sand and patches of coral outcrop that would be spread so as to cover every inch of the wrecked plane and pegged all round with corkscrew iron stanchions that would not be shifted by the heaviest surface storm or groundswell in his imagination largo saw every move of the eight men who would now be working far below the surface on the reality for which there had been so much training so many dummy exercises he marveled at the effort the incredible ingenuity that had gone into plan omega now all the months of preparation of sweat and tears were being repaid there came a bright blink of light on the surface of the water not far from the jollyboat then another and another the men were surfacing as they did so the moon caught the glass of their masks they swam to the boat largo verified that all eight were there and clumsily heaved up the short ladder and over the side the mechanic and branch the german killer helped them off with their gear the underwater light was switched off and hauled inboard and instead of the rattle of the generator there came the muffled roar of the twin johnstons the boat sped back to the yacht and to the waiting arms of the derricks the couplings were made firm and verified and with a shrill electric whine the boat complete with passengers was swung up and inboard the captain came and stood at largos side he was a big sullen rawboned man who had been cashiered from the canadian navy for drunkenness and insubordination he had been a slave to largo ever since largo had called him to the stateroom one day and broken a chair over his head on account of a questioned command that was the kind of discipline he understood now he said the holds clear okay to sail are both the teams satisfied they say so not a hitch first see they all get one full jigger of whisky then tell them to rest they will be going out again in just about an hour ask kotze to have a word with me be ready to sail in five minutes okay the eyes of the physicist kotze were bright under the moon largo noticed that he was trembling slightly as if with fever he tried to instill calm into the man he said cheerfully well my friend are you pleased with your toys the toy shop has sent you everything you want kotzes lips trembled he was on the verge of excited tears he said his voice high it is tremendous you have no idea weapons such as i had never dreamed of and of a simplicity a safety even a child could handle these things without danger the cradles were big enough for them you have room to do your work yes yes kotze almost flapped his hands with enthusiasm there are no problems none at all the fuses will be off in no time it will be a simple matter to replace them with the time mechanism maslov is already at work correcting the threads i am using lead screws they are more easy to machine and the two plugs these ignitors you were telling me about they are safe where did the divers find them they were in a leaden box under the pilots seat i have verified them perfectly simple when the time comes they will of course be kept apart in the hiding place the rubber bags are splendid just what was needed i have verified that they seal completely watertight no danger from radiation not now everything is in the leaden cases kotze shrugged i may have picked up a little while i was working on the monsters but i wore the harness i will watch for signs i know what to do you are a brave man kotze i wont go near the damned things until i have to i value my sex life too much so you are satisfied with everything you have no problems nothing has been left on the plane kotze had got himself under control he had been bursting with the news with his relief that the technical problems were within his power now he felt empty tired he had voided himself of the tensions that had been with him for weeks after all this planning all these dangers supposing his knowledge had not been enough supposing the bloody english had invented some new safety device some secret control of which he knew nothing but when the time came when he unwrapped the protective webbing and got to work with his jewelers tools then triumph and gratitude had flooded into him no now there were no problems everything was all right now there was only routine kotze said dully no there are no problems everything is there i will go and get the job finished largo watched the thin figure shamble off along the deck scientists were queer fish they saw nothing but science kotze couldnt visualize the risks that still had to be run for him the turning of a few screws was the end of the job for the rest of the time he would be a useless supercargo it would be easier to get rid of him but that couldnt be done yet he would have to be kept on just in case the weapons had to be used but he was a depressing little man and a near hysteric largo didnt like such people near him they lowered his spirits they smelled of bad luck kotze would have to be found some job in the engine room where he would be kept busy and above all out of sight largo went into the cockpit bridge the captain was sitting at the wheel a light aluminum affair consisting only of the bottom half of a circle largo said okay lets go the captain reached out his hand to the bank of buttons at his side and pressed the one that said start both there came a low hollow rumble from amidships a light blinked on the panel to show that both engines were firing properly the captain pulled the electromagnetic gear shift to slow ahead both and the yacht began to move the captain made it full ahead both and the yacht trembled and settled a little in the stern the captain watched the revolution counter his hand on a squat lever at his side at twenty knots the counter showed the captain inched back the lever that depressed the great steel scoop below the hull the revolutions remained the same but the finger of the speedometer crawled on round the dial until it said forty knots now the yacht was half flying half planing across the glittering sheet of still water the hull supported four feet above the surface on the broad slightly uptilted metal skid and with only a few feet of the stern and the two big screws submerged it was a glorious sensation and largo as he always did thrilled to it the motor yacht disco volante was a hydrofoil craft built for largo with spectre funds by the italian constructors leopoldo rodrigues of messina the only firm in the world to have successfully adapted the shertelsachsenberg system to commercial use with a hull of aluminum and magnesium alloy two daimlerbenz fourstroke diesels supercharged by twin brownboveri turbo superchargers the disco volante could move her hundred tons at around fifty knots with a cruising range at that speed of around four hundred miles she had cost ј but she had been the only craft in the world with the speed cargo and passengerspace and with the essential shallow draft for the job required of her in bahamian waters the constructors claim of this type of craft that it has a particular refinement that spectre had appreciated having high stability and a shallow draft aliscafos as they are called in italy do not determine magnetic field variation nor do they cause pressure waves both desirable characteristics in case the disco volante might wish some time in her career to escape detection six months before the disco had been shipped out to the florida keys by the south atlantic route she had been a sensation in florida waters and among the bahamas and had vastly helped to make largo the most popular millionaire in a corner of the world that crawls with millionaires who have everything and the fast and mysterious voyages he made in the disco with all those underwater swimmers and occasionally with a two seater lycomingengined foldingwing amphibian mounted on the roof of the streamlined superstructure had aroused just the right amount of excited comment slowly largo had let the secret leak out through his own indiscretions at dinners and cocktail parties through carefully primed members of the crew in the bay street bars this was a treasure hunt an important one there was a pirates map a sunken galleon thickly overgrown with coral the wreck had been located largo was only waiting for the end of the winter tourist season and for the calms of early summer and then his shareholders would be coming out from europe and work would begin in earnest and two days before the shareholders nineteen of them had duly come trickling in to nassau by different routes from bermuda from new york from miami rather dulllooking people to be sure just the sort of hardheaded hardworking businessmen who would be amused by a gamble like this a pleasant sunshine gamble with a couple of weeks holiday in nassau to make up for it if the doubloons were after all not in the wreck and that evening with all the visitors on board the engines of the disco had begun to murmur just when they should have the harbor folk agreed just when it was getting dark and the beautiful dark blue and white yacht had slid out of harbor once in the open sea the engines had started up their deep booming that had gradually diminished to the southeast toward the listeners agreed an entirely appropriate hunting ground the southerly course was considered appropriate because it is among the southern bahamas that the great local treasure troves are expected to be found it was through the southerly passages through these islands the crooked island the mayaguana and the caicos passages that the spanish treasure ships would try to dodge the pirates and the french and british fleets as they made for home here it is believed lie the remains of the porto pedro sunk in with a million pounds of bullion on board the santa cruz lost in carried twice as much and the el capitan and san pedro both sunk in carried a million and half a million pounds of treasure respectively every year treasure hunts for these and other ships are carried out among the southern bahamas no one can guess how much if anything has been recovered but everyone in nassau knows of the lb silver bar recovered by two nassau businessmen off gorda cay in and since presented to the nassau development board in whose offices it is permanently on view so all bahamians know that treasure is there for the finding and when the harbor folk of nassau heard the deep boom of the discos engines dying away to the south they nodded wisely but once the disco was well away and the moon had not yet risen with all lights doused she swung away in a wide circle toward the west and toward the rendezvous point she was now leaving now she was a hundred miles two hours away from nassau but it would be almost dawn when after one more vital call nassau would again hear the boom of her engines coming in from the false southern trail largo got up and bent over the chart table they had covered the course many times and in all weathers it was really no problem but phases i and ii had gone so well that double care must be taken over phase iii yes all was well they were dead on course fifty miles they would be there in an hour he told the captain to keep the yacht as she was and went below to the radio room elevenfifteen was just coming up it was call time the small island dog island was no bigger than two tennis courts it was a hunk of dead coral with a smattering of seagrape and battered screw palm that grew on nothing but pockets of brackish rainwater and sand it was the point where the dog shoal broke the surface a wellknown navigational hazard that even the fishing boats kept well away from in daylight andros island showed to eastward but at night it was as safe as houses the disco came up fast and then slowly lowered herself back into the water and slid up to within a cables length of the rock her arrival brought small waves that lapped and sucked at the rock and then were still the anchor slipped silently down forty feet and held down in the hold largo and the disposal team of four waited for the underwater hatch to be opened the five men wore aqualungs largo held nothing but a powerful underwater electric torch the four others were divided into two pairs they wore webbing slung between them and they sat on the edge of the iron grating with their frogmans feet dangling waiting for the water to swirl in and give them buoyancy on the webbing between each pair rested a sixfootlong tapering object in an obscene gray rubber envelope the water seeped rushed and then burst into the hold submerging the five men they slipped off their seats and trudged out through the hatchway largo in the lead and the two pairs behind him at precisely tested intervals largo did not at first switch on his torch it was not necessary and it would bring stupid dazed fish that were a distraction it might even bring shark or barracuda and though they would be no more than a nuisance one of the team despite largos assurances might lose his nerve they swam on in the soft moonlit mist of the sea at first there was nothing but a milky void below them but then the coral shelf of the island showed up climbing steeply toward the surface sea fans like small shrouds in the moonlight waved softly beckoning and the clumps and trees of coral were gray and enigmatic it was because of these things the harmless underwater mysteries that make the skin crawl on the inexperienced that largo had decided to lead the disposal teams himself out in the open where the plane had foundered the eye of the big searchlight made with the known object of the plane itself the underwater world into the semblance of a big room but this was different this graywhite world needed the contempt of a swimmer who had experienced these phantom dangers a thousand times before that was the main reason why largo led the teams he also wanted to know exactly how the two gray sausages were stored away it could happen if things went wrong that he would have to salvage them himself the underpart of the small island had been eroded by the waves so that seen from below it resembled a thick mushroom under the umbrella of coral there was a wide fissure a dark wound in the side of the stem largo made for it and when he was close switched on his torch beneath the umbrella of coral it was dark the yellow light of the torch showed up the minute life of an inshore coral community the pale sea urchins and the fierce black spines of sea eggs the shifting underbrush of seaweeds the yellow and blue seeking antennae of a langouste the butterfly and angel fish fluttering like moths in the light a coiled bкche de mer a couple of meandering sea caterpillars and the black and green jelly of a sea hare largo lowered the black fins on his feet got his balance on a ledge and looked round shining his torch on the rock so that the two teams could get a foothold then he waved them on and into the smooth broad fissure that showed a glimmer of moonlight at its far end inside the center of the rock the underwater cave was only about ten yards long largo led the teams one after the other through and into the small chamber that might once perhaps have been a wonderful repository for a different kind of treasure from the chamber a narrow fissure led to the upper air and this would certainly become a fine blowhole in a storm though it would be unlikely that fishermen would be close enough to the dog shoal in a storm to see the water fountaining out of the center of the island above the present water line in the chamber largos men had hammered stanchions into the rock to form cradles for the two atomic weapons with leather straps to hold them secure against any weather now one by one the two teams lifted the rubber packages up onto the iron bars and made them secure largo examined the result and was satisfied the weapons would be ready for him when he needed them in the meantime such radiation as there was would be quarantined within this tiny rock a hundred miles from nassau and his men and his ship would be clean and innocent as snow the five men trudged calmly back to the ship and into the hold through the hatch to the boom of the engines the bows of the disco lifted slowly out of the water and the beautiful ship streamlined like the gondola of some machine of the air rather than of the sea skimmed off on the homeward journey largo stripped off his equipment and with a towel round his slim waist went forward to the radio cabin he had missed the midnight call it was now onefifteen sevenfifteen in the morning for blofeld largo thought of this while contact was being made blofeld would be sitting there haggard perhaps probably unshaven there would be coffee beside him the last of an endless chain of cups largo could smell it now blofeld would be able to take a taxi to the turkish baths in the rue aubert his resort when there were tensions to be dissipated and there at last he would sleep number speaking number listening phase iii completed phase iii completed successful one am here closing down i am satisfied largo stripped off the earphones he thought to himself so am i we are more than threequarters home now only the devil can stop us he went into the stateroom and carefully made himself a tall of his favorite drink crиme de menthe frappй with a maraschino cherry on top he sipped it delicately to the end and ate the cherry then he took one more cherry out of the bottle slipped it into his mouth and went up on the bridge domino the girl in the sapphire blue mg twoseater shot down the slope of parliament street and at the junction with bay street executed an admirable racing change through third into second she gave a quick glance to the right correctly estimated the trot of the strawhatted horse in the shafts of the rickety cab with the gay fringe and swerved out of the side street lefthanded the horse jerked back his head indignantly and the coachman stamped his foot up and down on the big bermuda bell the disadvantage of the beautiful deep tingtong tingtong of the bermuda carriage bell is that it cannot possibly sound angry however angrily you may sound it the girl gave a cheerful wave of a sunburned hand raced up the street in second and stopped in front of the pipe of peace the dunhills of nassau not bothering to open the low door of the mg the girl swung one brown leg and then the other over the side of the car showing her thighs under the pleated cream cotton skirt almost to her waist and slipped to the pavement by now the cab was alongside the cabby reined in he was mollified by the gaiety and beauty of the girl he said missy you done almost shaved de whiskers off of old dreamy here you wanna be more careful the girl put her hands on her hips she didnt like being told anything by anyone she said sharply old dreamy yourself some people have got work to do both of you ought to be put out to grass instead of cluttering up the streets getting in everyones way the ancient negro opened his mouth thought better of it said a pacifying hokay missy hokay flicked at his horse and moved on muttering to himself he turned on his seat to get another look at the shedevil but she had already disappeared into the shop dats a fine piece of gal he said inconsequentially and put his horse into an ambling trot twenty yards away james bond had witnessed the whole scene he felt the same way about the girl as the cabby did he also knew who she was he quickened his step and pushed through the striped sun blinds into the blessed cool of the tobacconists the girl was standing at a counter arguing with one of the assistants but i tell you i dont want senior service i tell you i want a cigarette thats so disgusting that i shant want to smoke it havent you got a cigarette that stops people smoking look at all that she waved a hand toward the stacked shelves dont tell me some of those dont taste horrible the man was used to crazy tourists and anyway the nassavian doesnt get excited he said well maam and turned and languidly looked along the shelves bond said sternly to the girl you can choose between two kinds of cigarette if you want to smoke less she looked sharply up at him and who might you be my names bond james bond im the worlds authority on giving up smoking i do it constantly youre lucky i happen to be handy the girl looked him up and down he was a man she hadnt seen before in nassau he was about six feet tall and somewhere in his middle thirties he had dark rather cruel good looks and very clear bluegray eyes that were now observing her inspection sardonically a scar down his right cheek showed pale against a tan so mild that he must have only recently come to the island he was wearing a very dark blue lightweight singlebreasted suit over a cream silk shirt and a black knitted silk tie despite the heat he looked cool and clean and his only concession to the tropics appeared to be the black saddlestitched sandals on his bare feet it was an obvious attempt at a pickup he had an exciting face and authority she decided to go along but she wasnt going to make it easy she said coldly all right tell me the only way to stop smoking is to stop it and not start again if you want to pretend to stop for a week or two its no good trying to ration yourself youll become a bore and think about nothing else and youll snatch at a cigarette every time the hour strikes or whatever the intervals may be youll behave greedily thats unattractive the other way is to have cigarettes that are either too mild or too strong the mild ones are probably the best for you bond said to the attendant a carton of dukes kingsize with filter bond handed them to the girl here try these with the compliments of faust oh but i cant i mean but bond had already paid for the carton and for a packet of chesterfields for himself he took the change and followed her out of the shop they stood together under the striped awning the heat was terrific the white light on the dusty street the glare reflected back off the shop fronts opposite and off the dazzling limestone of the houses made them both screw up their eyes bond said im afraid smoking goes with drinking are you going to give them both up or one by one she looked at him quizzically this is very sudden mr er bond well all right but somewhere out of the town its too hot here do you know the wharf out beyond the fort montague bond noticed that she looked quickly up and down the street its not bad come on ill take you there mind the metal itll raise blisters on you even the white leather of the upholstery burned through to bonds thighs but he wouldnt have minded if his suit had caught fire this was his first sniff at the town and already he had got hold of the girl and she was a fine girl at that bond caught hold of the leatherbound safety grip on the dashboard as the girl did a sharp turn up frederick street and another one onto shirley bond settled himself sideways so that he could look at her she wore a gondoliers broadrimmed straw hat tilted impudently down over her nose the pale blue tails of its ribbon streamed out behind on the front of the ribbon was printed in gold my disco volante her shortsleeved silk shirt was in halfinch vertical stripes of pale blue and white and with the pleated cream skirt the whole getup reminded bond vaguely of a sunny day at henley regatta she wore no rings and no jewelery except for a rather masculine square gold wristwatch with a black face her flatheeled sandals were of white doeskin they matched her broad white doeskin belt and the sensible handbag that lay with a black and white striped silk scarf on the seat between them bond knew a good deal about her from the immigration form one among a hundred which he had been studying that morning her name was dominetta vitali she had been born in bolzano in the italian tyrol and therefore probably had as much austrian as italian blood in her she was twentynine and gave her profession as actress she had arrived six months before in the disco and it was entirely understood that she was mistress to the owner of the yacht an italian called emilio largo whore tart prostitute were not words bond used about women unless they were professional streetwalkers or the inmates of a brothel and when harling the commissioner of police and pitman chief of immigration and customs had described her as an italian tart bond had reserved judgment now he knew he had been right this was an independent a girl of authority and character she might like the rich gay life but so far as bond was concerned that was the right kind of girl she might sleep with men obviously did but it would be on her terms and not on theirs women are often meticulous and safe drivers but they are very seldom firstclass in general bond regarded them as a mild hazard and he always gave them plenty of road and was ready for the unpredictable four women in a car he regarded as the highest danger potential and two women as nearly as lethal women together cannot keep silent in a car and when women talk they have to look into each others faces an exchange of words is not enough they have to see the other persons expression perhaps in order to read behind the others words or to analyze the reaction to their own so two women in the front seat of a car constantly distract each others attention from the road ahead and four women are more than doubly dangerous for the driver has to hear and see not only what her companion is saying but also for women are like that what the two behind are talking about but this girl drove like a man she was entirely focused on the road ahead and on what was going on in her driving mirror an accessory rarely used by women except for making up their faces and equally rare in a woman she took a mans pleasure in the feel of her machine in the timing of her gear changes and the use of her brakes she didnt talk to bond or seem to be aware of him and this allowed him to continue his inspection without inhibition she had a gay tohellwithyou face that bond thought would become animal in passion in bed she would fight and bite and then suddenly melt into hot surrender he could almost see the proud sensual mouth bare away from the even white teeth in a snarl of desire and then afterward soften into a halfpout of loving slavery in profile the eyes were soft charcoal slits such as you see on some birdsbut in the shop bond had seen them full face then they had been fierce and direct with a golden flicker in the dark brown that held much the same message as the mouth the profile the straight small uptilted nose the determined set of the chin and the cleancut sweep of the jaw line were as decisive as a royal command and the way the head was set on the neck had the same authority the poise one associates with imaginary princesses two features modified the cleancut purity of line a soft muddled brigitte bardot haircut that escaped from under the straw hat in an endearing disarray and two deeply cut but soft dimples which could only have been etched by a sweet if rather ironic smile that bond had not yet seen the sunburn was not overdone and her skin had none of that dried exhausted sheen that can turn the texture of even the youngest skin into something more like parchment beneath the gold there was an earthy warmth in the cheeks that suggested a good healthy peasant strain from the italian alps and her breasts high riding and deeply ved were from the same stock the general impression bond decided was of a willful hightempered sensual girl a beautiful arab mare who would only allow herself to be ridden by a horseman with steel thighs and velvet hands and then only with curb and saw bit and then only when he had broken her to bridle and saddle bond thought that he would like to try his strength against hers but that must be for some other time for the moment another man was in the saddle he would first have to be unhorsed and anyway what the hell was he doing fooling with these things there was a job to be done the devil of a job the mg swept out of shirley street on to eastern road and followed the coast across the wide harbor entrance were the emerald and turquoise shoals of athol island a deepsea fishing boat was passing over them the two tall antennae of her twelvefoot rods streaming their lines astern a fast motorboat came hammering by dose inshore the waterskier on the line behind her executing tight slaloms across the waves of her wake it was a sparkling beautiful day and bonds heart lifted momentarily from the trough of indecision and despondency created by an assignment that particularly since his arrival at dawn that day seemed increasingly timewasting and futile the bahamas the string of a thousand islands that straggle five hundred miles southeast from just east of the coast of florida to just north of cuba from latitude є down to latitude є were for most of three hundred years the haunt of every famous pirate of the western atlantic and today tourism makes full use of the romantic mythology a roadsign said blackbeards tower mile and another gunpowder wharf sea food native drinks shady garden first left a sand track showed on their left the girl took it and pulled up in front of a ruined stone warehouse against which leaned a pink clapboard house with white window frames and a white adamstyle doorway over which hung a brightly painted inn sign of a powder keg with a skull and crossbones on it the girl drove the mg into the shade of a clump of casuarinas and they got out and went through the door and through a small dining room with red and white checked covers and out onto a terrace built on the remains of a stone wharf the terrace was shaded by seaalmond trees trimmed into umbrellas trailed by a shuffling colored waiter with soup stains down his white coat they chose a cool table on the edge of the terrace looking over the water bond glanced at his watch he said to the girl its exactly midday do you want to drink solid or soft the girl said soft ill have a double bloody mary with plenty of worcester sauce bond said what do you call hard ill have a vodka and tonic with a dash of bitters the waiter said yassuh and mooched away i call vodkaontherocks hard all that tomato juice makes it soft she hooked a chair toward her with one foot and stretched out her legs on it so that they were in the sun the position wasnt comfortable enough she kicked off her sandals and sat back satisfied she said when did you arrive i havent seen you about when its like this at the end of the season one expects to know most of the faces i got in this morning from new york ive come to look for a property it struck me that now would be better than in the season when all the millionaires are here the prices are hopeless they may come down a bit now theyre gone how long have you been here about six months i came out in a yacht the disco volante you may have seen her shes anchored up the coast you probably flew right over her coming in to land at windsor field a long low streamlined affair is she yours shes got beautiful lines she belongs to a relative of mine the eyes watched bonds face do you stay on board oh no weve got a beach property or rather weve taken it its a place called palmyra just opposite where the yacht is it belongs to an englishman i believe he wants to sell it its very beautiful and its a long way away from the tourists its at a place called lyford key that sounds the sort of place im looking for well well be gone in about a week oh bond looked into her eyes im sorry if youve got to flirt dont be obvious suddenly the girl laughed she looked contrite the dimples remained i mean i didnt really mean that not the way it sounded but ive spent six months listening to that kind of thing from these silly old rich goats and the only way to shut them up is to be rude im not being conceited theres no one under sixty in this place young people cant afford it so any woman who hasnt got a harelip or a mustache well not even a mustache would put them off theyd probably like it well i mean absolutely any girl makes these old goats get their bifocals all steamed up she laughed again she was getting friendly i expect youll have just the same effect on the old women with pincenez and blue rinses do they eat boiled vegetables for lunch yes and they drink carrot juice and prune juice we wont get on then i wont sink lower than conch chowder she looked at him curiously you seem to know a lot about nassau you mean about conch being an aphrodisiac thats not only a nassau idea its all over the world where there are conchs is it true island people have it on their wedding night i havent found it to have any effect on me why she looked mischievous are you married no bond smiled across into her eyes are you no then we might both try some conch soup some time and see what happens thats only a little better than the millionaires youll have to try harder the drinks came the girl stirred hers with a finger to mix in the brown sediment of worcester sauce and drank half of it she reached for the carton of dukes broke it open and slit a packet with her thumbnail she took out a cigarette sniffed it cautiously and lit it with bonds lighter she inhaled deeply and blew out a long plume of smoke she said doubtfully not bad at least the smoke looks like smoke why did you say you were such an expert on giving up smoking because ive given it up so often bond thought it time to get away from the small talk he said why do you talk such good english your accent sounds italian yes my names dominetta vitali but i was sent to school in england to the cheltenham ladies college then i went to rada to learn acting the english kind of acting my parents thought that was a ladylike way to be brought up then they were both killed in a train crash i went back to italy to earn my living i remembered my english but she laughed without bitterness i soon forgot most of the rest you dont get far in the italian theater by being able to walk about with a book balanced on your head but this relative with the yacht bond looked out to sea wasnt he there to look after you no the answer was curt when bond made no comment she added hes not exactly a relative not a close one hes a sort of close friend a guardian oh yes you must come and visit us on the yacht she felt that a bit of gush was needed hes called largo emilio largo youve probably heard hes here on some kind of a treasure hunt really now it was bonds turn to gush that sounds rather fun of course id like to meet him whats it all about is there anything in it heaven knows hes very secretive about it apparently theres some kind of a map but im not allowed to see it and i have to stay ashore when he goes off prospecting or whatever he does a lot of people have put up money for it sort of shareholders theyve all just arrived as were going in a week or so i suppose everythings ready and the real hunts going to start any moment now what are the shareholders like do they seem sensible sort of people the trouble with most treasure hunts is that either someones been there before and sneaked off with the treasure or the ships so deep in the coral you cant get at it they seem all right very dull and rich terribly serious for something as romantic as treasure hunting they seem to spend all their time with largo plotting and planning i suppose and they never seem to go out in the sun or go bathing or anything its as if they didnt want to get sunburned as far as i can gather none of them have ever been in the tropics before just a typical bunch of stuffy businessmen theyre probably better than that i havent seen much of them largos giving a party for them at the casino tonight what do you do all day oh i fool around do a bit of shopping for the yacht drive around in the car bathe on other peoples beaches when their houses are empty i like underwater swimming ive got an aqualung and i take one of the crew out or a fisherman the crew are better they all do it i used to do it a bit ive brought my gear will you show me some good bits of reef sometime the girl looked pointedly at her watch i might do its time i went she got up thanks for the drink im afraid i cant take you back im going the other way theyll get you a taxi here she shuffled her feet into her sandals bond followed the girl through the restaurant to her car she got in and pressed the starter bond decided to risk another snub he said perhaps ill see you at the casino tonight dominetta praps she put the car pointedly into gear she took another look at him she decided that she did want to see him again she said but for gods sake dont call me dominetta im never called that people call me domino she gave him a brief smile but it was a smile into the eyes she raised a hand the rear wheels spat sand and gravel and the little blue car whirled out along the driveway to the main road it paused at the intersection and then as bond watched turned righthanded toward nassau bond smiled he said bitch and walked back into the restaurant to pay his bill and have a taxi called the man from the cia the taxi took bond out to the airport at the other end of the island by the interfield road the man from the central intelligence agency was due in by pan american at onefifteen his name was larkin f larkin bond hoped he wouldnt be a musclebound excollege man with a crewcut and a desire to show up the incompetence of the british the backwardness of their little colony and the clumsy ineptitude of bond in order to gain credit with his chief in washington bond hoped that at any rate he would bring the equipment he had asked for before he left london through section a who looked after the liaison with cia this was the latest transmitter and receiver for agents in the field so that the two of them could be independent of cable offices and have instant communication with london and washington and the most modern portable geiger counters for operating both on land and under water one of the chief virtues of cia in bonds estimation was the excellence of their equipment and he had no false pride about borrowing from them new providence the island containing nassau the capital of the bahamas is a drab sandy slab of land fringed with some of the most beautiful beaches in the world but the interior is nothing but a waste of lowlying scrub casuarinas mastic and poisonwood with a large brackish lake at the western end there are birds and tropical flowers and palm trees imported fully grown from florida in the beautiful gardens of the millionaires round the coast but in the middle of the island there is nothing to attract the eye but the skeleton fingers of spidery windmill pumps sticking up above the pine barrens and bond spent the ride to the airport reviewing the morning he had arrived at seven am to be met by the governors adc a mild error of security and taken to the royal bahamian a large oldfashioned hotel to which had recently been applied a thin veneer of american efficiency and tourist gimmicks ice water in his room a cellophanewrapped basket of dingy fruit with the compliments of the manager and a strip of sanitized paper across the lavatory seat after a shower and a tepid touristy breakfast on his balcony overlooking the beautiful beach he had gone up to government house at nine oclock for a meeting with the commissioner of police the chief of immigration and customs and the deputy governor it was exactly as he had imagined it would be the most immediates and the top secrets had made a superficial impact and he was promised full cooperation in every aspect of his assignment but the whole business was clearly put down as a ridiculous flap and something that must not be allowed to interfere with the normal routine of running a small sleepy colony nor with the comfort and happiness of the tourists roddick the deputy governor careful middleoftheway man with a ginger mustache and gleaming pincenez had put the whole affair in a most sensible light you see commander bond in our opinion and we have most carefully debated all the possibilities all the er angles as our american friends would say it is inconceivable that a large fourengined plane could have been hidden anywhere within the confines of the colony the only airstrip cable of taking such a plane am i right harling is here in nassau so far as a landing on the sea is concerned a er ditching i think they call it we have been in radio contact with the administrators on all the larger outer islands and the replies are all negative the radar people at the meteorological station bond had interrupted at this point might i ask if the radar screen is manned round the clock my impression is that the airport is very busy during the day but that there is very little traffic at night would it be possible that the radar is not so closely watched at night the commissioner of police a pleasant very militarylooking man in his forties the silver buttons and insignia on whose dark blue uniform glittered as they can only when spit and polish is a main activity and there are plenty of batmen around said judiciously i think the commander has a point there sir the airport commandant admits that things do slacken off a bit when theres nothing scheduled he hasnt got all that amount of staff and of course most of them are locals sir good men but hardly up to london airport standards and the radar at the met station is only a gca set with a low horizon and range mostly used for shipping quite quite the deputy governor didnt want to be dragged into a discussion about radar sets or the merits of nassavian labor theres certainly a point there no doubt commander bond will be making his own inquiries now there was a request from the secretary of state the title rolled sonorously forth for details and comments on recent arrivals in the island suspicious characters and so forth mr pitman the chief of immigration and customs was a sleek nassavian with quick brown eyes and an ingratiating manner he smiled pleasantly nothing out of the ordinary sir the usual mixture of tourists and businessmen and local people coming home we were asked to have details for the past two weeks sir he touched the brief case on his lap i have all the immigration forms here sir perhaps commander bond would care to go through them with me the brown eyes flicked toward bond and away all the big hotels have house detectives i could probably get him further details on any particular name all passports were checked in the normal manner there were no irregularities and none of these people was on our wanted list bond said might i ask a question the deputy governor nodded enthusiastically of course of course anything you like were all here to help im looking for a group of men probably ten or more they probably stick together a good deal might be as many as twenty or thirty i guess they would be europeans they probably have a ship or a plane they may have been here for months or only a few days i gather you have plenty of conventions coming to nassau salesmen tourist associations religious groups heaven knows what all apparently they take a block of rooms in some hotel and hold meetings and so forth for a week or so is there anything like that going on at the moment mr pitman well of course we do have plenty of those sort of gatherings very welcome to the tourist board the chief of immigration smiled conspiratorially at bond as if he had just given away a closely guarded secret but in the last two weeks weve only had a moral rearmament group at the emerald wave and the tiptop biscuit people at the royal bahamian theyve gone now quite the usual convention pattern all very respectable thats just it mr pitman the people im looking for the people who may have arranged to steal this plane will certainly take pains to look respectable and behave in a respectable fashion were not looking for a bunch of flashy crooks we think these must be very big people indeed now is there anything like that on the island a group of people like that well the chief of immigration smiled broadly of course weve got our annual treasure hunt going on the deputy governor barked a quick deprecating laugh now steady on mr pitman surely we dont want them to get mixed up in all this or heaven knows where we shall end i cant believe commander bond wants to bother his head over a lot of rich beachcombers the commissioner of police said doubtfully the only thing is sir they do have a yacht and a small plane for the matter of that and i did hear that a lot of shareholders in the swindle had come in lately those points do tally with what the commander was asking about i admit its ridiculous but this man largos respectable enough for commander bonds requirements and his men have never once given us trouble unusual to have not even one case of drunkenness in a ships crew in nearly six months and bond had leaped at the flimsy thread and had pursued it for another two hours in the customs building and in the commissioners office and as a result he had gone walking in the town to see if he could get a look at largo or any of his party or pick up any other shreds of gossip as a result he had got a good look at domino vitali and now the taxi had arrived at the airport bond told the driver to wait and walked into the long low entrance hall just as the arrival of larkins flight was being announced over the tannoy he knew there would be the usual delay for customs and immigration he went to the souvenir shop and bought a copy of the new york times in its usual discreet headlines it was still leading with the loss of the vindicator perhaps it knew also about the loss of the atom bombs because arthur krock on the editorial page had a heavyweight column about the security aspects of the nato alliance bond was halfway through this when a quiet voice in his ear said meet no bond swung round it was it was felix leiter leiter his cia companion on some of the most thrilling cases in bonds career grinned and thrust the steel hook that was his right hand under bonds arm take it easy friend dick tracy will tell all when we get out of here bags are out front lets go bond said well god damn it you old soandso did you know it was going to be me sure cia knows all at the entrance leiter had his luggage which was considerable put aboard bonds taxi and told the driver to take it to the royal bahamian a man standing beside an undistinguishedlooking black ford consul sedan left the car and came up mr larkin im from the hertz company this is the car you ordered we hope shes what you want you did specify something conventional leiter glanced casually at the car looks all right i just want a car thatll go none of those ritzy jobs with only room for a small blonde with a sponge bag im here to do property work not jazz it up may i see your new york license sir right then if youll just sign here and ill make a note of the number of your diners club card when you go leave the car anywhere you like and just notify us well collect it have a good holiday sir they got into the car bond took the wheel leiter said that hed have to practice a bit on what he called this limey southpaw routine of driving on the left and anyway hed be interested to see if bond had improved his cornering since their last drive together when they were out of the airport bond said now go ahead and tell last time we met you were with pinkertons whats the score drafted just damned well drafted hell anyone would think there was a war on you see james once youve worked for cia youre automatically put on the reserve of officers when you leave unless youve been cashiered for not eating the code book under fire or something and apparently my old chief alien dulles that is just didnt have the men to go round when the president sounded the fire alarm so i and twenty or so other guys were just pulled in drop everything twentyfour hours to report hell i thought the russians had landed and then they tell me the score and to pack my bathing trunks and my spade and bucket and come on down to nassau so of course i griped like hell asked them if i shouldnt brush up on my canasta game and take some quick lessons in the chacha so then they unbuttoned and told me i was to team up with you down here and i thought maybe if that old bastard of yours n or m or whatever you call him had sent you down here with your old equalizer there might be something cooking in the pot after all so i picked up the gear youd asked for from admin packed the bow and arrows instead of the spade and bucket and here i am and thats that now you tell you old sonofabitch hell its good to see you bond took leiter through the whole story point by point from the moment he had been summoned to ms office the morning before when he came to the shooting outside his headquarters leiter stopped him now what do you make of that james in my book thats a pretty funny coincidence have you been fooling around with anybodys wife lately sounds more like around the loop in chicago than a mile or so from piccadilly bond said seriously it makes no sense to me and none to anyone else the only man who might have had it in for me recently that is is a crazy bastard i met down at a sort of clinic place i had to go to on some blasted medical grounds bond to leiters keen pleasure rather sheepishly gave details of his cure at shrublands i bowled this man out as a member of a chinese tong one of their secret societies the red lightning tong he must have heard me getting the gen on his outfit from records on an open line from a call box in the place next thing he damned near managed to murder me just for a lark and to get even i did my best to roast him alive bond gave the details nice quiet place shrublands youd be surprised how carrot juice seems to affect people where was this lunatic asylum place called washington modest little place compared with yours not far from brighton and the letter was posted from brighton thats the hell of a long shot ill try another one of the points our chaps brought up was that if a plane was to be stolen at night and landed at night a full moon would be the hell of an aid to the job but the plane was taken five days after the full just supposing your roast chicken was the lettersender and supposing the roasting forced him to delay sending the letter while he recovered his employers would be pretty angry yes i suppose so and supposing they gave orders for him to be rubbed for inefficiency and supposing the killer got to him just as he got to you to settle his private account from what you tell me he wouldnt have lain down under what you did to him well now just supposing all that it adds up doesnt it bond laughed partly in admiration youve been taking mescalin or something its a damned good sequence for a comic strip but these things dont happen in real life planes with atom bombs dont get stolen in real life except that they do youre slowing down james how many people would believe the files on some of the cases you and i have got mixed up in dont give me that crap about real life there aint no such animal bond said seriously well look here felix tell you what ill do theres just enough sense in your story so ill put it on the machine to m tonight and see if the yard can get anywhere with it they could check with the clinic and the hospital in brighton if thats where he was taken and they may be able to get on from there trouble is wherever they get theres nothing left of the man but his shoes and i doubt if theyll catch up with the man on the motorbike it looked a real pro job to me why not these highjackers sound like pros its a pro plan it all fits all right you go ahead and put it on the wire and dont be ashamed of saying it was my idea my medal collection has got to looking a bit thin since i left the outfit they pulled up under the portico of the royal bahamian and bond gave the keys to the parking attendant leiter checked in and they went up to his room and sent for two double dry martinis on the rocks and the menu from the pretentious dishes for your particular consideration printed in ornamental gothic bond chose native seafood cocktail supreme followed by disjointed home farm chicken sautй au cresson which was described in italics as tender farm chicken broiled to a rich brown basted with creamery butter and disjointed for your convenience price or dollars felix leiter went for the baltic herring in sour cream followed by chopped tenderloin of beef french onion rings price or dollars when they had both commented sourly and at length about the inflated bogosity of touristhotel food and particularly the mendacious misuse of the english language to describe materials which had certainly been in various deepfreezes for at least six months they settled down on the balcony to discuss bonds findings of the morning half an hour and one more double dry martini later their luncheon came the whole thing amounted to about five shillings worth of badly cooked rubbish they ate in a mood of absentminded irritation saying nothing finally leiter threw down his knife and fork this is hamburger and bad hamburger the french onion rings were never in france and whats more he poked at the remains with a fork theyre not even rings theyre oval he looked belligerently across at bond all right hawkshaw where do we go from here the major decision is to eat out in future the next is to pay a visit to the disco now bond got up from the table when weve done that well have to decide whether or not these people are hunting pieces of eight or ј then well have to report progress bond waved at the packing cases in a corner of the room ive got the loan of a couple of rooms on the top floor of police headquarters here the commissioners cooperative and a solid character these colonial police are good and this ones a cut above the rest we can set up the radio there and make contact this evening tonight theres this party at the casino well go to that and see if any of these faces mean anything to either of us the first things to see if the yachts clean or not can you break that geiger counter out sure and its a honey leiter went to the cases selected one and opened it he came back carrying what looked like a rolleiflex camera in a portable leather case here give me a hand leiter took off his wrist watch and strapped on what appeared to be another watch he slung the camera by its strap over his left shoulder now run those wires from the watch up my sleeve and down inside my coat right now these two small plugs go through these holes in my coat pocket and into the two holes in the box got it now were all fixed leiter stood back and posed man with a camera and a wrist watch he unbuttoned the flap of the camera see perfectly good lenses and all that even a button to press in case you have to seem to take a picture but in back of the makebelieve theres a metal valve a circuit and batteries now take a look at this watch and it is a watch he held it under bonds eyes only difference is that its a very small watch mechanism and that sweep secondhand is a meter that takes the radioactive count those wires up the sleeve hitch it on to the machine now then youre still wearing that old wrist watch of yours with the big phosphorus numerals so i walk round the room for a moment to get the background count thats basic all sorts of things give off radiation of some sort and i take an occasional glance at my watch nervous type and ive got an appointment coming up now here by the bathroom all that metal is giving off something and my watch is registering positive but very little nothing else in the room and ive established the amount of background interference ill have to discount when i start to get hot right now i come close up to you and my cameras only a few inches away from your hand here took a look put your watch right up against the counter see the sweephand is getting all excited move your watch away and it loses interest its those phosphorus numerals of yours remember the other day one of the watch companies withdrew an air pilots watch from the market because the atomic energy people got fussy same thing they thought this particular pilots watch with the big phosphorescent numerals was giving off too much radiation to be good for the wearer of course leiter patted the camera case this is a special job most types give off a clicking sound and if youre prospecting for uranium which is the big market for these machines you wear earphones to try and pick up the stuff underground for this job we dont need anything so sensitive if we get near where those bombs are hidden this damned sweephandll go right off the dial okay so lets go hire ourselves a sixpenny sick and pay a call on the ocean greyhound my name is emilio largo leiters sixpenny sick was the hotel launch a smart chryslerengined speedboat that said it would be an hour they ran out westward from the harbor past silver cay long cay and balmoral island and round delaporte point five miles farther down the coast encrusted with glittering seashore properties the boatman said cost ј per foot of beach frontage they rounded old fort point and came upon the gleaming white and dark blue ship lying with two anchors out in deep water just outside the reef leiter whistled he said in an awestruck voice boy is that a piece of boat id sure like to have one of those to play with in my bath bond said shes italian built by a firm called rodrigues at messina thing called an aliscafo shes got a hydrofoil under the hull and when she gets going you let this sort of skid down and she rises up and practically flies only the screws and a few feet of the stern stay in the water the police commissioner says she can do fifty knots in calm water only good for inshore work of course but they can carry upwards of a hundred passengers when theyre designed as fast ferries apparently this ones been designed for about forty the rest of the space is taken up with the owners quarters and cargo space must have cost damned near a quarter of a million the boatman broke in they say on bay street that she goin go after the treasure these next few days or so all the people that own share in the gold come in a few days ago then she spen one whole night doin a final recce they say is down exhuma way or over by watlings island guess you folks know thats where columbus make him first landfall on this side of the atlantic around fourteen ninety somethin but could be anywhere down there theys always been talk of treasure down mongst the ragged islands even as far as crooked island fact is she sail out southward hear her myself right until her engines died away east by southeast ida say the boatman spat discreetly over the side must be plenty heap of treasure with the cost of that ship and all the money they throwing way every time she go to the hoiling wharf they say the bills five hundred pound bond said casually which night was it they did the final recce night after she hoiled thatd be two nights ago sail round six the blank portholes of the ship watched them approach a sailor polishing brass round the curve of the enclosed dome that was the bridge walked through the hatch into the bridge and bond could see him talking into a mouthpiece a tall man in white ducks and a very wide mesh singlet appeared on deck and observed them through binoculars he called something to the sailor who came and stood at the top of the ladder down the starboard side when their launch came alongside the man cupped his hands and called down what is your business please have you an appointment bond called back its mr bond mr james bond from new york i have my attorney here i have an inquiry to make about palmyra mr largos property one moment please the sailor disappeared and returned accompanied by the man in white ducks and singlet bond recognized him from the police description he called down cheerfully come aboard come aboard he gestured for the sailor to go down and help fend the launch bond and leiter climbed out of the launch and went up the ladder largo held out a hand my name is emilio largo mr bond and mr larkin my attorney from new york actually im english but i have property in america they shook hands im sorry to bother you mr largo but its about palmyra the property i believe you rent from mr bryce ah yes of course the beautiful teeth gleamed warmth and welcome come on down to the stateroom gentlemen im sorry i am not properly dressed to receive you the big brown hands caressed his flanks the wide mouth turned down in deprecation my visitors usually announce themselves on the shiptoshore but if you will forgive the informality largo allowed the phrase to die on the air and ushered them through a low hatch and down a few aluminum steps into the main cabin the rubberlined hatch hissed to behind him it was a fine large cabin paneled in mahogany with a deep winered carpet and comfortable dark blue leather club chairs the sun shining through the slats of venetian blinds over the broad square ports added a touch of gay light to an otherwise rather somber and masculine room its long center table littered with papers and charts glassfronted cabinets containing fishing gear and an array of guns and other weapons and a black rubber underwater diving suit and aqualung suspended almost like the skeleton in a sorcerers den from a rack in one corner the airconditioning made the cabin deliciously cool and bond felt his damp shirt slowly freeing itself from his skin please take a chair gentlemen largo carelessly brushed aside the charts and papers on the table as if they were of no importance cigarettes he placed a large silver box between them and now what can i get you to drink he went to the loaded sideboard something cool and not too strong perhaps a planters punch gin and tonic or there are various beers you must have had a hot journey in that open launch i would have sent my boat for you if only i had known they both asked for a plain tonic bond said im very sorry to barge in like this mr largo no idea i could have got you on the telephone we just got in this morning and as ive only a few days i have to get a move on the point is im looking for a property down here oh yes largo brought the glasses and bottles of tonic to the table and sat down so that they formed a comfortable group what a good idea wonderful place ive been here fr six months and already id like to stay forever but the prices theyre asking largo threw up his hands these bay street pirates and the millionaires they are even worse but you are wise to come at the end of the season perhaps some of the owners are disappointed not to have sold perhaps they will not open their mouths so wide thats what i thought bond sat comfortably back and lit a cigarette or rather what my lawyer mr larkin advised leiter shook his head pessimistically he had made some inquiries and he frankly advised that realestate values down here have gone mad bond turned politely toward leiter to bring him into the conversation isnt that so daft mr largo quite daft worse even than florida out of this world i wouldnt advise any client of mine to invest at these prices quite so largo obviously didnt want to get drawn too deeply into these matters you mentioned something about palmyra is there anything i can do to help in that respect bond said i understand you have a lease of the property mr largo and there is talk that you may be leaving the house before long only gossip of course you know what they are in these small islands but it sounds more or less what im looking for and i gather the owner this englishman bryce might sell if he got the right price what i was going to ask you bond looked apologetic was whether we might drive out and look the place over some time when you werent there of course any time that might suit you largo flashed his teeth warmly he spread his hands but of course of course my dear fellow whenever you wish there is no one in residence but my niece and a few servants and she is out most of the time please just call her up on the telephone i shall tell her that you will be doing so it is indeed a charming property so imaginative a beautiful piece of design if only all rich men had such good taste bond got to his feet and leiter followed suit well thats extraordinarily kind of you mr largo and now well leave you in peace perhaps we may meet again in the town some time you must come and have lunch but bond poured admiration and flattery into his voice with a yacht like this i dont suppose you ever want to come ashore must be the only one on this side of the atlantic didnt one used to run between venice and trieste i seem to remember reading about it somewhere largo grinned his pleasure yes that is right quite right they are also on the italian lakes for passenger traffic now they are buying them in south america a wonderful design for coastal waters she only draws four feet when the hydrofoil is operating i suppose accommodations the problem it is a weakness of all men though not necessarily of all women to love their material possessions largo said with a trace of pricked vanity no no i think you will find that it is not so you can spare five minutes we are rather crowded at the moment you have heard no doubt of our treasure hunt he looked sharply at them as a man would who expects ridicule but we will not discuss that now no doubt you do not believe in these things but my associates in the affair are all on board with the crew there are forty of us you will see that we are not cramped you would like largo gestured to the door in the rear of the stateroom felix leiter showed reluctance you know mr bond that we have that meeting with mr harold christie at five oclock bond waved the objection aside mr christie is a charming man i know he wont mind if we are a few minutes late id love to see over the ship if youre sure you can spare the time mr largo largo said come it will not take more than a few minutes the excellent mr christie is a friend of mine he will understand he went to the door and held it open bond had been expecting the politeness it would interfere with leiter and his apparatus he said firmly please go first mr largo you will be able to tell us when to duck our heads with more affabilities largo led the way ships however modern are more or less the same the corridors to port and starboard of the engine room rows of cabin doors which largo explained were occupied the large communal bathrooms the galley where two cheerfullooking italians in white smocks laughed at largos jokesabout the food and seemed pleased with the visitors interest the huge engine room where the chief engineer and his mate germans it seemed gave enthusiastic information about the powerful twin diesels and explained the hydraulics of the hydrofoil depressor it was all exactly like visiting any other ship and saying the right things to the crew using the right superlatives to the owner the short space of afterdeck was occupied by the little twoseater amphibian painted dark blue and white to match the yacht its wings now folded and its engine cowled against the sun a big jollyboat to hold about twenty men and an electric derrick to hoist them in and outboard bond estimating the ships displacement and her freeboard said casually and the hold more cabin space just storage and the fuel tanks of course she is an expensive ship to run we have to carry several tons the ballast problem is important with these ships when her bows come up the fuel shifts aft we have to have big lateral tanks to correct these things talking fluently and expertly largo led them back up the starboard passageway they were about to pass the radio room when bond said you said you had shiptoshore what else do you carry the usual marconi short and long wave i suppose could i have a look radio has always fascinated me largo said politely some other time if you dont mind im keeping the operator full time on met reports theyre rather important to us at the moment of course they climbed up into the enclosed dome of the bridge where largo briefly explained the controls and led them out on the narrow deck space so there you are said largo the good ship disco volante the flying saucer and she really does fly i can assure you i hope you and mr larkin will come for a short cruise one of these days for the present he smiled with a hint of a secret shared as you may have heard we are rather busy very exciting this treasure business do you think youve got a good chance we like to think so largo was deprecating i only wish i could tell you more he waved an apologetic hand unfortunately as they say my lips are sealed i hope you will understand yes of course you have your shareholders to consider i only wish i was one so that i could come along i suppose theres not room for another investor alas no the issue as they say is fully subscribed it would have been very pleasant to have had you with us largo held out a hand well i see that mr larkin has been looking anxiously at his watch during our brief tour we must not keep mr christie waiting any longer it has been a great pleasure to meet you mr bond and you mr larkin with a further exchange of courtesies they went down the ladder to the waiting launch and got under way there was a last wave from mr largo before he vanished through the hatch to the bridge they sat in the stern well away from the boatman leiter shook his head absolutely negative reaction around the engine room and the radio room but thats normal it was all normal damnably normal what did you make of him and the whole setup same as you damned normal he looks what he says he is and behaves that way not much crew about but the ones we saw were either ordinary crew or wonderful actors only two small things stuck me there was no way down to the hold that i could see but of course it could have been a manhole under the passage carpet but then how do you get the stores he talked of down there and theres the hell of a lot of space in that hold even if i dont know much about naval architecture ill do a check with the oiling wharf through the customs people and see just how much fuel he does carry then its odd that we didnt see any of these shareholders it was around three oclock when we went on board and most of them may have been having siestas but surely not all nineteen of them what do they do in their cabins all the time another small thing did you notice that largo didnt smoke and that there was no trace of tobacco smell anywhere in the ship thats odd around forty men and not one of them is a smoker if one had anything else to go on one would say that wasnt coincidence but discipline the real pros dont drink or smoke but i admit its a damned long shot notice the decca navigator and the echosounder pretty expensive bits of equipment both of them fairly normal on a big yacht of course but id have expected largo to point them out when he was showing us the bridge rich men are proud of their toys but thats only clutching at straws id have said the whole outfits as clean as a whistle if it wasnt for all that missing space we werent shown that talk about fuel and ballast sounded a bit glib to me what do you think same as you theres at least half of that ship we didnt see but then again theres a perfectly good answer to that he may have got a stack of secret treasurehunting gear down there he doesnt want anyone to see remember that merchant ship off gibraltar during the war the italian frogmen used it as a base big sort of trapdoor affair cut in the hull below the water line i suppose he hasnt got something like that bond looked sharply at leiter the olterra one of the blackest marks against intelligence during the whole war he paused the disco was anchored in about forty feet of water supposing theyd got the bombs buried in the sand below her would your geiger counter have registered doubt it ive got an underwater model and we could go and have a sniff round when it gets dark but really james leiter frowned impatiently arent we getting a bit off beam seeing burglars under the bed weve got damnall to go on largos a powerfullooking piratical sort of chap probably a bit of a crook where women are concerned but what the hell have we got against him have you put a trace through on him and on these shareholders and the crew members yes put them all on the wire from government house urgent rates we should get an answer by this evening but look here felix bonds voice was stubborn theres a damned fast ship with a plane and forty men no one knows anything about theres not another group or even an individual in the area who looks in the least promising all right so the outfit looks all right and its story seems to stand up but just supposing the whole thing was a phony a damned good one of course but then so it ought to be with all thats at stake take another look at the picture these socalled shareholders all arrive just in time for june third on that night the disco goes to sea and stays out till morning just supposing she rendezvousd that plane in shallow water somewhere just suppose she picked up the bombs and put them away in the sand under the ship if you like anyway somewhere safe and convenient just suppose all that and what sort of a picture do you get a b picture so far as im concerned james leiter shrugged resignedly but i guess theres just enough to make it a lead he laughed sardonically but id rather shoot myself than put it in tonights report if were going to make fools of ourselves wed better do it well out of sight and sound of our chiefs so whats on your mind what comes next while you get our communications going im going to check with the oiling wharf then well call up this domino girl and try and get ourselves asked for a drink and have a quick look at largos shore base this palmyra then we go to the casino and look over the whole of largos group and then bond looked stubbornly at leiter im going to borrow a good man from the police commission to give me a hand put on an aqualung and go out and have a sniff round the disco with your other geiger machine leiter said laconically destry rides again well ill go along with that james just for old times sake but dont go and stub your toe on a sea urchin or anything i see there are free chacha lessons in the ballroom of the royal bahamian tomorrow weve got to keep fit for those i guess therell be nothing else in this trip for my memory book back in the hotel a dispatch rider from government house was waiting for bond he saluted smartly handed over an ohms envelope and got bonds signed receipt in exchange it was a cable from the colonial office personal to the governor the text was prefixed probond the cable read your records have nothing repeat nothing on these names stop informatively all stations report negatively on operation thunderball stop what have you query the message was signed prism which meant that m had approved it bond handed the cable to leiter leiter read it he said see what i mean were on a bum steer this is a thumbtwiddler see you later in the pineapple bar for a dry martini thats half a jumbo olive ill go send a postcard to washington and asked them to send down a couple of waves were going to have time on our hands sour martinis as it turned out the first half of bonds program for the evening went by the board on the telephone domino vitali said that it would not be convenient for them to see the house that evening her guardian and some of his friends were coming ashore yet it was indeed possible that they might meet at the casino that evening she would be dining on board and the disco would then sail round and anchor off the casino but how would she be able to recognize him in the casino she had a very poor memory for faces would he perhaps wear a flower in his buttonhole or something bond had laughed he said that would be all right he would remember her by her beautiful blue eyes they were unforgettable and the blue rinse that matched them he had put the receiver down halfway through the amused sexy chuckle he suddenly wanted to see her again very much but the movement of the ship altered his plans for the better it would be much easier to reconnoitre her in the harbor it would be a shorter swim and he would be able to go into the water under cover of the harbor police wharf equally with her anchorage empty it would be all the easier to survey the area where she had been lying but if largo moved the yacht about so nonchalantly was it likely the bombs if there were any would be hidden at the anchorage if they were surely the disco would stand watch over them bond decided to put a decision aside until he had more and more expert information about the ships hull he sat in his room and wrote his negative report to m he read it through it would be a depressing signal to get should he say anything about the wisp of a lead he was working on no not until he had something solid wishful intelligence the desire to please or reassure the recipient was the most dangerous commodity in the whole realm of secret information bond could imagine the reaction in whitehall where the thunderball war room would be ready anxious to grasp at straws ms careful i think we may conceivably have got a lead in the bahamas absolutely nothing definite but this particular man doesnt often go wrong on these things yes certainly ill check back and see if we can get a followup and the buzz would get around ms on to something agent of his thinks hes got a lead the bahamas yes i think wed better tell the pm bond shuddered the most immediates would pour in to him elucidate your flash fullest details premier wants detailed grounds for your there would be no end to the flood leiter would get the same from cia the whole place would be in an uproar then in answer to bonds tatty little fragments of gossip and speculation there would come the blistering surprised you should take this flimsy evidence seriously futurely confine your signals to facts and the final degradation view speculative nature your and subsequents comma future signals must repeat must be joint and countersigned by cia representative bond wiped his forehead he unlocked the case containing his cipher machine transposed his text checked it again and went off to police headquarters where leiter was sitting at his keyboard the sweat of concentration pouring down his neck ten minutes later leiter took off his earphones and handed over to bond he mopped his face with an already drenched handkerchief first its sunspots and i had to swap over to the emergency wavelength there i found theyd put a baboon on the other end you know one of the ones that can write the whole of shakespeare if you leave him at it long enough he angrily waved several pages of cipher groups now ive got to unscramble all this probably from accounts about how much extra income tax this sunshine trip will cost me he sat down at a table and began cranking away at his machine bond put his short message over quickly he could see it being punched out on the tapes in one of those busy rooms on the eighth floor going to the supervisor being marked personal for m copy to oo section and records then another girl hurrying off down the passage with the flimsy yellow forms on a clip file he queried whether there was anything for him and signed off he left leiter and went down to the commissioners room harling was sitting at his desk with his coat off dictating to a police sergeant he dismissed him pushed a box of cigarettes over his desk to bond and lit one himself he smiled quizzically any progress bond told him that the trace on the largo group had been negative and that they had called on largo and gone over the disco with a geiger counter this also had been negative bond still wasnt satisfied he told the commissioner what he wanted to know about the fuel capacity of the disco and the exact location of the fuel tanks the commissioner nodded amiably and picked up the telephone he asked for a sergeant molony of the harbor police he cradled the receiver and explained we check all fueling this is a narrow harbor crammed with small craft deepsea fishing boats and so on quite a fire hazard if something went wrong we like to know what everyone is carrying and whereabouts in the ship just in case theres some firefighting to be done or we want a particular ship to get out of range in a hurry he went back to the telephone sergeant molony he repeated bonds questions listened said thankyou and put the receiver down she carries a maximum of five hundred gallons of diesel took that amount on on the afternoon of june nd she also carries about forty gallons of lubricating oil and a hundred gallons of drinking water all carried amidships just forrard of the engine room that what you want this made nonsense of largos talk of lateral tanks and the difficult ballast problem and so forth of course he could have wanted to keep some secret treasurehunting gear out of sight of the visitors but at least there was something on board he wanted to hide and for all his show of openness it was now established that mr largo might be a rich treasure hunter but he was also an unreliable witness now bonds mind was made up it was the hull of the ship he wanted to have a look at leiters mention of the olterra had been a long shot but it just might pay off bond passed on a guarded version of his thoughts to the commissioner he told him where the disco would be lying that night was there on the force a totally reliable man who could give him a hand with his underwater recce and was there a sound aqualung fully charged available harling gently asked if this was wise he didnt exactly know the laws of trespass but these seemed to be good citizens and they were certainly good spenders largo was very popular with everyone any kind of scandal particularly if the police were involved would create the hell of a stink in the colony bond said firmly im sorry commissioner i quite see your point but these risks have to be run and ive got a job to do surely the secretary of states instructions are sufficient authority bond fired his broadside i could get specific orders from him or from the prime minister for the matter of that in about an hour if you feel its necessary the commissioner shook his head he smiled no need to use the big guns commander of course you shall have what you want i was just giving you the local reaction im sure the governor would have given you the same warning this is a small puddle here were not used to the crash treatment from whitehall no doubt well get used to it if this flap last long enough now then yes weve got plenty of what you want weve got twenty men in the harbor salvage unit have to youd be surprised how often a small boat gets wrecked in the fairway just where some cruise ships going to anchor and of course theres the occasional body ill have constable santos assigned to you splendid chap native of eleuthera where he used to win all the swimming prizes hell have the gear you want where you want it now just give me the details back in his hotel bond took a shower swallowed a double bourbon oldfashioned and threw himself down on his bed he felt absolutely beat the plane trip the heat the nagging sense that he was making a fool of himself in front of the commissioner in front of leiter in front of himself added to the dangers and probably futile ones at that of this ugly night swim had built up tensions that could only be eased by sleep and solitude he went out like a light to dream of domino being pursued by a shark with dazzling white teeth that suddenly became largo largo who turned on him with those huge hands they were coming closer they reached slowly for him they had him by the shoulder but then the bell rang for the end of the round and went on ringing bond reached out a drugged hand for the receiver it was leiter he wanted that martini with the jumbo olive it was nine oclock what the hell was bond doing did he want someone to help with the zipper the pineapple room was paneled in bamboo carefully varnished against termites wroughtiron pineapples on the tables and against the wall contained segments of thick red candle and more light was provided by illuminated aquaria let into the walls and by ceiling lights enclosed in pink glass starfish the vinylite banquettes were in ivory white and the barman and the two waiters wore scarlet satin calypso shirts with their black trousers bond joined leiter at a corner table they both wore white dinner jackets with their dress trousers bond had pointed up his rich propertyseeking status with a winered cummerbund leiter laughed i nearly tied a goldplated bicycle chain round my waist in case of trouble but i remembered just in time that im a peaceful lawyer i suppose its right that you should get the girls on this assignment i suppose i just stand by and arrange the marriage settlement and later the alimony waiter leiter ordered two dry martinis just watch he said sourly the martinis arrived leiter took one look at them and told the waiter to send over the barman when the barman came looking resentful leiter said my friend i asked for a martini and not a soused olive he picked the olive out of the glass with the cocktail stick the glass that had been threequarters full was now half full leiter said mildly this was being done to me while the only drink you knew was milk id learned the basic economics of your business by the time youd graduated to cocacola one bottle of gordons gin contains sixteen true measures double measures that is the only ones i drink cut the gin with three ounces of water and that makes it up to twentytwo have a jigger glass with a big steal in the bottom and a bottle of these fat olives and youve got around twentyeight measures bottle of gin here costs only two dollars retail lets say around a dollar sixty wholesale you charge eighty cents for a martini a dollar sixty for two same price as a whole bottle of gin and with your twentyeight measures to the bottle youve still got twentysix left thats a clear profit on one bottle of gin of around twentyone dollars give you a dollar for the olives and the drop of vermouth and youve still got twenty dollars in your pocket now my friend thats too much profit and if i could be bothered to take this martini to the management and then to the tourist board youd be in trouble be a good chap and mix us two large dry martinis without olives and with some slices of lemon peel separate okay right then were friends again the barmans face had run through indignation respect and then the sullenness of guilt and fear reprieved but clutching at his scraps of professional dignity he snapped his fingers for the waiter to take away the glasses okay suh whatever you says but weve pot plenty overheads here and the majority of customers they doan complain leiter said well heres one whos dry behind the ears a good barman should learn to be able to recognize the serious drinker from the statusseeker who wants just to be seen in your fine bar yassuh the barman moved away with negro dignity bond said you got those figures right felix i always knew one got clipped but i thought only about a hundred per cent not four or five young man since i graduated from government service to pinkertons the scales have dropped from my eyes the cheating that goes on in hotels and restaurants is more sinful than all the rest of the sin in the world anyone in a tuxedo before seven in the evening is a crocodile and if he couldnt take a good bite at your pocketbook hed take a good bite at your ear the same goes for the rest of the consumer business even when its not wearing a tuxedo sometimes it gets me real mad to have to eat and drink the muck you get and then see what youre charged for it look at our damned lunch today six seven bucks with fifteen per cent added for whats called service and then the waiter hangs about for another fifty cents for riding up in the elevator with the stuff hell leiter ran an angry hand through his mop of straw hair just dont lets talk about it im fit to bust a gut when i think about it the drinks came they were excellent leiter calmed down and ordered a second round he said now lets get angry about something else he laughed curtly guess im just sore at being back in government service again watching all the taxpayers money going down the drain on this wild goose chase mark you james there was apology in leiters voice im not saying this whole operation isnt a true bill hell of a mess in fact but what riles me is that we should be a couple of arseend charlies stuck down on this sand spit while the other guys have got the hot spots you know places where something really may be happening or at least likely to happen tell you the truth i felt like a damned fool gumshoeing around that fellers yacht this afternoon with my little geiger toy he looked keenly at bond you dont find you grow out of these things i mean its all right when theres a war on but it seems kinda childish when peace is bustin out all over bond said doubtfully of course i know what you mean felix perhaps its just that in england we dont feel quite as secure as you do in america the war just doesnt seem to have ended for us berlin cyprus kenya suez let alone these jobs with people like smersh that i used to get tangled up in there always seems to be something boiling up somewhere now this damned business dare say im taking it all too seriously but theres something fishy going on around here i checked up on that fuel problem and largo certainly told us a lie bond gave the details of what he had learned at police headquarters i feel ive got to make sure tonight you realize theres only about seventy hours to go if i find anything i suggest tomorrow we take a small plane and really run a search over as much of the area as we can that planes a big thing to hide even under water you still got your license sure sure leiter shrugged his shoulders ill go along with you of course i will if we find anything perhaps the signal i got this evening wont look so damned silly after all so this was what had put leiter into such a vile temper bond said what was that leiter took a drink and gazed morosely into his glass well for my money its just so much more attitudinizing by those powerstruck fatcats at the pentagon but that sheaf of stuff i was waving about was a circular to all our men on this job to say that the army and the navy and the air force are holding themselves ready to give full support to cia if anything turns up think of that dammit leiter looked angrily at bond think of the waste of fuel and manpower that must be going on all over the world keeping all these units at readiness just to show you know what ive been allocated as my striking force leiter gave a harsh derisive laugh half squadron of super sabre fighter bombers from pensacola and leiter stabbed at bonds forearm with a hard finger and my friend the manta the manta our latest atomic submarine when bond smiled at all this vehemence leiter continued more reasonably mark you its not quite so idiotic as it sounds these sabres are on antisubmarine sweep duties anyway carrying depth charges they have to be at readiness and the manta happens to be on some sort of a training cruise in the area getting ready to go under the south pole for a change i suppose or some other damned promotion job to help along the navy estimates but i ask you heres all these million dollars worth of material on instant call from ensign leiter commanding room in the royal bahamian hotel not bad bond shrugged his shoulders seems to me your president is taking all this a bit more seriously than his man in nassau i suppose our chiefs of staff have weighed in with our stuff on the other side of the atlantic anyway no harm in having the big battalions in the offing just in case nassau casino happens to be target no by the way what ideas have your people got about these targets what have you got in this part of the world that fits in with spectres letter weve only got the joint rocket base at a place called northwest cay at the eastern end of the grand bahamas thats about a hundred and fifty miles north of here apparently the gear and prototypes we and your people have got there would easily be worth ј the only possible targets ive been given are cape canaveral the naval base at pensacola and if the party really is going to take place in this area miami for target no with tampa as a possible runnerup spectre used the words a piece of property belonging to the western powers that sounds like some kind of installation to me something like the uranium mines in the congo for instance but a rocket base would fit all right if weve got to take this thing seriously id lay odds on canaveral or this place on grand bahama only thing i cant understand if theyve got these bombs how are they going to transport them to the target and set them off a submarine could do it just lay one of the bombs offshore through a torpedo tube or a sailing dinghy for the matter of that apparently exploding these things is no problem so long as they recovered all the parts from the plane apparently youd just have to insert some kind of fuse thing in the right place between the tnt and the plutonium and screw the impact fuse off the nose and fit a time fuse that would give you time to get a hundred miles away bond added casually have to have an expert who knows the drill of course but the trip would be no problem for the disco for instance she could lay the bomb off grand bahama at midnight and be back at anchor off palmyra by breakfast time he smiled see what i mean it all adds up nuts said leiter succinctly youll have to do better than that if you want my blood pressure to go up anyway lets get the hell out of here and go have ourselves some eggs and bacon in one of those clip joints on bay street itll cost us twenty dollars plus tax but the manta probably burns that every time her screws turn full circle then well go along to the casino and see if mr fuchs or signor pontecorvo is sitting beside largo at the blackjack table cardboard hero the nassau casino is the only legal casino on british soil anywhere in the world how this is justified under the laws of the commonwealth no one can quite figure it is leased each year to a canadian gambling syndicate and their operating profits in the smart winter season are estimated to average around the only games played are roulette with two zeros instead of one which increases the take to the house from the european to a handsome blackjack or on which the house makes between and per cent and one table of chemin de fer whose cagnotte yields a modest per cent the operation is run as a club in a handsome private house on west bay street and there is a pleasant dance and supper room with a threepiece combo that plays old favorites in strict time and a lounge bar it is a wellrun elegant place that deserves its profit the governors adc had presented bond and leiter with membership cards and after they had had coffee and a stinger at the bar they separated and went to the tables largo was playing chemin de fer he had a fat pile of hundreddollar plaques in front of him and half a dozen of the big yellow thousanddollar biscuits domino vitali sat behind him chainsmoking and watching the play bond observed the game from a distance largo was playing expansively bancoing whenever he could and letting his own banks run he was winning steadily but with excellent manners and by the way people joked with him and applauded his coups he was obviously a favorite in the casino domino in black with a squarecut neckline and with one large diamond on a thin chain at her throat was looking morose and bored the woman on largos right having bancoed him three times and lost got up and left the table bond went quickly across the room and slid into the empty place it was a bank of eight hundred dollars the round sum being due to largo making up the cagnotte after each play it is good for the banker when he has got past the third banco it often means the bank is going to run bond knew this perfectly well he was also painfully aware that his total capital was only one thousand dollars but the fact that everyone was so nervous of largos luck made him bold and after all the table has no memory luck he told himself is strictly for the birds he said banco ah my good friend mr bond largo held out a hand now we have the big money coming to the table perhaps i should pass the bank the english know how to play at railway trains but still he smiled charmingly if i have to lose i would certainly like to lose to mr bond the big brown hand gave the shoe a soft slap largo eased out the pink tongue of playing card and moved it across the baize to bond he took one for himself and then pressed out one more for each of them bond picked up his first card and flicked it face up into the middle of the table it was a nine the nine of diamonds bond glanced sideways at largo he said that is always a good start so good that i will also face my second card he casually flicked it out to join the nine it turned over in midair and fell besides the nine it was a glorious ten the ten of spades unless largos two cards also added up to nine or nineteen bond had won largo laughed but the laugh had a hard edge to it you certainly make me try he said gaily he threw his cards to follow bonds they were the eight of hearts and the king of clubs largo had lost by a pip two naturals but one just better than the other the crudest way to lose largo laughed hugely somebody had to be second he said to the table at large what did i say the english can pull what they like out of the shoe the croupier pushed the chips across to bond bond made a small pile of them he gestured at the heap in front of largo so it seems can the italians i told you this afternoon we should go into partnership largo laughed delightedly well lets just try once again put in what you have won and i will banco it in partnership with mr snow on your right yes mr snow mr snow a toughlooking european who bond remembered was one of the shareholders agreed bond put in the eight hundred and they each put in four against him bond won again this time with a six against a five for the table once more by one point largo shook his head mournfully now indeed we have seen the writing on the wall mr snow you will have to continue alone this mr bond has green fingers against me i surrender now largo was smiling only with his mouth mr snow suivied and pushed forward sixteen hundred dollars to cover bonds stake bond thought i have made sixteen hundred dollars in two coups over five hundred pounds and it would be fun to pass the bank and for the bank to go down on the next hand he withdrew his stake and said la main passe there was a buzz of comment largo said dramatically dont do it to me dont tell me the banks going to go down on the next hand if it does i shoot myself okay okay i will buy mr bonds bank and we will see he threw some plaques out on to the table sixteen hundred dollars worth and bond heard his own voice say banco he was bancoing his own bank telling largo that he had done it to him once then twice and now he was going to do it inevitably again largo turned round to face bond smiling with his mouth he narrowed his eyes and looked carefully with a new curiosity at bonds face he said quietly but you are hunting me my dear fellow you are pursuing me what is this vendetta bond thought i will see if an association of words does something to him he said when i came to the table i saw a spectre he said the word casually with no hint at double meaning the smile came off largos face as if he had been slapped it was at once switched on again but now the whole face was tense strained and the eyes had gone watchful and very hard his tongue came out and touched his lips really what do you mean bond said lightly the spectre of defeat i thought your luck was on the turn perhaps i was wrong he gestured at the shoe lets see the table had gone quiet the players and spectators felt that a tension had come between these two men suddenly there was the smell of enmity where before there had been only jokes a glove had been thrown down by the englishman was it about the girl probably the crowd licked its lips largo laughed sharply he stitched gaiety and bravado back on his face aha his voice was boisterous again my friend wishes to put the evil eye upon my cards we have a way to deal with that where i come from he lifted a hand and with only the first and little fingers outstretched in a fork he prodded once like a snake striking toward bonds face to the crowd it was a playful piece of theater but bond within the strong aura of the mans animal magnetism felt the ill temper the malevolence behind the old mafia gesture bond laughed goodnaturedly that certainly put the hex on me but what did it do to the cards come on your spectre against my spectre again the look of doubt came over largos face why again the use of this word he gave the shoe a hefty slap all right my friend we are wrestling the best of three falls here comes the third quickly his first two fingers licked out the four cards the table had hushed bond faced his pair inside his hand he had a total of five a ten of clubs and a five of hearts five is a marginal number one can either draw or not bond folded the cards face down on the table he said with the confident look of a man who has a six or a seven no card thank you largos eyes narrowed as he tried to read bonds face he turned up his cards flicked them into the middle of the table with a gesture of disgust he also had a count of five now what was he to do draw or not draw he looked again at the quiet smile of confidence on bonds face and drew it was a nine the nine of spades by drawing another card instead of standing on his five and equaling bond he had drawn and now had a four to bonds five impassively bond turned up his cards he said im afraid you should have killed the evil eye in the pack not in me there was a buzz of comment round the table but if the italian had stood on his five i always draw on a five i never do it was bad luck no it was bad play now it was an effort for largo to keep the snarl off his face but he managed it the forced smile lost its twist the balled fists relaxed he took a deep breath and held out his hand to bond bond took it folding his thumb inside his palm just in case largo might give him a bonecrusher with his vast machine tool of a hand but it was a firm grasp and no more largo said now i must wait for the shoe to come round again you have taken all my winnings i have a hard evenings work ahead of me just when i was going to take my niece for a drink and a dance he turned to domino my dear i dont think you know mr bond except on the telephone im afraid he has upset my plans you must find someone else to squire you bond said how do you do didnt we meet in the tobacconists this morning the girl screwed up her eyes she said indifferently yes it is possible i have such a bad memory for faces bond said well could i give you a drink i can just afford even a nassau drink now thanks to the generosity of mr largo and i have finished here this sort of thing cant last i mustnt press my luck the girl got up she said ungraciously if you have nothing better to do she turned to largo emilio perhaps if i take this mr bond away your luck will turn again i will be in the supper room having caviar and champagne we must try and get as much of your funds as we can back in the family largo laughed his spirits had returned he said you see mr bond you are out of the frying pan into the fire in dominettas hands you may not fare so well as in mine see you later my dear fellow i must now get back to the salt mines where you have consigned me bond said well thanks for the game i will order champagne and caviar for three my spectre also deserves his reward wondering again whether the shadow that flickered in largos eyes at the word had more significance than italian superstition he got up and followed the girl between the crowded tables to the supper room domino made for a shadowed table in the farthest corner of the room walking behind her bond had noticed for the first time she had the smallest trace of a limp he found it endearing a touch of childish sweetness beneath the authority and blatant sex appeal of a girl to whom he had been inclined to award that highest but toughest french title a courtisane de marque when the clicquot rosй and fifty dollars worth of beluga caviar came anything less he had commented to her would be no more than a spoonful he asked her about the limp did you hurt yourself swimming today she looked at him gravely no i have one leg an inch shorter than the other does it displease you no its pretty it makes you something of a child instead of a hard old kept woman yes her eyes challenged him is that how you see yourself its rather obvious isnt it anyway its what everyone in nassau thinks she looked him squarely in the eyes but with a touch of pleading nobodys told me that anyway i make up my own mind about men and women whats the good of other peoples opinions animals dont consult each other about other animals they look and sniff and feel in love and hate and everything in between those are the only tests that matter but people are unsure of their own instincts they want reassurance so they ask someone else whether they should like a particular person or not and as the world loves bad news they nearly always get a bad answer or at least a qualified one would you like to know what i think of you she smiled every woman likes to hear about herself tell me but make it sound true otherwise i shall stop listening i think youre a young girl younger than you pretend to be younger than you dress i think you were carefully brought up in a redcarpet sort of way and then the red carpet was suddenly jerked away from under your feet and you were thrown more or less into the street so you picked yourself up and started to work your own way back to the red carpet you had got used to you were probably fairly ruthless about it you had to be you only had a womans weapons and you probably used them pretty coolly i expect you used your body it would be a wonderful asset but in using it to get what you wanted your sensibilities had to be put aside i dont expect theyre very far underground they certainly havent atrophied theyve just lost their voice because you wouldnt listen to them you couldnt afford to listen to them if you were to get back on that red carpet and have the things you wanted and now youve got the things bond touched the hand that lay on the banquette between them and perhaps youve almost had enough of them he laughed but i mustnt get too serious now about the smaller things you know all about them but just for the record youre beautiful sexy provocative independent selfwilled quicktempered and cruel she looked at him thoughtfully theres nothing very clever about all that i told you most of it you know something about italian women but why do you say im cruel if i was gambling and i took a knock like largo did and i had my woman a woman sitting near me watching and she didnt give me one word of comfort or encouragement i would say she was being cruel men dont like failing in front of their women she said impatiently ive had to sit there too often and watch him show off i wanted you to win i cannot pretend you didnt mention my only virtue its honesty i love to the hilt and i hate to the hilt at the present time with emilio i am halfway where we were lovers we are now good friends who understand each other when i told you he was my guardian i was telling a white lie i am his kept woman i am a bird in a gilded cage i am fed up with my cage and tired of my bargain she looked at bond defensively yes it is cruel for emilio but it is also human you can buy the outside of the body but you cannot buy what is inside what people call the heart and the soul but emilio knows that he wants women for use not for love he has had thousands in this way he knows where we both stand he is realistic but it is becoming more difficult to keep to my bargain to to lets call it sing for my supper she stopped abruptly she said give me some more champagne all this silly talking has made me thirsty and i would like a packet of players she laughed please as they say in the advertisements i am fed up with just smoking smoke i need my hero bond bought a packet from the cigarette girl he said whats that about a hero she had entirely changed her bitterness had gone and the lines of strain on her face she had softened she was suddenly a girl out for the evening ah you dont know my one true love the man of my dreams the sailor on the front of the packet of players you have never thought about him as i have she came closer to him on the banquette and held the packet under his eyes you dont understand the romance of this wonderful picture one of the great masterpieces of the world this man she pointed was the first man i ever sinned with i took him into the woods i loved him in the dormitory i spent nearly all my pocket money on him in exchange he introduced me to the great world outside the cheltenham ladies college he grew me up he put me at ease with boys of my own age he kept me company when i was lonely or afraid of being young he encouraged me gave me assurance have you never thought of the romance behind this picture you see nothing yet the whole of england is there listen she took his arm eagerly this is the story of hero the name on his cap badge at first he was a young man a powder monkey or whatever they called it in that sailing ship behind his right ear it was a hard time for him weevils in the biscuits hit with marlinspikes and ropes ends and things sent up aloft to the top of all that rigging where the flag flies but he persevered he began to grow a mustache he was fairhaired and rather too pretty she giggled he may even have had to fight for his virtue or whatever men call it among all those hammocks but you can see from his face that line of concentration between his eyes and from his fine head that he was a man to get on she paused and swallowed a glass of champagne the dimples were now deep holes in her cheeks are you listening to me you are not bored having to listen about my hero im only jealous go on so he went all over the world to india china japan america he had many girls and many fights with cutlasses and fists he wrote home regularly to his mother and to a married sister who lived at dover they wanted him to come home and meet a nice girl and get married but he wouldnt you see he was keeping himself for a dream girl who looked rather like me and then she laughed the first steamships came in and he was transferred to an ironclad thats the picture of it on the right and by now he was a bosun whatever that is and very important and he saved up from his pay and instead of going out fighting and having girls he grew that lovely beard to make himself look older and more important and he set to with a needle and colored threads to make that picture of himself you can see how well he did it his first windjammer and his last ironclad with the lifebuoy as a frame he only finished it when he decided to leave the navy he didnt really like steamships in the prime of life dont you agree and even then he ran out of gold thread to finish the rope round the lifebuoy so he just had to tail it off there you can see on the right where the rope crosses the blue line so he came back home on a beautiful golden evening after a wonderful life in the navy and it was so sad and beautiful and romantic that he decided that he would put the beautiful evening into another picture so he bought a pub at bristol with his savings and in the mornings before the pub opened he worked away until he had finished and there you can see the little sailing ship that brought him home from suez with his duffel bag full of silks and seashells and souvenirs carved out of wood and thats the needles lighthouse beckoning him in to harbor on that beautiful calm evening mark you she frowned i dont like that sort of bonnet thing hes wearing for a hat and id have liked him to have put hms before the hero but you can see that would have made it lopsided and he wouldnt have been able to get all the hero in but you must admit its the most terrifically romantic picture i cut it off my first packet when i smoked one in the lavatory and felt terribly sick and kept it until it fell to pieces then i cut off a fresh one i carried him with me always until things went wrong and i had to go back to italy then i couldnt afford players theyre too expensive in italy and i had to smoke things called nazionales bond wanted to keep her mood he said but what happened to the heros pictures how did the cigarette people get hold of them oh well you see one day a man with a stovepipe hat and a frock coat came into the heros pub with two small boys here she held the packet sideways those are the ones john player sons you see it says that their successors run the business now well they had one of the first motor cars a rolls royce and it had broken down outside the heros pub the man in the stovepipe hat didnt drink of course those sort of people didnt not the respectable merchants who lived near bristol so he asked for ginger beer and bread and cheese while his chauffeur mended the car and the hero got it for them and mr john player and the boys all admired the two wonderful tapestry pictures hanging on the wall of the pub now this mr player was in the tobacco and snuff business and cigarettes had just been invented and he wanted to start making them but he couldnt for the life of him know what to call them or what sort of a picture to put on the packet and he suddenly had a wonderful idea when he got back to the factory he talked to his manager and the manager came along to the pub and saw the hero and offered him a hundred pounds to let his two pictures be copied for the cigarette packet and the hero didnt mind and anyway he wanted just exactly a hundred pounds to get married on she paused her eyes were far away she was very nice by the way only thirty and a good plain cook and her young body kept him warm in bed until he died many years later and she bore him two children a boy and a girl and the boy went into the navy like his father well anyway mr player wanted to have the hero in the lifebuoy on one side of the packet and the beautiful evening on the other but the manager pointed out that that would leave no room for all this she turned over the packet about rich cool and navy cut tobacco and that extraordinary trademark of a dolls house swimming in chocolate fudge with nottingham castle written underneath so then mr player said well then well put one on top of the other and thats just exactly what they did and i must say i think it fits in very well dont you though i expect the hero was pretty annoyed at the mermaid being blanked out the mermaid oh yes underneath the bottom comer of the lifebuoy where it dips into the sea the hero had put a tiny mermaid combing her hair with one hand and beckoning him home with the other that was supposed to be the woman he was going to find and marry but you can see there wasnt room and anyway her breasts were showing and mr player who was a very strong quaker didnt think that was quite proper but he made it up to the hero in the end oh how did he do that well you see the cigarettes were a great success it was really the picture that did it people decided that anything with a wonderful picture like that on the outside must be good and mr player made a fortune and i expect his successors did too so when the hera was getting old and hadnt got long to live mr player had a copy of the lifebuoy picture drawn by the finest artist of the day it was just the same as the heros except that it wasnt in color and it showed him very much older and he promised the hero that this picture too would always be on his cigarette packets only on the inside bit here she pushed out the cardboard container you see how old he looks and one other thing if you look closely the flags on the two ships are flying at half mast rather sweet of mr player dont you think to ask the artist for that it meant that the heros first and last ship were remembering him and mr player and his two sons came and presented it to him just before he died it must have made it much easier for him dont you think it certainly must mr player must have been a very thoughtful man the girl was slowly returning from her dreamland she said in a different rather prim voice well thank you anyway for having listened to the story i know its all a fairy tale at least i suppose it is but children are stupid in that way they like to have something to keep under the pillow until theyre quite grown up a rag doll or a small toy or something i know that boys are just the same my brother hung on to a little metal charm his nanny had given him until he was nineteen then he lost it i shall never forget the scenes he made even though he was in the air force by then and it was the middle of the war he said it brought him luck she shrugged her shoulders there was sarcasm in her voice as she said he neednt have worried he did all right he was much older than me but i adored him i still do girls always love crooks particularly if theyre their brother he did so well that he might have done something for me but he never did he said that life was every man for himself he said that his grandfather had been so famous as a poacher and a smuggler in the dolomites that his was the finest tombstone among all the petacchi graves in the graveyard at bolzano my brother said he was going to have a finer one still and by making money the same way bond held his cigarette steady he took a long draw at it and let the smoke out with a quiet hiss is your family name petacchi then oh yes vitali is only a stage name it sounded better so i changed it nobody knows the other ive almost forgotten it myself ive called myself vitali since i came back to italy i wanted to change everything what happened to your brother what was his first name giuseppe he went wrong in various ways but he was a wonderful flyer last time i heard of him hed been given some highup job in paris perhaps thatll make him settle down i pray every night that it will hes all ive got i love him in spite of everything you understand that bond stabbed out his cigarette in the ashtray he called for the bill he said yes i understand that swimming the gantlet the dark water below the police wharf sucked and kissed at the rusty iron stanchions in the latticed shadows cast through the ironwork by the threequarter moon constable santos heaved the single aqualung cylinder up onto bonds back and bond secured the webbing at his waist so that it would not snarl the strap of leiters second geiger counter the underwater model he fitted the rubber mouthpiece between his teeth and adjusted the valve release until the air supply was just right he turned off the supply and took out the mouthpiece the music of the steel band in the junkanoo night club tripped gaily out over the water it sounded like a giant spider dancing on a tenor xylophone santos was a huge colored man naked except for his swimming trunks with pectoral muscles the size of dinner plates bond said what should i expect to see at this time of night any big fish about santos grinned usual harbor stuff sah some barracuda perhaps mebbe a shark but theys lazy an overfed with the refuse an muck from de drains dey wont trouble you less you bleedin that is theyll be nightcrawlin things on the bottom lobster crab mebbe a small pusfeller or two the bottoms mostly seagrass on bits o iron from wrecks an plenty of bottle and suchlike mucky if you get me sah but the waters clear and youll be hokay with this moon and the lights from the disco to guide you tek you bout twelve fifteen minute ida say funny ting i been lookin for an hour and deres no watchman on deck an no one in the wheelhouse an the bit o breeze should hide you bubbles coulda give you an oxygen rebreather but ah doan like dem tings them dangerous all right lets go then see you in about half an hour bond felt for the knife at his waist shifted the webbing and put the mouthpiece between his teeth he turned on the air and his fins slapping on the muddy sand walked down and into the water there he bent down spat into his mask to prevent it steaming up washed it out and adjusted it then he walked slowly on getting used to the breathing by the end of the wharf he was up to his ears he quietly submerged and launched himself forward into an easy leg crawl his hands along his flanks the mud shelved steeply and bond kept on going down until at about forty feet he was only a few inches above the bottom he glanced at the big luminous figures on the dial of his watch he untensed himself and put his legs into an easy relaxed rhythm through the roof of small waves the pale moonlight flickered on the gray bottom and the refuse motor tires cans bottles cast black shadows a small octopus feeling his shock wave turned from dark brown to pale gray and squeezed itself softly back into the mouth of the oildrum that was its home sea flowers the gelatinous polyps that grow out of the sand at night whisked down their holes as bonds black shadow touched them other tiny night things puffed thin jets of silt out of their small volcanoes in the mud as they felt the tremor of bonds passage and an occasional hermit crab snapped itself back into its borrowed shell it was like traveling across a moon landscape on and under which many mysterious creatures lived minute lives bond watched it all carefully as if he had been an underwater naturalist he knew that was the way to keep nerves steady under the sea to focus the whole attention on the people who lived there and not try to probe the sinister gray walls of mist for imaginary monsters the rhythm of his steady progress soon became automatic and while bond keeping the moon at his right shoulder held to his course his mind reached back to domino so she was the sister of the man who probably highjacked the plane probably even largo if largo was in fact involved in the plot didnt know this so what did the relationship amount to coincidence it could he nothing else her whole manner was so entirely innocent and yet it was one more thin straw to add to the meager pile that seemed in some indeterminate way to be adding up to largos involvement and largos reaction at the word spectre that could he put down to italian superstition or it could not bond had a deadly feeling that all these tiny scraps amounted to the tip of an iceberg a few feet of ice pinnacle with below a thousand tons of the stuff should he report or shouldnt he bonds mind boiled with indecision how to put it how to grade the intelligence so that it would reflect his doubts how much to say and how much to leave out the extrasensory antennae of the human body the senses left over from the jungle life of millions of years ago sharpen unconsciously when man knows that he is on the edge of danger bonds mind was concentrating on something far away from his present risks but beneath his conscious thoughts his senses were questing for enemies now suddenly the alarm was sounded by a hidden nerve danger danger danger bonds body tensed his hand went to his knife and his head swiveled sharply to the right not to the left or behind him his senses told him to look to the right a big barracuda if it is twenty pounds or over is the most fearsome fish in the sea clean and straight and malevolent it is all hostile weapon from the long snarling mouth in the cruel jaw that can open like a rattlesnakes to an angle of ninety degrees along the blue and silver steel of the body to the lazy power of the tail fin that helps to make this fish one of the five fastest sprinters in the sea this one moving parallel with bond ten yards away just inside the wall of gray mist that was the edge of visibility was showing its danger signals the broad lateral stripes showed vividly the angry hunting sign the gold and black tigers eye was on him watchful incurious and the long mouth was open half an inch so that the moonlight glittered on the sharpest row of teeth in the ocean teeth that dont bite at the flesh teeth that tear out a chunk and swallow and then hit and scythe again bonds stomach crawled with the ants of fear and his skin tightened at his groin cautiously he glanced at his watch about three more minutes to go before he was due to come up with the disco he made a sudden turn and attacked fast toward the great fish flashing his knife in fast offensive lunges the giant barracuda gave a couple of lazy wags of its tail and when bond turned back on his course it also turned and resumed its indolent sneering cruise weighing him up choosing which bit the shoulder the buttock the foot to take first bond tried to recall what he knew about big predator fish what he had experienced with them before the first rule was not to panic to be unafraid fear communicates itself to fish as it does to dogs and horses establish a quiet pattern of behavior and stick to it dont show confusion or act chaotically in the sea untidiness ragged behavior mean that the possible victim is out of control vulnerable so keep to a rhythm a thrashing fish is everyones prey a crab or a shell thrown upside down by a wave is offering its underside to a hundred enemies a fish on its side is a dead fish bond trudged rhythmically on exuding immunity now the pale moonscape changed a meadow of soft seagrass showed up ahead in the deep slow currents it waved languidly like deep fur the hypnotic motion made bond feel slightly seasick dotted sparsely in the grass were the big black footballs of dead sponges growing out of the sand like giant puffballs nassaus only export until a fungus had got at them and had killed the sponge crop as surely as myxomatosis has killed rabbits bonds black shadow flickered across the breathering lawn like a clumsy bat to the right of his shadow the thin black lance cast by the barracuda moved with quiet precision a dense mass of silvery small fry showed up ahead suspended in midstream as if they had been bottled in aspic when the two parallel bodies approached the mass divided sharply leaving wide channels for the two enemies and then closing behind them into the phalanx they adopted for an illusory protection through the cloud of fish bond watched the barracuda it moved majestically on ignoring the food around it as a fox creeping up on the chicken run will ignore the rabbits in the warren bond sealed himself in the armor of his rhythm transmitting to the barracuda that he was a bigger a more dangerous fish that the barracuda must not be misled by the whiteness of the flesh amongst the waving grass the black barb of the anchor looked like another enemy the trailing chain rose from the bottom and disappeared into the upper mists bond followed it up forgetting the barracuda in his relief at hitting the target and in the excitement of what he might find now he swam very slowly watching the white explosion of the moon on the surface contract and define itself once he looked down there was no sign of the barracuda perhaps the anchor and chain had seemed inimical the long hull of the ship grew out of the upper mists and took shape a great zeppelin in the water the folded mechanism of the hydrofoil looked ungainly as if it did not belong bond clung for a moment to its starboard flange to get his bearings far down to his left the big twin screws bright in the moonlight hung suspended motionless but somehow charged with thrashing speed bond moved slowly along the hull toward them staring upward for what he sought he drew in his breath yes it was there the ridge of a wide hatch below the water line bond groped over it measuring about twelve feet square divided down the center bond paused for a moment wondering what was inside the closed doors he pressed the switch of the geiger counter and held the machine against the steel plates he watched the dial of the meter on his left wrist it trembled to show the machine was alive but it registered only the fraction leiter had told him to expect from the hull bond switched the thing off so much for that now for home the clang beside his ear and the sharp impact against his left shoulder were simultaneous automatically bond sprang back from the hull below him the bright needle of the spear wavered slowly down into the depths bond whirled the man his black rubber suit glinting like armor in the moonlight was pedaling furiously in the water while he thrust another spear down the barrel of the co gun bond hurled himself toward him flailing at the water with his fins the man pulled back the loading lever and leveled the gun bond knew he couldnt make it he was six strokes away he stopped suddenly ducked his head and jackknifed down he felt the small shock wave of the silent explosion of gas and something hit his foot now he soared up below the man and scythed upward with his knife the blade went in he felt the black rubber against his hand then the butt of the gun hit him behind the ear and a white hand came down and scrabbled at his airpipe bond slashed wildly with the knife his hand moving with terrifying slowness through the water the point ripped something the hand let go of the mask but now bond couldnt see again the butt of the gun crashed down on his head now the water was full of black smoke heavy stringy stuff that clung to the glass of his mask bond backed painfully slowly away clawing at the glass at last it cleared the black smoke was coming out of the man out of his stomach but the gun was coming up again slowly agonizingly as if it weighed a ton and the bright sting of the spear showed at its mouth now the webbed feet were hardly stirring but the man was sinking slowly down to bonds level suspended straight in the water he looked like one of those little celluloid figures in a ptolemy jar that rise and fall gracefully with pressure on the rubber top to the jar bond couldnt get his limbs to obey they felt like lead he shook his head to clear it but still his hands and flippers moved only half consciously all speed gone now he could see the bared teeth round the other mans rubber mouthpiece the gun was at his head at his throat at his heart bonds hands crept up his chest to protect him while his flippers moved sluggishly like broken wings below him and then suddenly the man was hurled toward bond as if he had been kicked in the back his arms spread in a curious gesture of embrace for bond and the gun tumbled slowly away between them and disappeared a puff of black blood spread out into the sea from behind the mans back and his hands wavered out and up in vague surrender while his head twisted on his shoulders to see what had done this to him and now a few yards behind the man shreds of black rubber hanging from its jaws bond saw the barracuda it was lying broadside on seven or eight feet of silver and blue torpedo and round its jaws there was a thin mist of blood the taste in the water that had triggered its attack now the great tigers eye looked coldly at bond and then downward at the slowly sinking man it gave a horrible yawning gulp to rid itself of the shreds of rubber turned lazily threequarters on quivered in all its length and dived like a bolt of white light it hit the man on the right shoulder with wideopen jaws shook him once furiously like a dog with a rat and then backed away bond felt the vomit rising in his gorge like molten lava he swallowed it down and slowly as if in a dream began swimming with languid sleepy strokes away from the scene bond had not gone many yards when something hit the surface to his left and the moonlight glinted on a silvery kind of egg that turned lazily over and over as it went down it meant nothing to bond but two strokes later he received a violent blow in the stomach that knocked him sideways it also knocked sense into him and he began to move fast through the water at the same time planing downward toward the bottom more buffets hit him in quick succession but the grenades were bracketing the blood patch near the ships hull and the shock waves of the explosions became less the bottom showed up the friendly waving fur the great black toadstools of the dead sponges and the darting shoals of small fish fleeing with bond from the explosions now bond swam with all his strength at any moment a boat would be got over the side and another diver would go down with any luck he would find no traces of bonds visit and conclude that the underwater sentry had been killed by shark or barracuda it would be interesting to see what largo would report to the harbor police difficult to explain the necessity for an armed underwater sentry for a pleasure yacht in a peaceful harbor bond trudged on across the shifting seagrass his head ached furiously gingerly he put up a hand and felt the two great bruises the skin felt intact but for the cushion of water the two blows with the butt of the gun would have knocked him out as it was he still felt half stunned and when he came to the end of the seagrass and to the soft white moon landscape with its occasional little volcano puffs from the sea worms he felt as if he was on the edge of delirium wild commotion at the edge of his field of vision shocked him out of the semitrance a giant fish the barracuda was passing him it seemed to have gone mad it was snaking wildly along biting at its tail its long body curling and snapping back in a jackknife motion its mouth opening wide and shutting again in spasms bond watched it hurtle away into the gray mist he felt somehow sorry to see the wonderful king of the sea reduced to this hideous jiggling automaton there was something obscene about it like the blind weaving of a punchy boxer before he finally crashes to the canvas one of the explosions must have crushed a nerve center wrecked some delicate balance mechanism in the fishs brain it wouldnt last long a greater predator than itself a shark would note the signs the loss of symmetry that is suicide in the sea he would follow for a while until the spasms slackened then the shark would make a short jabbing run the barracuda would react sluggishly and that would be the end in three great grunting bites the head first and then the still jerking body and the shark would cruise quietly on its sickle mouth trailing morsels for the black and yellow pilot fish below his jaws and perhaps for the remora or two the parasites that travel with the great host that pick the sharks teeth when it is sleeping and the jaws are relaxed and now there were the grayslimed motor tires the bottles the cans and the scaffolding of the wharf bond slid over the shelving sand and knelt in the shallows his head down not capable of carrying the heavy aqualung up the beach an exhausted animal ready to drop the redeye catacomb bond putting on his clothes dodged the comments of constable santos it seemed there had been sort of underwater explosions with eruptions on the surface on the starboard side of the yacht several men had appeared on deck and there had been some kind of commotion a boat had been lowered on the port side out of sight of the shore bond said he knew nothing of these things he had cracked his head against the side of the ship silly thing to do he had seen what he had wanted to see and had then swum back entirely successful the constable had been a great help thank you very much and good night bond would be seeing the commissioner in the morning bond walked with careful steadiness up the side street to where he had parked leiters ford he got to the hotel and telephoned leiters room and together they drove to police headquarters bond described what had happened and what he had discovered now he didnt care what the consequences might be he was going to make a report it was eight am in london and there were under forty hours to go to zero hour all these straws added up to half a haystack his suspicions were boiling like a pressure cooker he couldnt sit on the lid any longer leiter said decisively you do just that and ill file a copy to cia and endorse it whats more im going to call up the manta and tell her to get the hell over here you are bond was amazed at this change of tune whats got into you all of a sudden well i was sculling around the casino taking a good look at anyone i thought might be a shareholder or a treasure hunter they were mostly in groups standing around trying to put up the front of having a good time sunshine holiday and all that they werent succeeding largo was doing all the work being gay and boyish the others looked like private dicks or the rest of the torrio gang just after the st valentine day massacre never seen such a bunch of thugs in my life dressed up in tuxedos and smoking cigars and drinking champagne and all that just a glass or two to show the christmas spirit orders i suppose but all of them with that smell one gets to know in the service or in pinkertons for the matter of that you know careful coldfish thinkingofsomethingelse kinda look the pros have well none of the faces meant anything to me until i came across a little guy with a furrowed brow and a big egghead with pebble glasses who looked like a mormon whos got into a whorehouse by mistake he was peering about nervously and every time one of these other guys spoke to him he blushed and said what a wonderful place it was and he was having a swell time i got close enough to hear him say the same thing to two different guys rest of the time he just mooned around sort of helpless and almost sucking a corner of his handkerchief if you get me well that face meant something to me i knew id seen it before somewhere you know how it is so after puzzling for a bit i went to the reception and told one of the guys behind the desk in a cheery fashion that i thought id located an old classmate whod migrated to europe but i couldnt for the life of me remember his name very embarrassing as he seemed to recognize me would the guy help so he came along and i pointed this feller out and he went back to his desk and went through the membership cards and came up with the one i wanted seemed he was a man called traut emil traut swiss passport one of mr largos group from the yacht leiter paused well i guess it was the swiss passport that did it he turned to bond remember a fellow called kotze east german physicist came over to the west about five years ago and sang all he knew to the joint scientific intelligence boys then he disappeared thanks to a fat payment for the info and went to ground in switzerland well james take my word for it thats the same guy the file went through my hands when i was still with cia doing desk work in washington all came back to me it was one hell of a scoop at the time only saw his mug on the file but theres absolutely no doubt about it that mans kotze and now what the hell is a top physicist doing on board the disco fits doesnt it they had come to police headquarters lights burned only on the ground floor bond waited until they had reported to the duty sergeant and had gone up to their room before he answered he stood in the middle of the room and looked at leiter he said thats the clincher felix so now what do we do with what you got this evening id pull the whole lot in on suspicion no question at all suspicion of what largo would reach for his lawyer and theyd be out in five minutes democratic processes of the law and so forth and what single fact have we got that largo couldnt dodge all right so traut is kotze were hunting for treasure gentlemen we need an expert mineralogist this man offered his services said his name was traut no doubt hes still worried about the russians getting after him next question yes weve got an underwater compartment on the disco were going to hunt treasure through it inspect it well if you must there you are gentlemen underwater gear skids perhaps even a small bathyscaphe underwater sentry of course people have spent six months trying to find out what were after how were going to get it were professionals gentlemen we like to keep our secrets and anyway what was this mr bond this rich gentleman looking for a property in nassau doing underneath my ship in the middle of the night petacchi never heard of him dont care what miss vitalis family name was always known her as vitali bond made a throwaway gesture with one hand see what i mean this treasurehunting cover is perfect it explains everything and what are we left with largo pulls himself up to his full height and says thanks gentlemen so i may go now and so i shall within the hour i shall find another base for my work and you will be hearing from my lawyers forthwith wrongful detention and trespass and good luck to your tourist trade gentlemen bond smiled grimly see what i mean leiter said impatiently so what do we do limpet mine send her to the bottom in error so to speak no were going to wait at the expression on leiters face bond held up a hand were going to send our report in careful guarded terms so we dont get an airborne division landing on windsor field and were going to say the manta is all we need and so it is with her we can keep tabs on the disco just as we please and well stay under cover keep a hidden watch on the yacht and see what happens at present were not suspected largos plan if there is one that is and dont forget this treasurehunting business still covers everything perfectly well is going along all right all hes got to do now is collect the bombs and make for target no ready for zero hour in around thirty hours time we can do absolutely nothing to him until hes got one or both of those bombs on board or we catch him at their hiding place now that cant be far away nor can the vindicator if shes hereabouts so tomorrow we take that amphibian theyve got for us and hunt the area inside a radius of a hundred miles well hunt the seas and not the land she must be in shoal water somewhere and damned well hidden with this calm weather we should be able to locate her if shes here now come on lets get those reports off and get some sleep and say were out of communication for ten hours and disconnect your telephone when you get back to your room however careful we are this signal is going to set the potomac on fire as well as the thames six hours later in the crystal light of early morning they were out at windsor field and the ground crew was hauling the little grumman amphibian out of the hangar with a jeep they had climbed on board and leiter was gunning the engines when a uniformed motorcycle dispatch rider came driving uncertainly toward them across the tarmac bond said get going quick here comes paper work leiter released the brakes and taxied fast toward the single northsouth runway the radio crackled angrily leiter took a careful look over the sky it was clear he slowly pushed down on the joystick and the little plane snarled its way faster and faster down the concrete and with a final bump soared off over the low bush the radio still crackled leiter reached up and switched it off bond sat with the admiralty chart on his lap they were flying north they had decided to start with the grand bahama group and have a first look at the possible area of target no they flew at a thousand feet below them the berry islands were a necklace of brown spits set in cream and emerald and turquoise see what i mean said bond you can see anything big through that water down to fifty feet anything as big as the vindicator would have been spotted anywhere on any of the air routes so ive marked off the areas where theres the minimum traffic theyd have ditched somewhere well out of the way assuming and its the hell of an assumption that when the disco made off to the southeast on the night of the third it was a ruse itll be reasonable to hunt to the north and the west she was away eight hours two of those would have been at anchor doing the salvage work that leaves six hours sailing at around thirty knots cut an hour off for laying the false trail and that leaves five ive marked off an area from the grand bahamas down to south of the bimini group that fits if anything fits did you get on the the commissioner yes hes going to have a couple of good men with dayandnight glasses keeping an eye on the disco if she moves from her palmyra anchorage where shes due back at midday and if were not back in time hell have her shadowed by one of the bahama airways charter planes i got him quite worried with just one or two bits of information he wanted to go to the governor with the story i said not yet hes a good man just doesnt want too much responsibility without someone elses okay i used the pms name to keep him quiet until we get back hell play all right when do you think the manta could be here sevening id say leiters voice was uneasy i must have been drunk last night to have sent for her christ were creating one hell of a flap james it doesnt look too good in the cold light of dawn anyway what the hell theres grand bahama coming up dead ahead want me to give the rocket base a buzz prohibited flying area but we might as well go in up to our ears while were about it just listen to the bawling out well be getting in just a minute or two he reached up and switched on the radio they flew eastward along the fifty miles of beautiful coast toward what looked like a small city of aluminum hutments among which red and white and silver structures rose like small skyscrapers above the low roofs thats it said leiter see the yellow warning balloons at the corners of the base warning to aircraft and fishermen theres a flight test on this morning better get out to sea a bit and keep south if its a full test theyll be firing toward ascension island about five thousand miles east off the african coast dont want to get an atlas missile up our backsides look over there to the leftsticking up like a pencil beside that red and white gantry atlas or a titan intercontinental or might be a prototype polaris the other two gantriesll be for matador and snark and perhaps your thunderbird that big gun thing like a howitzer thats the camera tracker the two saucershaped reflectors are the radar screen golly one of thems turning away toward us were going to get hell in a minute that strip of concrete down the middle of the island thats the skid strip for bringing in missiles that are recallable cant see the central control for telemetering and guidance and destruction of the things if they go mad thatll be underground one of those squat blockhouse things some brass hatll be sitting down there with his staff getting all set for the countdown or whatevers going to happen and telling someone to do something about that goddamn little plane thats fouling up the works above their heads the radio crackled a metallic voice said nakoi nakoi youre in a prohibited area can you hear me change course southwards immediately nakoi this is grand bahama rocket base keep clear keep clear leiter said oh hell no use interfering with world progress anyway weve seen all we want no good getting on the windsor field report to add to our troubles he banked the little plane sharply but you see what i mean if that little heap of ironmongery isnt worth a quarter of a billion dollars my names p rick and its just about a hundred miles from nassau perfect for the disco the radio started again nakoi nakoi you will be reported for entering a prohibited area and for failing to acknowledge keep flying south and watch out for sudden turbulence over the radio went silent leiter said that means theyre going to fire a test keep an eye on them and let me know when ill cut down the revs no harm in watching ten million dollars of the taxpayers money being blown off look the radar scanners turned back to the east theyll be sweating it out in that blockhouse all right ive seen em at it lights be blinking all over the big board way down underground the kibitzers be at their periscopes voicesll come down over the pa system beacon contact warning balloons up telemeter contact tank pressure okay gyros okay rockettank pressure correct rocket clear recorders alive lights all green ten nine eight seven six fire despite leiters graphic countdown nothing happened then through his glasses bond saw a wisp of steam coming from the base of the rocket then a great cloud of steam and smoke and a flash of bright light that turned red breathlessly for there was something terrible in the sight bond gave the blowbyblow to leiter its edging up off the pad theres a jet of flame it seems to be sitting on it now its going up like a lift now its off god its going fast now theres nothing but a spark of fire in the sky now its gone whew bond mopped his brow remember that moonraker job i was on a few years back interesting to see what the people out front saw yeah you were lucky to get out of that deep fry leiter brushed aside bonds reminiscences now then next stop those spits in the ocean north of bimini and then a good run down the bimini group around seventy miles southwest keep an eye out if we miss those dots well end up in the grounds of the fountain blue in miami a quarter of an hour later the tiny necklet of cays showed up they were barely above the water line there was much shoal it looked an ideal hidingplace for the plane they came down to a hundred feet and slowly cruised in a zigzag down the group the water was so clear that bond could see big fish meandering around the dark clumps of coral and seaweed in the brilliant sand a big diamondshaped sting ray cowered and buried itself in the sand as the black shadow of the plane pursued and shot over it there was nothing else and no possibility of concealment the green shoal waters were as clean and innocent as if they had been open desert the plane flew on south to north bimini here there were a few houses and some small fishing hotels expensivelooking deepsea fishing craft were out their tall rods streaming gay people in the welldecks waved to the little plane a girl sunbathing naked on the roof of a smart cabin cruiser hastily snatched at a towel authentic blonde commented leiter they flew on south to the cat cays that trail away south from the biminis here there was still an occasional fishing craft leiter groaned what the hells the good of this these fishermen would have found it by now if it was here bond told him to keep on south thirty miles farther south there were little unnamed specks on the admiralty chart soon the dark blue water began to shoal again to green they passed over three sharks circling aimlessly then there was nothing just dazzling sand under the glassy surface and occasional patches of coral they went on carefully down to where the water turned again to blue leiter said dully well thats that fifty miles on theres andros too many people there someone would have heard the plane if there was a plane he looked at his watch eleventhirty what next hawkshaw ive only got fuel for another two hours flying something was itching deep down in bonds mind something some small detail had raised a tiny question mark what was it those sharks in about forty feet of water circling on the surface what were they doing there three of them there must be something something dead that had brought them to that particular patch of sand and coral bond said urgently just go back up once more felix over the shoals theres something the little plane made a tight turn felix cut down the revs and just kept flying speed about fifty feet above the surface bond opened the door and craned out his glasses at short focus yes there were the sharks two on the surface with their dorsals out and one deep down it was nosing at something it had its teeth into something and was pulling at it among the dark and pale patches a thin straight line showed on the bottom bond shouted get back over again the plane zoomed round and back christ why did they have to go so fast but now bond had seen another straight line on the bottom leading off at ninety degrees from the first he flopped back into his seat and banged the door shut he said quietly put her down over those sharks felix i think this is it leiter took a quick glance at bonds face he said christ then well i hope i can make it damned difficult to get a true horizon this waters like glass he pulled away curved back and slowly put the nose down there was a slight jerk and then the hiss of the water under the skids leiter cut his engines and the plane came to a quick stop rocking in the water about ten yards from where bond wanted the two sharks on the surface paid no attention they completed their circle and came slowly back they passed so close to the plane that bond could see the incurious pink button eyes he peered down through the small ripples cast by the two dorsal fins yes those rocks on the bottom were bogus they were painted patches so were the areas of sand now bond could clearly see the straight edges of the giant tarpaulin the third shark had nosed back a big section now it was shoveling with its flat head trying to get underneath bond sat back he turned to leiter he nodded thats it all right big camouflaged tarpaulin over her take a look while leiter leaned across bond and stared down bonds mind was racing furiously get the police commissioner on the police wavelength and report get signals sent off to london no if the radio operation on the disco was doing his job he would be keeping watch on the police frequency so go on down and have a look see if the bombs were still there bring up a piece of evidence the sharks kill one and the others would go for the corpse leiter sat back his face was shining with excitement well ill be goddammed boy oh boy he clapped bond on the back weve found it weve found the goddam plane whaddya know jesus kerist bond had taken out the walther ppk he checked to see there was a round in the chamber rested it on his left forearm and waited for the two sharks to come round again the first was the bigger a hammerhead nearly twelve feet long its hideously distorted head moved slowly from side to side as it nuzzled through the water watching what went on below waiting for a sign of meat bond aimed for the base of the dorsal fin that cut through the water like a dark sail it was fully erect a sign of tension and awareness in the big fish just below it was the spine unassailable except with a nickelplated bullet he pulled the trigger there was a phut as the bullet hit the surface just behind the dorsal the boom of the heavy gun rolled away over the sea the shark paid no attention bond fired again the water foamed as the fish reared itself above the surface dived shallowly and came up thrashing sideways like a broken snake it was a brief flurry the bullet must have severed the spinal cord now the great brown shape began moving sluggishly in circles that grew ever wider the hideous snout came briefly out of the water to show the sickle mouth gasping for a moment it rolled over on its back its stomach white to the sun then it righted itself and dead probably continued its mechanical disjointed swim the following shark had watched all this now it approached cautiously it made a short snapping run and swerved away feeling safe it darted in again seemed to nuzzle at the dying fish and then lifted its snout above the surface and came down with all its force scything into the flank of the hammerhead it got hold but the flesh was tough it shook its great brown head like a dog worrying at the mouthful and then tore itself away a cloud of blood poured over the sea now the other shark appeared from below and both fish in a frenzy tore and tore again at the still moving hulk whose nervous system refused to die the dreadful feast moved away on the current and was soon only a distant splashing on the surface of the quiet sea bond handed leiter the gun ill get on down may be rather a long job theyve got enough to keep them busy for half an hour but if they come back wing one of them and if for any reason you want me back on the surface fire straight down at the water and go on firing the shock wave should just about reach me bond began to struggle out of his clothes and with leiters help into his aqualung it was a cramped difficult business it would be still worse getting back into the plane and it occurred to bond that he would have to jettison the underwater gear leiter said angrily i wish to god i could get down there with you trouble with this damned hook it just wont swim like a hand have to think up some rubber webbing gadget never occurred to me before bond said youll have to keep steam up on this crate weve already drifted a hundred yards get her back up like a good chap i dont know who im going to find sharing the wreck with me its been here a good five days and other visitors may have moved in first leiter pressed the starter and taxied back into position he said you know the design of the vindicator you know where to look for the bombs and these detonator things the pilot has charge of yes full briefing in london well so long tell mother i died game bond scrambled onto the edge of the cockpit and jumped he got his head under and swam leisurely down through the brilliant water now he could see that there were swarms of fish over the whole area below him bill fish small barracuda jacks of various types the carnivores they parted grudgingly to make room for their big pale competitor bond touched down and made for the edge of the tarpaulin that had been dislodged by the shark he pulled out a couple of the long corkscrew skewers that secured it to the sand switched on his waterproof torch and his other hand on his knife slipped under the edge he had been expecting it but the foulness of the water made him retch he clamped his lips more tightly round the mouthpiece and squirmed on to where the bulk of the plane raised the tarpaulin into a domed tent he stood up his torch glittered on the underside of a polished wing and then below it on something that lay under a scrabbling mass of crabs langoustes sea caterpillars and starfish this also bond had been prepared for he knelt down to his grisly work it didnt take long he undipped the gold identification disk and unlatched the gold wrist watch from the horrible wrists and noted the gaping wound under the chin that could not have been caused by sea creatures he turned his torch on the gold disk it said giuseppe petacchi no he strapped the two bits of evidence to his own wrists and went on toward the fuselage that loomed in the darkness like a huge silver submarine he inspected the exterior noted the rent where the hull had been broken on impact and then climbed up through the open safety hatch into the interior inside bonds torch shone everywhere into red eyes that glowed like rubies in the darkness and there was a soft movement and scuttling he sprayed the light up and down the fuselage every where there were octopuses small ones but perhaps a hundred of them weaving on the tips of their tentacles sliding softly away into protecting shadows changing their camouflage nervously from brown to a pale phosphorescence that gleamed palely in the patches of darkness the whole fuselage seemed to be crawling with them evilly horribly and as bond shone his torch on the roof the sight was even worse there bumping softly in the slight current hung the corpse of a crew member in decomposition it had risen up from the floor and octopuses hanging from it like bats now let go their hold and shot jetpropelled to and fro inside the planedreadful glinting redeyed comets that slapped themselves into dark corners and stealthily squeezed themselves into cracks and under seats bond closed his mind to the disgusting nightmare and weaving his torch in front of him proceeded with his search he found the redstriped cyanide canister and tucked it into his belt he counted the corpses noted the open hatch to the bomb bay and verified that the bombs had gone he looked in the open container under the pilots seat and searched in alternative places for the vital fuses for the bombs but they also had gone finally having a dozen times had to slash away groping tentacles from his naked legs he felt his nerve was quickly seeping away there was much he should have taken with him the identification disks of the crew the pulp of the log book that showed nothing but routine flight details and no hint of emergency readings from the instrument panel but he couldnt stand another second of the squirming redeyed catacomb he slid out through the escape hatch and swam almost hysterically toward the thin line of light that was the edge of the tarpaulin desperately he scrabbled his way under it snagged the cylinder on his back in the folds and had to back under again to free himself and then he was out in the beautiful crystal water and soaring up to the surface at twenty feet the pain in his ears reminded him to stop and decompress impatiently staring up at the sweet hull of the seaplane above him he waited until the pain had subsided then he was up and clinging to a float and tearing at his equipment to get rid of it and its contamination he let it all go and watched it tumbling slowly down toward the sand he rinsed his mouth out with the sweetness of pure salt water and swam to within reach of letters outstretched hand how to eat a girl as they approached nassau on their way back bond asked leiter to take a look at the disco lying off palmyra she was there all right just where she had been the day before the only difference which had little meaning was that she had only her bow anchor out there was no movement on board bond was thinking that she looked beautiful and quite harmless lying there reflecting her elegant lines in the mirror of the sea when leiter said excitedly say james take a look at the beach place the boathouse alongside the creek see those double tracks leading up out of the water up to the door of the boathouse they look odd to me theyre deep what could have made them bond focused his glasses the tracks ran parallel something something heavy had been hauled between the boathouse and the sea but it couldnt be surely it couldnt he said tensely lets get away quick felix then as they zoomed off overland im damned if i can think of anything that could have made those and dammit if it was what it might have been theyd have swept off those tracks pretty quick leiter said laconically people make mistakes well have to give that place the goingover ought to have done it before nicelooking dump i think ill take mr largo up on his invitation and get out there on behalf of my esteemed client mr rockefeller bond it was one oclock by the time they got back to windsor field for half an hour the control tower had been searching for them on the radio now they had to face the commandant of the field and providentially as it happened the governors adc who gave the governors blanket authorization for the string of their misdemeanors and then handed bond a thick envelope which contained signals for both of them the contents began with the expected rockets for breaking communication and demands for further news eta for the manta was five oclock that evening inquiries through interpol and the italian police confirmed that giuseppe petacchi was in fact the brother of dominetta vitali whose personal history as given to bond stood up in all other respects the same sources confirmed that emilio largo was a bigtime adventurer and suspected crook though technically his dossier was clean the source of his wealth was unknown but did not stem from funds held in italy the disco had been paid for in swiss francs the constructors confirmed the existence of the underwater compartment it contained an electric hoist and provision for launching small underwater craft and releasing skin divers in largos specifications this modification to the hull had been given as a requirement for underwater research further inquiry into the shareholders had yielded no further facts with the significant exception that most of their backgrounds and professions dated back no further than six years this suggested the possibility that their identities might be of recent fabrication and at any rate in theory this would equate with possible membership of spectre if such a body did in fact exist kotze had left switzerland for an unknown destination four weeks previously latest photographs of the man were on the midday pan american plane nevertheless the thunderball war room had to accept the solidity of largos cover unless further evidence came to hand and the present intention was to continue the worldwide search while allotting priority to the bahamas area in view of this priority and the extremely urgent time factor brigadier fairchild cb dso british military attache in washington with rear admiral carlson usn ret until recently secretary to the us chiefs of staff committee would be arriving at est by the presidents boeing columbine to take joint command of further operations the full cooperation of messrs bond and leiter was requested and until the arrival of abovenamed officers full reports every hour on the hour were to be radioed to london copy to washington under joint signature leiter and bond looked at each other in silence finally leiter said james i propose we disregard the last bit and take formal note of remainder weve already missed four hours and i dont propose we spend the rest of the day sweating it out in our radio room theres just too much to do tell you what ill do the stint of telling them the latest and then ill say were going off the air in view of the new emergency i then propose to go and look over palmyra on your behalf sticking to our cover story and i propose to have a damned good look at the boathouse and see what those tracks mean right then at five well rendezvous with the manta and prepare to intercept the disco if and when she sails as for the big brass in the presidents special well they can just play pinochle in government house until tomorrow morning tonights the night and we just cant waste it on the after you alphonse routine okay bond reflected they were coming into the outskirts of nassau through the shantytown slums tucked away behind the millionaire faзade along the waterfront he had disobeyed many orders in his life but this was to disobey the prime minister of england and the president of the united states a mighty left and right but things were moving a damned sight too fast m had given him this territory and right or wrong m would back him up as he always backed up his staff even if it meant ms own head on a charger bond said i agree felix with the manta we can manage this on our own the vital thing is to find out when those bombs go on board the disco ive got an idea for that may work may not it means giving the vitali girl a rough time but ill try and handle that side drop me at the hotel and ill get cracking meet you here again around fourthirty ill call up harling and see if hes got anything new on the disco and ask him to pass the word upstairs to you if anythings cooking youve got all that straight about the plane okay ill hang on to petacchis identification disk for the time being be seeing you bond almost ran through the lobby of the hotel when he picked up his key at the reception desk they gave him a telephone message he read it going up in the lift it was from domino please telephone quickly in his room bond first ordered a club sandwich and a double bourbon on the rocks and then called the police commissioner the disco had moved to the oiling wharf at first light and had filled her tanks then she had moved back to her anchorage off palmyra half an hour ago at onethirty precisely the seaplane had been lowered over the side and with largo and one other on board had taken off eastward when the commissioner had heard this on the walkietalkie from his watchers he had got on to the control tower at windsor field and had asked for the plane to be radartracked but she had flown low at about three hundred feet and they had lost her among the islands about fifty miles to the southeast nothing else had come up except that the harbor authorities had been alerted to expect an american submarine the manta the nuclearpowered one at around five in the evening that was all what did bond know bond said carefully that it was too early to tell it looked as if the operation was hotting up could the watchers be asked to rush the news back as soon as the seaplane was sighted coming back to the disco this was vital would the commissioner please pass on his news to felix leiter who was on his way to the radio room at that moment and could bond be lent a car anything to drive himself yes a land rover would be fine anything with four wheels then bond got on to domino out at palmyra she sounded eager for his voice where have you been all morning james it was the first time she had used his christian name i want you to come swimming this afternoon i have been told to pack and come on board this evening emilio says they are going after the treasure tonight isnt it nice of him to take me but its a dead secret so dont tell anyone will you but he is vague about when we will be back he said something about miami i thought she hesitated i thought you might have gone back to new york by the time we get back i have seen so little of you you left so suddenly last night what was it i suddenly got a headache touch of the sun i suppose it had been quite a day i didnt want to go and id love to come for a swim where she gave him careful directions it was a beach a mile farther along the coast from palmyra there was a side road and a thatched hut he couldnt miss it the beach was sort of better than palmyras the skindiving was more fun and of course there werent so many people it belonged to some swedish millionaire who had gone away when could he get there half an hour would be all right they would have more time on the reef that is bonds drink came and the sandwich he sat and consumed them looking at the wall feeling excited about the girl but knowing what he was going to do to her life that afternoon it was going to be a bad business when it could have been so good he remembered her as he had first seen her the ridiculous straw hat tilted down over the nose the pale blue ribbons flying as she sped up bay street oh well bond rolled his swimming trunks into a towel put on a dark blue seaisland cotton shirt over his slacks and slung leiters geiger counter over his shoulder he glanced at himself in the mirror he looked like any other tourist with a camera he felt in his trousers pocket to make sure he had the identification bracelet and went out of the room and down in the lift the land rover had dunlopillo cushions but the rippleedged tarmac and the pitted bends of nassaus coastal road were tough on the springs and the quivering afternoon sun was a killer by the time bond found the sandy track leading off into the casuarinas and had parked the car on the edge of the beach all he wanted to do was get into the sea and stay in it the beach hut was a robinson crusoe affair of plaited bamboo and screwpine with a palm thatch whose wide eaves threw black shadows inside were two changing rooms labeled his and hers hers contained a small pile of soft clothes and the white doeskin sandals bond changed and walked out again into the sun the small beach was a dazzling halfmoon of white sand enclosed on both sides by rocky points there was no sign of the girl the beach shelved quickly through green to blue under the water bond took a few steps through the shallows and dived through the bloodwarm upper water down into the cool depths he kept down there as long as possible feeling the wonderful cold caress on his skin and through his hair then he surfaced and crawled lazily out to sea expecting to see the girl skindiving around one of the headlands but there was no sign of her and after ten minutes bond turned back to the shore chose a patch of firm sand and lay down on his stomach his face cradled in his arms minutes later something made bond open his eyes coming toward him across the middle of the quiet bay was a thin trail of bubbles when it passed over the dark blue into the green bond could see the yellow single cylinder of the aqualung tank and the glint of a mask with a fan of dark hair streaming out behind the girl beached herself in the shallows she raised herself on one elbow and lifted the mask she said severely dont lie there dreaming come and rescue me bond got to his feet and walked the few steps to where she lay he said you oughtnt to aqualung by yourself whats happened has a shark been lunching off you dont make silly jokes ive got some seaegg spines in my foot youll have to get them out somehow first of all get this aqualung off me it hurts too much to stand on my foot with all this weight she reached for the buckle at her stomach and released the catch now just lift it off bond did as he was told and carried the cylinder up into the shade of the trees now she was sitting in the shallow water inspecting the sole of her right foot she said there are only two of them theyre going to be difficult bond came and knelt beside her the two black spots close together were almost under the curl of the middle toes he got up and held out a hand come on well get into the shade this is going to take time dont put your foot down or youll push them in further ill carry you she laughed up at him my hero all right but dont drop me she held up both arms bond reached down and put one arm under her knees and another under her armpits her arms closed round his neck bond picked her up easily he stood for a moment in the lapping water and looked down into her upturned face the bright eyes said yes he bent his head and kissed her hard on the halfopen waiting mouth the soft lips held his and drew slowly away she said rather breathlessly you shouldnt take your reward in advance that was only on account bond closed his hand firmly over her right breast and walked out of the water and up the beach into the shade of the casuarinas he laid her gently down in the soft sand she put her hands behind her head to keep the sand out of her straggling hair and lay waiting her eyes half hidden behind the dark mesh of her eyelashes the mounded v of the bikini looked up at bond and the proud breasts in the tight cups were two more eyes bond felt his control going he said roughly turn over she did as she was told bond knelt down and picked up her right foot it felt small and soft like a captured bird in his hand he wiped away the specks of sand and uncurled the toes the small pink pads were like the buds of some multiple flower holding them back he bent and put his lips to where the broken ends of the black spines showed he sucked hard for about a minute a small piece of grit from one of the spines came into his mouth and he spat it out he said this is going to be a long business unless i hurt a bit otherwise itll take all day and i cant waste too much time over just one foot ready he saw the muscles of her behind clench to take the pain she said dreamily yes bond sunk his teeth into the flesh round the spines bit as softly as he could and sucked hard the foot struggled to get away bond paused to spit out some fragments the marks of his teeth showed white and there were pinpoints of blood at the two tiny holes he licked them away there was almost no black left under the skin he said this is the first time ive eaten a woman theyre rather good she squirmed impatiently but said nothing bond knew how much it would be hurting he said its all right domino youre doing fine last mouthful he gave the sole of her foot a reassuring kiss and then as tenderly as he could put his teeth and lips back to work a minute or two later and he spat out the last section of spine he told her it was over and gently laid the foot down he said now you mustnt get sand into it come on ill give you another lift into the hut and you can put your sandals on she rolled over her black eyelashes were wet with the tears of small pain she wiped a hand over them she said looking seriously up at him do you know youre the first man whos ever made me cry she held up her arms and now there was complete surrender bond bent and picked her up this time he didnt kiss the waiting mouth he carried her to the door of the hut his or hers he carried her into his he reached out a hand for his shirt and shorts and threw them down to make a scrap of a bed he put her down softly so that she was standing on his shirt she kept her arms round his neck while he undid the single button of the brassiиre and then the tapes of the taut slip he stepped out of his bathing trunks and kicked them away when the kissing stopped bond leaned on one elbow and looked down at the beautiful drowned face there was a dew of sweat below the eyes and at the temples a pulse beat fast at the base of the neck the lines of authority had been sponged away by the lovemaking and the face had a soft sweet bruised look the wet eyelashes parted and the tawny eyes big and faraway looked up with remote curiosity into bonds they focused lazily and examined him as if they were seeing him for the first time bond said im sorry i shouldnt have done that the words amused her the dimples at each side of the mouth deepened into clefts she said you talk like a girl who has had it for the first time now you are frightened that you will have a baby you will have to tell your mother bond leaned down and kissed her he kissed the two corners of her mouth and then the parted lips he said come and swim then i must talk to you he got to his feet and held out his hands reluctantly she took them he pulled her up and against him her body flirted with his knowing it was safe she smiled impishly up at him and became more wanton bond crushed her fiercely to him to stop her and because he knew they had only a few more minutes of happiness he said stop it domino and come on we dont need any clothes the sand wont hurt your foot i was only pretending she said so was i when i came out of the sea the spines didnt hurt all that much and i could have cured them if id wanted to like the fishermen do you know how bond laughed yes i do now into the sea he kissed her once and stood back and looked at her body to remember how it had been then he turned abruptly and ran to the sea and dived deeply down when he got back to shore she was already out and dressing bond dried himself he answered her laughing remarks through the partition with monosyllables finally she accepted the change in him she said what is the matter with you james is anything wrong yes darling pulling on his trousers bond heard the rattle of the little gold chain against the coins in his pocket he said come outside ive got to talk to you sentimentally bond chose a patch of sand on the other side of the nut from where they had been before she came out and stood in front of him she examined his face carefully trying to read it bond avoided her eyes he sat with his arms around his knees and looked out to sea she sat down beside him but not close she said you are going to hurt me is it that you too are going away be quick do it cleanly and i will not cry bond said im afraid its worse than that domino its not about me its about your brother bond sensed the stiffening of her body she said in a low tense voice go on tell me bond took the bracelet out of his pocket and silently handed it to her she took it she hardly gave it a glance she turned a little away from bond so he is dead what happened to him it is a bad story and a very big one it involves your friend largo it is a very great conspiracy i am here to find out things for my government i am really a kind of policeman i am telling you this and i will tell you the rest because hundreds and perhaps thousands of people will die unless you help to prevent it that is why i had to show you that bracelet and hurt you so that you would believe me i am breaking my oath in doing this whatever happens whatever you decide to do i trust you not to tell what i am going to say so that is why you made love to me to make me do what you want and now you blackmail me with the death of my brother the words came out between her teeth now in a soft deadly whisper she said i hate you i hate you i hate you bond said coldly in a matteroffact voice your brother was killed by largo or on his orders i came here to tell you that but then he hesitated you were there and i love you and want you when what happened began to happen i should have had strength to stop it i hadnt i knew it was then or perhaps never knowing what i knew it was a dreadful thing to have done but you looked so beautiful and happy i wanted to put off hurting you that is my only excuse bond paused now listen to what i have to tell you try and forget about your hate for me in a moment you will realize that we are nothing in all this this is a thing by itself bond didnt wait for her to comment he began from the beginning and went slowly minutely through the whole case omitting only the advent of the manta the one factor that could now be of help to largo and perhaps alter his plans he ended so you see there is nothing we can do until those weapons are actually on board the disco until that moment comes largo has a perfect alibi with his treasurehunt story there is nothing to link him with the crashed plane or with spectre if we interfere with him now this moment arrest the ship on some excuse put a watch on her prevent her sailing there will only be a delay in the spectre plan only largo and his men know where the bombs are hidden if the plane has gone for them it will be keeping contact with the disco by radio if theres any hitch the plane can leave the bombs at the hiding place or at another dump them in shallow water anywhere and return for them when the trouble has blown over even the disco could be taken off the job and some other ship or plane used any time in the future spectre headquarters wherever they are will inform the prime minister that there has been a change of plan or they can say nothing at all then perhaps weeks from now they will send another communication and this time there will perhaps be only twentyfour hours notice for the money to be dropped the terms will be tougher and we shall have to accept them so long as those bombs are still lost to us the threat is there you see that yes so what is to be done the voice was harsh the girls eyes glittered fiercely as they looked at and through bond toward some distant target not he thought at largo the great conspirator but at largo who had had her brother killed we have got to know when those bombs are on board the disco that is all that matters then we can act with all our weight and we have one great factor on our side we are pretty sure that largo feels secure he still believes that the wonderful plan and it is wonderful is going exactly as it was meant to do that is our strength and our only strength you see that and how are you to know when the bombs come on board the yacht you must tell us yes the monosyllable was dull indifferent but how am i to know and how am i to tell you this man is no fool he is only foolish in wanting his mistress she spat the word out when so much else is at stake she paused these people have chosen badly largo cannot live without a woman within reach they should have known that when did largo tell you to come back on board five the boat is coming to fetch me at palmyra bond looked at his watch it is now four i have this geiger counter it is simple to use it will tell at once if the bombs are on board i want you to take it with you if it says there is a bomb on board i want you to show a light at your porthole switch the lights on in your cabin several times anything like that we have men watching the ship they will be told to report then get rid of the geiger counter drop it overboard she said scornfully that is a silly plan it is the sort of melodramatic nonsense people write about in thrillers in real life people dont go into their cabins and switch on their lights in daylight no if the bombs are there i will come up on deck show myself to your men that is natural behavior if they are not there i will stay in my cabin all right have it your own way but will you do this of course if i can prevent myself killing largo when i see him but on condition that when you get him you will see that he is killed she was entirely serious she looked at him with matteroffact eyes as if he were a travel agent and she were reserving a seat on a train i doubt if that will happen i should say that every man on board will get a life sentence in prison she considered this yes that will do that is worse than being killed now show me how this machine works she got to her feet and took a couple of steps up the beach she seemed to remember something she looked down at the bracelet in her hand she turned and walked down to the edge of the sea and stood for a moment looking out across the quiet water she said some words that bond couldnt hear then she leaned back and with all her strength threw the gold chain far out over the shoal into the dark blue the chain twinkled briefly in the strong sun and there was a small splash she watched the ripples widen and when the smashed mirror was whole again turned and walked back up the sand her small limp leaving footmarks of uneven depth bond showed her the working of the machine he eliminated the wristwatch indicator and told her to depend entirely on the telltale clicking anywhere in the ship should be all right he explained but better near the hold if you can get there say you want to take a photograph from the well deck aft or something this things made up to look like a rolleiflex its got all the rolleiflex lenses and gadgets on the front lever to press and all it just hasnt got a film you could say that youd decided to take some farewell pictures of nassau and the yacht couldnt you yes the girl who had been listening attentively now seemed distracted tentatively she put out a hand and touched bonds arm she let the hand fall she looked up at him and then swiftly away she said shyly what i said what i said about hating you that is not true i didnt understand how could i all this terrible story i still cant quite believe it believe that largo has anything to do with it we had a sort of an affair in capri he is an attractive man everyone else wanted him it was a challenge to take him from all these other smart women then he explained about the yacht and this wonderful trip looking for treasure it was like a fairy tale of course i agreed to come who wouldnt have in exchange i was quite ready to do what i had to do she looked briefly at him and away i am sorry but that is how it is when we got to nassau and he kept me ashore away from the yacht i was surprised but i was not offended the islands are beautiful there was enough for me to do but what you have told me explains many small things i was never allowed in the radio room the crew were silent and unfriendly they treated me like someone who was not wanted on board and they were on curious terms with largo more like equals than paid men and they were tough men and better educated than sailors usually are so it all fits i can even remember that for a whole week before last thursday largo was terribly nervous and irritable we were already getting tired of each other i put it down to that i was even making plans for flying home by myself but he has been better the last few days and when he told me to be packed and ready to come on board this evening i thought i might just as well do as he said and of course i was very excited over this treasure hunt i wanted to see what it was all about but then she looked out to sea there was you and this afternoon after what happened i had decided to tell largo i would not go i would stay here and see where you went and go with you for the first time she looked him full in the face and held his eyes would you have let me do that bond reached out and put his hand against her cheek of course i would but what happens now when shall i see you again this was the question bond had dreaded by sending her back on board and with the geiger counter he was putting her in double danger she could be found out by largo in which case her death would be immediate if it came to a chase which seemed almost certain the manta would sink the disco by gunfire or torpedo probably without warning bond had added up these factors and had closed his mind to them he kept it closed he said as soon as this is over i shall look for you wherever you are but now you are going to be in danger you know this do you want to go on with it she looked at her watch she said it is half past four i must go do not come with me to the car kiss me once and stay here do not worry about what you want done i will do it well it is either that or a stiletto in the hack for this man she held out her arms come minutes later bond heard the engine of the mg come to life he waited until the sound had receded in the distance down the western coast road then he went to the land rover and climbed in and followed a mile down the coast at the two white obelisks that marked the entrance to palmyra dust still hung in the driveway bond sneered at his impulse to drive in after her and stop her from going out to the yacht what in hell was he thinking of he drove on fast down the road to old fort point where the police watchers were housed in the garage of a deserted villa they were there one man reading a paperback in a canvas chair while the other sat before tripod binoculars that were trained on the disco through a gap in the blinds of a side window the khaki walkietalkie set was beside them on the floor bond gave them the new briefing and got on the radio to the police commissioner and confirmed it to him the commissioner passed two messages to him from leiter one was to the effect that the visit to palmyra had been negative except that a servant had said the girls baggage had gone on board the disco that afternoon the boathouse was completely innocent it contained a glassbottomed boat and pedallo the pedallo would have made the tracks they had seen from the air the second message said that the manta was expected in twenty minutes would bond meet leiter at the prince george wharf where she would dock the manta coming with infinite caution upchannel had none of the greyhound elegance of the conventional submarine she was blunt and thick and ugly the bulbous metal cucumber her rounded nose shrouded with tarpaulin to hide the secrets of her radar scanner from the nassavians held no suggestion of her speed which leiter said was around forty knots submerged but they wont tell you that james thats classified i guess were going to find that even the paper in the can is classified when we go aboard watch out for these navy guys nowadays theyre so tightlipped they think even a belch is a security risk what else do you know about her well we wont tell this to the captain but of course in cia we had to be taught the basic things about these atom subs so we could brief agents on what to look for and recognize clues in their reports shes one of the george washington class about four thousand tons crew of around a hundred cost about a hundred million dollars range anything you want until the chow runs out or until the nuclear reactor needs topping up say every hundred thousand miles or so if she has the same armament as the george washington shell have sixteen vertical launching tubes two banks of eight for the polaris solidfuel missile these have a range of around twelve hundred miles the crews call the tubes the sherwood forest because theyre painted green and the missile compartment looks like rows of great big tree trunks these polaris jobs are fired from way down below the surface the sub stops and holds dead steady they have the ships exact position at all times through radio fixes and star sights through a tricky affair called a startracker periscope all this dope is fed into the missiles automatically then the chief gunner presses a button and a missile shoots up through the water by compressed air when it breaks surface the solidfuel rockets ignite and take the missile the rest of the way hell of a weapon really when you come to think of it imagine these damned things shooting up out of the sea anywhere in the world and blowing some capital city to smithereens weve got six of them already and were going to have more good deterrent when you come to think of it you dont know where they are or when not like bomber bases and firing pads and so on you can track down and put out of action with your first rocket wave bond commented drily theyll find some way of spotting them and presumably an atomic depth charge set deep would send a shock wave through hundreds of miles of water and blow anything to pieces over a huge area but has she got anything smaller than these missiles if were going to do a job on the disco what are we going to use shes got six torpedo tubes up front and i dare say shes got some smaller stuff machine guns and so forth the troubles going to be to get the commander to fire them hes not going to like firing on an unarmed civilian yacht on the orders of a couple of plainclothes guys and one of them a limey at that hope his orders from the navy department are as solid as mine and yours the huge submarine bumped gently against the wharf lines were thrown and an aluminum gangplank was run ashore there was a ragged cheer from the crowd of watchers being held back by a cordon of police leiter said well here we go and to one hell of a tad start not a hat between us to salute the quarter deck with you curtsy ill bow time for decision the interior of the submarine was incredibly roomy and it was stairs and not a ladder that led down into the interior there was no clutter and the sparkling paintwork was in twotone green powerlines painted in vivid colors provided a cheerful contrast to the almost hospital decor preceded by the officer of the watch a young man of about twentyeight they went down two decks the air was beautifully cool at the bottom of the stairs he turned left and knocked on a door that said commander p pedersen usn the captain looked about forty he had a square rather scandinavian face with a black crewcut just going gray he had shrewd humorous eyes but a dangerous mouth and jaw he was sitting behind a neatly stacked metal desk smoking a pipe there was an empty coffee cup in front of him and a signal pad on which he had just been writing he got up and shook hands waved them to two chairs in front of his desk and said to the officer of the watch coffee please stanton and have this sent would you he tore the top sheet off the signal pad and handed it across most immediate he sat down well gentlemen welcome aboard commander bond its a pleasure to have a member of the royal navy visit the ship ever been in subs before i have said bond but only as a supercargo i was in intelligence rnvr special branch strictly a chocolate sailor the captain laughed thats good and you mr leiter no captain but i used to have one of my own you operated it with a sort of rubber bulb and tube trouble was theyd never let me have enough depth of water in the bath to see what she could really do sounds rather like the navy department theyll never let me try this ship full out except once on trials every time you want to get going the needle comes across a damn red line some interfering soandso has painted on the dial well gentlemen the captain looked at leiter whats the score havent had such a flood of top secret most immediates since korea i dont mind telling you the last one was from the chief of the navy personal said i was to consider myself under your orders or on your death or incapacity under commander bonds until admiral carlson arrives at this evening so what whats cooking all i know is that all signals have been prefixed operation thunderball what is this operation bond had greatly taken to commander pedersen he liked his ease and humor and in general the old navy phrase came back to him the cut of his jib now he watched the stolid goodhumored face as leiter told his story down to the departure of largos amphibian at onethirty and the instructions bond had given to domino vitali in the background to leiters voice there was a medley of soft noises the high constant whine of a generator overlaid by the muted background of canned music the ink spots singing i love coffee i love tea occasionally the pa system above the captains desk crackled and sang with operational doubletalk roberts to chief of the boat chief engineer wants oppenshaw team blue to compartment f and from somewhere came the suck and gurgle of a pumplike apparatus that sounded punctually every two minutes it was like being inside the simple brain of a robot that worked by hydraulics and electrical impulses with a few promptings from its human masters after ten minutes commander pedersen sat back he reached for his pipe and began filling it absentmindedly he said well thats one hell of a story he smiled and strangely enough even if i hadnt had these signals from the navy department id believe it always did think something like this would happen one of these days hell i have to carry these missiles around and im in command of a nuclear ship but that doesnt mean that im not terrified by the whole business got a wife and two children and that doesnt help either these atomic weapons are just too damned dangerous why any one of these little sandy cays around here could hold the whole of the united states to ransom just with one of my missiles trained on miami and here am i fellow called peter pedersen age thirtyeight maybe sane or maybe not toting around sixteen of the things enough to damn near wipe out england however he put his hands down on the desk in front of him thats all by the way now weve got just one small piece of the problem on our hands small but as big as the world so what are we to do as i see it the idea of you gentlemen is that this man largo will be coming back any minute now in his plane after picking up the bombs from where he hid them if hes got the bombs and on what youve told me ill go along with the probability that he has this girl will give us the tipoff then we close in and arrest his ship or blow it out of the water right but supposing he hasnt got the bombs on board or for one reason or another we dont get the tipoff what do we do then bond said quietly we follow him sit close on his tail until the time limit thats about twentyfour hours from now is up thats all we can do without causing one hell of a legal stink when the time limits up we can hand the whole problem back to our governments and they can decide what to do with the disco and the sunken plane and all the rest by that time some little man in a speedboat weve never heard of may have left one of the bombs off the coast of america and miami may have gone up in the air or there may be a big bang somewhere else in the world theres been plenty of time to take those bombs off the plane and get them thousands of miles from here well thatll be too bad and well have muffed it but at this moment were in the position of a detective watching a man he thinks is going to commit a murder doesnt even know for sure whether hes got a gun on him or not theres nothing the detective can do but follow the man and wait until he actually pulls the gun out of his pocket and points it then and only then the detective can shoot the man or arrest him bond turned to leiter isnt that about it felix thats how it figures and captain commander bond here and i are damn sure largos our man and that hell be sailing for his target in no time at all thats why we agreed to panic and ask you along one gets you a hundred hell be placing that bomb at night and tonights the last night hes got by the way captain have you got steam up or whatever the atom boys call it i have and we can be under way in just about five minutes the captain shook his head but theres one bit of bad news for you gentlemen i just cant figure how were going to keep track of the disco hows that youve got the speed havent you leiter caught himself pointing his steel hook threateningly at the captain and hastily brought it down again to his lap the captain smiled guess so guess we could give her a good race on a straight course but you gentlemen dont seem to have figured on the navigational hazards in this part of the ocean he pointed at the british admiralty chart on the wall take a look at that ever seen a chart with so many figures on it looks like a spilled ants nest those are soundings gentlemen and i can tell you that unless the disco sticks to one of the deepwater channels tongue of the ocean northwest providence channel or the northeast weve had it as commander bond would say all the rest of that area he waved a hand may look the same blue color on a map but after your trip in that grumman goose you know darned well it isnt the same blue color darned near the whole of that area is banks and shoal with only around three to ten fathoms over it if i was quite crazy and looking for a nice cosy job ashore id take the ship along surfaced in ten fathoms if i could bribe the navigator and seal off the echosounder from crew members but even if we got a long spell of ten fathoms on the chart you got to remember thats an old chart dates back to the days of sail and these banks have been shifting for more than fifty years since it was drawn up then theres the tides that set directly onto and off the banks and the coral niggerheads that wont show up on the echosounder until you hear the echo of them smashing up the hull or the screw the captain turned back to his desk no gentlemen this italian vessel was darned well chosen with that hydrofoil device of hers she probably doesnt draw more than a fathom if she chooses to keep to the shallows we just havent got a chance and thats flat the captain looked from one to another of them want me to call up the navy department and have fort lauderdale take over with those fighter bombers youve got on call get them to do a shadowing job the two men looked at each other bond said she wont be showing lights theyll have the hell of a job picking her up at night what do you say felix maybe wed better call them out even if its only to keep some sort of a watch off the american coast then if the captains willing well take the northwest channel if the disco sails that is and bank on the bahamas rocket station being target no felix leiter ran his left hand through the mop of strawcolored hair goddammit he said angrily hell yes i suppose so were looking fools enough already bringing the manta on stage whats a squadron of planes sure weve just got to back our hunch that its largo and the disco come on lets get together with the captain and whip off a signal that doesnt look too damned silly copy to cia and to your chief how do you want it to go admiralty for m prefixed operation thunderball bond wiped a hand down over his face god this is going to put the cat among the pigeons he looked up at the big metal wall clock six thatll be midnight in london popular time to get a signal like this the pa system in the ceiling spoke more clearly watch officer to captain police officer with urgent message for commander bond the captain pressed a switch and spoke into a desk microphone bring him below prepare to cast off lines all hands prepare for sailing the captain waited for the acknowledgment and released the switch the captain smiled across at them he said to bond whats the name of that girl domino well domino say the good word the door opened a police corporal his hat off crashed to attention on the steel flooring and extended a stiff arm bond took the buff ohms envelope and slit it open he ran his eyes down the penciled message signed by the police commissioner unemotionally he read out plane returned hoisted inboard disco sailed at full speed course northwest stop girl did not repeat not reappear on deck after boarding bond borrowed a signal blank from the captain and wrote manta will endeavor shadow via northwest providence channel stop fighter bomber squadron from fort lauderdale will be asked through navy department to cooperate within radius of two hundred miles off florida coast stop manta will keep contact through windsor field air control stop navy department and admiralty being informed stop please inform governor also admiral carlson and brigadier fairchild on arrival bond signed the message and passed it to the captain who also signed as did leiter bond put the message in an envelope and gave it to the corporal who wheeled smartly and clanked out in his heavy boots when the door was shut the captain pressed down the switch on the intercom he gave orders to sail surfaced course due north at ten knots then he switched off in the short silence there was a flurry of background noise piping of bosuns whistles a thin mechanical whine and the sound of running feet the submarine trembled slightly the captain said quietly well gentlemen thats that id like to have the goose a bit less wild and a bit more solid but ill be glad to chase her for you now then that signal with only half his mind on the wording of the signal bond sat and worried about the significance of the commissioners message and about domino it looked bad it looked as if either the plane had not brought back the two bombs or one of them in which case the mobilization of the manta and of the fighter bombers was a pretty meaningless precaution hardly justified by the evidence it could easily be that the crashed vindicator and the missing bombs were the work of some entirely different group and that while they chased the disco the field was being left clear for spectre but bonds instincts refused to allow him to accept this possibility as cover the whole disco largo setup was one hundred per cent watertight it could not be faulted in any respect that in itself was enough to arouse bonds suspicions a plot of this magnitude and audacity would only have been conceived under faultless cover and down to the smallest detail largo could have just set off on his treasure hunt and everything down to the lastminute plane recce of the treasure location to see if there were any fishing boats about for instance fitted in with that possibility or he could be sailing to lay the bomb adjust the time fuse for perhaps a few hours after the deadline to allow time for its recovery or destruction if england and america at the last moment agreed to pay the ransom and get far enough away from the danger area to avoid the explosion and establish an alibi but where was the bomb had it arrived on board in the plane and had domino for some reason been unable to go up on deck to make her signal or was it going to be picked up en route to the target area the westerly course from nassau heading perhaps for the northwest light through the berry island channel fitted both possibilities the sunken plane lay westward south of the biminis and so did miami and other possible targets on the american coast or after passing through the channel about fifty miles west of nassau the disco could veer sharply northward and after another fifty miles of sailing through shoal water that would discourage pursuit get back into the northwest providence channel and make straight for the grand bahamas and the missile station bond fretted with indecision and the fear that he and leiter were making majestic fools of themselves forced himself to face one certainty he and leiter and the manta were engaged on a crazy gamble if the bomb was on board if the disco veered north for the grand bahamas and the missile station then by racing up the northwest channel the manta might intercept her in time but if this gamble came off with all its possibilities of error why hadnt domino made her signal what had happened to her very softly very slowly the disco a dark torpedo leaving a deep briefly creaming wake hurtled across the indigo mirror of the sea in the big stateroom there was silence save for the dull boom of the engines and the soft tinkle of a glass on the sideboard although as a precaution the storm shutters were battened down over the portholes the only light inside came from a single port navigation lantern hung from the roof the dim red light only just illuminated the faces of the twenty men sitting round the long table and the redandblackshadowed features contorting with the slight sway of the top light gave the scene the appearance of a conspiracy in hell at the top of the table largo his face though the cabin was airconditioned shining with sweat began to speak his voice was tense and hoarse with strain i have to report that we are in a state of emergency half an hour ago no found miss vitali in the well deck she was standing fiddling with a camera when no came upon her she lifted the camera and pretended to take a photograph of palmyra although the safety cap was over the lens no was suspicious he reported to me i went below and took her to her cabin she struggled with me her whole attitude aroused my suspicions i was forced to subdue her by drastic measures i took the camera and examined it largo paused he said quietly the camera was a fake it concealed a geiger counter the counter was very naturally registering over milliroentgens i brought her back to consciousness and questioned her she refused to talk in due course i shall force her to do so and then she will be eliminated it was time to sail i again rendered her unconscious and roped her securely to her bunk i have now summoned this meeting to acquaint you of this occurrence which i have already reported to no largo was silent a threatening exasperated growl came from round the table no one of the germans said through his teeth and what mister no did no have to say about this he said we were to carry on he said the whole world is full of geiger counters looking for us the secret services of the whole world have been mobilized against us some busybody in nassau the police probably was perhaps ordered to have a radiation search made of all ships in harbor perhaps miss vitali was bribed to bring the counter on board but no said that once we have placed the weapon in the target area there will be nothing to fear i have had the radio operator listening for unusual traffic between nassau and the coast the density is quite normal if we were suspected nassau would be deluged with wireless traffic from london and washington but all is quiet so the operation will proceed as planned when we are well away from the area we will dispose of the lead casing of the weapon the lead casing will contain miss vitali no persisted but you will first obtain the truth from this woman it is not pleasant for our future plans to think that we may be under suspicion interrogation will begin as soon as the meeting is over if you want my opinion those two men who came on board yesterday this bond and the man larkin may be involved they may be secret agents the socalled larkin had a camera i did not look at it closely but it was similar to that in the possession of miss vitali i blame myself for not having been more careful with these two men but their story was convincing on our return to nassau tomorrow morning we shall have to be circumspect miss vitali will have fallen overboard i will work out the details of the story there will be an inquest this will be irritating but nothing more our witnesses will be unshakable it will be wise to use the coins as additional alibi for our whereabouts tonight no is the state of erosion of the coins satisfactory no kotze the physicist said judiciously it is no more than adequate but they will pass examination a cursory examination they are authentic doubloons and reals of the early seventeenth century sea water has no great effect on gold and silver i have used a little acid to pit them they will of course have to be handed to the coroner and declared as treasure trove it would need a far greater expert than he or the court to pass judgment on them there will be no compulsion to reveal the location of the treasure we could perhaps give the depth of water ten fathoms let us say and an unspecified reef i see no means by which our story could be upset there is often very deep water outside reefs miss vitali could have had trouble with her aqualung and could have been seen disappearing over the deep shelf where our echosounder gave the depth as a hundred fathoms we did our best to dissuade her from taking part in the search but she was an expert swimmer the romance of the occasion was too much for her no opened his hands there are often accidents of this nature many lives are lost in this way every year a thorough search was instituted but there were shark the treasure hunt was broken off and we immediately returned to nassau to report the tragedy no shook his head decisively i see no reason to be dismayed by this occurrence but i am in favor of a most rigorous interrogation no turned his head politely in largos direction there are certain uses of electricity of which i have knowledge the human body cannot resist them if i can be of any service largos voice was equally polite they might have been discussing remedies for a seasick passenger thank you i have means of persuasion that i have found satisfactory in the past but i shall certainly call upon you if the case is an obstinate one largo looked down the table into the shadowed ruby faces and now we will quickly run through the final details he glanced down at his watch it is midnight there will be two hours moonlight starting at three am the first light of dawn will be shortly after five am we thus have two hours for the operation our course will bring us in towards west end from the south this is a normal entry to the islands and even if our further progress toward the target area is noted by the missilestation radar it will only be assumed that we are a yacht that has strayed slightly off course we shall anchor at exactly three am and the swimming party will leave for the halfmile swim to the laying point the fifteen of you who will be taking part in this swim will as arranged swim in arrow formation the chariot and the sled with the missile in the center formation must be strictly kept to avoid straying the blue torch on my back should be an adequate beacon but if any man gets lost he returns to the ship is that understood the first duty of the escort will be to watch for shark and barracuda i will again remind you that the range of your guns is not much more than twenty feet and that fish must be hit in or behind the head any man who is about to fire must warn his neighbor who will then stand by to give additional fire if required however one hit should be sufficient to kill if the curare is as we have been informed not affected by the passage through sea water above all largo put his hands decisively down on the table before him do not forget to remove the small protective sheath from the barb before firing largo raised his hands you will forgive me for repeating these points we have had many exercises in similar conditions and i have confidence that all will be well but the underwater terrain will be unfamiliar and the effect of the dexedrine pills they will be issued to the swimming party after this meeting will be to sensitize the nervous system as well as provide the extra stamina and encouragement so we must all be prepared for the unexpected and know how to handle it are there any further questions during the planning stages months before in paris blofeld had warned largo that if trouble was caused by any members of his team it was to be expected from the two russians the exmembers of smersh no and no conspiracy blofeld had said is their life blood hand in hand with conspiracy walks suspicion these two men will always be wondering if they are not the object of some subsidiary plot to give them the most dangerous work to make them fallguys for the police to kill them and steal their share of the profits they will be inclined to inform against their colleagues and always to have reservations about the plans that are agreed upon for them the obvious plan the right way to do a thing will have been chosen for some ulterior reason which is being kept hidden from them they will need constant reassurance that nothing is being kept hidden from them but once they have accepted their orders they will carry them out meticulously and without regard for their personal safety such men apart from their special talents are worth having but you will please remember what i have said and should there be trouble should they try and sow mistrust within the team you must act quickly and with utter ruthlessness the maggots of mistrust and disloyalty must not be allowed to get a hold in your team they are the enemies within that can destroy even the most meticulous planning now no a oncefamous smersh terrorist called strelik began talking he was sitting two places away from largo on his left he did not address largo but the meeting he said comrades i am thinking of the interesting matters recounted by no and i am telling myself that everything has been excellently arranged i am also thinking that this operation will be a very fine one and that it will certainly not be necessary to explode the second weapon on target no i have some documentations on these islands and i am learning from the yachtsmans guide to the bahamas that there is a big new hotel within a few miles of our target site also a scattered township i am therefore estimating that the explosion of weapon no will destroy perhaps two thousand persons two thousand persons is not very many in my country and their death compared with the devastation of this important missile station would not in the soviet union be considered of great importance i am thinking that it will be otherwise in the west and that the destruction of these people and the rescuing of the survivors will be considered a grave matter that will act decisively towards immediate agreement with our terms and the saving of target no from destruction this being so comrades the dull flat voice gained a trace of animation i am saying to myself that within as little as twentyfour hours our labors will have been completed and the great prize will be within our grasp now comrades the red and black shadows turned the taut little smile into a dark grimace with so much money so near at hand a most unworthy thought has come into my mind and i would not be performing my duty to my russian comrade no nor to the other members of our team if i did not share this thought with you at the same time requesting forbearance for what may be unfounded suspicions the meeting was very quiet ominously so these men had all been secret agents or conspirators they recognized the smell of insurrection the shadow of approaching disloyalty what did no know what was he going to divulge each man got ready to decide very quickly which way to jump when the cat was let out of the bag largo slipped the gun out of his pocket and held it along his thigh there will come a moment continued no watching the faces of the men opposite for a quick gauge of their reactions very shortly when fifteen of us leaving five members and six subagents on board this ship will be out there he waved a hand at the cabin wall in the darkness at least half an hours swim from this ship at that moment comrades the voice became sly what a thing it would be if those remaining on board were to sail the ship away and leave us in the water there was a shifting and muttering round the table no held up a hand ridiculous i am thinking and so no doubt are you comrades but we are men of a feather we recognize the unworthy urges that can come upon even the best of friends and comrades when fortunes are at stake and comrades with fifteen of us gone how much more of a fortune would there be for those remaining with their story for no of a great fight with sharks in which we all succumbed largo said softly and what is it you propose no for the first time no looked to his right he could not see the expression in largos eye he spoke at the great red and black mass of his face the tone of his voice was obstinate he said i am proposing that one member of each national group should stay on board to safeguard the interests of the other members of his national group that would reduce the swimming party to ten in this way those who are undertaking this dangerous work would go about it with more enthusiasm knowing that no such happening as i have mentioned could come about largos voice was polite unemotional he said i have one very short and simple answer to your suggestion no the light glittered redly on the metal thumb that protruded from the big hand the three bullets pumped so quickly into the face of the russian that the three explosions the three bright flashes were almost one no put up two feeble hands palms forward as if to catch any further bullets gave a jerk forward with his stomach at the edge of the table and then crashed heavily backward in a splinter of chair wood onto the floor largo put the muzzle of the gun up to his nose and delicately sniffed at it moving it to and fro under the nostrils as if it was some delicious phial of perfume in the silence he looked slowly down one rank of faces and up the other finally he said softly the meeting is now at an end will all members please return to their cabins and look for a last time to their equipment food will be ready from now on in the galley one drink of alcohol will also be available for those who want it i will detail two crew members to look after the late no thank you when largo was alone he got to his feet stretched and gave a great cavernous yawn then he turned to the sideboard opened a drawer and took out a box of corona cigars he chose one and with a gesture of distaste lit it he then took the closed red rubber container that held the ice cubes and walked out of the door and along to the cabin of domino vitali he closed the door and locked it here also a red riding light hung from the ceiling under it on the double bunk the girl lay offered like a starfish her ankles and wrists strapped to the four corners of the ironwork below the mattress largo put the icebox down on the chest of drawers and balanced the cigar carefully beside it so that the glowing tip would not spoil the varnish the girl watched him her eyes glittering red points in the semidarkness largo said my dear i have had great enjoyment out of your body much pleasure in return unless you tell me who gave you that machine to bring on board i shall be forced to cause you great pain it will be caused with these two simple instruments he held up the cigar and blew on the tip until it glowed brightly this for heat and these ice cubes for cold applied scientifically as i shall apply them they will have the inevitable effect of causing your voice when it has stopped screaming to speak and speak the truth now then which is it to be the girls voice was deadly with hate she said you killed my brother and you will now kill me go on and enjoy yourself you are already a piece of death yourself when the rest of it comes very soon i pray god you will suffer a million times more than both of us largos laugh was a short harsh bark he walked over to the edge of the bunk he said very well my dear we must see what we can do with you very softly and very very slowly he bent down and hooked his fingers in the neckline of her shirt and the join of the brassiere very slowly but with great force he tore downward the whole length of her then he threw aside the torn halves of material and exposed the whole gleaming length of her body he examined it carefully and reflectively and then went to the chest of drawers and took the cigar and the bowl of ice cubes and came back and made himself comfortable on the edge of the bunk then he took a puff at the cigar knocked the ash off onto the floor and leaned forward the shadower in the attack center of the manta it was very quiet commander pedersen standing behind the man at the echosounder occasionally made a comment over his shoulder to bond and leiter who had been given canvasbacked chairs well away from the depth and speed gauges which had been hooded so that they could be read only by the navigating team these three men sat side by side on red leather foamcushioned aluminum seats handling the rudder and the forward and aft diving planes as if they were pilots in an airliner now the captain left the echosounder and came over to bond and leiter he smiled cheerfully thirty fathoms and the nearest cay is a mile to westwards now weve got a clear course all the way to grand bahama and were making good speed if we keep it up weve got about four hours sailing be off grand bahama about an hour before first light how about some food and a bit of sleep there wont be anything on the radar for an hour these berry islands fill the screen until were clear of them then come the big question when we clear them shall we see that one of the smallest of the cays has broken loose and is sailing fast northwards on a parallel course to ours if we see that on the screen itll be the disco if shes there well submerge youll hear the alarm bells but you can just roll over and have a bit more sleep nothing can happen until its certain that shes in the target area then well have to think again the captain made for the stairway mind if i lead the way watch your head on the pipes this is the one part of the ship where there isnt much clearance they followed him down and along a passage to the mess hall a welllighted dining room finished in cream with pastel pink and green panels they took their places at the head of one of the formicatop tables away from the other officers and men who looked curiously at the two civilians the captain waved a hand at the walls of the room bit of a change from the old battleship gray youd be surprised how many eggheads are involved in the design of these ships have to be if you want to keep your crew happy when the ships submerged for a month or more at a time the trickcyclists said we couldnt have just one color must have contrast everywhere or the mens eyes get sort of depressed this halls used for movies closedcircuit television cribbage tournaments bingo god knows what anything to keep the men off duty from getting bored and you notice theres no smell of cooking or engine smells electrostatic precipitators all over the ship that filter them off a steward came with menus now then lets get down to it im having the baked virginia ham with redeye gravy apple pie with ice cream and iced coffee and steward dont go too easy on that redeye he turned to bond getting out of harbor always gives me an appetite you know it isnt the sea the captain hates its the land bond ordered poached eggs with rye toast and coffee he was grateful for the captains cheerful talk but he himself had no appetite there was a gnawing tension inside him which would be released only when the disco was picked up on the radar and there would be a prospect of action and lurking behind his concern about the whole operation was worry about the girl had he been right to trust her with so much of the truth had she betrayed him had she been caught was she alive he drank down a glass of iced water and listened to the captain explaining how the ice cubes and the water were distilled from the sea finally bond became impatient with the cheerful even tone of the conversation he said forgive me captain but could i interrupt for a moment and clear my mind about what were going to do if were right about the disco and if we come up with her off the grand bahama i cant quite figure what the next step ought to be ive got my own ideas but were you thinking wed try and go alongside and board her or just blow her out of the water the captains gray eyes were quizzical he said i was kind of leaving all that to you fellers the navy department says that im under your orders im just the chauffeur supposing you tell me what you have in mind and ill be glad to go along with anything you suggest so long as it doesnt endanger my ship he smiled too much that is in the last resort if the navy department means what it says and from your account of this operation it does the safety of the ship will also have to go by the board as i told you aloft in the attack center i got acknowledgment of our signal and full approval for our proposed course of action thats all the clearance i need now then you tell me the food came bond pecked at his eggs and pushed them away he lit a cigarette he said looking at felix leiter well i dont know what youve worked out felix but this is how i see the picture we may find around four oclock in the morning on the assumption that is that the disco has been sailing north in shoal water under cover of the berry islands and that shell then make for the grand bahama shore somewhere off the site of the missile station well now on that assumption ive had a good look at the charts and it seems to me that if shes going to lay that bomb as close to the target as she can shell heave to and anchor about a mile offshore in about ten fathoms and get the bomb another halfmile or so closer to the target lay it in twelve feet of water or so switch on the time mechanism and get the hell away thats how id go about it shed be away by first light and theres plenty of yacht traffic around west end from what i can gather from the pilot shed show up on the station radar of course but shed be just another yacht assuming the bombs set for the twelve hours largos got before the time limit expires he could be back in nassau or twice as far away if he wanted in the time hes got for my money hell go back to nassau with his treasurehunting story and wait for the next lot of orders from spectre bond paused he avoided leiters eyes that is unless hes managed to get information out of the girl leiter said stanchly hell i dont believe that girl would talk shes a tough cookie and supposing she did hes only got to drop her overboard with some lead round her neck and say her aqualung failed on the treasure hunt or some spiel of that sort hed go back to nassau all right that mans covers as solid as j p morgan and company the captain interrupted leaving all that aside commander bond and sticking to the operational angles how do you suggest hes going to get that bomb out of the ship and right into the target area i agree that according to the charts he cant get much closer in the yacht and if he did he might be in trouble with the waterfront guard at the missile station i see from my dope on the place that theyve got some kind of a guard boat for chasing away fishermen and suchlike when theyre going to do a practice shoot bond said decisively im sure thats the real purpose of the underwater compartment in the disco theyve got one of those underwater sleds in there and probably an electric torpedo to haul it theyll load the bomb on the sled and take it in with a team of underwater swimmers lay it and come back to the ship otherwise why have all that underwater gear the captain said slowly you may be right commander it makes sense but so what do you want me to do about it bond looked the captain in the eye theres only one moment to nail these people if we show our hand too soon the disco can get the hell away only a few hundred yards maybe and dump the bombs in a hundred fathoms the only time to get them and the bomb the first bomb anyway is when that team has left the ship and is on its way to the laying point weve got to get their underwater team with our underwater team the second bomb if its aboard doesnt matter we can sink the ship with the second bomb inside her the captain looked down at his plate he arranged the knife and fork tidily together straightened the dessert spoon and took the remains of his iced coffee and swirled the fragments of ice round so that they tinkled he put the glass back on the table and looked up first at leiter then at bond he said thoughtfully i guess what you say makes sense commander we have plenty of oxygen rebreathers on board we also have ten of the finest swimmers in the nuclear flotilla but theyll only have knives to fight with ill have to ask for volunteers he paused whos going to lead them bond said ill do that skindiving happens to be one of my hobbies and i know what fish to look out for and which ones not to mind about ill brief your men about those things felix leiter interrupted he said obstinately and dont think youre going to leave me behind eating virginia ham i put an extra footflipper on this he held up the shining hook and ill race you over half a mile any day gammy leg and all youd be surprised the things one gets around to improvise when someone chews off one of your arms compensation its called by the medics in case you hadnt heard about it the captain smiled he got to his feet okay okay ill leave you two heroes to fight it out while i have a word to the men over the speaker system then well have to get together with the charts and see that the gears okay and suchlike you fellers arent going to get any sleep after all ill have a ration of battle pills issued to you youre going to need them he raised a hand and went off down the mess hall leiter turned to bond you goddam shyster thought you were going to leave your old pal behind didnt you god the treachery of you limeys perfidious albion is right all right bond laughed how the hell was i to know youd been in the hands of rehabilitators and therapists and so on i never knew you took life so seriously i suppose youve even found some way of petting with that damned meathook of yours leiter said darkly youd be surprised get a girl round the arm with this and youd be amazed the effect it has on their good resolutions now then lets get down to cases what sort of formation are we going to swim in can we get some of those knives made into lances how are we going to recognize our side from theirs underwater and in semidarkness at that weve got to make this operation pretty solid that pedersens a good guy we dont want to get some of his men killed through some damn silly mistake of ours the voice of the captain sounded over the communication system now hear this this is your captain speaking it is possible that we may encounter hazards in the course of this operation i will tell you how this may come about this ship has been chosen by the navy department for an exercise that is tantamount to an operation of war i will tell you the story which will remain classified top secret until further orders this is what has happened bond asleep in one of the duty officers bunks was awakened by the alarm bell the iron voice of the pa system said diving stations diving stations and almost at once his bunk tilted slightly and the distant whine of the engines altered pitch bond smiled grimly to himself he slipped off the bunk and went along and up to the attack center felix leiter was already there the captain turned away from the plot his face was tense he said it looks as if you were right gentlemen weve got her all right about five miles ahead and two points to starboard shes doing around thirty knots no other ship could be holding that speed or would be likely to and shes showing no lights here care to have a look through the scope shes raising quite a wake and kicking up plenty of phosphorescence no moon yet but youll see the white blur when your eyes get used to the dark bond bent to the rubber eye sockets in a minute he had her a white scut on the horizon of the soft feathery swell he stood back whats her course same as ours western end of grand bahama well go deeper now and put on a bit of speed weve got her on the sonar as well so we shant lose her well get up parallel and close in a bit later the met report gives a light westerly breeze in the early hours thatd be a help dont want it too calm when we unload the swimming party the surfacell boil quite a bit as each man goes out here he turned to a powerfullooking man in white ducks this is petty officer fallon hes in command of the swimming party under your and mr leiters orders of course all the top swimmers volunteered hes chosen nine of them ive taken them off all duties maybe you gentlemen would like to get acquainted with your team youll want to discuss your routines i guess disciplinell have to be pretty tight recognition signals and so forth okay the sergeant at arms is looking after the weapons he smiled hes rustled up a dozen flick knives had some difficulty persuading the men to give them up but hes done it hes barbed them and sharpened them down almost to needles then fitted them into the tops of broom handles guess hell make you sign an indent for the brooms or hell have the supply officer on top of him when we get out of this all right then be seeing you ask for anything you want he turned back to the plot bond and leiter followed petty officer fallon along the lower deck to the engine room and then to the enginerepair shop on their way they passed through the reactor room the reactor the equivalent of a controlled atomic bomb was an obscene kneelevel bulge rising out of the thickly leaded deck as they passed it leiter whispered to bond liquid sodium submarine intermediate reactor mark b he grinned sourly and crossed himself bond gave the thing a sideways kick with his shoe steamage stuff our navys got the mark c the repair shop a long low room equipped with various forms of precision machinery presented a curious sight at one end were grouped the nine swimmers clad only in bathing trunks their fine bodies glowing with sunburn at the other two men in gray overalls drab figures of the machine age were working in semidarkness with only pinpoints of bright light cast on the whirring lathes from which the knife blades threw small fountains of blue and orange sparks some of the swimmers already had their spears after the introductions bond took one and examined it it was a deadly weapon the blade sharpened to a stiletto and notched near the top into a barb firmly wired into the top of a long stout stave bond thumbed the needlesharp steel and touched the tip even a sharks skin would not stand up to that but what would the enemy have co guns for a certainty bond looked the smiling bronzed young men over there were going to be casualties perhaps many everything must be done to effect surprise but those golden skins and his own and leiters paler skins would show at twenty feet in the moonlight all right for the guns but well out of range of the spears bond turned to petty officer fallon i suppose you dont have rubber suits on board why sure commander have to for escape in cold waters he smiled were not always sailing among the palm trees well all need them and could you get white or yellow numbers big ones painted on their backs then well know more or less whos who sure sure he called to his men hey fonda and johnson go along to the quartermaster and draw rubber suits for the whole team bracken get a pail of rubber solution paint from stores paint numbers on the backs of the suits a foot deep from one to twelve get going later with the gleaming black suits hanging like giant bat skins along the wall bond called the team together men were going to have one hell of an underwater battle therell be casualties anyone care to change his mind the faces grinned back at him all right then now well be swimming at around ten feet for a quarter perhaps half a mile itll be pretty light the moonll be up and the bottoms white sand with some seagrass well take it easy and go in triangle formation with me no leading followed by mr leiter here as no and petty officer fallon as no then we broaden out behind like a wedge of geese all you have to do is follow the number in front of you and no onell get lost watch out for isolated niggerheads as far as i can gather from the chart theres no true reef only broken clumps itll be getting on for early feeding time for the fish so watch out for anything big but leave it alone unless it gets too inquisitive then three of you take it on with the spears but dont forget that its most unlikely any fish will attack us close together well look like one hell of a big black fish to anyone else and i guess well be given a wide berth watch out for sea eggs on the coral and mind the tips of your spears hold them right up near the blade above all keep quiet we must try and get surprise on our side the enemys got co guns range above twenty feet but theyre slow things to reload if ones aimed at you try and give a small target keep flat in the water dont put your feet down and give him a fulllength target as soon as hes fired go for him like hell with your spear right out one jab of those things in almost any part of the head or body and your mans had it wounded men will have to look after themselves we cant spare stretcher bearers if youre wounded back out of the fight and get away to a coral clump and rest on it or make for the shore and shallow water if youve got a spear in you dont try and pull it out just hold it in the wound until someone gets to you petty officer fallon will have one of the ships signal flares hell release that to the surface as soon as our attack begins and your captain will at once surface and put out an escape dinghy with an armed party and the ships surgeon now then any questions what do we do as soon as we get out of the sub sir try and not make any fuss on the surface get down quickly to ten feet and take your place in the formation were likely to get help from a light breeze but were bound to create turbulence on the surface keep it down as much as you can what about signals underwater sir suppose a mask goes wrong or something thumbs down for any kind of emergency arm held straight out for a big fish thumbs up means i understand or coming to help you thats all youll need bond smiled if the feet go up thats the signal that youve had it the men laughed various kinds of laugh there came the sudden voice of the pa system swimming party to the escape hatch i repeat swimming party to the escape hatch don equipment don equipment commander bond to the attack center please the whine of the engines died to a moan and then was silent there was a slight bump as the manta hit bottom naked warfare bond shot upward out of the escape hatch in a blast of compressed air far above him the surface of the sea was a glittering plate of quicksilver bubbling and swirling with the small waves that bond was glad to see had materialized the balloon of air rushed on past him and he watched it hit the silver ceiling like a small bomb there was a sharp pain in his ears to get decompression he fought with his fins and slowed down until he hung suspended ten feet below the surface below him the long black shape of the manta looked sinister and dangerous he thought of the electric light blazing inside her and a hundred men going about their business it gave him a creepy feeling now there came a great explosion from the escape hatch as if the manta was firing at bond and the black projectile of leiter shot up at him through the burst of silver air bubbles bond moved out of his path and swam on up to the surface cautiously he looked above the small flurry of the waves the disco still blacked out lay stopped less than a mile away to his left there were no signs of activity on board a mile to the north lay the long dark outline of grand bahama edged with the white of sand and small waves there were small patches of broken white on the coral and niggerheads in the intervening water above the island on top of the tall rocket gantries that showed as indistinct black skeletons the red aircraft warning lights winked on and off bond got his bearings and quietly jackknifed his body down below the surface he stopped at about ten feet and keeping his body pointed like a compass needle along the course he would have to follow lay paddling softly with his fins to keep position and waited for the rest of his team ten minutes before commander pedersens stolid calm had given way to controlled excitement by gum its working out like you said it would he had said wonderingly when bond came into the attack center they hove to just about ten minutes ago and since then the sonar keeps on picking up odd noises underwater noises just what one would expect if they were getting things mobilized in that underwater compartment of theirs nothing else to go on but its quite enough i guess you and the boys had better get going as soon as youre out of the way im going to float up a surface antenna and get a signal off to navy department give them a sitrep and have the missile station warned to stand by to evacuate if things go wrong then im going to come up to twenty feet or so and have two tubes loaded and keep a periscope watch im issuing petty officer fallon with a second flare ive told him to keep out of trouble as much as he can and be ready to let off the second flare if it looks as if things are going really bad for our side unlikely but i cant take chances with things as they are if that second flare comes up im going to close in knock a piece or two off the disco with the fourinch and then board her then im going to be rough as hell until that bombs been recovered and rendered safe the captain shook his head doubtfully he ran his hand over the black iron filings of his crewcut this is one hell of a situation commander well just have to play it by ear he held out his hand well youd better get going good luck i hope my boysll be a credit to the ship bond felt a tap on his shoulder it was leiter he grinned through his mask and jerked up a thumb bond took a quick look behind him the men lay spread out in a rough wedge their fins and hands working slowly as they marked time in the water bond nodded and got going moving forward with a slow even trudge one hand at his side and the other holding his spear up the shaft against his chest behind him the black wedge fanned out into formation and cruised forward like some giant deltawinged stingray on the prowl it was hot and sticky inside the black suit and the recirculating oxygen coming through the mouthpiece tasted of rubber but bond forgot the discomfort as he concentrated on keeping an even pace and a dead steady course on a prominent niggerhead with waves washing its head that he had chosen as a fix for his first contact with the shoal waters far below where the dancing moon shadows could not penetrate the bottom was even white sand with an occasional dark patch that would be seagrass all around there was nothing but the great pale luminous hall of the sea at night a vast lonely mist through which against his will and his intelligence bond expected at any moment the dark torpedo of a great fish to materialize its eyes and senses questing toward the rippling shape of the black intruder but there was nothing and nothing came and gradually the patches of seagrass became more distinct and ripples showed on the sandy bottom as it shelved slowly up from fifty to forty and then to thirty feet to reassure himself that all was well bond took a quick glance over his shoulder yes they were all there the oval panes of eleven gleaming masks with the fluttering fins kicking up behind them and the glint of the moonlight on the blades of the spears bond thought by god if only we can achieve surprise what a terrifying ambush to meet coming at you through the shadows and shapes of the reef his heart lifted momentarily at the thought only to be checked by the deep gnawing of his hidden fears about the girl supposing she was part of the enemy team supposing he came face to face with her would he bring himself to do it with the spear but the whole idea was ridiculous she was on board safe he would be seeing her again soon as soon as this work was done a small coral clump showed up below and refocused his mind now he gazed watchfully ahead there were more clumps the ink splashes of sea eggs crowds of small glittering reef fish a small forest of sea fans that beckoned and waved with the ebb and flow like the hair of drowned women bond slowed and felt leiter or fallon bump into his fins he made the slowing signal with his free hand now he crept carefully forward looking for the silvery wash of the waves against the top of his navigation mark yes it was there away to the left he was a good twenty feet off course he swerved toward it gave the halt signal and came slowly up under its protection with infinite caution he raised his head through the sucking waves he glanced first toward the disco yes she was still there showing more plainly with the moon now full on her no sign of life bond inched his gaze slowly across the intervening sea nothing a flurry of wavelets down the mirrored pathway of the moon now bond slid round to the other side of the coral head nothing but the broken waters of the shoal and five or six hundred yards away the clear coastline and the beach bond searched the clear channels for unusual turbulence in the water for shapes for anything moving what was that a hundred yards away on the edge of a big patch almost a lagoon of clear water among the coral a head a pale head with the glitter of a mask across it had broken the surface for an instant taken a quick look around and immediately submerged bond held his breath he could feel his thrilled heart hammering against the inside of his rubber suit feeling stifled he took the breathing tube from between his teeth and let his breath burst out of him he quickly gulped in some mouthfuls of fresh air got a good fix on the position crammed the tube roughly between his lips and slid back and down behind the masks gazed blankly at him waiting for a signal bond jerked up his thumb several times through the near masks he could see the answering flash of teeth bond shifted his grasp on the spear down to an attacking position and surged forward over the low coral now it was only a question of speed and careful navigation among the occasional higher outcrops fish squirted out of his path and all the reef seemed to waken with the shock wave of the twelve hastening bodies fifty yards on bond signaled to slow to fan out in the attacking line then he crept on again his eyes aching and bloodshot with the strain boring ahead through the jagged shapes among the pale mist yes there was the glitter of white flesh and there and there bonds arm made the hurling signal for the attack he plunged forward his spear held in front of him like a lance bonds group came in from the flank it was a mistake as bond quickly saw for the spectre team was still moving forward and at a speed that surprised bond until he saw the small whirring propellers on the backs of the enemy largos men were wearing compressedair speed packs bulky cylinders strapped between the twin cylinders of their aqualungs that operated small screws combined with the trudge of the fins this gave them at least double normal swimming speed in open water but here among the broken coral and slowed by the maneuvering of the sled preceded by the electric chariot the team was perhaps only a knot faster than bonds group now thrashing their way forward to an interception point that was rapidly escaping them and there were a hell of a lot of the enemy bond stopped counting after twelve and most of them carried co guns with extra spears in quivers strapped to their legs the odds were bad if only he could get within spear range before the alarm was given thirty yards twenty bond glanced behind him there were six of his men almost at arms length the rest straggled out in a crooked line still the masks of largos men pointed forward still they hadnt seen the black shapes making for them through the coral but now when bond was level with largos rear guard the moon threw his shadow forward across a pale patch of sand and one man then another glanced quickly round bond got a foot against a lump of coral and with this to give him impetus flung himself forward the man had no time to defend himself bonds spear caught him in the side and hurled him against the next man in line bond thrust and wrenched sickeningly the man dropped his gun and bent double clutching his side bond bored on into the mass of naked men now scattering in all directions with their jet packs accelerated another man went down in front of him clawing at his face a chance thrust of bonds had smashed the glass of his mask he threshed his way up toward the surface kicking bond in the face as he went a spear ripped into the rubber protecting bonds stomach and bond felt pain and wetness that might be blood or sea water he dodged another flash of metal and a gun butt hit him hard on the head but with most of its force spent against the cushion of water it knocked him silly and he clung for a moment to a niggerhead to get his bearings while the black tide of his men swept past him and individual fights filled the water with black puffs of blood the battleground had now shifted to a wide expanse of clear water fringed with broken coral on the far side of this bond saw the grounded sled laden with something long and bulky with a rubber covering the silver torpedo of the chariot and a close group of men that included the unmistakable oversize figure of largo bond melted back among the coral clumps got close down to the sand and began to swim cautiously round the flank of the big clear pool almost immediately he had to stop a squat figure was cowering in the shadows his gun was raised and he was taking careful aim it was at leiter in difficulties with one of largos men who had him by the throat while leiter the swim fin on his hook gone clawed with the hook at the mans back bond gave two hard kicks of his flippers and hurled his spear from six feet the light wood of the handle had no momentum but the blade cut into the mans arm just as the bubbles of gas burst from the muzzle of the gun his shot went wide but he flashed round and thrust at bond with the empty gun out of the corner of his eye bond saw his spear floating slowly up toward the surface he dived for the mans legs in a clumsy rugby tackle and clawed them off the ground then as the gun muzzle hit him on the temple he reached a desperate hand for the enemys mask and ripped it off his face that was enough bond swam aside and watched the man blinded by the salt water groping his way up toward the surface bond felt a nudge at his arm it was leiter clutching at his oxygen tube his face inside the mask was contorted he made a feeble gesture upward bond got the message he seized leiter round the waist and leaped for the surface fifteen feet up as they broke through the silver ceiling leiter tore the broken tube from his mouth and gulped frantically for air bond held him through the paroxysm and then guided him to a clump of shallow coral and when leiter pushed him angrily away and told him to get the hell back under and leave him alone he put up a thumb and dived down again now he kept well in the forest of coral and began again his stalk of largo occasionally he caught glimpses of individual battles and once he passed under a man one of his men from the manta staring down at him from the surface but the face under the water framed in its streaming hair had no mask or oxygen tube and the mouth gaped hideously in death on the bottom among the coral clumps there were bits of wrack from the tide of battle an oxygen pack strips of black rubber a complete aqualung and several spears from the co guns bond picked up two of them now he was on the edge of the open lagoon of battle water the sled with its obscene rubber sausage was still there guarded by two of largos men with their guns at the ready but there was no sign of largo bond peered into the misty wall through which the moonlight paler now filtered down onto the ripples in the sand their pretty patterns scuffed and churned by the feet of the combatants where the sand had been disturbed reef fish were swarming to pick up minute fragments of algae and other fodder like seagulls and rooks when the plow has passed there was nothing else to be seen and there was no way for bond to guess how the battle dispersed into a dozen separate running fights was going what was happening on the surface when bond had taken leiter up the sea had been lit by the red flare how soon would the rescue dinghy from the manta be on the scene ought he to stay where he was and watch over the bomb with frightening suddenness the decision was made for him out of the mists to bonds right the gleaming torpedo shape of the electric chariot shot into the arena largo sat astride it in the saddle he was bent down behind the small perspex shield to get extra speed and his left hand held two of the manta spears pointing forward while he controlled the single joystick with his right as he appeared the two guards dropped their guns on the sand and held up the coupling of the sled largo slowed down and drifted up to them one man caught the rudder and wrestled to pull the chariot backward toward the couplings they were going to get out largo was going to take the bomb back out through the reef and drop it in deep water or bury it the same thing would be done with the second bomb in the disco with the evidence gone largo would say that he had been ambushed by rival treasure hunters how was he to know they came from a united states submarine his men had fought back with their shark guns but only because they had been attacked first once again the treasurehunt cover would hide everything the men were still wrestling with the coupling largo was looking back anxiously bond measured the distance and flung himself forward with a great kick against the coral largo turned in time to fling up an arm and parry bonds stab with his righthand spear and bonds stab with the left rattled harmlessly off the aqualung cylinders on largos back bond drove on head first his hands outstretched for the air tube in largos mouth largos hands flashed to protect himself dropping his two spears and jerking back the joystick he had been holding in his right the chariot surged forward away from the two guards and shot obliquely upward toward the surface while the two bodies clung and struggled on its back it was impossible to fight scientifically both men tore vaguely at each other while their teeth clenched desperately on the rubber mouthpieces that were their lifelines but largo had a firm grip on the chariot between his knees while bond had to use one hand to hang on to largos equipment to prevent himself from being thrown again and again largos elbow crashed into bonds face while bond dodged from side to side to take the blows on the mouth and not on the precious glass of his mask at the same time bond hammered with his free hand at his only target largos kidneys beneath the brown square of flesh that was all he could reach the chariot broke surface fifty yards down the wide channel leading to the open sea and tore crazily on its nose tilted by bonds weight over the tail sticking at fortyfive degrees out of the water now bond was half in the wash and it would only be minutes before largo managed to twist and get both hands to him bond made up his mind he let go of largos aqualung and clutching the stern of the torpedo between his legs slid back until he felt the top of the rudder at his back now if he could avoid the screw he reached one hand down between his legs got a firm grip on the rudder and heaved himself backward and off the machine now his face inches away from the whirring propeller was buffeted by the turbulence but he dragged hard downward and felt the stern coming with him soon the damned thing would be almost upright bond wrenched the blade of the rudder sideways in a rightangled turn and then his arms almost torn out of their sockets by the strain let go above and in front of him as the torpedo veered righthanded largos body thrown by the sharp turn and the change of balance crashed into the water twisted quickly over and faced downward the mask searching for bond bond was beat utterly defeated by exhaustion now there was nothing for him but to get away and somehow stay alive the bomb was immobilized the chariot gone careering in circles over the sea largo was finished bond summoned the remains of his strength and sluggishly dived down toward his last hope a refuge among the coral almost lazily largo his strength unimpaired came down after him swimming in a giant easy crawl bond swerved in among the coral heads a white sand passage showed up and he followed it then there was a fork bond trusting to the small extra protection of his rubber suit followed the narrower lane between the sharp clumps but now a black shadow was above him following him largo had not bothered to get into the channel he was swimming above the coral looking down watching bond biding his time bond looked up there was a gleam of teeth round the mouthpiece largo knew he had got him bond flexed his fingers to get more life into them how could he hope to defeat those great hands those hands that were machine tools and now the narrow passage was widening there was the glint of a sandy channel ahead there was no room for bond to turn round he could only swim on into the open trap bond stopped and stood it was the only thing to do largo had him like a rat in a trap but at least largo would have to come in and get him bond looked upward yes the great gleaming body followed by its string of silver bubbles was forging carefully on into the open water now swiftly like a pale seal he dived down to the firm sand and stood facing bond slowly he advanced between the walls of coral the big hands held forward for the first hold at ten paces he stopped his eyes swiveled sideways to a coral clump his right hand shot out at something and gave a quick yank when the hand pulled back it was writhing writhing with eight more fingers largo held the baby octopus in front of him like a small waving flower his teeth drew away from the rubber mouthpiece and the clefts of a smile appeared in his cheeks he put up one hand and significantly tapped his mask bond bent down and picked up a rock covered with seaweed largo was being melodramatic a rock in largos mask would be more efficient than having an octopus slapped across his bond wasnt worried by the octopus only a day before he had been in company with a hundred of them it was largos longer reach that worried him largo took a pace forward and then another bond crouched backing carefully so as not to cut his rubber skin into the narrow passage largo came on slowly deliberately in two more paces he would attack bond caught a glint of movement out in the open behind largo someone to the rescue but the glint was white not black it was one of theirs largo leaped forward bond kicked off the coral and dived down for largos groin the jagged rock in his hand but largo was ready his knee came up hard against bonds head and at the same time his right hand came swiftly down and clamped the small octopus across bonds mask then from above both his hands came down and got bond by the neck lifted him up like a child and held him at arms length pressing bond could see nothing vaguely he felt the slimy tentacles groping over his face getting a grip on the mouthpiece between his teeth pulling but the blood was roaring in his head and he knew he was gone slowly he sank to his knees but how why was he sinking what had happened to the hands at his throat his eyes squeezed tight in agony opened and there was light the octopus now at his chest let go and shot away among the coral in front of him largo largo with a spear sticking horribly through his neck lay kicking feebly on the sand behind him and looking down at the body stood a small pale figure fitting another spear into an underwater gun the long hair flowed round her head like a veil in the luminous sea bond got slowly to his feet he took a step forward suddenly he felt his knees beginning to give a wave of blackness began to creep up over his vision he leaned against the coral his mouth slackening round the oxygen tube water seeped into his mouth no he said to himself no dont let that happen a hand took one of his but dominos eyes behind her mask were somewhere else they were blank lost she was ill what was the matter with her bond was suddenly awake again his eyes took in the blood patches on her bathing dress the angry red marks on her body between the scraps of bikini they would both die standing there unless he did something about it slowly his leaden legs began to stir the black fins they were moving up it wasnt so difficult after all and now vaguely her own fins were helping the two bodies reached the surface together and lay face downward in the shallow troughs of the waves the oyster light of dawn slowly turned pink it was going to be a beautiful day take it easy mr bond felix leiter came into the white antiseptic room and closed the door conspiratorially behind him he came and stood beside the bed where bond lay on the edge of drugged sleep hows it going feller not bad just doped doctor said i wasnt to see you but i thought you might care to hear the score okay sure bond struggled to concentrate he didnt really care all he could think about was the girl well ill make it quick doctors just doing his rounds and ill get hell if he finds me here theyve recovered both bombs and kotze the physicist chap is singing like a bird seems spectres a bunch of really bigtime hoodlums exoperators of smersh the mafia the gestapo all the big outfits headquarters in paris top mans called blofeld but the bastard got away or anyway they havent caught up

was going to be the final haul you were right about miami it was going to be target no same sort of operation they were going to plant the second bomb in the yacht basin bond smiled weakly so now everybodys happy oh sure except me havent been able to get away from my damned radio until now valves were almost blowing and theres a pile of cipher stuff from m just longing for you to get around to it thank god the top brass from cia and a team from your outfit are flying in this evening to take charge then we can hand over and watch our two governments getting snarled up over the epilogue what to tell the public what to do with these spectre guys whether to make you a lord or a duke how to persuade me to run for president tricky little details like that and then well damned well get away and have ourselves a ball some place maybe youd care to take that girl along hell shes the one that rates the medals the guts they cottoned onto her geiger counter god knows what that bastard largo did to her but she didnt sing not a damned word then when the team was under way she somehow got herself out of the cabin porthole with her gun and aqualung and went to get him got him and saved your life into the bargain i swear ill never call a girl a frail again not an italian girl anyway leiter cocked an ear he moved swiftly to the door hell theres that damned medic gumshoeing down the corridor be seeing you james he quickly turned the door handle listened for a moment and slipped out of the room feebly desperately bond called wait felix felix but the door had closed bond sank back and lay staring at the ceiling slowly anger boiled up inside him and panic why in hell didnt someone tell him about the girl what the hell did he care about all the rest was she all right where was she was she the door opened bond jerked himself upright he shouted furiously at the whitecoated figure the girl how is she quick tell me dr stengel the fashionable doctor of nassau was not only fashionable but a good doctor he was one of the jewish refugee doctors who but for hitler would have been looking after some big hospital in a town the size of dьsseldorf instead rich and grateful patients had built a modern clinic for him in nassau where he treated the natives for shillings and the millionaires and their wives for ten guineas a visit he was more used to handling overdoses of sleeping pills and the ailments of the rich and old than multiple abrasions curare poisoning and odd wounds that looked more as if they belonged to the days of the pirates but these were government orders and under the official secrets act at that dr stengel hadnt asked any questions about his patients nor about the sixteen autopsies he had had to perform six for americans from the big submarine and ten including the corpse of the owner from the fine yacht that had been in harbor for so long now he said carefully miss vitali will be all right for the moment she is suffering from shock she needs rest what else what was the matter with her she had swum a long way she was not in a condition to undertake such a physical strain why not the doctor moved toward the door and now you too must rest you have been through much you will take one of those hypnotics once every six hours yes and plenty of sleep you will soon be on your feet again but for some time you must take it easy mr bond take it easy you must take it easy mr bond where had he heard those idiotic words before suddenly bond was raging with fury he lurched out of bed in spite of the sudden giddiness he staggered toward the doctor he shook a fist in the urbane face urbane because the doctor was used to the emotional storms of patients and because he knew that in minutes the strong soporific would put bond out for hours take it easy god damn you what do you know about taking it easy tell me whats the matter with that girl where is she whats the number of her room bonds hands fell limply to his sides he said feebly for gods sake tell me doctor i i need to know dr stengel said patiently kindly someone has illtreated her she is suffering from burns many burns she is still in great pain but he waved a reassuring hand inside she is well she is in the next room in no you may see her but only for a minute then she will sleep and so will you yes he held open the door thank you thank you doctor bond walked out of the room with faltering steps his blasted legs were beginning to give again the doctor watched him go to the door of no watched him open it and close it again behind him with the exaggerated care of a drunken man the doctor went off along the corridor thinking it wont do him any harm and it may do her some good it is what she needs some tenderness inside the small room the jalousies threw bands of light and shadow over the bed bond staggered over to the bed and knelt down beside it the small head on the pillow turned toward him a hand came out and grasped his hair pulling his head closer to her her voice said huskily you are to stay here do you understand you are not to go away when bond didnt answer she feebly shook his head to and fro do you hear me james do you understand she felt bonds body slipping to the floor when she let go his hair he slumped down on the rug beside her bed she carefully shifted her position and looked down at him he was already asleep with his head cradled on the inside of his forearm the girl watched the dark rather cruel face for a moment then she gave a small sigh pulled the pillow to the edge of the bed so that it was just above him laid her head down so that she could see him whenever she wanted to and closed her eyes the end
