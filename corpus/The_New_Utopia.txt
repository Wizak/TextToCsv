the new utopia i had spent an extremely interesting evening i had dined with some very advanced friends of mine at the national socialist club we had had an excellent dinner the pheasant stuffed with truffles was a poem and when i say that the chateau lafitte was worth the price we had to pay for it i do not see what more i can add in its favour after dinner and over the cigars i must say they do know how to stock good cigars at the national socialist club we had a very instructive discussion about the coming equality of man and the nationalisation of capital i was not able to take much part in the argument myself be cause having been left when a boy in a position which rendered it necessary for me to earn my own living i have never enjoyed the time and opportunity to study these questions but i listened very attentively while my friends explained how for the thousands of centuries during which it had existed before they came the world had been going on all wrong and how in the course of the next few years or so they meant to put it right equality of all mankind was their watchword perfect equality in all things equality in possessions and equality in position and influence and equality in duties resulting in equality in happiness and contentment the world belonged to all alike and must be equally divided each mans labour was the property not of himself but of the state which fed and clothed him and must be applied not to his own aggrandisement but to the enrichment of the race individual wealth the social chain with which the few had bound the many the bandits pistol by which a small gang of rob bers had thieved must be taken from the hands that too long had held it social distinctions the barriers by which the rising tide of humanity had hitherto been fretted and restrained must be for ever swept aside the human race must press onward to its destiny whatever that might be not as at present a scattered horde scrambling each man for himself over the broken ground of un equal birth and fortune the soft sward reserved for the feet of the pampered the cruel stones reserved for the feet of the cursed but an ordered army marching side by side over the level plain of equity and equality the great bosom of our mother earth should nourish all her children like and like none should be hungry none should have too much the strong man should not grasp more than the weak the clever should not scheme to seize more than the simple the earth was mans and the fulness thereof and among all mankind it should be portioned out in even shares all men were equal by the laws of man with inequality comes misery crime sin selfishness arrogance hypocrisy in a world in which all men were equal there would exist no temptation to evil and our natural nobility would assert itself when all men were equal the world would be heaven freed from the degrading despotism of god we raised our glasses and drank to equality sacred equality and then ordered the waiter to bring us green char treuse and more cigars i went home very thoughtful i did not go to sleep for a long while i lay awake thinking over this vision of a new world that had been presented to me how delightful life would be if only the scheme of my socialis tic friends could be carried out there would ne no more of this struggling and striving against each other no more jealousy no more disappointment no more fear of poverty the state would take charge of us from the hour we were born until we died and provide for all our wants from the cradle to the coffin both inclu sive and we should need to give no thought even to the matter there would be no more hard work three hours labour a day would be the limit according to our calculations that the state would require from each adult citizen and nobody would be allowed to do more i should not be allowed to do more no poor to pity no rich to envy no one to look down upon us no one for us to look down upon not quite so pleasant this latter reflection all our life ordered and arranged for us nothing to think about except the glorious destiny whatever that might be of humanity then thought crept away to sport in chaos and i slept when i awoke i found myself lying under a glass case in a high cheerless room there was a label over my head i turned and read it it ran as follows this man was found asleep in a house in london after the great social revolution of from the account given by the landlady of the house it would appear that he had already when discovered been asleep for over ten years she having forgotten to call him it w as decided for scientific purposes not to awake him but just to see how long he would sleep on and he was accordingly brought and deposited in the museum of curiosities on february th visitors are requested not to squirt water through the airholes an intelligentlooking old gentleman who had been arranging some stuffed lizards in an adjoining case came over and took the cover off me whats the matter he asked anything disturbed you no i said i always wake up like this when i feel ive had enough sleep what century is this this he said is the twentyninth century you have been asleep for just one thousand years ah well i feel all the better for it i replied getting down off the table theres nothing like having ones sleep out i take it you are going to do the usual thing said the old gentleman to me as i proceeded to put on my clothes which had been lying beside me in the case youll want me to walk round the city with you and explain all the changes to you while you ask questions and make silly remarks yes i replied i suppose thats what i ought to do i suppose so he muttered come on and lets get it over and he led the way from the room as we went downstairs i said well is it all right now is what all right he replied why the world i replied a few friends of mine were arranging just before i went to bed to take it to pieces and fix it up again properly have they got it all right by this time is everybody equal now and sin and sorrow and all that sort of thing done away with oh yes replied my guide youll find everything all right now weve been working away pretty hard at things while youve been asleep weve just got this earth about perfect now i should say nobody is allowed to do anything wrong or silly and as for equality tadpoles aint in it with us he talked in rather a vulgar manner i thought but i did not like to reprove him we walked out into the city it was every clean and very quiet the streets which were designated by numbers ran out from each other at right angles and all presented exactly the same appearance there were no horses or carriages about all the traffic was conducted by electric cars all the people that we met wore a quiet grave expression and were so much like each other as to give one the idea that they were all members of the same family everyone was dressed as was also my guide in a pair of grey trousers and a grey tunic buttoning tight round the neck and fastened round the waist by a belt each man was clean shaven and each man had black hair i said are all men twins twins good gracious no answered my guide whatever made you fancy that why they all look so much alike i replied and theyve all got black hair oh thats the regulation colour for hair explained my companion weve all got black hair if a mans hair is not black naturally he has to have it dyed black why i asked why retorted the old gentleman somewhat irritably why i thought you understood that all men were now equal what would become of our equality if one man or woman were allowed to swagger about in golden hair while another had to put up with carrots men have not only got to be equal in these happy days but to look it as far as can be by causing all men to be clean shaven and all men and women to have black hair cut the same length we obviate to a certain extent the errors of nature i said why black he said he did not know but that was the colour which had been decided upon who by i asked by the majority he replied raising his hat and lowering his eyes as if in prayer we walked further and passed more men i said are there no women in this city women exclaimed my guide of course there are weve passed hundreds of them i thought i knew a woman when i saw one i observed but i cant remember noticing any why there go two now he said drawing my attention to a couple of persons near to us both dressed in the regulation grey trousers and tunics how do you know they are women i asked why you see the metal numbers tha everybody wears on their collar yes i was just thinking what a number of policeman you had and wondering where the other people were well the even numbers are women the odd numbers are men how very simple i remarked i suppose after a little practice you can tell one sex from the other almost at a glance oh yes he replied if you want to we walked on in silence for a while and then i said why does everybody have a number to distinguish him by answered my companion dont people have names then no why oh there was so much inequality in names some people were called montmorency and they looked down on the smiths and the smythes did not like mixing with the joneses so to save further bother it was decided to abolish names altogether and to give everybody a number did the montmorencys and the smythes object yes but the smiths and joneses were in the majority and did no the ones and twos look down upon the threes and fours and so on at first yes but with the abolition of wealth numbers lost their value except for industrial purposes and for double acrostics and now no does not consider himself in any way superior to no i had not washed when i got up there being no conveniences for doing so in the museum and i was begining to feel somewhat hot and dirty i said can i wash myself anywhere he said no we are not allowed to wash ourselves you must wait until halfpast four and then you will be washed for tea be washed i cried who by the state he said that they had found they could not maintain their equality when people were allowed to wash themselves some people washed three or four times a day while others never touched soap and water from one years end to the other and in consquence there got to be two distinct classes the clean and the dirty all the old class prejudices began to be revived the clean despised the dirty and the dirty hated the clean so to end dissension the state decided to do the washing itself and each citizen was now washed twice a day by governmentappointed officials and private washing was prohibited i noticed that we passed no houses as we went along only block after block of huge barracklike buildings all of the same size and shape occasionally at a corner we came across a smaller building labelled museum hospital debating hall bath gymnasium acadeny of sciences exhibition of industries school of talk etc etc but never a house i said doesnt anybody live in this town he said you do ask silly questions upon my word you do where do you think they live i said thats just what ive been trying to think i dont see any houses anywhere he said we dont need houses not houses such as you are thinking of we are socialistic now we live together in fraternity and equality we live in these blocks that you see each block accommodates one thousand citizens it contains one thousand beds one hundred in each room and bathrooms and dressingrooms in proportion a dininghall and kitchens at seven oclock every morning a bell is rung and ever one rises and tidies up his bed at seventhirty they go into the dressingrooms and are washed and shaved and have their hair done at eight oclock breakfast is served in the dininghall it comprises a pint of oatmeal porridge and halfapint of warm milk for each adult citizen we are all strict vegetarians now the vegetarian vote increased enormously during the last century and their organisation being very perfect they have been able to dictate every election for the past fifty years at one oclock another bell is rung and the people return to dinner which consists of beans and stewed fruits with rollypolly pudding twice a week and plumduff on saturdays at five oclock there is tea and at ten the lights are put out and everbody goes to bed we are all equal and we all live alike clerk and scavenger tinker and apothecary all together in fraternity and liberty the men live in blocks on this side of town and the women are at the other end of the city where are the married people kept i asked oh there are no married couples he replied we abolished marriage two hundred years ago you see married life did not work at all well with our system domestic life we found was thoroughly antisocialistic in its tendencies men thought more of their wives and families than they did of the state they wished to labour for the benefit of their little circle of beloved ones rather than for the good of the community they cared more for the future of their children than for the destiny of humanity the ties of love and blood bound men together fast in little groups instead of in one great whole before considering the advancement of the human race men considered the advancement of their kith and kin before striving for the greatest happiness of the greatest number men strove for the happiness of the few who were near and dear to them in secret men and women hoarded up and laboured and denied themselves so as in secret to give some little extra gift of joy to their beloved love stirred the vice of ambition in mens hearts to win the smiles of the women they loved to leave a name behind them that their children might be proud to bear men sought to raise themselves above the general level to do some deed that should make the world look up to them and honour them above their fellowmen to press a deeper footprint than anothers upon the dusty highway of the age the fundamental principles of socialism were being daily thwarte and contemned each house was a revolutionary centre for the propagation of individualism and personality from the warmth of each domestic hearth grew up the vipers comradeship and independence to sting the state and poison the minds of men the doctrines of equality were openly disputed men when they loved a woman thought her superior to every other woman and hardly took any pains to disguise their opinion loving wives believed their husbands to be wiser and braver and better than all other men mothers laughed at the idea of their children being in no way superior to other children children imbibed the hideous heresy that their father and mother were the best father and mother in the world from whatever point you looked at it the family stood forth as our foe one man had a charming wife and two sweettempered children his neighbour was married to a shrew and was the father of eleven noisy illdispositioned brats where was the equality again wherever the family existed there hovered ever contending the angels of joy and sorrow and in a world where joy and sorrow are known equality cannot live one man and woman in the night stand weeping beside a little cot on the other side of the lathandplaster a fair young couple hand in hand are laughing at the silly antics of a gracefaced gurgling baby what is poor equality doing such things could not be allowed love we saw was our enemy at every turn he made equality impossible he brought joy and pain and peace and suffering in his train he disturbed mens beliefs and imperilled the destiny of humanity so we abolished him and all his works now there are no marriages and therefore no domestic troubles no wooing therefore no heartaching no loving therefore no sorrowing no kisses and no tears we all live together in equality free from the troubling of joy and pain i said it must be very peaceful but tell me i ask the question merely from a scientific standpoint how do you keep up the supply of men and women he said oh thats simple enough how did you in your day keep up the supply of horses and cows in the spring so many children according as the state requires are arranged for and carefully bred under medical supervision when they are born they are taken away from their mothers who else might grow to love them and brought up in the public nurseries and schools until they are fourteen they are then examined by stateappointed inspectors who decide what calling they shall be brought up to and to such calling they are thereupon apprenticed at twenty they take their rank of citizens and are entitled to a vote no difference whatever is made between men and women both sexes enjoy equal privileges i said what are the privileges he said why all that ive been telling you we wandered on for a few more miles but passed nothing but street after street of these huge blocks i said are there no shops nor stores in this town no he replied what do we want with shops and stores the state feeds us clothes us houses us doctors us washes and dresses us cuts our corns and buries us what could we do with shops i began to feel tired with our walk i said can we go in anywhere and have a drink he said a drink whats a drink we have halfapint of cocoa with our dinner do you mean that i did not feel equal to explaining the matter to him and he evidently would not have understood me if i had so i said yes i meant that we passed a very finelooking man a little further on and i noticed that he had one arm i had noticed two or three rather biglooking men with only one arm in the course of the morning and it struck me as curious i remarked about it to my guide he said yes when a man is much above the average size and strength we cut one of his legs or arms off so as to make things more equal we lop him down a bit as it were nature you see is somewhat behind the times but we do what we can to put her straight i said i suppose you cant abolish her well not altogether he replied we only wish we could but he added afterwards with pardonable pride weve done a good deal i said how about an exceptionally clever man what do you do with him well we are not much troubled in that way now he answered we have not come across anything dangerous in the shape of brainpower for some considerable time now when we do we perform a surgical operation upon the head which softens the brain down to the average level i have sometimes thought mused the old gentleman that it was a pity we could not level up sometimes instead of always levelling down but of course that is impossible i said do you think it right of you to cut these people up and tone them down in this manner he said of course it is right you seem very cocksure about the matter i retorted why is it of course right because it was done by the majority how does that make it right i asked a majority can do no wrong he answered oh is that what the people who are lopped off think they he replied evidently astonished at the question oh they are in the minority you know yes but even the minority has a right to its arms and legs and heads hasnt it a minority has no rights he answered i said its just as well to belong to the majority if youre thinking of living here isnt it he said yes most of our people do they seem to think it more convenient i was finding the town somewhat uninteresting and i asked if we could not go into the country for a change my guide said oh yes certainly but did not think i should care much for it oh but it used to be so beautiful in the country i urged before i went to bed there were great green trees and grassy windwaved meadows and little rosedecked cottages and oh weve changed all that interrupted the old gentleman it is all one huge marketgarden now divided by roads and canals cut at right angles to each other there is no beauty in the country now whatever we have abolished beauty it interfered with our equality it was not fair that some people should live among lovely scenery and other upon barren moors so we have made it all pretty much alike everywhere now and no place can lord it over another can a man emigrate into any other country i asked it doesnt matter what country any other country would do oh yes if he likes replies my companion but why should he all lands are exactly the same the whole world is all one people now one language one law one life is there no variety no change anywhere i asked what do you do for pleasure for recreation are there any theatres no responded my guide we had to abolish theatres the histrionic temperament seemd utterly unable to accept the principles of equality each actor thought himself the best actor in the world and superior in fact to most other people altogether i dont know whether it was the same in your day exactly the same i answered but we did not take any notice of it ah we did he replied and in consequence shut the theatres up besides our white ribbon vigilance society said that all places of amusement were vicious and degrading and being an energetic and stoutwinded band they soon won the majority over to their views and so all amusements are prohibited now i said are you allowed to read books well he answered there are not many written you see owing to our all living such perfect lives and there being no wrong or sorrow or joy or hope or love or grief in the world and everything being so regular and proper there is really nothing much to write about except of course the destiny of humanity true i said i see that but what of the old works the classics you had shakespeare and scott and thackeray and there were one or two little things of my own that were not halfbad what have you done with all those oh we have burned all those old works he said they were full of the old wrong notions of the old wrong wicked times when men were merely slaves and beasts of burden he said all the old paintings and sculptures had been likewise destroyed partly for the same reason and partly because they were considered improper by the white ribbon vigilance society which was a great power now while all new art and literature were forbidden as such things tended to undermine the principles of equality they made men think and the men that thought grew cleverer than those that did not want to think and those that did not want to think naturally objected to this and being in the majority objected to some purpose he said that from like considerations there were no sports or games permitted sports and games caused competition and competition led to inequality i said how long do your citizens work each day three hours he answered after that all the remainder of the day belongs to ourselves ah that is just what i was coming to i remarked now what do you do with yourselves during those other twentyone hours oh we rest what for the whole twentyone hours well rest and think and talk what do you think and talk about oh oh about how wretched life must have been in the old times and about how happy we are and and oh and the destiny of humanity dont you ever get sick of the destiny of humanity no not much and what do you understand by it what is the destiny of humanity do you think oh why to to go on being like we are now only more so everybody more equal and more things done by electricity and everybody to have two votes instead of one and thank you that will do is there anything else that you think of have you got a religion oh yes and you worship a god oh yes what do you call him the majority one question more you dont mind my asking you all these questions bytheby do you oh no this is all part of my three hours labour for the state oh im glad of that i should not like to feel that i was encroaching on your time for rest but what i wanted to ask was do many of the people here commit suicide no such a thing never occurs to them i looked at the faces of the men and women that were passing there was a patient almost pathetic expression upon them all i wondered where i had seen that look before it seemed familiar to me all at once i remembered it was just the quiet troubled wondering expression that i had always noticed upon the faces of the horses and oxen that we used to breed and keep in the old world strange how very dim and indistinct all the faces are around me and where is my guide and why am i sitting on the pavement and hark surely that is the voice of mrs biggles my old landlady has she been asleep a thousand years too she says it is twelve oclock only twelve and im not to be washed til halfpast four and i do feel so stuffy and hot and my head is aching hulloa why im in bed has it all been a dream and am i back in the nineteenth century through the open window i hear the rush and roar of old lifes battle men are fighting striving carving out each man his own life with the sword of strength and will men are laughing grieving loving doing wrong deeds doing great deeds falling struggling helping one another living and i have a good deal more than three hours work to do today and i meant to be up at seven and oh dear i do wish i had not smoked so many strong cigars last night
