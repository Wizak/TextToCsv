of congress catalog card number manufactured in the united states of america first american edition for kath a memento of the long sunday explanatory note when the first two packets of the flashman papers were published in and there was some controversy over their authenticity it was asked whether the papers were in fact the true personal memoirs of harry flashman the notorious bully of tom browns schooldays and later an eminent british soldier or were simply an impudent fake this was not a controversy in which either mr paget morrison the owner of the papers or i his editor thought fit to join the matter was thoroughly discussed in various journals and also on television and if any doubters remain they are recommended to study the authoritative article which appeared in the new york times of july and which surely settles the question once and for all the first two packets of the papers contained flashmans personal narrative of his expulsion from rugby school by dr thomas arnold his early service in the british army his decoration by queen victoria after the first afghan war and his involvement in the schleswigholstein question in which he found himself pitted against the young otto von bismarck and the celebrated countess of landsfeld the third packet which is now presented to the public continues his story in the year and the early months of it is remarkable as a firsthand account of an important social phenomenon of the early victorian years the afroamerican slave trade and in its illumination of the characters of two of the most eminent statesmen of the century one a future british prime minister and the other a future american president flashmans recollections cast interesting light on what may be called their formative years when the flashman papers were brought to light at ashby leicestershire in it was noted that while the great volume of manuscript had obviously been examined and rearranged round about no alteration or amendment had been made to the text as set down by flashman himself in closer examination of the third packet reveals however that an editorial hand has been lightly at work i suspect that it belonged to grizel de rothschild the youngest of flashmans sistersinlaw who with a fine victorian delicacy has modified those blasphemies and improprieties with which the old soldier occasionally emphasised his narrative she was by no means consistent in this for while she paid close attention to oaths she left untouched those passages in which flashman retails his amorous adventures possibly she did not understand what he was talking about in any event she gave up the task approximately halfway through the manuscript but i have left her earlier editing as it stands since it adds a certain period charm to the narrative for the rest i have as usual inserted occasional explanatory notes gmf flash for freedom i believe it was the sight of that old fool gladstone standing in the pouring rain holding his special constables truncheon as though it were a bunch of lilies and looking even more like an unemployed undertakers mute than usual that made me think seriously about going into politics god knows im no tory and i never set eyes on a whig yet without feeling the need of a bath but i remember thinking as i looked at gladstone that day well if thats one of the bright particular stars of english public life flashy my boy you ought to be at westminster yourself you wouldnt blame me you must have thought the same often after all theyre a contemptible lot and youll agree that i had my full share of the qualities of character necessary in political life i could lie and dissemble with the best give short change with a hearty clap on the shoulder slip out from under long before the blow fell talk toady and turn tail as fast as a yankee fakir selling patent pills mark you ive never been given to interfering in other folks affairs if i could help it so i suppose that would have disqualified me but for a little while i did think hard about bribing my way to a seat and the result of it was that i came within an ace of being publicly disgraced shanghaied sold as a slave and god knows what besides ive never seriously considered politics since it was when i came home from germany in the spring of after my skirmish with otto bismarck and lola montez i was in d d bad shape with a shaven skull a couple of wounds and the guts scared half out of me and all i wanted was to go to ground in london until i was my own man once more one thing i was sure of nothing was going to drag me out of england again which was ironic when you consider that ive spent more than half of the last fifty years at the ends of the earth in uniform as often as not and doing most of my walking backwards anyway i came home across the channel one jump ahead of half the monarchs and statesmen in europe the popular rebellion id seen in munich was only one of a dozen that broke out that spring and all the fellows whod lost their thrones and chancellorships seemed to have decided like me that old england was the safest place so it proved but the joke was that for a few weeks after i came home it looked touch and go whether england didnt have a revolution of her own which would have sold the fleeing monarchs properly and serve em right mind you i thought it was all gammon myself id just seen a real rebellion with mobs chanting and smashing and looting and i couldnt imagine it happening in st jamess but that crabbed old scotch miser morrison my abominable fatherinlaw thought different and poured out his fears to me on my first evening at home its thae bluidy chartists cries he with his head in his hands the d d mob is loose aboot the toon or soon will be its no enough their ten hoors bill they want tae slake their vengeance on honest fowk as well burn them a the wicked rascals and whit does the government do will ye tell me naethin wi rebellion in oor midst an the french chappin at oor doors the french have too much on hand with their own rebels to mind about us says i as to the chartists i recall you expressing the same fears years ago in paisley and nothing came of it if you remember naethin came ot dye say cries he with his chops quivering i ken whit came ot you that should hae been at your post were loupin intae the bushes wi my elspeth oh goad says he groaning as if we hadnae tribulation enough wee elspeth in her her condeetion that was another thing of course my beautiful elspeth after eight years of wedded bliss had now conceived at last and to hear her father mother and sisters you would have thought it was judgement day myself i believe shed done it just to be topsides with the queen who had recently produced yet another of her innumerable litter but what concerned me most was the identity of the father i knew my darling featherhead you see for the trollop she was you would never have thought it to look at her beguiling innocence but it had long been an unspoken bargain between us that we let each others private lives alone and i could guess she had been in the woodshed with half a dozen during my absence mind you i might have pupped her myself before i went to germany but who could tell and if she gave birth to something with red hair and a pug nose there was liable to be talk and god knows what might come of that you see we were an odd family old morrison was as rich as an amsterdam jew and when my guvnor went smash over railway stock morrison had paid the bills for elspeths sake he had been paying ever since keeping me and my guvnor on a pittance while he used our house and got what credit he could out of being related to the flashman family not that that was much in my opinion but since we were halfway into society and morrison had daughters to marry off he was prepared to tolerate us he had to tolerate me anyway since i was married to his daughter but it was a d d tricky business all round for he could kick me out if he chose and would do like a shot the moment elspeth decided shed had enough of me as it was we dealt well enough with each other but with a child on the way things might i suspected be different id no wish to be out in the street trying to scrape by on a captains half pay so what with elspeth pregnant and old morrison expecting the communist rabble at the door at any moment it was a fairly cheerless homecoming elspeth seemed pleased enough to see me all right but when i tried to bundle her into bed she would have none of it in case the child was harmed so instead of bouncing her about that evening i had to listen fondly to her drivelling about what name we should give our little hero for she was sure it must be a boy he shall be harry albert victor says she holding my hand and gazing at me with those imbecile blue eyes which never lost their power somehow to make my heart squeeze up inside me god knows why after you my dearest love and our dear dear queen and her dearest love would you approve my darling capital choice says i couldnt be better not unless i thought to myself you called him tom or dick or william or whatever the fellows name was who was in the hay with you you make me so happy harry says she and do you know i believed it she was like that you see as immoral as i was but without my intelligence no conscience whatever and a blissful habit of forgetting her own transgressions or probably she never thought she had any to forget she leaned up and kissed me and the smell and feel of her blonde plumpness set me off and i made a grab at her tits but she pushed me away again we must be patient my own says she composing herself we must think only of dear harry albert victor she cooed and maundered a little longer and then said she must rest so i left her sipping her whitewine whey and spent the rest of the evening listening to old morrison groaning and snarling it was the same old tune more or less that id grown used to on the rare occasions when we had shared each others company over the past eight years the villainy of the workers the weakness of government the rising cost of everything my own folly and extravagance the vanity of his wife and daughters and all the rest of it it was pathetic and monstrous too when you considered how much the old skinflint had raked together by sweating his millworkers and cheating his associates but i observed that the richer he got the more he whined and raged and if there was one thing ill say for him he got richer quicker than the only sober man in a poker game the truth was that coward and skinflint though he was he had a shrewd business head no error from being a prosperous scotch mill owner when i married his daughter he had blossomed since coming south and had his finger in a score of pies all d d dirty ones no doubt he had become known in the city and in tory circles too for if he was a provincial nobody he had the golden passport and it was getting fatter all the time he was already angling for his title although he didnt get it until some little time later when russell sold it to him a whig minister ennobling a tory miser which just goes to show but with all these glittering prizes in front of him the little swine was getting greedier by the hour and the thought of it all dissolving in revolution had him nearly puking with fear its time tae tak a stand says he goggling at me we have to defend our rights and our property and i almost burst out laughing as i remembered the time in paisley when his millworkers got out of hand and he cringed behind his door bawling for me to lead my troops against them but this time he was really frightened i gathered from his vapourings that there had been recent riots in glasgow and even in trafalgar square and that in a few days there was to be a great rally of chartists spawn of beelzebub he called them on kennington common and that it was feared they would invade london itself to my astonishment when i went out next day to take my bearings i discovered there was something in it at horse guards there were rumours that regiments were being brought secretly to town the homes of ministers were to be guarded and supplies of cutlasses and firearms were being got ready special constables were being recruited to oppose the mob and the royal family were leaving town it all sounded d d serious but my uncle bindley who was on the staff told me that the duke was confident nothing would come of it so youll win no more medals this time says he sniffing i take it now that you have consented to honour us with your presence again that you are looking to your family to find you employment again im in no hurry thankee says i im sure youd agree that in a time of civil peril a gentlemans place is in his home defending his dear ones if you mean the morrisons says he i cannot agree with you their rightful place is with the mob from which they came careful uncle says i you never know you might be in need of a scotch pension yourself some day and with that i left him and sauntered home the place was in a ferment old morrison carried away by terror for his strongboxes had actually plucked up courage to go to marlborough street and test as a special constable and when i came home he was standing in the drawingroom looking at his truncheon as though it was a snake mrs morrison my medusainlaw was lying on the sofa with a maid dabbing her temples with eaudecologne elspeths two sisters were weeping in a corner and elspeth herself was sitting cool as you please with a shawl round her shoulders eating chocolates and looking beautiful as always she was the one member of the family who was quite unruffled old morrison looked at me and groaned and looked at the truncheon again its a terrible thing to tak human life says he dont take it then says i strike only to wound get your back against a brick wall and smash em across the knees and elbows the females set up a great howl at this and old morrison looked ready to faint dye think itll come tae tae bloodshed shouldnt wonder says i very cool yell come with me he yammered youre a soldier a man of action aye yeve the queens medal an a yeve seen service aye against the countrys enemies yere the very man tae stand up to this this trash yell come wi me or maybe tak my place solemnly i informed him that the duke had given it out that on no account were the military to be involved in any disturbance that might take place when the chartists assembled i was too well known i should be recognised im afraid it is for you civilians to do your duty says i but i shall be here at home so you need have no fear and if the worst befalls you may be sure that my comrades and i shall take stern vengeance i left that drawingroom sounding like the wailing wall but it was nothing to the scenes which ensued on the morning of the great chartist meeting at kennington old morrison set off amidst the lamentations of the womenfolk truncheon in hand to join the other specials but was back in ten minutes having sprained his ankle he said and had to be helped to bed i was sorry because id been hoping he might get his head stove in but it wouldnt have happened anyway the chartists did assemble and the specials were mustered in force to guard the bridges it was then that i saw gladstone with the other specials with his nose dripping preparing to sell his life dearly for the sake of constitutional liberty and his own investments but it poured down everyone was soaked the foreign agitators who were on hand got nowhere and all the inflamed mob did was to send a monstrous petition across to the house of commons it had five million signatures they said i know it had four of mine one in the name of obadiah snooks and three others in the shape of xs beside which i wrote john morrison arthur wellesley henry john temple palmerston their marks but the whole thing was a frost and when one of the frog agitators in trafalgar square got up and d d the whole lot of the chartists for english cowards a butchers boy tore off his coat squared up to the frenchy and gave the snailchewing scoundrel the finest thrashing you could wish for then of course the whole crowd carried the butchers boy shoulder high and finished up singing god save the queen with tremendous gusto a thoroughly english revolution i dare say you may wonder what all this had to do with my thinking about entering politics well as ive said it had lowered my opinion of asses like gladstone still further and caused me to speculate that if i were an mp i couldnt be any worse than that sorry pack of fellows but this was just an idle thought however if my chief feeling about the demonstration was disappointment that so little mischief had been done it had a great effect on my fatherinlaw crouched at home with the bedclothes over his head waiting to be guillotined youd hardly credit it but in a way hed had much the same thought as myself although i dont claim to know by what amazing distortions of logic he arrived at it but the upshot of his panicstricken meditations on that day and the following night when he was still expecting the mob to reassemble and run him out of town on a rail was the amazing notion that i ought to go into parliament its your duty cries he sitting there in his nightcap with his ankle all bandaged up while the family chittered round him offering gruel he waved his spoon at me ye should hiv a seat i the hoose im well aware that when a man has been terrified out of his wits the most lunatic notions occur to him as sane and reasonable but i couldnt follow this me in parliament i loosed a huge guffaw what the devil would i do there dye think that would keep the chartists at bay at this he let loose a great tirade about the parlous state of the country and the impending dissolution of constitutional government and how it was everyones duty to rally to the flag oddly enough it reminded me of the kind of claptrap id heard from bismarck strong government and lashing the workers but i couldnt see how flashy mp was going to bring that about if yesterdays nonsense has convinced you that we need a change at westminster says i and id not disagree with you there why dont you stand yourself he glowered at me over his gruelbowl im no the hero of kabul says he forbye ive business enough to attend to but you yeve nothing to hinder ye yere never tired o tellin us whit a favourite ye are wi the public heres your chance to make somethin ot youre out of your senses says i who would elect me anybody snaps he a pug ape frae the zoological gardens could win a seat in this country if it was managed right buttering me up i could see but im not a politician says i i know nothing about it and care even less then yere the very man and yell find plenty o kindred spirits at westminster says he and when i hooted at him he flew into a tremendous passion that drove the females weeping from the room i left him raging but when i came to think about it do you know it didnt seem quite so foolish after all he was a sharp man old morrison and he could see it would do no harm to have a member in the family what with his business interests and so on not that id be much use to him that i could see i didnt know then that he had been maturing some notion of buying as many as a dozen seats id no idea you see of just how wealthy the old rascal was and how he was scheming to use that wealth for political ends you wont find much in the history books about john morrison lord paisley but you can take my word for it that it was men like him who pulled the strings in the old queens time while the political puppets danced they still do and always will and from my side of the field it didnt look a half bad idea flashy mp sir harry flashman mp perhaps lord flash of lightning paymaster of the forces with a seat in the cabinet dn your eyes god knows i could do that job as well as thomas babbling macaulay even in my day dreaming i stopped short of flashy prime minister but for the rest the more i thought of it the better i liked it light work plenty of spare time for as much depraved diversion as i could manage in safety and the chance to ram my opinions down the publics throat whenever i felt inclined i need never go out of london if i didnt want to i would resign from the army of course and rest on my considerable if illgotten laurels and old morrison would be happy to foot the bills no doubt in return for slight services rendered the main thing was it would be a quiet life as you know in spite of the published catalogue of my career victoria cross general rank eleven campaigns and all that mummery ive always been an arrant coward and a peaceable soul bullying underlings and whipping trollops always excepted im a gentle fellow which means ill never do harm to anyone if theres a chance he may harm me in return the trouble is no one would believe it to look at me ive always been big and hearty and looked the kind of chap whod go three rounds with the town tough if he so much as stepped on my shadow and from what tom hughes has written of me you might imagine i was always ready for devilment aye but as ive grown older ive learned that devilment usually has to be paid for god knows ive done my share of paying and even in at the ripe old age of twentysix id seen enough sorrow from the khyber to german dungeons by way of the borneo jungles and the torturepits of madagascar to convince me that i must never go looking for trouble again whod have thought that old morrisons plans to seat me at westminster could have led to well neer mind all in good time as to getting a suitable seat that would be easy enough with morrisons gelt greasing the way which prompted the thought that i ought to have a word with him about issues of political importance two thousand a year at least says i five hundred and no a penny more says he dammit ive appearances to keep up says i elspeths notions aint cheap ill attend to that says he as i always have done the cunning old bastard wouldnt even let me have the administration of my own wifes household he knew better a thousand then good god my clothesll cost that elspeth can see tae your wardrobe says he smirking five hundred my buckie its mair than your worth ill not do it then says i and thats flat aye weel says he thats a peety ill just have to get one that will yell find it a wee bit lean on your army halfpay im thinkin damn you says i sevenfifty and eventually i got it but only because elspeth told her father i should have it she of course was delighted at the thought of my having a political career we shall have soirees attended by lord john and the marquis of lansdowne she exclaimed people with titles and their ladies and theyre whigs says i ive an idea your papa will expect me to be a tory it doesnt signify in the least says she the tories are a better class of people altogether i believe why the duke is a tory is he not so the rumour runs says i but political secrets of that kind must be kept quiet you know oh it is all quite wonderful says she paying me no heed at all you will be famous again harry you are so clever you are sure to be a success and i i will need at least four page boys with buttons and footmen in proper uniform she clapped her hands her eyes sparkling and pirouetted why harry we shall need a new house i must have clothes oh but papa will see to it he is so kind it occurred to me that papa might decide he had bitten off more than he could chew listening to her although personally i thought her ideas were excellent she was in tremendous spirits and i took the opportunity to make another assault on her she was so excited that i had her half out of her dress before she realised what i was about and then the wicked little b h teased me along until i was thoroughly randified only to stop me in the very act of boarding her because of her concern for dear little harry albert victor blast his impudence to think says she that he will have a great statesman for a father she had me in the cabinet already you see oh harry how proud we shall be which was small consolation to me just then having to button myself up and restrain my carnal appetites to be sure i eased them considerably in the next week or two for i looked out some of the haymarket tarts of my acquaintance and although they were a poor substitute for elspeth they helped me to settle in again to london life and regular whoring so i was soon enjoying myself speculating pleasantly about the future taking my ease with the boys about the town forgetting the recent horrors of jotunberg and rudi starnbergs gang of assassins and waiting for old morrison to start the wheels of my political career turning he was helped of course by my own celebrity and the fact that my father who was now happily settled down with his delirium tremens at a place in the country had been an mp in his time and a damned fine hand at the hustings he had got in on a popular majority after horsewhipping his opponent on the eve of the poll and offering to fight bareknuckle with any man the whigs could put up from brougham down he had a good deal more bottom than i but they did for him at reform and if i didnt have his ardour i was certain i had a greater talent for survival political and otherwise anyway it was some weeks before morrison announced that i was to meet some men in the know as he called them and that we were to go down to wiltshire for a few days to the house of a local bigwig where some politicos would be among the guests it sounded damned dull and no doubt would have been had it not been for my own lechery and vanity and the shockingest turn of ill luck apart from anything else i missed the derby we left elspeth at home working contentedly at her berlins and took the train for bristol morrison and i he was the damndest travelling companion you ever saw for apart from being a thundering bore he carped at everything from the literature at the station book stalls which he pronounced trash to the new practice of having to pay a bob attendance money to railway servants i was glad to get to devizes i can tell you whence we drove to seend a pretty little place where our host lived in a fairish establishment called cleeve house he was the kind of friend youd expect morrison to have a middleaged moneybags of a banker called locke with reachmedown whiskers and a face like a threeday corpse he was warm enough evidently but as soon as i saw the females sitting about in chairs on the gravel with their bonnets on reading improving books i could see this was the kind of houseparty that wasnt flashys style at all i was used to hunting weeks where you dined any old how with lots of brandy and singing and chaps p g in the corner and keeping all hours and no females except the local bareback riders as old jack mitton used to call them but by they were going out you see and it was as much as you dare do at some of the houses to produce the cards before midnight after the ladies had retired i remember speed telling me round about this time of one place hed been to where they got him up at eight for morning prayers and gave him a book of sermons to read after luncheon cleeve house wasnt quite as raw as that but it would have been damned dreary going if one of the girls present hadnt been quite out of the ordinary run i fixed on her from the start a willowy blonde piece with a swinging hip and a knowing eye strange i met her at cleeve and didnt see her again till i came on her cooking breakfast for a picket of campbells highianders outside balaclava six years later the very morning of cardigans charge fanny locke her name was she was the young sister of our host a damned handsome eighteen with the shape of a welldeveloped matron like so many young girls whose body outgrows their years she didnt know what to do with it well i could give her guidance there as soon as i saw her swaying down the staircase at cleeve hoho thinks i hark forrard you may be sure i was soon in attendance and when i found she was a friendly little thing and a keen horsewoman i laid my plans accordingly and engaged to go riding with her next day when she would show me the local country it was the long grass i had in mind of course in the meantime the first evening at cleeve was quite as much fun as a methodist service of course all tory gatherings are the same and locke had assembled as choice a collection of knowall prigs as you could look for bentinck i didnt mind because he had some game in him and knew more about the turf than anyone i ever met but he had in tow the cocky little sheeny disraeli whom i never could stomach he was pathetic really trying to behave like the young idea when he was well into greasy middle age with his lovelock and fancy vest like a punjabi whoremaster they were saying then that he had spent longer arriving at westminster than a onelegged irish peer with the gout well he arrived in the end as we know and if id been able to read the future i might have toadied him a good deal more i dare say locke our host introduced us as we were going in to dinner and i made political small talk as old morrison had told me i should bad work for your lot in the lords hey says i and he lowered his lids at me in that smartaffected way he had you know says i the jewish bill getting thrown out bellows to mend in whitechapel what bad luck all round i went on what with shylock rumning second at epsom too i had twenty quid on him myself i heard locke mutter good god but friend codlingsby just put back his head and looked at me thoughtfully indeed says he how remarkable and you aspire to politics mr flashman thats my ticket says i truly remarkable says he do you know i shall watch your career with bated breath and then locke mumbled him away and i pounced on miss fanny and took her in to dinner of course it was all politics at table but i was too engaged with fanny to pay much heed when the ladies had gone and wed all moved up i heard more but it didnt stick i remember they were berating russells idleness and the governments extravagance on which disraeli made one of those sallies which you could see had been well polished beforehand lord john must not be underestimated says he he understands the first principle that the great strength of the british constitution lies in the money it costs us make government cheap and you make it contemptible everyone laughed except old morrison who glared over his glass thatll look well in one o your novelles sir i dont doubt but let me tell you running a country is like running a mill and wastell ruin the baith o them disraeli being smart affected to misunderstand i know nothing of running mills says he pugilism is not among my interests which of course turned the laugh against old morrison you may judge from this the kind of rare wit to be found at political gatherings i was out of all patience after an hour of it and by the time we joined the ladies miss fanny to my disgust had gone to bed next day however she and i were off on our expedition soon after breakfast with sandwiches and a bottle in my saddlebag for we intended to ride as far as roundway down a place which she was sure must interest me since there had been a battle fought there long ago on the way she showed me the house where she had once lived and then we cantered on across the excellent riding country that lies north of salisbury plain it was the jolliest day with a blue sky fleecy clouds and a gentle breeze and fanny was in excellent trim she looked mighty fetching in a plumcoloured habit with a tricorne hat and feather and little black boots and i never saw a female better in the saddle she could keep up with me at a gallop her fair hair flying and her pretty little lips parted as she scudded along so to impress her i had to show her some of the riding tricks id picked up in afghanistan like running alongside my beast full tilt with a hand on the mane and swinging over the rump to land and run on tother side d d showy stuff and she clapped her hands and cried bravo while the bumpkins we passed along the way hallooed and waved their hats all this put me in capital form of course and by the time we got to roundway i was nicely primed to lure miss fanny into a thicket and get down to business she was such a jolly little thing with such easy chatter and a saucy glint in her blue eye that i anticipated no difficulty we dismounted near the hill and we led our beasts while she told me about the battle in which it seemed the cavaliers had thoroughly chased the roundheads the people hereabouts call it runaway down says she laughing because the roundheads fled so fast it was the best thing id ever heard about cromwells fellows gave me a fellowfeeling for em and i made some light remark to this effect oh you may say so says she you who have never run away she gave me an odd little look sometimes i wish i were a man with the strength to be brave like you flashy knows a cue when he hears it im not always brave fanny says i pretty solemn and stepping close sometimes im the veriest coward by gd i never spoke a truer word i cant believe says she and got no further for i kissed her hard on the lips for a moment she bore it and then to my delight she began teasing me with her tongue but before i could press home my advantage she suddenly slipped away laughing no no cries she very merry this is runaway down remember and like a fool i didnt pursue on the instant if i had done i dont doubt shed have yielded but i was content to play her game for the moment and so we walked on chatting and laughing you may think this trivial the point is that if id mounted miss fanny that day i daresay id have lost interest in her at all events id have been less concerned to please her later and would have avoided a great deal of sorrow and being chased and bullyragged halfway round the world as it was it was the most d ably bothersome day i remember half a dozen times i got to grips with her over the luncheon sandwiches during our walk down from the hill even in the saddle on the way home and each time she kissed like a novice french whore and then broke off teasing and either because we met people on the way or because she was as nimble as a flyweight i never had a chance to go to work properly of course id known chits like this before and experience told me it would come all right on the night as the theatricals say but by the time we were cantering up to cleeve again i was as horny as the town bull and not liking it overmuch and there was a nasty shock waiting in the shape of two chaps who came out of the front door both in hussar rig the first one halloing and waving to fanny and helping her down from her mare she made him known to me with a mischievous twinkle as her fiancй one duberly which would have been bad news at any other time but all my attention was taken by his companion who stood back eyeing me with a cool smile very knowing my heart checked for a second at the sight of him it was bryant if you know my memoirs you know him he and i had been subalterns in cardigans regiment nine years before on the occasion when i fought a memorable duel he had agreed for a consideration to ensure that my opponents pistol was loaded only with blank so that i had survived the meeting with credit i had cheated him out of his payment to be sure and there had been nothing he could do except make empty threats of vengeance after that our ways had parted and id forgotten him and now here he was like corpse at a christening of course he still couldnt harm me but it was a nasty turn to see him just the same hello flash says he sauntering up still campaigning i see and he made his bow to miss fanny while duberly presented him most honoured to know you sir says this duberly shaking my hand as i dismounted he was a fattish whiskered creature with muff written all over him heard so much distinguished officer delighted to see you here eh fan and she cool piece that she was having sensed in an instant that bryant and i were at odds chattered gaily about what a jolly picnic we had made while duberly humphed and grinned and was all over her presently he led her indoors leaving bryant and me by the horses spoiled the chase for you has he flash says he with his spiteful little grin d lish nuisance these fiancйs sometimes as inconvenient as husbands i dare say i cant imagine youd know about that says i looking him up and down when did cardigan kick you out then for he wasnt wearing cherrypicker rig he flushed at that and i could see id touched him on the raw i transferred to the eighth irish says he we dont all leave regiments as you do with our tails between our legs my my it still rankles tommy dont it says i grinning at him feeling the pinch were we i always thought the eleventh was too expensive for you well if you cant come up to snuff in the eighth you can always take up pimping again you know that made his mouth work all right in the old days in canterbury when he was toadying me id thrown a few guineas his way in return for his services as whoremonger and general creature he fell back a step dn you flashman says he ill bring you down yet not to your own level if you please says i and left him swearing under his breath now if id been as wise then as i am now id have remembered that even as slimy a snake as bryant still has fangs but he was such a contemptible squirt and id handled him so easily in the past that i put him out of my mind i was more concerned with the inconvenience of this fat fool duberly whose presence would make it all the more difficult for me to cock a leg athwart miss fanny i was sure she was game for it after that days sparring but of course duberly quite cut me out now that he was here squiring her at tea and fetching her fan clucking round her in the drawingroom and taking her arm in to dinner locke and the rest of her family were all for him i could see so i couldnt put him down as id have done anywhere else it was d d vexing but wheres the fun if its all too easy i told myself and set to scheme how i might bring the lady to the sticking point as we shakespeare scholars say i was much distracted from these fine thoughts by old morrison who berated me privately for what he called godless gallivanting after yon hussy it seemed i should have spent the day hanging on the lips of bentinck and disraeli and locke who had been deep in affairs i soothed him with a promise that id attend them after dinner which i did and steep work it was ireland was very much exciting them i recall and the sentencing and transportation of some rebel called mitchel old morrison was positive he should have been hanged and got into a great passion because when they shipped him off to the indies they didnt send him in chains with a breadandwater diet if the d d rascal had sailed on any vessel o mine it would hae been sawdust he got tae eat and d d little o that says dear kind papa and the rest of them cried hear hear and agreed that it was this kind of soft treatment that encouraged sedition they expected the paddies to rise at any time and there was talk of dublin being besieged all humbug of course you cant mount a rebellion on rotten potatoes after that there was fierce debate over whether the working class wanted reform and one hume was damned for a scoundrel and disraeli discoursed on the folly of some measure to exclude mps who couldnt pay their debts no doubt he had a personal interest there and i sat and listened bored to death until bentinck suggested we join the ladies not that there was much sport there either for mrs locke was reading aloud from the great new novel jane eyre and from the expression on the faces of fanny and the other young misses i guessed theyd have been happier with varney the vampire or sweeney todd in another corner the older folk were looking at picture books german churches probably another pack of females were sewing and mumbling to each other and in an adjoining salon some hysterical bitch was singing who will oer the downs with me with a governess thrashing away at the pianoforte a couple of wild old rakes were playing backgammon and duberly was explaining to whoever would listen that he would have been glad to serve in india but his health wouldnt allow dont ye know i asked myself how long i could bear it i believe it was bentinck who suggested cards locke looked like the kind who wouldnt have permitted such devices of the devil under his roof but bentinck was the lion you see and couldnt be gainsaid besides there was still a little leeway in those days which youd never have got in the sixties or seventies i wasnt in at the beginning of the game having been ambushed by an old dragon in a lace cap who told me how her niece priscilla had written to her with an envelope instead of waxing her letter and what did i think of that i despaired of getting away until who should appear but fanny herself sparkling and full of nonsense to insist that i should come and show her how to make her wagers i am quite at sea says she and henry this was duberly vows that counting makes his head ache you will assist me captain flashman wont you and aunt selina will not mind will you auntie dear i should have told her to go straight to hl and clung to aunt selina like a shipwrecked lascar but you cant read the future aint it odd to think if id declined her invitation i might have been in the lords today and a certain american might never have become president mind you even now if a fresh piece like fanny locke stooped in front of me with those saucy eyes and silken hair and pushed those pouting lips and white shoulders at me ah dry your whiskers old flash you could keep your coronet for me and id take her hand and hobble off to my ruin whatever it was aunt selina sniffed and told her she must not wager more than a pair of gloves and not your houbigants mind you foolish little girl indeed i dont know what the world is coming to or henry duberly thinking of to permit you wagering at cards no doubt he will be one of these husbands who will allow you to waltz and drink porter in company it would not have done in my day what are the stakes oh ever so little aunt says fanny tugging at my sleeve farthings and sweets and lord george has the bank and is ever such fun is he indeed says aunt selina gathering up her reticule then i shall come myself to see you are not excessively silly there was quite a crowd round the table in the salon where bentinck was presiding over vingtetun amid great merriment he was playing the chef to perfection calling the stakes and whipping round the pasteboards like a riverboat dude even locke and morrison were present watching and being not too sour about it mrs abigail locke was among the players with bryant advising toadylike at her elbow disraeli was making a great show of playing indulgently like a great man who dont mind stooping to trivialities if it will amuse lesser minds and half a dozen others old and young were putting up their counters and laughing with delight at bentincks sallies as fanny and aunt selina took their seats an old fellow with white whiskers leans across to me i must warn you says he that lord george has us playing very deep plunging recklessly you know he held up some counters the green ones are a farthing the blue a hapenny and the yellow you must take care are a penny it is desperate work you see im coming for you sir michael cries bentinck slapping the pack now ladies are you ready then one for all and all for the lucky winner and he flicked the cards round to the players it was silly harmless stuff you see all good nature and playfulness and as desperate a card game as i ever sat in on in my life not that youd have guessed it at first with bentinck making everyone merry and one of the players a sulkylooking youth of about fourteen of the kind whose arse i delighted to kick in happier days protesting that he was cleaned out and bentinck solemnly offering to take his note of hand for twopence fanny was all excitement holding her card up close for me to see and asking how much she should go which gave me the opportunity to huddle in and stroke her bare shoulder as i whispered in her ear next to her old aunt selina was buying cards like a st jamess shark very precise and slow she took four and paused at bentinck was watching her his handsome face very intent his thumb poised on the next card she took it and it was a trey which meant that she had a fivecard hand at which there was great applause and bentinck laughed and cried well done maam as he paid her counters over i never buy beyond you know aunt selina confided to fanny unless it is for a fivecard hand i find it a very good rule so the game went round and i found myself thinking that it doesnt take high stakes to show up who the real gamesters are you could sense the rapport there was between bentinck and aunt selina two folk with not a jot in common mark you he was one of the sportsmen of the day used to playing for thousands a grandee of the turf and the tables who could watch a fortune slip away in five seconds at epsom and never bat an eyelid and here he was watching like a hawk as some dowager hesitated over a farthing stake or frowning as the sullen master jerry lost his twopenny iou and promptly demanded further credit wasnt it greville who said that the money lord george bentinck won was just so many paper counters to him it was the game that mattered and aunt selina was another of the same she duelled with him like a good un and won as often as not and he liked her for it and then the bank passed round tc fanny and i had to deal the cards for her bryant who had raised a great laugh by coming round to touch aunt selinas mittened hand for luck said we should have a fair deal at last since i had been notoriously the worst vingtetun player in the whole light cavalry there was more polite mirth at this and i gave him a hard look as he went back to mrs locke and wondered to myself just what he had meant by that then fanny all twittering as she handled the stakes claimed my attention and i dealt the cards if you know vingtetun or poor mans baccarat or blackjack or pontoon whichever you like to call it you know that the object is not to go above with the cards dealt to you its a gamblers game in which you must decide whether to stay pat at or or risk another card which may break you or if its a small one may give you a winning score of or zi ive played it from sydney to sacramento and learned to stick at like aunt selina the odds are with the bank since when the scores are level the banker takes the stakes fanny and i had a good bank i dealt her the first round which sank everyone except disraeli who had two court cards for the next time i gave fanny an ace and a knave for vingtetun which swamped the whole board and she clapped her hands and squealed with delight then we ran two fivecard hands in succession and the punters groaned aloud and protested at our luck and bentinck jestingly asked aunt selina if she would stand good for him and she cried with you lord george and made great play of changing his silver for her coppers i was interested in the game by this time its a fact greville was right it dont matter a dn how small the stakes are and fanny was full of excitement and admiration for my luck she shot me an adoring look over her shoulder and i glanced down at her quivering bosoms and thought to myself youll be in rare trim for another kind of game later get em excited a fight is best with the claret flowing but any kind of sport will do if theres a hint of savagery in it and theyll couple like monkeys and then as i pulled my eyes away and dealt the first cards of another hand looking to see that all the stakes were placed i saw that on mrs lockes card there was a pile of yellow counters about two bobs worth that meant they had an ace for certain and they had but it did em no good they draw a seven with it bought a five and then went broke with a king but next time round they staked an even bigger pile of yellows lost again and came back with a still larger wager for the following hand i paused in the act of dealing the second cards youre playing double or quits maam says i to mrs locke road to ruin but before she could speak bryant cut in stakes too high for you are they why if you cant afford not a bit says i if my principals content and i looked down at fanny who was sitting with a splendid pile of counters before her oh do go on please cries she it is the greatest fun so i put round the second cards if bryant thought he was going to rattle me over a few shillings worth of stake he was a bigger fool than i thought but i knew he wasnt a fool and that he was a d d sharp hand at card tricks so i kept my eye on mrs lockes place they lost again and next time mrs locke would only put up a single yellow on which they won there was a good deal of heavy jesting at this and i saw bryant whispering busily in her ear when i dealt the first card he pounced on it they consulted together and then they put their whole pile yellows blues everything on top of the card and bryant gave me a nasty grin and stood back waiting i couldnt follow this it couldnt be better than an ace and it was just a kindergarten game anyway did he think he could score off me by breaking miss fannys bank i noticed bentinck was smiling in a halfpuzzled way and disraeli was fingering his card thoughtfully and shifting his lidded glance from bryant to me they were wondering too and suddenly i felt that cold touch at the nape of my neck that is the warning signal of danger it was ridiculous of course a hapenny game in a country house but i could sense bryant was as worked up as if thered been a thousand guineas riding on his partners card it wasnt healthy and i wanted to be out of that game then and there but id have looked a fool and aunt selina was tapping for a second card and looking at me severely i put them round and perhaps because i had that tiny unease i fumbled master jerrys second card so that it fell face up i should have taken it back by rights but it was an ace and the little scoundrel who should have been in his bed long before insisted on keeping it bryant snapped up mrs lockes second card and showed it to her with a grin disraeli displayed vingtetun by laying his second card a queen face up across the first one the rest bought a third or stood pat i faced our cards a knave and a three which was bad i faced a third an ace which gave us nothing for it but to go on and i turned up a four we were at and at least three players were sitting pat on three cards which meant probably they had or or better i whispered to fanny did she want to try for a fivecard trick which would beat everyone except codlingsbys vingtetun oh yes please cries she we are in luck i feel sure of it i put my thumb on the top card and stopped something was d d far wrong somewhere and i knew it bentinck knew it too and aunt selina who was staring over her spectacles at the pack in my hand others in the room sensed something locke and morrison had broken off their conversation to watch bryant was smirking across at me i flicked over the top card it was a deuce giving us and victory bentinck cried ha aunt selina muttered something under her breath and fanny gave an ecstatic squeal and began to rake in the stakes i gathered in the cards while everyone chattered and laughed mrs locke had an ace and a nine i noticed and i commiserated her on her bad luck bryant pipes up at once very bad luck indeed i should say but i ignored him and told fanny we must now pass the bank to disraeli since he had scored vingtetun oh must we cries she pouting and we were doing so well what a shame it is aunt selina exclaimed at her greed there was more laughter and disraeli took out his eyeglass and bowed to fanny i would not dream says he of claiming the cards from such a fair banker a pun which was greeted with polite applause oh i daresay her partner is quite happy to pass the cards cries bryant the killings made eh flashy now i daresay we must have won thirty shillings on that bank most of it from mrs locke and you could take what hed said as a joke but the jarring note in his voice and the grin on his flushed face told me it wasnt i stared at him and bentincks head whipped round and suddenly there was a silence broken only by miss fannys tinkling laughter as she exclaimed to aunt selina about her own good luck i think it is your bank dizzy says bentinck quietly at last his eyes on bryant unless the ladies feel we have played enough the ladies protested against this and then bryant cut in again ive played quite enough thankee and i daresay my partner has too mrs locke looked startled and bryant went on i never thought to see ah but let it go and he turned from the table like a man trying to control himself there was a seconds silence and then they were babbling what did he say what did he mean and bentinck was flushed with anger and demanding to know what bryant was implying at this bryant pointed to me and says it is really too bad in a pleasant game for the ladies this fellow i beg your pardon lord george but it is too much ask him cries he to turn out his pockets his coat pockets it hit me like a dash of icy water in the shocked hush i found my hand going to my lefthand coat pocket while everyone gaped at me bentinck took a pace towards me saying no stop not before the ladies and then my hand came out and there were three playing cards in it i was too horrified and bewildered to speaks there was a shriek from one of the females and a general gasp and someone muttered cheat oh i could only stare from the cards to bentincks horrified face to bryants flushed and exultant and to dizzys white with disbelief miss fanny jumped up with a shriek starting away from me and then someone was shepherding the females from the room in a terrible silence leaving me with the stern disgusted faces and the exclamations of incredulity and amazement they crowded forward while i stood there gazing at the cards in my hand i can see them yet the king of clubs the deuce of hearts and the ace of diamonds bentinck was speaking and i forced myself to look round at him with bryant disraeli old morrison locke and the others crowding at his back gentlemen my voice was hoarse i i cant imagine i swear to god i thought i hadnt seen the ace of diamonds says someone i saw his hand go to his pocket at the last deal this was bryant oh my goad the shame ot ye wicked deceitful the fellows a damned sharp a cheat in this house remarkable says disraeli with an odd note in his voice for a few pence you know george its d d unlikely the amount never matters says bentinck with a voice like steel its winning now sir what have you to say i was gathering my wits before this monstrous thing trying to understand it god knew i hadnt cheated when i cheat its for something that matters not sweets and hapence and suddenly it hit me like a lightning flash bryant coming round to touch aunt selinas hand standing shoulder to shoulder with me so this was how he was taking his revenge put me in that situation today and id reason my way out of it talking calmly but i was twentysix then and panicked dn it if i had been cheating id have been ready for them with my story cut and dried but for once i was innocent and couldnt think what to say i dashed the cards down and faced them its a b y lie i shouted i didnt cheat i swear it my god why should i lord george can you believe it mr disraeli i appeal to you would i cheat for a few coppers how came the cards in your pocket then demands bentinck that little viper i shouted pointing at bryant the jealous little b d placed them there to disgrace me that set up a tremendous uproar and bryant blast his eyes played it like a master he took a step back gritted his teeth bowed to the company and says lord george i leave it to you to determine the worth of a foul slander from a proven cheat and then he turned and strode from the room i could only stand raging and then as i saw how he had foxed me my god ruined me and before the best in the land i lost control altogether i sprang for the door bawling after him someone caught my sleeve but i threw him off and then i had the door open and was plunging through in pursuit there was a hubbub behind me and a sudden squeal of alarm ahead for there were ladies at the head of the stairs their white faces turned towards me bryant made off at the sight of me and in blind passion i hurled myself after him i had only one thought to catch the undersized little squirt and pound him to death sense decency and the rest were forgotten i got my hand on his collar at the top of the stairs while the females screamed and shrank back i wrenched him round his face grey with fear and shook him like a rat you foul vermin i roared try to dishonour me would you you scum of of the eighth hussars and as i swung him lefthanded before me i drew back my right fist and with all my strength smashed it into his face nowadays when im daydreaming over the better moments of my misspent life galloping lola montez and elspeth and queen ranavalona and little renee the creole and the fat dancingwench i bought in india whose name escapes me and having old colin campbell pinning the vc to my unworthy breast and receiving my knighthood from queen victoria and breaking into the ranees treasurecellar and seeing all that splendid loot laid out for the taking when i think back on these fine things the recollection of hitting tommy bryant invariably comes back to me god knows it was a nightmare at the time but in retrospect i cant think of inflicting a hurt that i enjoyed more my fist caught him full on the mouth and nose so hard that his collar was jerked clean out of my hand and be went hurtling head foremost down that staircase like an arrow bouncing once before crashing to rest in the hall his limbs all asprawl there were shrieks of hysterical females in my ears and hands seizing my coat and men scampering down to lift him up but all i remember is seeing fannys face turned towards me in terror and bentincks voice drifting up the staircase my god i believe hes killed him as it turned out bentinck was wrong thank god the little louse didnt die but it was a nearrun thing apart from a broken nose his skull was fractured in the fall and for a couple of days he hung on the edge with a bristol horseleech working like fury to save him from going over once he regained consciousness and had the impertinence to say tell flashman i forgive him with all my heart which cheered me up because it indicated he was going to live and wanted to appear a forgiving christian if hed thought he was dying hed have d d me to hell and beyond but after that he lost consciousness again and i went through the tortures of the pit they had confined me to my room locke was a justice of the peaceand kept me there with the muff duberly sitting outside the door like a blasted waterbailiff i was in a fearful sweat for if bryant kicked the bucket it would be a hanging matter no error and at the thought of it i could only lie on my bed and quake id seen men swing and thought it excellent fun but the thought of the rope rasping on my neck and the blind being pulled over my brows and the fearful plunge and sickening snap and blackness my god it had me vomiting in the corner well ive had the noose under my chin since then and waited blubbering for them to launch me off and even the real thing seems no worse looking back than those few days of waiting in that bedroom with the yellow primroses on the wallpaper and the blue and red carpet on the floor with little green tigers woven into it and the print of harlaxton manor near grantham lincolnshire the seat of one john longden esq which hung above the bed i can still recite the whole caption with the thought of the gallows driving everything else from my mind it was small consolation to learn from duberly who seemed to be in a mortal funk himself over the whole business that there was by no means complete agreement that i had been caught cheating disraeli he was clever ill say that for him bad sensibly pointed out that a detected cheat wouldnt have hauled the evidence out of his pocket publicly as soon as he was challenged he maintained i would have protested and refused to be searched he was quite right of course but most of the other pious hypocrites disagreed with him and the general feeling was that i was a fraud and a dangerous maniac who would be well served if i finished up in the prison limepit whatever happened it was a hideous scandal the house had emptied as if by magic next day mrs locke was in a decline and her husband was apparently only waiting to see how bryant fared before turning me over to the police i dont know even now what was determined or who determined it in those few days except that old morrison was obviously up to the neck in it whatever happened to bryant my political career was obviously over before it had begun at best i was probably disgraced as a cheat and liable to sentence for assault that was if bryant lived in any event i was a liability to morrison henceforth and whether he decided to try to get rid of me permanently or planned simply to get me out of harms way for a time is something on which ive never made up my mind in fact i dont suppose he cared above half whether i lived or died so long as his own interests werent harmed he came to see me on the fifth day and told me that bryant was out of danger and i was so relieved that i was almost happy as i listened to him denouncing me for a wastrel a fornicator a cheat a liar a brute and all the rest of it i couldnt fault a word of it anyway when he was done he plumped down breathing like a bellows and says my certie but yere easier oot o this than ye deserve its no your fault the mark o cain isnae on yer broo this day a beast thats whit ye are flashman a ragin evil beast and he mopped his face weel locke isnae goin tae press charges ye have me tae thank for that and this fellow bryantll keep mum huh a few hundredll tak care of him hes anither officer and gentleman like yersel i could buy the lot o ye jist trash he snarled away under his breath and shot me a look but well no hush up the scandal for a that ye cannae come home yere aware o that i suppose i didnt argue i couldnt but i was illadvised enough to mutter something about elspeth and for a moment i thought he would strike me his face went purple and his teeth chattered mention her name tae me again jist once again and as goads my witness ill see ye transported for this weeks work yell rue the day ye ever set eyes on her aye as i have done most bitterly goad alone knows what i and mine have done tae be punished by you well at least he didnt pray over me like arnold he was a different kind of hypocrite was morrison and as a man of business he didnt waste overmuch holy vituperation before getting down to cases yell be best oot o england for a spell until this d able business has blown by if it ever does your fine relatives can mak your peace wi the horse guards this kind o scandalll be naethin new there i dare say for the rest ive been at work tae arrange matters and whether ye like it or not my buckle yell jump as i whistle dye see i suppose ive no choice says i and then deciding it would be politic to grovel to the old b d i added believe me sir i feel nothing but gratitude for what you are doing and hold your tongue says he yere a liar theres no more tae be said now yell pack yer valise and go at once tae poole and there take a room at the admiral and wait until ye hear from me not a word to a soul and never stir out or yell find my protection and lockes is withdrawn and thatll be a felons cell for ye and beggary tae follow theres money says he and dropping a purse on the table he turned on his heel and stamped out i made no protest he had me by the neck and i didnt waste time reflecting on the eagerness with which my relatives and friends have always striven to banish me from england whenever opportunity offered my own father lord cardigan and now old morrison they could never get shot of me fast enough and as on previous occasions there was no room for argument i would just have to go and see what the lord and john morrison provided i slipped away from the house at noon and was in poole by nightfall and there i waited a whole week fretting at first but gradually getting my spirits back at least i was free when i might have been going to the condemned hold whatever lay in front of me id come back to england eventually it might be no more than a year and by that time the trouble would be halfforgotten curiously enough the assault on bryant would be far less to live down than the business over the cards but the more i thought about that the more it seemed that no sensible men would take bryants word against mine he was known for a toady and a dirty little hound whereas i quite aside from my popular fame was bluff honest harry to everyone who thought they knew me indeed i even toyed with the notion of going back to town and brazening the thing then and there but i hadnt the gall for that it was all too fresh and morrison would have thrown me into the gutter for certain no i would just have to take my medicine whatever it was ive learned that theres no sense in kicking against the prick a phrase which fits old morrison like a glove i would just have to make the best of whatever he had in store for me what that was i discovered on the eighth day when a man called to see me just as i was finishing breakfast in fact i had finished and was just chivvying after the servant lass who had come to clear away the dishes from my room i had chased her into a corner and she was bleating that she was a good girl which ill swear she wasnt when the knock sounded she took advantage of it to escape admitting the visitor while she straightened her cap and snapped her indignation at me sauce says she i never get out says the newcomer and she took one look at him and fled he kicked the door to with his heel and stood looking at me and there was something in that look that made me bite back the dnyoureyes id been going to give him for issuing orders in my room at first glance he was ordinary looking enough square built middle height plain trousers and tightbuttoned jacket with his hands thrust into the pockets lowcrowned round hat which he didnt trouble to remove and stifftrimmed beard and moustache which gave him a powerful businesslike air but it wasnt that that stopped me it was the mans eyes they were as pale as water in a china dish bright and yet empty and as cold as an ice floe they were wide set in his brown hooknosed face and they looked at you with a blind fathomless stare that told you here was a terrible man above them on his brow there was a puckered scar that ran from side and side and sometimes jerked as he talked when he was enraged as he often was it turned red hollo thinks i heres another in my gallery of happy acquaintances mr flashman says he he had an odd husky voice with what sounded like a trace of north country my name is john charity spring it seemed d d inappropriate to me but he was evidently well enough pleased with it for he sat himself down in a chair and nodded me to another well waste no time if you please says he im under instructions from my owner to take you aboard my vessel as supercargo you dont know what that means i daresay and its not necessary that you should i know why youre shipping with me youll perform such duties as i suppose to be within your power am i clear well says i i dont know about that i dont think i care for your tone mr spring and captain spring says he and sat forward now see here mr flashman i dont beat about youre nothing to me i gather youve halfkilled someone and that youre a short leap ahead of the law im to give you passage out on the instructions of mr morrison suddenly his voice rose to a shout and he crashed his hand on the table well i dont give a dn you can stay or run dye see its all one to me but you dont waste my time the scar on his head was crimson and then it faded and his voice dropped well i didnt like the look of this one i can tell you but what could i do well says i you say mr morrison is your ships owner i didnt know he had ships part owner says he one of my directors i see and where is your ship bound captain spring and where are you to take me the pale eyes flickered were going foreign says he america and home again the voyage may last six months so by christmas youll be back in england as supercargo you take a share of profit a small share so your voyage wont be wasted whats the cargo says i interested because i remembered bearing that these shorthaul traders on the atlantic run did quite well general stuffs on the way out brummagem cloths some machinery cotton sugar molasses and so forth on the trip home he snapped the words out you ask too d d many questions mr flashman for a runner im not all that much of a runner says i it didnt sound too bad a way of putting by the time till the bryant business was past well in that case i suppose good says he now then i know youre an army officer and its in deference to that im making you supercargo which means you mess aft youve been in india for what thats worth what dyou know of the sea little enough says i ive voyaged out and home but i sailed in borneo waters with rajah brooke and can handle a small boat did you now the pale eyes gleamed that means youve been partpirate i daresay you look like it hold your tongue sir it doesnt matter to me ill ordy tell you this on my ship there is no freeandeasy skylarking i saw that slut in here just now well henceforth youll fornicate when i give you leave by god ill not have it otherwise he was shouting again this fellows halfmad thinks i then he was quiet you have languages i understand why yes french and german hindoostani pushtu which is a tongue of northern india says he impatiently i know get on well a little malay a little danish i learn languages easily aye you were educated at rugby you have the classics well says i ive forgotten a good deal hah hiatus maxime deflendus says this amazing fellow or if you prefer it hiatus valde deflendus he glared at me well i gaped at the man you mean oh lets see great er letting down great christs salvation says he no wonder arnold died young the priceless gift of education thrown away on brute minds you speak living languages without difficulty it seems had you not the grace to pay heed dn your skin to the only languages that matter he jumped up and strode about i was getting tired of mr charity spring they may matter to you says i but in my experience its precious little good quoting virgil to a headhunter and what the d l has this to do with anything he stood lowering at me and then sneered theres your educated englishman right enough gentlemen bah why do i waste breath on you quid quid praecipies esto brevis by god well if youll pack your precious traps mr flashman well be off theres a tide to catch and he was away bawling for my account at the stairhead it was obvious to me that i had fallen in with a lunatic and possibly a dangerous one but since in my experience a great many seamen are wanting in the head i wasnt overconcerned he paid not the slightest heed to anything i said as we made our way down to the jetty with my valise behind on a handcart but occasionally he would bark a question at me and it was this that eventually prodded me into recollecting one of the few latin tags which has stuck in my mind mainly because it was flogged into me at school as a punishment for talking in class he had been demanding information about my indian service mighty offensively too so i snapped at him percunctatorem fugitus nam garrulus idem est which i thought was pretty fair and he stopped dead in his tracks horace by gd he shouted well make something of you yet but it is fugito dye see not fugitus come on man make haste he got little opportunity to catechise me after this for the first stage of our journey was in a cockly little fishing boat that took us out into the channel and since it was hlish rough i was in no condition for conversation im an experienced sailor which is to say ive heaved my guts over the rail into all the seven seas and before we were ten minutes out i was sprawled in the scuppers wishing to god id gone back to london and faced the music this spewing empty misery continued as it always does for hours and i was still green and wobblykneed when at evening we came into a bay on the french coast and sighted mr springs vessel riding at anchor gazing blearily at it as we approached i was astonished at its size it was long and lean and black with three masts not unlike the clippers of later years as we came under her counter i saw the lettering on her side it read balliol college ah says i to spring who was by me just then you were at balliol were you no says he mighty short i am an oriel man myself then why is your ship called balliol college i saw his teeth clench and his scar darkened up because i hate the b y place he cried in passion he took a turn about and came back to me my father and brothers were balliol men dyou see does that answer you mr flashman well it didnt but at that moment my belly revolted again and when we came aboard i had to be helped up the ladder retching and groaning and falling asprawl on the deck i heard a voice say christ its nelson and then i was halfcarried away and dropped on a bunk somewhere alone in my misery while in the distance i heard the hateful voice of john charity spring bawling orders i vowed then as ive vowed fifty times since that this was the last time id ever permit myself to be lured aboard a ship but my mind must still have been working a little because as i dropped off to sleep i remember wondering why does a british ship have to sail from the french coast but i was too tired and ill to worry just then sometime later someone brought me broth and having spewed it on to the floor i felt well enough to get up and stagger on deck it was halfdark but the stars were out and to port there were hghts twinkling on the french coast i looked north towards england but there was nothing to be seen but grey sea and suddenly i thought my gd what am i doing here where the deuce am i going who is this man spring here i was who only a couple of weeks before had been rolling down to wiltshire like a lord with the intention of going into politics and now i was shivering with seasickness on an oceangoing barque commanded by some kind of mad oxford don it was too much and i found i was babbling to myself by the rail its always the way of course youre coasting along and then the current grips you and youre swept into events and places that you couldnt even have dreamed about it seemed to have happened so quickly but as i looked miserably back over the past fortnight there wasnt that i could see anything i could have done that would have prevented what was now happening to me i couldnt have resisted morrison or refused spring id had to do what i was told and here i was i found myself blubbering as i gazed over the rail at the empty waste of sea if only i hadnt got lusty after that little b h fanny and played cards with her and hit that swine biyant ah but what was the use it was done and i was going god knew where and leaving elspeth and my life of ease and drinking and guzzling and mounting women behind but it was too bad and i was full of selfpity and rage as i watched the water slipping past of course if id been like jack merry or dick champion or any of the other plucky little prigs that tom brown and his cronies used to read about setting off to seek my fortune on the bounding wave id have brushed aside a manly tear and faced the future with the stout heart of youth while old bosun mchearty clapped me on the shoulder and held me enthralled with tales of the south seas and i would have gone to bed at last thinking of my mother and resolving to prove worthy of my resolute and christian commander captain freeman perhaps at twentysix i was too old and hardused for instead of a manly tear i did another manly vomit and in place of bosun mchearty there came a rush of seamen tailing on a rope across the deck hurling me aside with a cry of stand from under you farmer while from the dark above me my christian commander bellowed at me to get below and not hinder work so i went and fell asleep thinking not of my mother or of the credit id bring my family but of the chance id missed in not rogering fanny locke that afternoon at roundway down aye the vain regrets of youth you will judge from this that i wasnt cut out for the life on the ocean wave i cant deny it if captain marryat had had to write about me hed have burned his pen signed on a cardiff tramp and been buried at sea for one thing in my first few days aboard i did not thrash the ships bully make friends with the nigger cook or learn how to gammon a bosprit from a leathery old salt who called me a likely lad no i spent those days in my bunk feeling d d ill and only crawling on deck occasionally to take the air and quickly scurry below again to my berth i was a seagreen and corruptible flashy in those days nor did i make friends for i saw only four people and disliked all of them the first was the ships doctor a bigbellied lout of an irishman who looked as though hed be more at home with a bottle than a lancet and had cold clammy hands he gave me a draught for my seasickness which made it worse and then staggered away to be ill himself he was followed by a queer oldyoung creature with wispy hair who shuffled in carrying a bowl from which he slopped some evillooking muck when i asked him who the d l he was he jerked his head in a nervous tic and stammered please sir im sammy sammy what nossir please sir sammy snivels capn calls me but they calls me looney mostly and whats that please sir its gruel the doctor sez for you to eat it please sir and he lumbered forward and spilled half of it over my cot dn you cries i and weak and all as i was i caught him a backhanded swipe on the face that sent him half across the cabin take your filth and get out he mowed at me and tried to scrape some of the stuff off the floor back into the bowl doctorll thump me if you dont take it please sir says he pushing it at me again please sir its nice tack an all please sir and then he squealed as i lunged out at him dropped the bowl and fairly ran for it i was too weak to do more than curse after him but i promised myself that when i was better i would put myself in a better frame of mind by giving the blundering halfwit a thumping on my own account to keep the doctors company next man in was no halfwit but a nimble little ferret of a ships boy with a loose lip and a cast in one eye he gave me a shifty grin and sniffed at the spilled gruel looney didnt ave no luck did e says he i told im gruel wouldnt go down noow i told him to go to blazes and leave me alone feelin groggy eh says he moving towards the bunk grubs no good ter you mate tell yer wot ill get in bed wiv yer for a shillin get out you dirty little b d says i for i knew his kind rugby had been crawling with em id sooner have your greatgrandmother snooks says he putting out his tongue youll sing a different tune after three months at sea an not a wench in sight itll be two bob then i flung a pot at him but missed and he let fly a stream of the richest filth ive ever listened to ill get mister comber ter you yer big black swine he finished up ell give you what for tata and with that he slipped out thumbing his nose mr comber was the fourth of my new acquaintances he was third mate and shared the cabin with me and i couldnt make him out he was civil although he said little enough but the odd thing was he was a gentleman and had obviously been to a good school what a playingfield beauty like this was doing on a merchantman i couldnt see but i held my tongue and watched him he was about my age tall and fair haired and too sure of himself for me to get on the wrong side of i guessed he was as puzzled about me as i was about him but i was feeling too poorly at first to give much heed to him he didnt champion the cabin boy by the way so that worthys threat had obviously been bluff it was four or five days before i got my sea legs and by then i was heartily sick of the balliol college nowadays you have no notion of what a sailingship was like in the forties people who travel posh in a steam packet cant imagine for one thing the h ish continual din of a wooden vessel the incessant creaking and groaning of timber and cordage like a fiends orchestra playing the same discordant notes regular as clockwork each time she rolled and by gd they rolled far worse than iron boats bucketing up and down and stinking too with the musty stale smell of a floating cathedral and the bilges plashing like a giants innards oh it was the life for a roaring boy all rights and that was only the start of it i didnt know it but i was seeing the balliol college at her best one morning when i was sufficiently recovered to hold down the gruel that looney brought me and strong enough to kick his backside into the bargain comes captain spring to tell me id lain long enough and it was time for me to learn my duties youll stand your watch like everyone else says he and in the meantime you can start on the work youre paid for which is to go through every scrap of that cargo privatim et seriatim and see that those longshore thieves havent bilked me so get up and come along with me i followed him out on deck we were scudding along like a flying duck with great billows of canvas spread and a wind on the quarter deck fit to lift your hair off there was plenty of shipping in sight but no land and i knew we must be well out of the channel by now looking forward from the poop rail along the narrow flush deck it seemed to me the balliol college didnt carry much of a crew for all her size but i didnt have time to stop and stare with spring barking at me he led me down the poop ladder and then dropped through a scuttle by the mizzen mast there you are says he take a good look although ive done a deal more sailing than i care to remember im no canvasback and while i know enough not to call the deck the floor im no hand at nautical terms we were in what seemed to be an enormous room stretching away forward to the foremast where there was a bullthead this room ran obviously the full breadth of the ship and was well lighted by gratings in the deck about fifteen feet above our heads but it was unlike the interior of any ship id ever seen it was so big and roomy on either side about four feet above the deck on which we stood there was a kind of halfdeck perhaps seven feet deep like a gigantic shelf and above that yet another shelf of the same size the space down the centre of the deck between the shelves was piled high with cargo in a great mound it must have been a good seventy feet long by twelve high ill send my clerk to you with the manifest says spring and a couple of hands to help shift and stow i became aware that the pale eyes were watching me closely well is this the hold says i its an oddlooking place for cargo aye says he aint it though something in his voice and in the dank feel of that great half empty deck set the worms stirring inside me i moved forward with the great heap of cargo bales and boxes on one side of me and the starboard shelves on the other it was all clean and holystoned but there was a strange heavy smell about it that i couldnt place looking about i noticed something in the shadows at the back of the lower shelf i reached in and drew out a long length of light chain garnished here and there with large bracelets i stood staring at them and then dropped them with a clatter as the truth rushed in on me now i saw why the balliol college had sailed from france why her deck was this strange shape why she was only halffull of cargo my gd cries i youre a slaver good for you mr flashman says spring and what then what then says i well you can turn your b d boat about this minute and let me ashore from her by gd if id guessed what you were id have seen you d d and old morrison with you before i set foot on your lousy packet dear me says he softly youre not an abolitionist surely dn abolition and you too cries i i know that slavings piracy and for that they stretch your neck below highwater mark you you tricked me into this you and that old swine but i wont have it dye hear youll set me ashore and i was striding past him towards the ladder as he stood with his hands thrust deep in his pockets eyeing me under the brim of his hat suddenly he shot out a hand and with surprising strength swung me round in front of him the pale eyes gazed into mine and then his fist drove into my belly doubling me up with pain i reeled back and he came after me smashing me left and right to the head and sending me sprawling against the cargo dn you i shouted and tried to crawl away but he pinned me with his foot glaring down at me now see here mister flashman says he i didnt want you but ive got you and youll understand here and now that while youre on this ship youre mine dye see youre not going ashore until this voyage is finished middle passage indies homeward run and all if you dont like slaving well thats too bad isnt it you shouldnt have signed aboard should you i didnt sign i never your signature will be on the articles that are in my cabin this minute says he oh itll be there sure enough youll put it there youre kidnapping me i yelled my gd you cant do it captain spring i beg you set me ashore let me get off ill pay you ill what and lose my new supercargo says this devil grinning at me no no john charity spring obeys his owners orders and mine are crystal clear mister flashman and he sees to it that those aboard his ship obey his orders too ye hear me he stirred me with his foot now get up youre wasting my time again youre here youll do your duty i wont tell you twice and those terrible pale eyes looked into mine again dye understand me i understand you i muttered sir says he sir come says he thats better now cheer up man i wont have sulks by gd this is a happy ship dye hear it should be the wages we pay theres a thought for you flashman youll be a d d sight richer by the end of this voyage than you would be on a merchantman what dye say to that my mind was in a maze over all this and real terror at what the consequences might be again i pleaded with him to be set ashore and he slapped me across the mouth shut your trap says he youre like an old woman scared are you what of its a capital crime i whimpered dont be a fool says he britain doesnt hang slavers nor do the yankees for all their laws say look about you this ships built for slaving aint she slavers who run the risk of getting caught arent built so with chains in view and slave decks and all no indeed qui male agit odit lucem they pose as honest merchantmen so if the patrols nab em they wont be impounded under the equipment regulations the balliol college needs no disguises for the simple reason were too fast and handy for any d d patrol ship english or american what im telling you mister flashman is that we dont get caught so you wont either does that set your mind at rest it didnt of course but knew better than to protest again all i could think of was how the hl i was going to get out of this he took my silence for assent well enough growls he youll begin on this lot then and he jerked a thumb at the cargo and for christs sake liven up man ill not have you glooming up this ship with a long face dye see at eight bells youll leave off and come to my cabin mrs spring will be serving tea for the officers and will wish to meet you i didnt believe my ears mrs spring my wife he snapped and seeing my bewilderment who the d l else would mrs spring be you dont think id ship my mother aboard a slaver do you and with that he strode off leaving me in a fine sweat thanks to an instants folly and the evil of that rotten little toad my fatherinlaw i was a member of the crew of a pirate ship and nothing to be done about it it took some digesting but there it was i suppose that after all the shocks id had in my young life this should have been nothing out of the way but i found myself shuddering at the thought not that id any qualms about slaving mark you from the holyholy point of view they could have transported every nigger in africa to the moon in chains for all i cared but i knew it was a d d chancy business aye and old morrison had known that too so the old swine had his fingers in the blackbird pie and ill lay my life that was a well concealed ledger in his countinghouse and had taken advantage of the bryant affair to shanghai me into this he had wanted me out of the way and here was a golden chance of making sure that i would be away for good no doubt spring was right and the balliol college would come through her voyage safe as most slavers did but there was always the chance of being caught and rotting your life away in jail even if they didnt top you and there was the risk of getting killed by niggers on the slave coast or catching yellow jack or some foul native disease as so many slaving crews did oh it was the perfect ocean cruise for an unwanted soninlaw and elspeth would be a widow i would never see her or england again for even if i survived the trip word of it might get home and id be an outlaw a felon i sat down on the cargo with my head in my hands and wept and raged inwardly against that little scotch scoundrel gd if ever i had the chance to pay him back but what was the use of thinking that way in my present plight in the end as usual one thought came uppermost in my mind survive flashy and let the rest wait but i resolved to keep my spite warm in the meantime in the circumstances it was as well that i had work to do going through that cargo as i did when a couple of hands and the ships clerk came down presently at least occupied part of my thoughts and kept me from working myself into a terror about the future after all thinks i men like these didnt sign on in the expectation of dying they seemed handy sober fellows who knew their business very different from the usual tarryjohn one of them an oldish man named kirk had been a slaver all his days and had served on the notorious black joke he wouldnt have shipped on any other kind of vessel what says he at ј a month id be a fool dye know ive four thousand quid put by in liverpool and charleston banks how many sailormen have the tenth of that risk ive been impounded once on the joke shipwrecked once and seen two cargoes of black ivory slung overside which meant a dead loss for the owners but i drew me pay didnt i oh aye ive been chased a score o times and been yardarm to yardarm in running fights wi limey an yankee patterrollers but no harm done an for sickness yeve more chance of that from some poxedup yellow tart in havana than on the coast these days youve been east well you know to keep yourself clean an boil your water then he made it sound not half bad apart from the stuff about fighting the patrols but i understood that this was a rare event the balliol college had never been touched in five trips that he knew of although she had been sighted and chased times without number shes built light see like all the baltimore brigs an clippers says kirk save a patch o calm shell show her heels to anything even steamships west o saint tommy even wi a full load o black cattle she could snap her fingers at the whole navy and wi the fair winds coming south like we are now shes gone before they see her only risky time is on the coast itself afore we load up if they was to catch us there wi the government wind pinning us on the coast they could impound us empty an all cos o the law as lays down that if youre rigged and fitted for slavin like we are they can pinch you even wiout a black aboard used to be that even then they couldnt touch ye if ye had the right papers greek say or braziliano he laughed why ive sailed on a ship that had yankee gyppo portugee an even rooshian papers au ready for inspection as might serve but its different now ye dont talk ye run he and the clerk and the other man i think he was a norwegian harked back a good deal to the old days when the slaveships had waited in turn at the great african barracoons to ship their cargoes and how the navy had spoiled the trade by bribing the native chiefs not to deal with slavers so that all the best stretches of coast nowadays were out of court and no niggers to be had mind you says kirk winking show em the kind o goods we got here an theyll spring you a likely cargo o yorubas or mandingos treaty or not an if sometimes you have to fight for em as we did two trips back well it comes cheaper dont it an capn spring hes got a grand nose for a tribal war or a chief thats got too many young bucks of his own people on his hands hes a caution he is an worth every penny the owners pay him like to guess ow much i said i had no idea twenty thousand pound a trip says kirk there now an you wonder i ship on a slaver i knew slavers made huge profits of course but this staggered me no wonder old morrison had an interest in the tradeand no doubt paid a subscription to the antislavery society and thought it well worthwhile and he wasnt laying out overmuch in trade goods by the look of this cargo you never saw so much junk although just the kind of stuff to make a nigger chief happy no doubt there were old brown bess muskets that probably hadnt been fired in fifty years sackfuls of condemned powder and shot rusty bayonets and cheap cutlasses and knives mirrors and looking glasses by the dozen feathered hats and check trousers iron pots and plates and cauldrons and most amazing of all a gross of army red coats th foot one of em had a bullethole and a rusty stain on the right breast and i remember thinking bad luck for someone there was a packet of letters in the pocket which i meant to keep but didnt and there was case after case of liquor in brown glass bottles gin i suppose yould call it but even to sniff the stuff shrivelled the hairs off your arse the blacks wouldnt know the difference of course we were searching through all this trash i counting and calling out to the clerk who ticked the manifest and kirk and his fellow stowing back when looney the idiot steward came down to gape at us he squatted down dribbling out of the corner of his mouth making stupid observations till kirk who was bundling the red coats sings out to him to come over kirk had taken two of the brass gorgets off the officers coats they must have been d d old uniforms and winking at us he laid the gorgets on the deck and says now looney youre a sharp un which is the biggest lf you can tell ill give you my spirits tomorrow if you cant you give me yours see i saw what he was after the gorgets were shaped like halfmoons and whichever was laid uppermost looked bigger children amuse themselves with such things cut out of paper looney squinted at them giggling and pointing to the top gorget says that un yere sure says kirk and taking the gorget which looney had indicated placed it beneath the other one which now looked bigger of course looney stared at it and then said that uns bigger now kirk changed them again while his mates laughed and looney was bewildered he gaped round helplessly and then kicking the gorgets aside he shouted you make em bigger an an littler and he started to cry calling kirk a dirty b d which made us laugh all the more so he shouted obscenities at us and stamped and then ran over to a pile of bags stowed beyond the cargo and began to urinate on them still swearing at us over his shoulder hold on cries kirk when he could contain his mirth thats the niggers gruel youre p g on i was holding my sides guffawing and the clerk cries out thatll make the dish all the tastier for em oh my stars looney seeing us amused began to laugh himself as such idiots will and p d all the harder and then suddenly i heard the others laughter cut off and there was a step on the ladder and there stood john charity spring staring at us with a face like the demon king those pale eyes were blazing and looney gave a little whimper and fumbled with his britches while the piddle ran across the tilting deck towards springs feet spring stood there in a silence you could feel while we scrambled up his hands clenched and unclenched and the scar on his head was blazing crimson his mouth worked and then he leaped at looney and knocked the cowering wretch down with one smashing blow for a moment i thought he would set about the halfwit with his boots but he mastered himself and wheeled on us bring that that vermin on deck he bawled and stamped up the ladder and i was well ahead of the seamen in rushing to looney and dragging him to the scuttle he yelled and struggled but we forced him up on deck where spring was stamping about in a spitting rage and the hands were doubling aft in response to the roars of the yankee first mate seize him up there orders spring and with me holding looneys thrashing legs kirk very deftly tied his wrists up to the port shrouds and ripped his shirt off spring was calling for the cat but someone says there wasnt one then make one dn you he shouted and paced up and down casting dreadful glances at the imploring looney who was babbling in his bonds dont hit us capn please dont hit us it was them other b ds changin things silence says spring and looneys cries subsided to a whisper while the crew crowded about to see the sport i kept back but made sure i had a good view they gave spring a hastily made cat and he buttoned his jacket tight and pulled his hat down now you b r ill make you dance cries he and laid in for all he was worth looney screamed and struggled each time the lashes hit him he shrieked and between each stroke spring cursed him for all he was worth foul my ship will you whack ruin the food for my cargo by gd whack spread pestilence with your filth will you whack yes pray you wharfside sonofab h im listening whack ill cut your b y soul out if you have one whack if it had been a regulation army cat i think hed have killed him as it was the hastily spliced yarn cut the idiots back to bits and the blood ran over his ragged trousers his screams became moans and then silence and then spring flung the cat overboard souse him and let him hang there to dry says he and then he addressed the unconscious victim and let me catch you at your filthy tricks again you scum so help me gd ill hang you dye hear he glared at us with his madmans eyes and my heart was in my mouth for a moment then his scar faded and he said in his normal bark dismiss the hands mr comber mr sullivan and you supercargo come aft mrs spring is serving tea there were a few curious glances at me as i followed spring and the yankee mate i was new to the crew of courseand as we went down the ladder to his cabin spring looked me over go and put on a jacket he growled gd dn you dont you know anything so i scudded off smartly and when i came back they were still waiting he examined me and in a flash of memory i thought of waiting with wellington to see the queen and being fussed over by flunkeys and then he threw open the door i trust we dont intrude my dear says he i have brought mr sullivan to tea and our new supercargo mr flashman i dont know what i expected the queen of sheba wouldnt have surprised me aboard the balliol college but it wasnt the mildlooking middleaged woman sitting behind a table picking at a sampler who turned to beam at us pleasantly murmured something in greeting and then set to pouring tea presently comber came in smoothing his hair and the grizzled old second mate kinnie who ducked his head to me when spring made us known to each other mrs spring handed over cups and we stood round sipping and nibbling at her biscuits while she beamed and spring talked she had little to say for herself but he paid her as much respect as though it had been a london drawingroom i had to pinch myself to believe it was real a teaparty aboard a slaver with this comfortable woman adding hot water to the pot while a flogged man was bleeding all over the deck above our heads and spring his cuff specked with the victims gore was laying it off about thucydides and horace mr flashman has had the beginning of an education my dear says he he was with dr arnold at rugby school she turned a placid face in my direction mr spring is a classical scholar says she his father was a senior fellow senior tutor if you please my dear says spring and its my belief he achieved that position by stealing the work of better men scholarship is merely a means to an end these days and paucis carior est fides quam pecunia you remember sallust mr comber no there seems to be little to choose between the ignorance of rugby and that of winchester college however if we have some leisure on this voyage we may repair these things may we not mr flashman i mumbled something about being always eager to learn aye says he pars sanitatis velle sanari fuit we may hope but i imagine seneca is yet another among the many authors with whom you are not acquainted he munched on a biscuit the pale blue eyes considering me tell me sir what do you know i stole a glance at the others kinnie had his head down over his cup and sullivan the big rawboned yankee was gazing bleakly before him comber was looking nervous well sir says i not very much and then like a fool i added toadylike not as much as a fellow of oriel college im sure combers cup clattered suddenly spring says very soft i am not a fellow mr flashman i was dismissed well it didnt surprise me im very sorry sir says i you well may be says he you well may be you may come to wish that i was in my rightful place sir instead of here his voice was rising and his scar going crimson he set his cup down with a force that rattled the table herding with the carrion of the sea sir instead of of dn your eyes man look at me you think it a matter for contempt dont you that a man of my intellect should be brought to this you think it a jest that i was flung into the gutter by jealous liars you do i see it in your no no indeed sir cries i quaking i was expelled myself i dont hold your confounded tongue he bawled you cant do right for doing wrong can you no by gd well i warn you mister flashman ill remind you of another text from seneca whom you dont b y well read dn your ignorance gravis ira regum sem per mr comber will construe it for you hes heard it before and digested it hell tell you that a captain is to be feared as much as a king he thumped the table mrs spring youll excuse me and he burst past me slamming the door behind him he left me shaking and then we heard his voice on deck bawling at the man at the wheel and his feet stamping overhead i felt the sweat starting on my forehead may i give you some more tea mr sullivan says mrs spring mr comber a little more she poured for them in silence have you been to sea before mr flashman god knows what i said it was too much for me and its quite likely i answered nothing at all i know we stood about a little longer and then sullivan said we must be about our duties and we thanked mrs spring and she inclined her head gravely and we filed out outside sullivan turned to me glanced up the ladder sighed and rubbed his jaw he was a youngish hardcase sailor this one with a new england figurehead and a slantendicular way of looking at you at last he says hes mad sos she he thought for a moment it dont matter though much sane or silly drunk or dry hes the best d d skipper on this coast or any other you follow me i stood there nodding well and good says he youll be in mr combers watch just tail on to the rope and keep your eyes open and when the skipper starts talkin latin or whatever it is just shut up dye hear that was one piece of advice which i didnt need if id learned one thing about the balliol college it was that i had no wish to bandy scholarship with john charity spring or anything else for that matter by now you will have some idea of what life at sea was like when uncle harry was a boy i dont claim that it was typical ive sailed on many ships since the balliol college and never struck one like it thank gd but although it was often like cruising in an asylum ill say one thing that ship and crew were d d good at their work which was kidnapping niggers and selling them in the americas i can say this now looking back i was hardly in a position to appreciate their qualities after that first day of flogging and tea parties all i could think of then was that i was at the mercy of a dangerous maniac who was hl bent on a dangerous criminal expedition and i didnt know which to be more scared of him and his latin lectures or the business ahead but as usual after a day or two i settled down and if i didnt enjoy the first weeks of that voyage well ive known worse at least i had an idea of what i was in for or thought i had and could hope to see the end of it for the moment i must take care and so i studied to do my duties well which was easy enough and to avoid awakening the wrath of captain j c spring this last wasnt too difficult as it proved all i had to do in his presence was listen to his interminable prosing about thucydides and lucan and seneca whom he particularly admired for he dearly loved to display his learning at any rate he lost no opportunity of airing his latinity to comber and me usually at tea in his cabin with the placid mrs spring sitting by nodding sullivan was right of course they were both mad you had only to see them at the divine service which spring insisted on holding on sundays with the whole ships company drawn up and mrs spring pumping away at her german accordion while we sang hark the wild billow and afterwards spring would blast up prayers to the almighty demanding his blessing on our voyage and guidance in the tasks which our hands should find to do world without end amen i dont know what wilberforce would have made of that or my old friend john brown but the ships company took it straightfaced mind you they knew better than to do anything else they were as steady a crowd as ive ever seen afloat hard men and sober who didnt say much but did their work with a speed and efficiency that would have shamed an indiaman they were professionals of course and a good cut above your ordinary sheilback they respected spring and he them although when one of them a huge dago talked back to him spring smashed him senseless with his bare fists inside a minutea man twice his size and weight and another who stole spirits he flogged nearly to death blaspheming at every strokeyet a couple of hours later he was reading aloud to us from the aeneid mind you if it was a tolerable life it was damned dull and i found my thoughts turning increasingly to elspeth and other women as the days grew longer but it was elspeth mostly i found myself dreaming about her soft nakedness and that silky golden hair spffling down over my face and the perfume of her breath it was rough work i tell you knowing there wasnt a wench in a hundred miles nor likely to be and from that my thoughts would turn to morrison and how i might get my own back when the time came that at least was a more profitable field of speculation so we ran south and then south by east day after day and the weather got warmer and i shed my coat for a red striped jersey and white duck trousers with a big belt and a sheath knife as like ralph rover as ever was and the galley stopped serving duff and the caskwater got staler by the day and then one morning the wind had a new smell a heavy rotten air that comes from centuries of mangrove growing and decaying and that afternoon we sighted the low green bank far away to port that is the coast of africa we sighted sails too every now and then but never for long the balliol college as kirk told me drew wind like no other ship on the ocean the best fun was stand up in her forechains as she lay over one gunwale just above the crests thrashing along like billybedamned with mountains of canvas billowing above you dick dauntless would have loved it ill be bound and i enjoyed it myself or at night when you could lean over and watch the green fire round her bows and look up at that african sky that is purple and soft like no other in the world with the stars twinkling gd knows im no romantic adventurer but sometimes i remember and id like to run south again down africa with a fair wind in a private yacht with my youth half a dozen assorted parisian whores the finest of food and drink and perhaps a german band aye its a mans life that land we had sighted was the guinea coast which was of no interest to us because as kirk assured me it was played out for slaving the growing senthnent for abolition at home the increasing number of nations who joined with england in fighting the trade the close blockade of the coast by british and yankee patrol ships who burned the slave stations and pounced on the ships all these things were making life more difficult in the blackbird trade in the s in the old days the slavers had been able to put in openly and pick up their cargoes which had been collected by the native chiefs and herded into the great pens or barracoons at the river mouths now it wasnt so easy and speed and secrecy were the thing which was why fast ships like the balliol college were at an advantage and of course clever slavers like spring knew exactly where to go for the best blacks and which chiefs to deal with this was the great thing your slaver might easily dodge the patrols on the way in and out for it was a huge coast and the navy couldnt hope to watch it all but unless he had a good agent ashore and a native king who could keep up a supply of prime figs he was sunk its always amused me to listen to the psalmsmiting hypocrisy of niggerlovers at home and in the states who talk about white savages raping the coast and carrying poor black innocents into bondage why without the help of the blacks themselves wed not have been able to lift a single slave out of africa but i saw the coast with my own eyes you see which the holy henriettas didnt and i know that this old wives tale of a handful of white pirates mastering the country and kidnapping as they chose is all my eye we couldnt have stayed there five minutes if the nigger kings and warrior tribes hadnt been all for it and traded their captured enemies aye and their own folk too for guns and booze and brummagem rubbish why my pious acquaintances wont believe this i cant fathom they enslaved their own kind in mills and factories and mines and made em live in kennels that an alabama planter wouldnt have dreamed of putting a black into aye and our dear dead st william wilberforce cheered em on too weeping his pious old eyes out over niggers he had never seen and dning the soul of anyone who suggested it was a bit hard to make white infants pull coal sledges for twelve hours a day of course he knew where his living came from i dont doubt my point is if he and his kind did it to their people why should they suppose the black rulers were any different where their kinsfolk were concerned they make me sick with their pious humbug but its all by the way the main thing is that spring had a good black king to work with a horrible old creature named gezo who lorded it over the back country of dahomey now that the windward coast wasnt the place any more and the slavers were concentrating round the corner in the white mans grave stretches like dahomey and benin and the oil rivers were where the real high jinks were to be found the navy lay in all the time at places like whydah and lagos and your sharp captains like spring were as likely as not to use the lonelier rivers and lagoons where they could load up at their leisure provided no one spotted em coming in after our first landfall we bore away south and came eastabout to cape palmas where you could see the palm trees that gave it its name down by the waters edge and so along the ivory coast and gold coast past three points to whydah where we put into the open roads spring had the stars and stripes at the masthead and was safe enough for there wasnt a yankee in port there were two british naval slops but they wouldnt come near us this was where the slavers scored kirk told me the yanks wouldnt let any but their own navy search an american ship so our bluejackets would interfere only with portuguese and spaniards and so on we lay off looking at the long yellow beach with the factories and barracoons behind it and the huge rollers crashing on the sand and it was as hot as hells kitchen i watched the kites diving and snatching among the hundreds of small craft plying about between ships and shore and the great kroo canoes riding the surf and tried to fan away the stench that rose from all the filth rotting on the oily water i remembered what kinnie had said oh sailor beware of the bight o benin theres one as comes out for a hundred goes in you could smell the sickness on the wind and i wondered why spring who was talking at the rail with sullivan and scanning the shore with his glass had put in here but presently out comes a big kroo canoe with half a dozen niggers on board who hailed us and for the first time i heard that queer coast lingo which passes for a language from gambia to the cape hollo tommy rot cries spring where pedro blanco hollo sah sings out one of the kroos he lib for bonny no catch two three week why he no lib for come him sabby me make palaver plenty plenty nigras come me plenty good stuff what can do him lib bonny him say spagnole fella sanchez lib for dahomey ribber him make strong palaver no goddam bobbery you take tommy rot sah catch rum punch tiny tim plenty good fella all way ribber make good nigra palaver wid spagnole fella no inglish yankee gunboat spring cursed a bit at all this it seemed he had been hoping to meet one pedro blanco at whydah but the krooboy tommy rot was telling him instead he should make for a river where a spaniard named sanchez would supply him with slaves spring didnt like it too much blanco bobbery b d says he me want him make palaver king gezo one time palaver sawa sawa bawls the kroo sanchez lib for gezo lib for you all for true hed better growls spring all right tommy rot come aboard catch tiny tim ten fella lib for ship sabby we took on a dozen of the kroos grinning lively blacks who were great favourites among the coast skippers they were prime seamen but full of tricks and went by ridiculous names like rum punch blunderbuss jumping jack pot belly and mainsail each one had his forehead tattooed blue and his front teeth filed to points i thought they were cannibals but it seems they carried these marks so that they would be recognised as kroos and there fore wouldnt be taken as slaves with them aboard the balliol college stood out from whydah and after two days sniffing about out of sight of land we put in again farther east on to a long low rotting coastline of mangrove crawling out into the sea among the sunken sandbars it looked d d unpleasant to me but spring at the wheel brought her through into a lagoon beyond which lay a great delta of junglecovered islands and through these we came to what looked like a river mouth we inched through the shoals with everyone hauling and sweating at the sweeps and the kroos out ahead in canoes while three men either side swung the lead incessantly chanting three fathom two and a half two and jesus saves two and a half two and jesus saves three fathom and then round the first bend was a clearing and huge stockades between river and jungle and huts and presently a fat dago in a striped shirt with a hankie round his head and rings in his ears comes out in a small boat all smiles to meet a great storm of abuse from spring youre sanchez are you and where the hls my cargo your barracoons are empty you infernal scoundrel five hundred blacks i signed for with that thieving blackguard pedro blanco and look yonder he flung out an arm towards the empty stockades in which the only sign of life was a few figures idiling round a cookingfire d l a black hide in sight apart from your own well sir the dago was full of squealing apologies waving his arms and sweating my dear captain spring your fears are groundless within two days there will be a thousand head in the barracoons pedro blanco has taken order king gezo himself has come down country especially on your behalf my good sir he is at dogba with his people there has been much fighting i understand but all quiet now and many many nigras in his slave train strong young men hardy young women all the best for you captain he beamed around greasily youre sure says spring two days i want to be out of here in three and i want to see king gezo dyou hear sanchez spread his sticky hands there is no difficulty he will be coming west from dogba to apokoto tomorrow well growls spring quieting down well see whats he got for us sombas sombas fulani adja aiza yoruba egbo whatever the captain requires is that so well ill have six hundred then stead of five and no sickly niggers see theyre not going to be auctioned off with their arses stuffed with tar mind that i want sound stock sanchez took his leave full of good wishes and the balliol college was made fast as close to the bank as she could be warped men were sent aloft to hang her topmasts with leaves and creepers so that no patrol vessel out at sea might spot us and sanchez sent men aboard to unload the cargo this meant work for me making sure they pinched nothing and by the time the last bale was out and under the guard of sanchezs native soldiers i was running with sweat it was a hellish place green jungle all around and steam coming off the brown oily surface of the water as though it were a bath clouds of midges descended as soon as the sun dropped and the heat pressed in on you like a blanket so that all you could do was lie stifling with your chest heaving and the perspiration pouring off you three days spring had said it was a wonder to me that we had survived three hours that night spring called a council in his cabin of all his officers i was there as supercargo but you can be sure i was well out of the rnnning i dont suppose ive listened to a more interesting discussion in my life though unless it was grant and lee meeting in the farmhouse or lucan and my old pal cardigan clawing at each other like female cousins at balaclava certainly for technical knowledge springs little circle was an eyeopener six hundred says spring more than id bargained for itll mean fifteen inches for the bucks and i want two bucks for every female and no d d calves thats an inch under the old measure capn says kinnie might do for your guineas but its tight for dahomeys why theyre near as big as mandingos some of em an mandingos take your sixteen inches easy ive seen the portugoosers carry mandes in less than that says sullivan an had twenty in the hundred die on em likely no fear they put bucks in with wenches reckon they spend all their time on top of each other an save space that way spring didnt join in their laughter ill have no mixing of male and female he growled thats the surest way to trouble i know im surprised at you mr sullivan just a joke sir but i reckon sixteen inches if we dance em regular im obliged to you for your opinion dance or not they get fifteen inches and the women twelve kinnie shook his head that wont do sir these dahomey b s takes as much as the men any day sideways packins no use either the way theyre shaped put em head to toe theyll fit says sullivan youll lose ten mebbe more in the hundred says kinnie thats a ten thousand dollar loss easy these days ill have no loss cries spring ill not by gd well ship nothing thats not a and the b s will have fresh fruit with their pulse each day and be danced night and morning dye hear even so sir insisted kinnie twelve inches wont comber spoke up for the first time he was pale and sweating heavily mind you we all werebut he looked seedier than the others perhaps mr kinnie is right sir another inch for the women when i want your advice mr comber ill seek it snaps spring given your way youd give em two feet or fill the b y ship with pygmies i was thinking of the possible cost sir mr comber you lie springs scar was going pink i know you sir youre tender of black sheep i dont like unnecessary suffering and death sir its true then by gd you shouldnt have shipped on a slaver roars spring dnation dyou want to give em a berth apiece you think im cruising em round the b y lighthouse for a lark forty pieces a pound mr comber thats what an ordinary buck will fetch in havana these days perhaps more a thousand dollars a head now take note mr comber of what your extra inch can mean a forty thousand dollar loss for your owner have you thought of that sir i know sir says comber sticking to his guns nervously but forty dead gives you the same loss and dnation take you will you dispute with me springs eyes were blazing i was shipping black pigs while you were hanging at your mothers teat where you ought to be this minute dye think i dont take as much thought to have em hale and happy as you you impudent pup and for a better reason i dont get paid for flinging corpses overboard its dollars im saving not souls mr comber heaven help me i dont know why youre in this business you ought to be in the b y board of trade he sat glaring at comber who was silent and then turned to the others fifteen and twelve gentlemen is that clear kinnie sighed very good capn you know my views and i do mr kinnie and i respect them they are grounded in experience and commercial sense not in humanitarian claptrap picked up from scoundrels like tappan and garrison the genius of universal emancipation eh mr comber youll be quoting to me in a moment genius of illdigested crap dont contradict me sir i know your views which is why im at a loss to understand your following this calling you d d hypocrite you comber sat silent and spring went on you will take personal responsibility for the welfare of the females mr comber and they wont die sir we shall see to that no they wont die because like you and mr flashman yonder they havent read seneca so they dont know that qui mori didicit servire dedidicit if they did wed be out of business in a week i must say it sounded good sense to me and comber sat mumchance he was obviously thankful when the discussion turned to more immediate matters like the arrival of king gezo the next day at apokoto which lay some miles up river spring wanted to meet him for a palaver and said that kinnie and comber and i should come along with a dozen of the hands while sullivan began packing the first slaves who would be arriving at the barracoons i was all in favour of getting off the balliol college for a few hours but when we boarded the kroos big canoe at the bank next day i wasnt so sure kinnie was distributing arms to the hands a carbine and cutlass for each man and spring himself took me aside and presented me with a very longbarrelled pistol you know these says he and i told him i did it was one of the early colt revolvers the type you loaded with powder and ball down the muzzle very crude theyd look today but they were the wonder of the world then i picked up a dozen of these last winter in baltimore says he american army guns gezo would give his very throne for em and i intend to use them in driving a very special bargain with him are you a good shot well then you can demonstrate them for him get kinnie to give you a needle gun and cutlass as well dyou think well need them says he turned the pale eyes on me would you rather go unarmed into the presence of the most bloodthirsty savage in west africa says he no mr flashman i dont expect we shall need to use our weapon not for a moment but i fear the greeks even when im bearing gifts to em sir dyou see well that was sense no doubt of it so i took my needle carbine and bandolier buckled on the cutlass and stuck the colt in my belt and stood forth like pirate bill as we took our places in the canoe it looked like something from a pantomime every man with his hankie knotted round his head armed to the teeth some of em with rings in their ears and one even with a patch over his eye it struck mewhat would arnold say if he could look down now from his place at the right hand of god why there he would say is that worthy lad tom brown with his milkandwater wife in the west country giving bread and blankets to needy villagers who knuckle their heads and call him squire good for you brown and there too that noble boy scud east lording it over the sepoys for the glory of god and the profit of john company how eminently satisfactory and young brooke too a fearless lieutenant aboard his uncles frigate unspeakable what a credit to his old school aye as the twigs are bent so doth the trees grow but who is this consorting with pirates and preparing to ship hapless niggers into slavery with oaths on his lips i might have known it is the degraded flashman unhappy youth but just what i might have expected aye he would have rejoiced at the sight if theres one thing he and his hypocritical kind loved better than seeing virtue rewarded it was watching a black sheep going to the bad the worst of it is i wasnt there of my own free will not that you ever get credit for that these philosophical musings were disturbed by the tender scene between mr and mrs spring as he prepared to board the canoe unlike the rest of us he was dressed as usual dark jacket round hat neckcloth all trim how the devil he stood it in that steaming heat i cant figure well at the last minute mrs spring leans over the ships side crying to him to take his comforter against the chill of the night this in a country where the nights are boiling hot mark you dnation mutters spring but out he climbed and took the muffler crying goodbye my dear goodbye while the men in the canoe grinned and looked the other way he was in a fine temper as we shoved off kicking the backside of the cabin boy who had been ordered to come along and dning the eyes of the man at the tiller just as we pushed out into midstream came another diversion from the jungle on the laudward side of the stockade came a distant murmuring and confused sound as it grew nearer you could hear that it was a great shuffling and moaning with the occasional shout and crack of a whip and a dull chanting in cadence behind it its the slave train bawls spring and sure enough presently out of the jungle came the head of a long line of niggers yoked two by two with long poles shuffling along between their guards they were a startling sight for there were hundreds of em all naked their black bodies gleaming in the sunshine and their legs covered with splashes of mud up to the thigh they moaned and chanted as they walked big stalwart bucks with woolly heads jerking and stumbling for the yokes were at their necks and if a man checked or broke his stride he brought his yokefellow up short the sound they made was like a huge swarm of bees except when one of the guards big niggers in kilts and blouses carrying muskets brought his whip into play and the crack would be followed by a yelp of pain easy with those kurbashes dn you yelled spring thats money youre cutting at he leaned eagerly over the thwart surveying the caravan prime stuff pon my soul mr kinnie no refuse there somba and egbo unless im mistaken aye sir good cattle all of em says kinnie spring rubbed his hands and with many a last glance gave the order to give way the men at the sweeps hauled and the big canoe pushed forward up river mrs spring fluttering her handkerchief after us from the balliol colleges rail once round the first bend we were in another world on either side and overhead the jungle penned us in like a huge green tent muffling the cries and shrieks of the beasts and birds beyond it the heat was stifling and the oily brown water itself was so still that the plash of the sweeps and the dripping of moisture from the foliage sounded unnaturally loud the men pulling were drenched in sweat it was a labour to breathe the heavy damp air and kirk was panting under his breath as he accompanied the rowers with rock an roll rock an roll shenandoah sailor hoist her high hoist her dry rock an roll me over it must have been three or four hours with only a few brief rests before spring ordered a halt at a small clearing on the waters edge he consulted his watch and then his compass and announced very good mr kinnie well march from here no sense in risking our craft any nearer these gentlemen than we have to cover her up and fall in ashore we all piled out and the huge canoe was manhandled in under the mangroves which hung far out from the waters edge when she was hidden to springs satisfaction with a guard posted and be bad ensured that every man was properly armed and equipped be led the way along a track that seemed to me to run parallel with the river although the jungle was so thick you couldnt see a yard either side the air was alive with mosquitoes and in the shadows of that little green tunnel we stumbled along slapping and cursing it was a poor trail and when spring asked me what i thought of it i answered hlish he barked a laugh and says truer than you know its made of corpses some of the thousands that result from the dahomeyans yearly festival of human sacrifice they build up the path with em bound together with vines and cemented with mud he pointed to the dense thickets either side you wouldnt make a mile a day in there nothing but ooze and roots and rotting rubbish sodden wet but never a drop of water to be had you can die of thirst in that stuff you may guess how this cheered up the journey but there was worse ahead we smelled apokoto long before we saw it a rank wave of corruption that had us cursing and gagging it was a stink of death animal and vegetable that hit you like a hot fog and clung in your throat filthy black animals says spring the town itself was bigger than i had imagined a huge stockaded place crammed with those round grass lodges which are beehive shaped with an onion topknot all of it was filthy and oozeridden except for the central square which had been stamped flat and hard the whole population thousands of em were gathered round it stinking fit to knock you flat the worst of the reek came from a great building like a cottage at the far side which puzzled me at first because it seemed to be built of shiny brown stones which seemed impossible in this swampy jungle country kirk put me wise about that skulls says he and that is what they were thousands upon thousands of human skulls cemented together to make the deathhouse the ghastly place where the human sacrifices prisoners slaves criminals and the like were herded before execution even the ground directly before it was paved with skulls and the evil of the place hung over that great square like an invisible mist i seen as many as a hundred chopped up at one time before that deathhouse says kirk men women an kids all cut up together its like a mayday fair to these black heathen they seem amiable enough just now says i wishing to god i were back at the ship and he agreed that as a rule the apokoto folk were friendly to white traders provided they had trade goods and looked as though they could defend themselves it was plain to see now why spring had us heavily armed id have been happier with a park of artillery as well aye theyre savage swine if you dont mind your eye says kirk rolling his quid an gezos the most fearsome b d of the lot hes the man to set upon your landlord by gd an wait till you see his warriors youre a military man aint you well you never seen nothin like his bodyguard not nowheres you just watch out for em best fighters in africa they reckon an probably the ony nigger troops anywhere that march in step an they can move in dead silence when they wants to which most niggers cant oh theyre the beauties they are we had to wait near an hour before gezo put in an appearance in which time the sun got hotter the reek fouler and my mind uneasier ive stood before the face of savage kings often enough and hated every minute of it but gezos little homefromhome with its stench of death and corruption and its death house and its thousands of big ugly niggers to our little party was as nasty a hole as ive struck i found myself shivering in spite of the heat haze but took heart from the fact that all our fellows seemed quite composed leaning on their muskets chewing and spitting and winking at the niggers only spring seemed agitated but not with fear he fidgeted eagerly from time to time snorting with impatience at the delay and took a turn up and down then he would stop standing four square with his hands in his pockets head tilted back and you could feel he was working to contain himself as he waited suddenly everything went dead quiet the chatter of the crowd stopped everyone held their breaths and our fellows stiffened and shifted together utter silence lay over that vast place broken only by the distant jungle noises spring shrugged and muttered high time too come on you black b d the silence lasted perhaps a minute and then out of the street beside the death house scampered a score of little figures either dwarves or boys but you couldnt tell because they were grotesquely masked they swung rattles as they ran filling the air with their clatter and crying out a confused jumble of words in which i managed to pick out gezo gezo they scattered about the square prancing and rattling and questing and spring says to me chasing away bad spirits and finding the most propitious place for his majesty to plant his fat posterior aye as usual on the platform look yonder two warriors were carrying forward a great carved stool its feet shaped like massive human legs which they planked down on the dais of skulls before the death house the masked dancers closed in whisking away round the stool and then scattered back to the edge of the square as they fell silent a drum began to beat from beyond the death house a steady marching thump that grew louder and louder and the crowd began to take it up stamping and clapping in unison and emitting a wordless grunt of ayuh ayuh while they swayed to the rhythm now youll open your eyes says kirk in my ear and as he said it i saw emerging from the street by the death house a double file of warriors swinging along in time to the steady cadence of the drum while the chanting grew louder ha cries spring eagerly at last they marched out either side of the square in two long lines lithe splendid figures swaying as they marched and it was something in the manner of that swaying that struck me as odd i stared harder and got the surprise of my life the warriors were all women and such women they must have been close on a mans height fine strapping creatures black as night and smart as guardsmen i gaped at the leading one on the right as she approached she came sashaying along looking straight before her a great ebony juno naked to the little blue kilt at her waist with a long stabbing spear in one hand and a huge cleaver in her belt the only other things she wore were a broad collar of beadwork tight round her throat and a white turban over her hair and as she passed in front of us i noticed that at her girdle there hung two skulls and a collection of what looked like lions claws the others who followed her were the same save that instead of turbans they wore their hair coiled together and tied with ropes of beads but each one carried a spear some had bows and quivers of arrows and one or two even had muskets not all were as tall as the leader but i never saw anything on horse guards that looked as welldrilled and handsome or as frighteningly dangerous none o your sogers could throw chests like them says kirk licking his lips and then i felt springs hand grip my wrist to my surprise his pale eyes were shining with excitement and i thought well you old lecher no wonder you left mrs spring at home this trip he pointed at the black glistening line as they marched past dyou realise what youre seeing flashman says he do you women warriors amazons the kind of whom herodotus wrote but he knew nothing of the reality look at them man did you ever see such a sight well they were likely big wenches certainly and they bounced along very jolly but when i watch a wobbling buttock i prefer it to be unobscured by a dangling skull and im no hand with women who look as though theyd rather kill and eat me than grapple in the grass but spring was all for em his voice was husky as he watched dyou know what they call themselves mazangu the fair ones you see how every company leader wears a spotless turban they call em amodozo doesnt that name bring back an echo from your schooldays think man who was the leader of the amazons in africa medusa amodozo medusa mazangu amazons his face was alive with a delight id never seen before these are the cream of the dahomeyan army the picked bodyguard of the king every voyage ive made i vowed id bring back half a dozen of them but ive never been able to make this black satan part with even one hell part this time though he rounded on me youve a gift of languages have you not on this voyage well learn it well find out everything there is to know about em study them their history their customs the real amazons by the holy ill make those smug halfeducated balliol sonsofb s sit up wont i though theyll find out what real scholarship is i suppose ive been in some queer places with some d d odd fellows but nothing queerer than watching those big black fighting sluts march by while a classicallyeducated slaver skipper babbled to me about anthropological research i thought it had been lust that excited him at the sight of all those black boobies quivering and it was lust at that but it was scholarly not carnal well if he thought i was going to huddle up with those female baboons studying present infinitives he was dead wrong theyve got both tits i said thought amazons only had one he snarled his contempt even walter raleigh knew better than that but he was wrong about what mattered so was lopez vaz so was herodotus not south america not scythia here africa i shall make a name a great name with my work on these women despise john charity spring will they he was shouting again not that anyone could hear much above that drumming ill show them by gd i will well keep one perhaps two the others will fetch a handy price in havana what think of the money theyll pay for black fighting women in new orleans i could get two no three thousand dollars a head for creatures like those i never interrupt an enthusiast especially one with a temper like a wild dogs presently he fell silent but he never took his eyes off those women who were halted now in a great circle round the square two other companies of them had filed in and taken station close to the death house and now in their wake came a gross black figure under a striped umbrella at the sight of whom they raised their spears in salute and stamped while the mob round the square roared a welcome king gezo of dahomey was bitter ugly even by nigger standards he must have weighed twenty stone with a massive belly hanging over his kilt of animal tails and huge shoulders inside his scarlet cape he had a kind of wicker hat on his head and under it was a face that would have shamed a gorilla huge flat nose pocked cheeks little yellow eyes and big yellow teeth he waddled to his stool plumped down and opened the palaver in a croaking voice that carried harshly all over the square at first we were ignored although he could be seen squinting our way every now and then he palavered with elders of the town and then with several folk who were summoned forward from the crowd one of them evidently displeased him because he suddenly screamed an order and two of the amazons beside his throne stepped forward drawing their cleavers and without ceremony laid into the victim right and left and literally slashed him to pieces the crowd holloed like mad gezo surged about on his stool and those two harpies hacked away at the dismembered corpse spattering the skull platform with blood when they were done slaves came forward to clear up they had to sweep what was left of the body off the stage no doubt this was for our benefit for we were now beckoned forward gezo was even more horrifying at close range with those yellow eyeballs rolling at you but he was civil enough to spring laughing hoarsely and chattering at him through one of his officials who spoke fair coast english they palavered for a while about the slaves who had been sent down to our ship and then gezo in high good humour ordered stools to be set for all our party and we squatted down at the edge of the dais while servants brought dishes of food i expected it would turn my stomach but it was not bad stew and fruit and native bread and a beer that was powerful and not unlike a german lager gezo gorged and talked spluttering out food as he squealed and barked at spring and occasionally drinking beer from a gaudy china mug on which was inscribed of all things a present for a good boy from scarborough i remember thinking how odd it was that this shoddy article should obviously be a prized possession while the local cups from which we drank were really fine pieces of metal beautifully carved all told it was as pleasant a meal as one could have in the presence of a terrifying ogre with the blood still sticky before his feet and the foul stench of the death house all around another distraction was the amazons who ringed the dais one of the whiteturbanned leaders stood close by me and i took close stock of her she had the flat face broad nose and thick lips usual on this part of the coast but with that splendid shape and a fine black satin thigh thrust out and almost touching me as i sat i thought by gum one could do worse they had men only once a year spring had said and i decided that being the man would be interesting work if you survived it i gave her a wink and the sullen face never altered but a moment later she raised the fly whisk that dangled from her wrist and brushed away an insect buzzing round my head i could see she fancied me black or white savage or duchess theyre all alike meanwhile the meal finished and presently gezo beckoned spring to draw his stool closer they grunted away at each other through the interpreter and i heard spring suggest the purchase of six of the amazon women this threw gezo into a great passion but spring let it rage and then whispered to the interpreter again there was much conferring and gezo barked and screamed but less loud each time i thought and at last spring turned to me show him your pistol says he and i handed it over gezo pawed over it excitedly rasping questions at spring and finally it was given back to me and spring says fire it for him all five shots as fast as you can into the side of the death house will do i stood up all eyes on me gezo chattering and bouncing up and down on his stool i drew a bead on one of the skull bricks and fired it kicked like blazes but i thumbed back the hammer smartly and loosed off the next four shots in quick time five gaping holes were smashed in the wall with splinters flying all over the place the mob roared gezo beat his fists on his knees with excitement and even the amazons put up their knuckles to their mouths my own pipseypopsey with the white turban stared at me roundeyed then spring called up one of our seamen who carried a case and when he opened it there were the five other colt pistols gezo slobbered and squealed at the sight of them but spring wouldnt hand them over he had more guts than id have had with that bloodstained maniac mowing and yelling at me they whispered away again and then gezo rolled his eyes shiftylike at the amazons summoned my girl and mumbled orders to her she didnt bat an eyelid but snapped a command to six of her wenches they grounded their spears like guardsmen put by their cleavers and then stood forward gezo yammered at them one of them said something back gezo yelled at them and from the ranks of all the other amazons there was something like a gasp and a murmur which rose to a growl they didnt like what was happening and gezo had to stand up and bawl at them until they were quiet i didnt like the look of this you could feel the anger and hatred welling up all round us but spring just snapped shut the case handed it to gezo and then turned to us mr kinnie says he the palaver is finished form up round these six women were getting out of here then he tipped his hat to gezo who was sitting back on his stool looking d d peevish and clutching his case our fellows had turned to face the crowd who were milling closer beyond the ranks of the amazons it was beginning to look ugly but spring just marched ahead bulldog fashion the amazons stepped back smartly to let him go and with our six black beauties in our midst we followed after two of the girls hesitated looking round over their shoulders but my amazon lady standing beside gezos throne shouted to them and they dropped their heads meekly and marched on with us by jove it was a long minutes walk to the gate of the stockade through the double file of those black amazon furies their faces sullen with anger and grief at the sale of their fellows while the great crowd of townsfolk roared in protest behind them but the discipline of those women warriors was like iron the king had said and that was that mind you if gezo had run for president at that moment he wouldnt have had my money on him but even so no one in that whole town was bold enough to gainsay him we were moving d d smartly by the time we reached the stockade a tight knot of men with our needle guns at the ready and the women being jostled along in the middle spring was first at the gate where he stopped and hurried us through i stood close by him his jaw was tight and he was as near scared as i ever saw him hurry b t you he shouted dn that gezo to haggle so longs and dn those women i didnt think theyd raise such a bother about the business straight ahead mr kinnie and keep those six sluts close dyou hear then to me come on wait say i it was instinctive believe me id no wish to linger not with that growling mob behind me but id noticed the little ferrety cabin boy was missing where the hl is he back there snaps spring hes senseless with nigger beer gezo wanted him wanted a white slave come on dn you will you stand there all day im not shocked easy but that took me flat aback for about the tenth part of an instant if spring wanted to trade his cabin boy to a nigger king it was all one to me i was into the fringe of the jungle a yard ahead of him and then we were running with the others in front of us the amazons being driven along one of em wailing already behind us the hubbub of the town was cut off by the dense foliage we hustled down the path but you dont run far in that climate and soon we had to slow down to a trot well enough i think says spring he stopped for a moment to listen but there was nothing except the jungle noises and the sobbing of our own breathing i didnt like that says he addressing no one in particular by gd i didnt if id known they were so d d jealous of their fighting wenches phew its the last time i deal with gezo though quid violentius aure tyranni for a moment id a notion he would change his mind and keep the pistols which would have been short shrift for us he laughed and the mad pale eyes blinked on there mr kinnie mr comber keep a sharp eye on the prisoners back to that boat in double time my lads before his majesty thinks better of his bargain we pushed on down the narrow trail and we must have been halfway to the river when spring stopped again listening i strained my ears nothing just the chickering of the forest beasts and birds spring called to the fellows to be quiet and we all listened spring turned his head from side to side and then i heard kirk say wot the hl we standing here for if theres anything to hear then the sooner were in that boat the better theres nuthin behind us says another uneasily silence snaps spring he was peering through the foliage at the side of the path i found my heart racing and not just with exertion if we were pursued they couldnt have outflanked us through that swamp and jungle surely we would have heard them and then i remembered kirk saying they can move in dead silence when they wants to for gds sake i whispered to spring lets get on he ignored me mr kinnie he called softly dyou hear anything to port no capn sings back kinnie theres noth the end of that word was a horrid scream in terror i stared down the path and saw kinnie stagger clawing at the shaft in his throat before tumbling headlong into the mangrove someone yelled a musket banged and then spring was thrusting forward bawling run for it keep on the path for your lives run like hl his order was wasted on mei was running before he had started thinking even someone screamed in front of me and a black shadow leaped on to the path it was an amazon swinging a machete one of the seamen caught it on his musket and dashed the butt into her face she went down shrieking and as i leaped over her my foot landed on her bare flesh i stumbled but went careering on the vision of those two naked black fiends slashing a man to death was before my eyes and the crash of shots and yelling behind me urged me on i fairly flew along that trail and by gum i wasnt alone they say sailors are poor runners but that landing party from the balliol college could move when they wanted to we stampeded along that twisting path elbowing each other aside in our panic to get away from the horror in the jungle on either side they were screaming their war cries now those terrible black sows once a spear flashed past in front of my face and i believe a couple of arrows buzzed above our heads and then i tripped and fell headlong with the others trampling over me i thought i was done for but when i scrambled to my feet i saw we were on the edge of the clearing by the river the fleetest of our party was tearing aside the branches where our canoe was hidden the man who had been left on guard was on one knee aiming his musket it banged and i turned to see an amazon fall shrieking not ten yards from me her cleaver bouncing along to land at my feet instinctively i grabbed it and then a flying body knocked me sideways some of our fellows were firing from the waters edge as i scrambled up i saw an amazon on her knees clutching her side with one hand as she tried vainly to hurl her spear with the other close by me was spring bawling like a madman he had his pepperpot revolver in one hand firing back towards the path and by gd with the other he was trying to drag along one of the amazons hed bought the mans dedication to scholarly research was incredible they were leaping through the edge of the jungle now howling black devils and if you believe that even the worst of young women has charms you are in error as i fled for the boat i saw the man who had been on guard spin round with an arrow in his shoulder before he could regain his feet three of them were on him and while two held him down throat and ankle the third carefully pulled up his shirt and with the utmost delicacy disembowelled him with her machete then i was at the boat a needle gun was in my hands and i was firing at another who was leaping across the clearing she went cartwheeling into the river and then spring was beside me dashing down his empty gun and drawing his cutlass shove off he bawled and i made a leap for the thwart missed and came down in the shallows spring jumped over me and i felt someone drag me upright it was comber for a moment we were shoulder to shoulder and then an amazon was on us her spear was back to thrust into my breast and in that split second i saw it was my whiteturbanned wench of the fly whisk her teeth bared in a ghastly grin and you may think me fanciful but ill swear she recognised me for she hesitated an instant swung her point away from me and drove it to the haft into combers side and as i threw myself headlong over the gunwale the ridiculous thought flashed through my mind bonny black cavalry whiskers they cant resist em dnation spring was roaring i lost that confounded slut and as the boat shot away from the bank he seized a needle gun almost crying with rage and blazed away i pulled myself up by the thwart and the first thing i saw was a bloody hand gripping the edge of the boat it was comber clinging on for dear life as we wallowed out into the stream with the dark red blood staining the water around him for a second i wondered whether i should try to haul him in or bash his fingers loose for he was encumbering our way but then spring had leaned over and with one titanic heave had dragged him over the thwart we were ten yards from the bank and it was lined with shrieking black women hurling their spears bending their bows leaping up and down in a frenzy of rage why none of them took to the water after us i dont know unless it was fear of crocodiles we cowered down to escape their missiles and then a voice was screaming from the bank help capn capn dont leave me for jesus sake capn save me it was kirk he was in the shallows being dragged back by half a dozen of those black witches they hauled him on to the bank screaming and laughing while we drifted out into midstream some bold idiot had seized a sweep and comber bleeding like a butchered calf was crying help him sir we must turn back we must save him spring thrust him away threw himself on to the sweep with the sailor and in spite of the arrows that whistled over the boat the two of them managed to drive us still farther away towards the opposite mangrove shore we were beyond the spears now and presently the arrows began to fall short although one of the last to reach the boat struck clean through the hand of the seaman at the oar pinning him to the timber spring wrenched it clear and the fellow writhed away clutching his wound and then holy joe comber was at it again turn back sir we cant leave kirk behind cant we by gd growls spring you just watch me mister if the b d cant run thats his lookout spoken like a man captain thinks i give me a leader you can trust any day and even comber his face contorted with pain could see it was no go they were swarming on the bank and had kirk spreadeagled we could see them wrenching his clothes off squealing with laughter while close by a couple of them had even started kindling a fire they were smart housewifely lasses those all right kirk was yelling blue murder and as we watched my girl in the white turban knelt down beside him and suddenly his voice rose into a horrible bloodchilling shriek several of the amazons prancing on the bank indicated to us by obscene gestures what she was doing to him comber groaned and began to spew and spring swearing like a lunatic was fumbling to load one of the needle guns he bawled to the rest of us to follow suit and we banged away at them for a moment but it was too dangerous to linger and with kirks screams and the gloating shrieks of those shed ls drifting downstream after us we manned the sweeps and rowed for all we were worth with the current to help us we drove along hard and i was finally able to choke down my panic and thank my stars for another delivery of the half dozen of us in the boat i was the only one without even a scratch spring had a machete cut on his left arm but not a deep one and the others wounds were mild enough except for combers but if spring was only slightly injured in the flesh his ambition had taken a nasty jar he d d gezos eyes for a treacherous hound and called the amazons things that would have made a marine blush but his chief fury voiced over and over again as we rowed downstream was i lost that black slut all these years and i lost the sow even that single one she would have done my gd i could have used that woman i was pondering that i could have used my whiteturbanned hebe for a different and less academic purposebut then i thought of kirk and discovered that any tendre i might have cherished for the lady had died and as i think back now strapping lass though she was i cant say that the old flame rekindles she was a shrew if ever i saw one with the danger safely past i was soon in good fettle again as ive said before theres nothing so cheering as surviving a peril in which companions have perished and our losses had been heavy five men had died in our hasty retreat from apokoto apart from kinnie kirk and the guard on the boat two others had been cut down by amazons on the path and of course the cabin boy had been left behind deliberately by spring not that he was any great loss for the rest it looked as though comber was a goner my wench had shovelled her spear well in under his short ribs leaving a hole like a hatchway murphy the surgeon when he had sobered up announced that there was nothing he could do but clean and stitch it which he did but for what may have come adrift inside says he i cant answer so they put comber in his berth halfdead with mrs spring to nurse him thatll carry the poor sd off even if his wound doesnt says murphy then we went to work there were upwards of a thousand niggers in the barracoons on the morning after our apokoto exploit and spring was in a sweat to get our cargo loaded and away it was the possibility of naval patrols sniffing us out that worried him sullivans suggestion that gezo might take it into his head to come down and make a clean sweep of us he dismissed out of hand as spring saw it the amazons and not gezo had been responsible for the attack now they had rescued their six wenches and gezo still had his pistols he wouldnt want to offend us further he was right sanchez who was an astonishing good plucked un for a dago actually went up to talk to gezo a day later to see that all was well and found the black rascal full of alarm in case spring was going to wash his hands of the dahomey trade sanchez reassured him and dropped a hint that if gezo would even now part with an amazon it would make for friendly relations but gezo was too windy of provoking his bodyguard he just clutched his case of pistols and begged sanchez to tell spring that he was still his friend sawa sawa and hoped they would continue to do good business together all this mark you while kirk and one of the men whod been caught on the path were strung up in front of the death house with those black shefiends working on them before a cheering crowd they were still alive sanchez said but you wouldnt have known they were human beings so honour was satisfied both sides but spring and sanchez took no chances the balliol colleges nets were rigged and her twelve and ninepounders shotted while sanchezs pickets guarded the jungle trails and the river all remained peaceful however and the business of loading the slaves went ahead undisturbed with our second mate dead and our third apparently dying i found myself having to work for a living even with men who knew their business as well as these its no easy matter to pack six hundred terrified stupid niggers into a slave deck its worse than putting irish infantry into a troopship first spring and murphy went through the barracoons picking out the likeliest bucks and wenches they were penned up in batches of a hundred men and women separate a great mass of smelling heaving black bodies all stark naked squatting and lying and moaning the sound was like a great wailing hum and it never stopped day or night except when the tubs of burgoo were shoved into the pens and they shut up long enough to empty the gourds which were passed round among them what astonished me was that spring and murphy were able to walk in among them as though they were tame beasts just the two of them in that mass of cowed miserable humanity with a couple of black guards jerking out the ones selected if theyd had a spark of spirit the niggers could have torn them limb from limb but they just sat helpless and mumbling i thought of the amazons and wondered what changed people from brave reckless savages into dumb resigned animals apparently its always the way on the coast sullivan told me he reckoned it was the knowledge that they were going to be slaves but that being brainless brutes they never thought of doing anything about it those who were selected were herded out of the barracoons into a long railed place like a sheep pen all jammed together with three black guards either side armed with whips and pistols there was a narrow gate at the other end just wide enough to let one slave through at a time and the two biggest guards were stationed there as each nigger emerged they seized him and flung him face down beside an iron brazier full of glowing coals and two of sanchezs dago pals clapped a branding iron on his shoulder he would squeal like blazes and the niggers in the pen would try to crowd back out the other end but the guards lashed them on and another would be hauled out and branded the same way the screaming and weeping in the pen was something to hear everyone who could was on hand to watch and there was much merriment at the antics of the niggers blubbering before they were burned and hopping and squealing afterwards spring was there for the branding of the wenches to see that it was done lightly just below the ankle on the inside in the case of the betterlooking ones who the d l wants a young wench with scars on her backside he growled even if we aint selling fancies the less marking the better the legrees tell me the southern ladies dont want even their field women burned these days so have a care with those irons you two and you doctor slap on that grease with a will this was to murphy who sat beyond the brazier with a huge tub of lard between his feet as each branded nigger was pulled forward one of the black guards would thrust the burned shoulder or ankle under murphys nose he would take a good look at it and then slap a handful of the lard on the wound crying either theres for you sambo or thatll pretty you up acushla he was half full of booze as usual and from time to time would apply himself to his bottle and then cry encouragement to the niggers as they came through or break into a snatch of raucous song i can see him now swaying on his stool red face glistening shirt hanging open over the red furze on his chest plastering on the grease with his great freckled hand and chanting although with lavish kindness the gifts of good are strewn the heathen in his blindness bows down to wood and stoone when he was done with them the heathen were pushed through a series of wooden frames set up close by the balliol colleges gangplanks one was six feet by two another slightly smaller and a third smaller still by means of these the slaves were sized and sent up one of three gangplanks accordingly the biggest ones were for the bottom of the slave deck the middlesized for the first tier of shelves and the smallest for the top tier but care was taken to separate men and women a tall wench or a little chap could have got in among the wrong sex and spring wouldnt have that he insisted that the women should be berthed forward of the first bulkhead and the men all aft of it and since they would be chained up they wouldnt be able to get up to high jinks i didnt see why they shouldnt myself but spring had his own reasons no doubt once up the planks though the really hard work began i didnt know much about it but i had to work with the hands who stowed the slaves and i soon picked up the hang of it as each slave was pushed down the hatch he was seized by a waiting seaman and forced to lie down on the deck in his allotted place head towards the side of the ship feet towards the centre until both sides of the deck were lined with them each man had to go in a space six feet by fifteen inches and now i saw why there had been so much argument over that extra inch if they were jammed up tight or made to lie on their right sides you could get ever so many more in this was the hard part for the slaves were terrified stupid and in pain from their branding they wriggled and squirmed on the deck and wouldnt be still and the hands had to knock them about or lay into the most imruly ones with a ropes end one huge buck bawling and with tears streaming down his face made a dash for the hatch but sullivan knocked him flat with a handspike threw him into place and terrified the others by shaking a catoninetails at them to let them see what they might hope to get if they misbehaved when they were placed a shackle was clapped round each right ankle and a long chain threaded through it until they were all stowed when the chain was made fast to the bulkheads at either end soon there were four lines of niggers flat on the deck with a space up the middle between them so that the seamen could stand there to pack the later arrivals into the shelves its not that im an abolitionist by any means but by the end of that day id had my bellyful of slaving the reek of those musky bodies in that deck was abominable the heat and stench grew by the hour until youd have wondered that anything could survive down there they howled and blubbered and we were fagged out with grabbing brown limbs and tugging and shoving and mudging them up with our feet to get the brutes to lie close they fouled themselves where they lay and before the job was half done the filth was indescribable we had to escape to the deck every half hour to souse ourselves with salt water and drink great draughts of orange juice before descending into that fearful pit again and wrestle again with wriggling black bodies that stunk and sweated and went everywhere but where you wanted them when it was finally done and sullivan ordered all hands on deck we climbed out dead beat ready to flop down anywhere and go to sleep but not with john charity spring about he must go down to inspect and count the rows and kick a black body into place here and tug another one there before he was satisfied he d d our eyes for letting em soil the deck and ordered the whole place hosed down niggers and all they dried where they lay in no time of course and the steam came out of the hatches like smoke i looked down at it just before the hatch gratings went on and it was an indiscribable sight row upon row of black bodies packed like cigars in a box naked and gleaming the dark mass striped with glittering dots of light where the eyes rolled in the sooty faces the crying and moaning and whimpering blended into a miserable anthem that ill never forget with the clanking of the chains and the rustle of hundreds of incessantly stirring bodies and the horrible smell of musk and foulness and burned flesh my stomach doesnt turn easy but i was sickened if it had been left to me then and there id have let em go the whole boiling of them back to their lousy jungle no doubt its a deplorable weakness in my character but this kind of raw work was a thought too much for me mind you sit me down in my club or at home and say here flash theres twenty thou for you if youll say aye to a cargo of black ivory going over the middle passage and i aint saying ild turn you down nor do i flinch when someone whips a black behind or claps on a brand but enoughs enough and when youve looked into the hold of a newladen slaver for the first time you know what hell is like i mentioned this to sullivan and he spat you think thats bell do you first blackbird voyage i made as a young hand we took three hundred coons from the gallinas and we were setting out for rio when a limey sloop tacks on to us it was a portuguese flag we carried with a yallerblack dago skipper in command he saw sure enough they were going to take us he looked at me with his head on one side can you guess what that christian angolese sonofab h did gwan have a guess i said i had heard of slave cargoes being thrown overboard so that when the navy came up all the evidence had gone sullivan laughed there wasnt time for that our skipper figures but we were carryin palm oil as well as slaves and had a good deal of trade powder left over so he set the ship on fire an we took to the boats navy couldnt get near her so she just burned out an sank with three hundred niggers aboard i wouldnt care to guess how many of em were lucky enough to drown he laughed again without any mirth at all and you think thats hell down there i guess you also think that mr j c spring is a real tough skipper well i did and if there were bigger swine afloat in the earlies im only glad i never met them but sullivans story gave me the shudders all right for it reminded me that the next stage of our voyage was the notorious middle passage with all the dangers of pursuit and capture to say nothing of hurricane and shipwreck dyou think theres any chance of of that happening with us says i and sullivan snorted ill say this for spring he dont lose ships or cargoes he believes in keeping the sharks hungry any navy coaster that comes up with us is in for a hl of a chase lessn shes a steamer an catches us in a flat calm here was a fearful thought what then says i then why we fight her says he and left me prey to a nausea that had nothing to do with the heat or the slavestench or my weariness having lately been at grips with fighting nigger women i could see myself shortly assisting in a runningseabattle against the royal navy just what was needed to liven up the cruise and by jove it nearly came to that too and on our very first hour out from that abominable coast we dropped down river early the next morning to catch the ebb tide i believe and it seemed a piece of lunacy to me to try those shoals and islands in the half light however spring knew his business he took the wheel himself and with only the foretopsail spread we drifted slowly between the green banks the leadsmen chanting quietly and the first hint of dawn beginning to lighten the sky over the black jungle mass astern it was a queer eery business gliding so silently along with only the mumble of the slaves the creak of rope and timber and the gurgle of water to break the stillness and then we were clear of the last banks and the sun shot a great beam of light ahead of us across the placid surface of the sea it was all very beautiful in its way but just as sullivan was roaring the watch up to set more sail the idyll was marred by the appearance round the southern headland of a small waspishlooking vessel standing slowly out on a course parallel to our own it happened that i saw her first and drew my commanders attention to her with a sailorlike hail of jesus look at that spring just stared for a moment and then says foresail and maintopsl mr sullivan before getting his glass out for a look white ensn says he presently without any emotion take a look mister twentygun sloop id say sullivan agreed and while my bowels did the polka the two of them just stood and watched her as though shed been a pleasure steamer i didnt know much about sailing as youre aware but even i could see that she was moving more briskly than we were that there was nothing but light airs stirring the surface and that she wasnt more than two miles away it looked to me as though the balliol colleges voyage was over before it had rightly begun which merely shows how ignorant i was for an hour while my gorge rose steadily we watched her we were doing no more than creep out from the coast and the sioop did the same only a little faster and converging gradually all the time on our course i could see that eventually we would be bound to meet if we held our courses and i had an idea that in light wind the sailing advantage would be all with the smaller vessel but spring seemed unconcerned from time to time he would turn and survey the coast behind us and the sky converse shortly with sullivan and then go back to watching the sloop with his hands stuck deep in his pockets he was waiting confidently i now know for a wind and he got it just when i had finally given up all hope the sails flapped spring barked an order and at a shout from sullivan the hands were racing aloft in the same moment the boom of a shot sounded over the water and a pillar of spray rose out of the sea a few hundred yards from our port bow burn your powder you useless son of a geordie coaster skipper you bawls spring from the wheel look alive mr sullivan and he sent out a perfect volley of orders as the balliol college heeled gently and lifted to the first puffs of wind and then i found myself tailing on a rope with the others hauling for dear life and wondering what the d l would happen next if i were a nautical man no doubt i could tell you but im not thank god the mysteries of ship handling are as obscure to me today as they were fifty years ago if i were bosun mchearty i daresay i could describe how we jibed with our futtock gansls clewed up to the orlop bitts and weathered her dye see with a lee helm and all plain sail in the bilges burn me buttocks as it was i just stuck like a shadow to a big portugal nigger of the deck watch called lord peabody and tailed on behind him with the pulleyhauley while spring and sullivan bawled their jargon the men aloft threw themselves about like acrobats and the balliol college began to surge forward at greater speed there was another shot from the sloop and an ironic cheer from our fellows why i couldnt imagine for our pursuer was soon cracking along famously and i could make out her ensign plainly and the figures on her deck all far too close for comfort i saw in the intervals of scampering about after peabody and hauling on the ropes that she would be able to fire in earnest soon and i was just commending my soul to god and wondering if i could turn queens evidence when spring let loose another volley of orders there was a tremendous cracking and bellying of sails overhead and the balliol college seemed to spin round on her heel plunge over with a lurch that brought my breakfast up and then go bowling away across the track of the sloop i dont understand it of course but in the next hour spring executed a similar manoeuvre half a dozen times while the wind freshened and although the sloop copied our movements so far as i could see she always somehow finished up farther away no doubt any yachtsman could explain it the hands cheered and laughed although you could hardly hear them for the fearful howling that was coming from below decks where the slaves were spewing and yelling in terror at the bucketing of the ship and then we were standing out to sea again and the sloop was away off our quarter still flying along but making no headway at all only then did spring hand over the wheel and come to the stern rail where he delivered a catechism to the distant navy vessel calling them lubberly sons of dogs and shaking his fist at them theres where the taxpayers money goes he roared thats whats supposed to defend us against the french look at them i could sail rings round em in a blackwall coal lighter quo quo scelesti ruitis eh i tell you mr sullivan a crew of all souls dons could do better on a raft what the blazes are they letting into the navy these days hell be some rumsoaked shorthaul pensioner no doubt either that or a beardless brat with a father in the lords and some ladylike mama whoring round the admiralty my stars wouldnt i like to put them all to sea under bully waterman or let em learn their trade in an opium clipper with a down east yankee skipper and a scotch owner you hear that you port mahon bumboatman you you ought to bean the beach it was fine stuff but wasted since the sloop was miles away by afternoon she was just a speck on the horizon and the coast of africa had vanished behind us the ease of our escape i was told all came of spring knowing his weather for standing away from the slave coast was evidently a most unchancy business and many slavers had been caught in the calms that so often beset them there but some of the deltas and river mouths could be relied on to give you wind and spring knew all about this it was also true that he was a firstrate seaman with a prime crew and together they were probably a match for anything we did sight another patrol vessel on the following day but we were tearing along at such a rate that she never came near us and spring didnt even interrupt his dinner it was blowing fairly stiffish now and the slaves had an abominable time for the first few days they just lay howling and weeping in their seasickness but spring insisted that the huge coppers and tubs in which their pulse porridge was made should be kept at work and by flogging one of the bucks down on the slave deck in the sight of his fellows he terrified them into eating ill as they were murphy was constantly at work especially among the women to make sure that none died and twice a day the hoses were turned on to scour out the filth which would otherwise have bred an epidemic in no time about the fourth day the wind dropped the slaves stopped spewing and the cooks who tended the mess tubs became the hardestworked men on the ship one thing the balliol college didnt stint to its human cargo and that was food which was good business of course spring also insisted that lime juice be issued and the slaves forced to drink it they hated it but when they saw it was that or the cat they swilled it down fast enough they were still in a fearful funk of course since they had no idea of what the ocean was like and couldnt seem to get used to the rolling of the ship when they werent eating or sleeping they just lay there in their long black rows wailing and rolling their eyes like frightened sheep there was no spirit in them at all and i began to see why the slavers thought of them not as humans but as animals every day they went through a curious exercise which was called dancing they were brought up on deck in batches and forced to caper about for half an hour leaping up and down and trotting round the deck this of course was just to keep them in trim they didnt like that either at first and we had to smarten them with ropes ends to get them moving but after the first few times they began to enjoy it and it was the most ludicrous sight to see them skipping and shuffling round the deck clapping their hands and even crooning to themselves the bolder spirits grinning and rolling their eyes they were just like children forgetting the misery of their condition and skylarking about quite delighted if the hands cried encouragement to them one of the fellows had a fiddle on which he would play jigs and reels and the niggers would try to outdo each other in capering to the music the men got over their fears faster than the women who danced with much less jollity although everyone on the ship was always on hand to watch them you couldnt have called any of em pretty with their pug faces and great woolly mops of hair but they had fine shapely bodies and none of us had seen a proper woman for near on six weeks the sight of those naked black bodies shuffling and swaying got me into a fever the first time i saw it and the others were the same licking their lips and muttering when was murphy the surgeon going to set about his business i understood what this meant when we were all ordered to report and strip down for murphy in his berth where he examined us carefully to see that none of us had pox or crabs or yaws or any of the interesting diseases that wicked saiormen are prone to when we were pronounced clean spring had us each pick out a black wench i thought this was by way of seamans comforts but it turned out that the more black wenches who could be got pregnant by white men the better the traders liked it for they would produce mulatto children who being halfwhite were smarter and more valuable than pure blacks the cuban dealers trusted spring and if he could guarantee that all his female slaves had been bulled by his crew it would add to their price i want all these wenches pupped says he but youll do it decently dyou hear salvo pudore in your quarters ill not have mrs spring offended it may sound like just the kind of holiday for a fellow like me but it was no great fun as it turned out i picked out a likely enough big wench jet black and the liveliest dancer of the lot but she knew nothing and she reeked of jungle even when she was scrubbed down i tried to coax some spirit into her first by kindness and then by ropes end but she was no more use than a bishops maiden aunt however one has to make do and in the intervals of our laborious grappling i tried to indulge my interest in foreign languages which apart from horses is the only talent i can boast i can usually make good use of a native pillow partner in this way provided she speaks english but of course this one didnt and was as stupid as a berkshire hog into the bargain so it was no go as far as learning anything was concerned but i did succeed in teaching her a few useful english words and phrases like me lady caroline lamb me best rattle in balliol college the hands thought this a great joke and just for devilment i also taught her a tag from horace and with immense work got her perfect in it so that when you pinched her backside she would squeak out civis romanus sum odi pro fanum vulgus spring almost leaped out of his skin when he heard it and was not at all amused he took the opportunity to upbraid me for not having sent her back to the slavedeck and taken another wench for he wanted them all covered i said i didnt want to break in any more of em and suggested that if this one learned a little english it might add to her value he raised his voice and d d my impudence not realising that mrs spring had come up the companion and could hear us she startled him by suddenly remarking mr flashman is a constant heart i knew it the moment i first saw him she was mad of course but spring was much put out because she wasnt meant to know what was going on with the black women but he let me keep lady caroline lamb so it was a pleasant enough cruise to begin with for the weather blew just enough to give us a good passage without being too rough for the niggers their health remained good with no deaths in the first week which greatly pleased spring the work was light above deck as it always is in a fast ship with a favourable wind and there was time to sit about watching the flying fish and listening to the hands swapping yarns my respect for them had increased mightily over our encounter with the british sloop which had confirmed my earlier impression that these were no ordinary packet rats with the points knocked off their knives but prime hands and ive learned that no time is wasted which is spent listening to men who really know their work however as always when i feel i can loaf for a spell something happened which drove all other thoughts out of my head even my daydreams about elspeth and how i might contrive to come home respectably before too long and scupper old morrison too if possible what happened was little enough and not unexpected but in the long run it certainly saved my liberty and probably my life on the seventh day out from dahomey murphy came to me and said i must go directly to comber who was dying since we sailed hed been stowed away in a little cubby off the main cabin aft where there was a window and mrs spring could tend to him its all up with him poor lad says murphy fuming with liquor his bowels is mortified im thinkin maybe that jezebels spear wuz pizened any roads he wants to see you i couldnt think why but i went along and as soon as i clapped eyes on him i could see it was the union jack for this one no error his face was wasted and yellow with big purple blotches beneath the eyes and he was breathing like a bellows he was lying on the berth with just a blanket over him and the hand on top of it was like a birds claw he signed feebly to me to shut the door and i squatted down on a stool beside his cot he lay for a few moments gazing blankly at the sunbeams from the open window and then says in a very weak voice flashman do you believe in god well id expected this of course his wasnt the first deathbed id sat by and they usually get religious sooner or later theres nothing for it but to squat down on your hunkers and let them babble dying people love to talk i know i do and ive been in extremis more often than most so to humour him i said certainly there was a god not a doubt about it and he chewed this over a bit and says and if there is a god and a heaven there must be a devil and a hell must there not id heard that before too so playing up to my part as the rev flashy bd i told him opinion was divided on the point in any event says i if there was a hell it couldnt be much worse than life on this earth which i dont believe for a minute by the way but there is a hell cries he turning on me with his eyes shining feverishly i know it a terrible flaming hell in which the damned burn through all eternity i know it flashman i tell you i could have told him this was what came of looking at the pictures in bunyans holy war which had blighted my young life for a spell when i first struck it but i soothed him by pointing out that if there was a hell it was reserved for prime sinners only and he probably wasnt up to that touch he rolled his head about on the pillow biting his lip with distress and the pain of his wound but i am a sinner he gasped a fearful sinner oh i do fear i am beyond redemption the saviour will turn from me i know oh im not sure now says i slaving aint that bad you know he groaned and closed his eyes there is no such sin on my conscience says he fretfully which i didnt understand it is my weak flesh that has betrayed me i have so many sins i have broken the seventh commandment i couldnt be sure about this i had a suspicion it was the one about oxen and other livestock which seemed unlikely but with a man whos halfdelirious you can never tell what is it thats troubling you i asked in that that village he said speaking with effort those those women oh god pity me i lusted after them in my mind i looked on them as david looked on bathsheeba i desired them carnally sinfully oh flashman i am guilty in his sight i now look here says i for i was getting tired of this you wont go to hell for that leastways if you do itll be a mighty crowded place youll have the entire human race there including the college of cardinals i shouldnt wonder but he babbled on about the sin of lechery for a bit and then as repentant sinners always do he decided i was right and took my hand his was as dry as a bundle of sticks you are a good fellow flashman says he you have eased my mind why hed been worried beat me if i thought that when i go ill have nothing worse on my conscience than slavering over a buxom bum well ill die happy thats all but this poor devil had obviously been biblereared and fretted according you truly believe i shall be saved says he there is forgiveness is there not we are taught so that we may be washed clean in the blood of the lamb clean as a whistle says i its in the book now then old fellow dont go says he gripping my hand not yet im im dying you know flashman there isnt much time i said wouldnt he like mrs spring to look in but he shook his head there is something i must do first be patient a moment my dear friend so i waited wishing to blazes i was out of there he was breathing harder than ever wheezing like an old pump but he must have been gathering strength for when he opened his eyes again they were clear and sane and looked directly at mine flashman says he earnestly how came you aboard this ship it took me aback but i started to tell him and he cut me off it was against your will he was almost pleading of course i wouldnt have then you too oh in gods name tell me truthfully you detest this abomination of slavery hollo thinks i whats here very smartly i said yes i detested it i wanted to see where he was going thank god says he thank god and then you will swear to me that what i tell you will be breathed to no one on this accursed vessel i swore it solemnly and he heaved a great sigh of relief my belt says he on the chest yonder yes take it and cut it open there near the buckle mystified i examined it it was a broad heavy article double welted i picked out the stitches as he indicated with my knife and the two welts came apart between them folded very tight was a slender oilskin packet i unfolded it and suddenly thought ive been here before then i remembered slitting open the lining of my own coat by the jotunschlucht with de gautet lying beside me groaning at the pain of his broken toes was that only a few months ago it seemed an eternity and then the packet was opens and i was unfolding the two papers within it i spread the first one out and found myself gaping at a letterhead design which showed an anchor and beneath it the words to lieutenant beauchamp millward comber rn you are hereby required and directed good gd says i staring youre a naval officer he tried to nod but his wound must have caught him for he groaned and gasped then read on says he to report yourself immediately to the secretary of the board of trade and receive from him or such subordinate official as he may appoint instructions and directions whereby you shall assist in whatsoever capacity the secretary shall deem most fitting against those persons engaged in the illicit and illegal traffic in human slaves between the guinea ivory grain togo dahomey niger and angola coasts and the americas you are most strictly enjoined to obey and carry out all such instructions and directions as though they had proceeded from their lordships of the admiralty or others your superior officers in her majestys service it was signed auckland the other paper which was from the board of trade was really no more than a sort of passport requesting that all officials officers and other persons in hm service and of foreign governments should render to lieutenant comber all assistance of which he might stand in need etc etc but in its way it was equally impressive for it was signed not only by the president labouchere but also coimtersigned by my old pal t b macaulay as paymaster and some frog or other for the french merchant marine i goggled at these things hardly understanding and then looked at comber he was lying with his eyes shut and his face working youre a spy says i a spy on the slavers he opened his eyes you may call it that if it is spying to help to deliver these poor creatures then i am proud to be a spy he made a great effort gasping with pain and turned on his side towards me flashman hear me im going soon even if you dont see this as i do as gods work still you are a gentleman an army officer why you are one of arnolds people the paladins for gods sake say you will help dont let all my work my death be in vain he was in a desperate sweat straining a hand out towards me his eyes glittering you must in honour and oh for these poor lost black souls if youd seen what ive seen aye and had to help in god forgive me but i had to you see until i had done my work you must help them flashman they cannot help themselves their minds are not as ours they are weak and foolish and an easy prey to scoundrels like spring but they have souls and this slavery is an abomination in gods sight he struggled to get farther up say you will help for pitys sake what do you want me to do take those letters his voice was weakening and i could see blood seeping through his blanket he must have opened his wound in his exertion then my chest there under the canvas shirt packet copy of springs accounts last voyage i took some of them completed them this trip letters too evidence against him and others for gods sake get them to the admiralty or the american navy people oh dear god he fell back moaning but by then i was ferreting through his chest snatching out a slender packet sewn in an oilskin cover i slipped it and the letters quickly out of sight in my pocket and bent over his cot go on man what more are there any others like yourself agents officers or what but he just lay there coughing weakly and breathing in little moaning gasps i closed the chest and sat down to see if he would revive again and after a moment he began to mumble i leaned close but it was a moment before i could make out what he was saying in fact he was singing in a little whisper at the back of his throat it was that sad little song the lass so good and true that they call danny boy nowadays i knew at once without telling that it was the song his mother had used to sing him to sleep for he began to smile a little with his eyes closed i could have kicked the brute if hed spent less time making his soul and bellyaching to me about hell fire and minded his duty he would have had time to tell me more about his mission not that i cared a button for that but all knowledge is useful when youre in the grip of folk like spring but he was going to slip his cable with all the good scandal untold by the looks of it sure enough when his whispered song died away he began muttering mother sally yes mother cold but nothing to make sense it was maddening of course my generation were preoccupied with their mothers which sets me apart mine died when i was little you see and i never really knew her which may account for a deal it crossed my mind in that moment what will i have to say in the last few seconds before i slip over the edge of life whose name will be on my repentant lips my fathers now there would be a cheery vision to carry over to the other side all boozy face and rasping voice elspeths i doubt it some of the other ladies lola or natasha or takesawaycloudswoman or leonie or lady white willow or no there wouldnt be time ill have to wait and see which reminds me young harry east when they pulled what was left of him into the dooli at cawnpore muttered tell the doctor and everyone thought he meant the surgeon but i knew different he meant arnold which as a dying thought has one advantage that the devil if you meet him later will be an improvement so i speculated as combers breathing slackened and then i saw the shadow of death cross his wasted face and he was gone i pulled the blanket over his head went through his jacket pockets and chest but found nothing worth while except a pencil case and a good clasp knife which i appropriated and then went topsides to tell spring hes gone at last is he was his charitable comment aye omne capax movet urna nomen we need not pretend he is a great loss blackwall fashion was about his style a sound enough seaman but better fitted for an indiaman than our trade very good you can tell the sailmaker to bundle him up well bury him tomorrow and he continued to survey the horizon through his glass while i slipped away to think over the momentous news id learned from the dying comber obviously the fact that he had been an admiralty man working against the slavers was of the first importance but for the life of me i couldnt see what use it might be to me for all that id soothed his passing moments out of an uncommon civility i didnt mind a snap whether his precious evidence ever reached government hands or not in fact it seemed to me that if an information was laid against the balliol college and her master those who had sailed with him would land in the dock as well and they included h flashman albeit he wasnt aboard willingly yet my knowledge and combers might be valuable somehow provided i kept them safe from prying eyes so it seemed to me at the time anyway so i took a leaf out of combers book and in the privacy of my berth sewed his two letters into my belt i hesitated a long while over the packet for i knew the secrets it contained would be fatally dangerous to whoever shared them if spring ever found out it would be a slit throat and a watery grave for me but curiosity got the better of me in the end i opened it carefully so that it could be resealed and was presently goggling my way through the contents it was prime stuff no question all springs accounts for copied out in minute writing how many niggers shipped how many sold at roatan and how many at the bay of pigs the names of buyers and traders a full description of deals and prices and orders on british and american banks there was enough to hang old john charity ten times over but that wasnt the best of it comber had been at his letters too and while some of them were in cypher quite a few were in english they included one from the london firm which had supplied the trade goods for our present voyage another from new york lawyers who seemed to represent american investors and oh b y rapture a document describing the transfer of the balliol college from its american builders brown bell to a concern in london among the names of whose directors was one j morrison i almost whooped at the sight of it what spring was thinking of to keep such damaging evidence aboard his vessel i couldnt fathom but there it was i found morrison mentioned in one other letter and a score of names besides it might not be enough to hang him or them but i was certain sure he would sell his rotten little soul to keep these papers from the public gaze i had him the knowledge was like a warm bath with these papers at my command i could when i got home again turn the screw on the little shark until he hollered uncle no longer would i be the poor relation i would have evidence that could ruin him commercially and socially and perhaps put him in the dock as well and the price of my silence would be a free run through his moneybags by gad id be set for life a seat in the house it would be a seat on the board at least and grovelling civility from him to me for a change hed rue the day he shanghaied me aboard his lousy slave ship chuckling happily i sewed it all up again in its oilskin and stitched this carefully into the lining of my coat there it would stay until i got home and it could be employed in safety to my enrichment and morrisons confusion i reflected as i went back on deck later that it all came from my act of christian kindness in listening by combers deathbed and comforting his last moments theres no doubt about it virtue isnt always just its own reward comber wasnt buried the next day because one of the slaves died during the night and when the watch found him at dawn they naturally heaved the body overside to the sharks for some reason this sent spring into a passion he wasnt having a white man buried at sea on the same day as a black had been slung over which seemed to be stretching it a bit but a lot of the older hands agreed with him it beats me when i go they can plant me in with the whole population of timbuctoo but others see things differently spring now was mad about little things like that and when eventually we did come to bury comber on the morning after and his body had been laid out on a plank by the rail all neatly stitched up in sailcloth our fastidious commander played merry hl because no one had thought to cover it with a flag this on a dahomey slaver mark you so we all had to wait with our hats off while looney was despatched to get a colour from the flag locker and spring stamped up and down with his prayer book under his arm cursing the delay and mrs spring sat by with her accordion she was wearing a floral bonnet in honour of the occasion secured with a black scarf for mourning and her face wore its usual expression of vacant amiability looney came back presently and you wouldnt believe it he was carrying the brazilian colours we were wearing them at the moment this being the middle passage so i suppose he thought hed done right but spring flew into a towering passion dn your lousy eyes cries he take that infernal dago duster out of my sight would you bury an englishman under that and he knocked looney sprawling and then kicked him into the scuppers he cursed him something fearful the scar on his head bright crimson until one of the hands brought a union jack and then we got on with the service spring rattled through it the shotted corpse went over with a splash mrs spring struck up we all sang rock af ages and the amen hadnt died away before spring had strode to the unfortunate looney and kicked his backside again so hard that he went clean down the booby hatch to the main deck ive often thought how instructive it would have been for our divinity students to see how the offices for the dead were conducted aboard the balliol college however this was just another incident which i relate to show you what kind of a lunatic spring was i suppose it stands out in my mind because the next few weeks were so uneventful that may seem an extraordinary thing to say about a slave voyage on the middle passage but once you are used to conditions however remarkable you start to twiddle your thumbs and find life a bore i had little to do beyond stand my watches help dance the slaves and continue the instruction of lady caroline lamb she took to following me about and had to be made to wear a cotton dress that the sailinaker ran up in case mrs spring caught sight of her as though shed never seen naked black wenches before by the hundred lady caroline lamb didnt care for this and whenever she was in my berth she used to haul the dress off and sit stark by the foot of my cot like a black statue waiting to be educated one way or the other one other thing i should mention because it turned out to be important was the behaviour of looney whether springs hammering had driven him even more barmy i cant say but he was a changed man after comber died hed been a willing happy idiot but now he became sullen and started if anyone spoke to him and took to muttering to himself in corners i cuffed him smartly to make him stop it but he wouldnt he just blubbered and mowed and shuddered if springs name was even mentioned hes the devil he whined the b y devil he bashed us for nowt he did the and he would crawl away whimpering obscenities to find a place to hide even sullivan who was softer with him than most couldnt prevail on him to do his duties aft as steward and the cooks chinese mate had to serve in springs cabin so we ran westward and then northwest for about a month if i remember rightly until one morning i learned that we were out of the atlantic and into the caribbean it all looked alike to me for the weather had continued fine the whole way and id never worn more than my jersey but now a change came over the ship each day there was gun drill at the long nines and twelves which struck me as ominous and you could sense a growing restlessness among the hands where men off watch had been content to loaf before they now kept watching the horizon and sniffing the wind either spring or sullivan was always at the after rail with the glass whenever a large sail was sighted spring would have the guns shotted and their crews standing by as the weather grew even hotter tempers got shorter the stench from the slavedeck was choking in its foulness and even the constant murmuring and moaning of the cargo seemed to me to have taken on a deeper more sinister note this was the time i learned when slave mutinies sometimes broke out as more of them died although only five perished all told in our ship and the others became sullen and desperate youd been able to feel the misery and fear down on the slavedeck but now you could feel the brooding hatred it was in the way they shuffled sulkily round when they were danced heads sunk and eyes shifting while the hands stood guard with the needleguns and the light swivel pieces were kept armed and trained to sweep the decks if need be i kept as well away from those glowering black brutes as i could even the sharks which followed the ship didnt look more dangerous and there were always half a dozen of them dark sinuous shapes gliding through the blue water a couple of fathoms down hoping for another corpse to come overside i wasnt the only one in a fine state of nerves on the last weeks run along the old spanish main apparently even spring was apprehensive for instead of running up northwest to the windward passage and our intended destination which was somewhere on the north side of cuba he held almost due west for the mosquito coast which if anything is a more godforsaken shore than the one we had left in africa i saw it only as a far distant line on our port beam but its heavy air lay on the ship like a blanket the pitch bubbled between the planks and even the wind seemed to have come from a blast furnace door by the time we stood into the bay at roatan which youll find on the map in the islas de la bahia off the honduras coast we were a jittery sundried ship and only thankful that wed come safe through with never a yankee patroller or garda costa in sight we dropped anchor in that great clearinghouse of the african slavers where ivory coast brigs and schooners the baltimore clippers and angola barques the gulf freetraders and braziliano pirates all rode at their moorings in the broad bay with the buinboats and shorecraft plying among them like waterbeetles and even the stench of our own slavedeck was beaten all to nothing by the immense reek of the huge barracoons and pens that lined the shore and even ran out into the sludgy green waters of the bay on great wooden piers one never dreams that such places exist until one sees and hears and smells them with their amazing variety of the scum of the earth blacks and halfbreeds of every description rio traders with curling mustachios and pistols in their belts and rings in their ears like buccaneers from a storybook down easter yankees in stovepipe hats with cigars sticking out of faces like flinty cliffs sunreddened english tars some still wearing the wide straw hats of the navy packet rats in canvas shirts and frayed trousers scowegians with leathery faces and knives hanging on lanyards round their necks frog and dago skippers in embroidered weskits with scarves round their heads and niggers by the hundred of every conceivable shape and shade everyone babbling and arguing in half the tongues on earth and all with one thing in common they lived by and on the slave trade but best of all i remember a big fellow all in dirty white calicos and a broadbrimmed panama holding on to a stay in one of the shoreboats that came under our counter and bawling up redfaced in reply to some one who had asked what was the news aint ye heard then they found gold over to the pacific coast thats right gold reckon theyre pickin it up fast as they can shovel why they say its in lumps big as your fist more goldn anyones ever seen before gold in california we landed all our slaves at roatan herding them down into the big lighters where the dago overseers packed them in like sheep while spring conducted business aft of the mizzenmast with half a dozen brokers who had come aboard a big awning had been rigged up and mrs spring dispensed tea and biscuits to those who wanted it which meant to spring himself and to a wizened little frenchman in a long taffeta coat and wideawake hat who perched on a stool sipping daintily from his cup while a nigger boy stood behind fanning the flies off him the other brokers were three greasy dagoes in dirty finery who drank rum a big dutchman with a face like a suet pudding who drank gin punch and a swarthy little yankee who drank nothing at all they had all made a quick tour of the slavedeck before it was cleared and when they bickered and bid with spring the dagoes jabbering and getting excited the other three mighty calm and businesslike in the end they divided the six hundred among them at an average price of nine dollars a pound which came to somewhere between seven and eight hundred thousand dollars for the cargo no money changed hands nothing was signed no receipts were sought or given spring simply jotted details down in a notebook and i daresay that after that the only transactions that took place would be the transfer of bills and orders in perfectly respectable banks in charlestown new york rio and london the niggers we landed would be resold some to plantation owners along the main but most of them into the united states when smugglers could be found to beat the american blockade and sell them in mobile and new orleans at three times what we had been paid for them when you calculate that the trade cargo wed given to king gezo through sanchez had been worth maybe a couple of thousand pounds well no wonder the slave trade throve in the forties i said we sold all our slaves but in fact we kept lady caroline lamb spring had decided that if i persevered with her instruction in english she would be worth keeping as an interpreter for later voyages such slaves were immensely valuable and we had actually made our last trip without one i didnt mind it would help pass the time and i felt somehow that it was a feather in my cap to her spring also added about a dozen mustee and quadroon girls sent aboard by the brokers who wanted them shipped to america where they were destined for the new orleans brothels spring agreed for a consideration to take them as far as havana where we were to load cargo for our homeward trip these yellow wenches were quite different from the blacks we had carried being graceful delicate creatures of the kind they called fancy pieces for use as domestic slaves id have traded twenty lady caroline lambs for any one of them but there was no chance of that they werent chained being so few and not the kind who would make trouble anyway we didnt linger in roatan slaves from the barracoons came aboard with a load of lime and scoured out the slavedeck and then we warped out of the bay to cleaner water and the pumps and hoses washed out the shelves for twentyfour hours before spring was satisfied as one of the hands remarked you could have eaten your dinner off it not that id have cared to myself after that we made sail due north for the yucatan passage and for the first time i think since id first set foot on that d d ship i began to feel easy in my mind it was no longer a slaver i felt well give or take the few yellows we were carrying we had turned the corner and now there was only havana and the run home why in two or three months or perhaps even less i would be in england again the bryant affair how trivial it seemed now would be blown over i would be able to see elspeth by jove i would be a father by then somebody would be anyway but id get the credit at least suddenly i began to feel excited and the dahomey coast and the horrors of that jungle river were like a nightmare that had never truly happened england and elspeth and peace of mind and what else well id see about that when the time came i should have known better of course whenever im feeling up to the mark and congratulating myself some fearful fate trips me headlong and i find myself haring for cover with my guts churning and nemesis in full cry after me in this case nemesis was a dandy little sloop flying the american colours that came up out of the southwest when we were three days out of roatan and had cuba clear on our starboard bow that was nothing in itself spring put on more sail and we held our own scudding northeast and then out from behind cape san antonio a bare two miles ahead comes a brig with the stars and stripes fluttering at her peak and there we were caught between them unable to fly and in my case anyway most unwilling to fight but not john charity spring he turned the balliol college on her heel and tried to race the sloop westward but on this tack she came up hand over fist and presently from her bowgun comes a plume of smoke and a shot kicked up the blue water off our port bow clear for action bawls he and with sullivan roaring about the deck they ran out the guns while the little sloop came tearing up and sends another shot across our bows now in my experience there is only one way to fight a ship and that is to get below on the side opposite to the enemy and find a snug spot behind a stout bulkhead i was down the main hatch before the first crash of our own guns and found myself on the slavedeck with a dozen screaming yellow wenches cowering in the corners i made great play ordering them to keep quiet and settle down while overhead the guns thundered again and there came a hideous crash and tearing somewhere forward where one of the yankees shots had gone home the wenches shrieked and i roared at them and waved my sheathknife one of them ran screaming across the tilting deck her hands over her face and i grabbed hold of her a fine lithe piece she was too and i was taking my time manhandling her back to her fellows when sullivan stuck his head through the hatch crying what the hl dye think youre about preventing a slave mutiny says i what you skulldng rascal he flourished a pistol at me you shift your d d butt up here directly dye hear so reluctantly i dropped the wench and went cautiously up the ladder again poking my head out to see what was what im no judge of naval warfare but by the way the hands were serving the port guns we were in the thick of a d d hot running fight the twelvepounders were crashing and being reloaded and run out again like something at trafalgar and although from time to time there was the shuddering crack of a shot striking us we seemed to be taking no great harm the deck watch were tailing onto a line while sullivan was yelling orders to the men aloft he bawled at me so i scrambled out and tailed on to the line and out of the corner of my eye i saw the sloop running across our bows her broadside popping away like fury and the scream and crash of shot just overhead sent me diving for the scuppers i fetched up against the rail with a crash wondering why the blazes id been fool enough to come out from cover just because sullivan told me to instinct i suppose and then there was a rending crackle from overhead something hit the deck with an almighty crash and somebody fell on top of me i pushed him off and my hand came away sticky with blood horrified i watched as the body rolled into the scuppers it had no head and blood was pouring out of the neck stump like a fountain all this had happened in a matter of minutes i climbed unsteadily to my feet and looked around a great tangle of cordage and splintered timber lay between the main and mizzen masts looking up i saw that our main top mast had come away and for a moment i felt the ship floundering and rolling helplessly someone was shrieking beneath the wreckage and sullivan was jumping forward with an axe and a dozen men at his heels to try to clear the tangle away beyond them spring was at the wheel hat jammed down as usual but his orders were lost in the crash of one of our port guns what happened in the next five minutes i barely remember i know that we were hit again and for a time you could hardly see across the deck for acrid powder smoke i crouched beside the rail palpitating until the clearing party came dragging their mass of wreckage and i had to jump away as they bundled it overside our guns had stopped firing and presently i was aware the yankee wasnt firing either so i chanced a look somehow after that brief holocaust a semblance of order bad been restored the gun crews were standing by their pieces sullivan was by the mizzen volleying commands to the topmen and spring was at the wheel the yankee sloop was astern limping with her foresail all askew but the brig was ploughing along like thunder in our injured condition even i could see she would be with us in no time at all and then no doubt she would batter us to pieces or take us with slaves aboard and that would be prison and possibly the gallows i felt the bile coming up in my throat and then i heard springs voice raised in a bellow of anger youll do as youre d d well told mister now get those yellows up on deck with their shackles on lively dn you dye hear sullivan his hat gone seemed to be protesting but spring silenced him with another bellow and presently the hands were driving up the yellow girls fastening leg irons about their ankles and herding them together by the mizzen mast spring and sullivan were by the wheel the latter pointing to the brig which was overhauling us fast well have her shooting us up in five minutes he was shouting we cant run skipper we cant fight were crippled dnit we can fight mister springs scar was flaming weve settled the sloop havent we whats that but a measly brig dye want me to strike to her look at her cries sullivan shes got thirty guns if shes got one i always knew he was a sensible chap ill fight her though says the idiot spring i havent made this cruise to be towed into new orleans by that pack of longshore loafers but well make that nigger rubbish safe first and if we fight and fail there wont be a black hide aboard to show against us now get the chain into em sullivan looked as though he would burst it wont do theyre too d d close theyll see m drop wont they what if they do no niggers no felony they can make what they like of the ship with the d d equipment law but they cant lay a hand on you or me now im telling you mister get that chain rove through i made nothing of this until four of the hands came running aft dragging a massive chain which they laid by the starboard rail then they herded the wenches over and began to pass the chain between their legs above the shackles so that it linked them all together they made the chain fast with rope to the end slaves in the line then forced the girls to lie flat with their feet up and by main force lifted the chain until it lay along the rail steady there bawls spring now hold it so till i give the word i dont bilk at much i watched them blowing sepoys from the ends of guns at cawnpore with a keen interest and i ate my dinner at peking an hour after the massacre but i confess that springs method of disposing of incriminating evidence made me gulp the wenches screamed and writhed in terror once that chain was pushed over they would be hurtled across the rail by its weight and in the sea they would sink like stones and then if the balliol college was taken well what slaves do you mean captain id heard of it being done and i remembered sullivans story of the dago who set his ship on fire but for all springs confidence i couldnt believe it would wash the yankee brig must have half a dozen glasses trained on us they could swear to murder done and seen to be done and then it was the gallows for certain funkstricken though i was i could think at least spring obviously hoped he could fight the yankee off and save his liberty and his slaves at the same time hed only push em over in the last extremity i was sure sullivan was right we couldnt hope to fight the brig somehow that madman had to be stopped or hed have all our heads in the noose if theres one thing that will make my limbs work in a crisis it is the thought of selfpreservation id no notion of what i intended but i found myself unheeded in the excitement walking across to the chest of arms that had been broken out by the main mast two of the hands were loading and priming pistols and passing them out i took a couple one a doublebarrelled piece and thrust them into my belt then seeing all eyes were fixed either on the pursuing brig or the line of squealing unfortunates shackled by the rail i dropped down the main hatch on to the slave deck i still didnt know what i was going to do i remember thinking as i stood there in an agony of uncertainty this is what comes of dabbling in politics and playing vingtetun with spinsters i had some frenzied notion of making my way aft through the main bulkhead door which was open now that the slavedeck was in a wholesome condition finding mrs spring in the main cabin and appealing to her i knew it was a lunatic thought but i found myself scampering through anyway pulling up by the after companion swithering this way and that cursing feebly to myself and racking my brains over what to do next springs bellowing almost directly overhead had me jumping in alarm squinting up the companion i could just see his head and shoulders facing away from me as he stood at the wheel he was roaring to the gun crews urging them to their stations and by the sound of his voice he was having his work cut out like sullivan they were ready to strike and then i heard the mates voice shouting at spring and suddenly cut off by the crack of a pistol shot take that dn you shouts spring stand away from him you there get to those tackles or by gd youll get the next round his hand came into view holding a smoking pistol and thinks i if hes daft enough to turn a gun on sullivan theres no stopping him except by the same way that was it of course as id known all along here was i armed and there was the back of his head not fifteen feet away and by gd if ever a man needed a bullet in the skull it was j c spring fellow of oriel but i darent do it oh it wasnt that i shrank from the dirty deed for christian reasons id killed before and anyone who stands between me and safety gets whatever i can give him no holds barred but only if its safeand this wasnt suppose i missed something told me that spring wouldnt suppose the crew raised objections well if they didnt the yankee navy would theyd be just the kind of idiots to consider it murder one way and another i couldnt risk it and i stood there sweating in panic torn between my terrors suddenly there was a patter of feet from the main bulkhead and here came the idiot looney trying to buckle on a cutlass as big as himself and to my amazement he was grinning foolishly to himself as he hurried towards the companion what the blazes are you doing cries i im goin to kill them b ds cries he thems is firin on us you numskull and then suddenly a great light dawned and i saw the safe way out you dont want to kill them its the captain thats doing this that d l spring up there i pointed to the companion way down which our skippers dulcet voice could be clearly heard hes your man looney hes the man to kill he stood gaping at me whaffor says he bewildered hes just killed mr sullivan i hissed at him hes gone mad hes killed sullivan your friend and some guardian angel prompted my next words hes going to kill you next i heard him say so im going to settle that b d looney thats what he said the loose idiot face just stared for a moment while i shook his arm from far astern came the boom of a gun and from overhead there was a crash of breaking timber and shouts and running feet its him theyre trying to kill not you not me hes the devil remember he just killed sullivan hell kill you and all of us suddenly his face changed ill swear a light of understanding came into his eyes and to my consternation he began to weep he stared at me choking e killed mr sullivan e done that by gum i know a cue when i hear one shot him like a dog looney in the back he gave a little whimper of rage e shouldnt ave why e done that because hes the devil you know that ive done some fearful convincing in my time but this topped everything thats why the yankees are shooting at us youve got to kill him looney or were all done for if you dont hell kill you he hates you remember how he flogged you for nothing youve got to kill him looney quickly i was thrusting a pistol at him as though it had been red hot and suddenly he grabbed it out of my hand just as our own stemchasers thundered overhead in reply his face contorted with rage wonderful beatific sight and he plunged past me to the ladder e killed mr sullivan the b d ill do for im it was splendid thank god he was an idiot and hated spring like poison i reckon it had taken me all of sixty seconds to turn him to murder which was a considerable feat of persuasion now all i had to do was make sure he didnt flinch from the act up you go looney good lad its him or you quick man quick i thrust at his backside as he swung on to the ladder jam it into his back and give him both barrels he killed sullivan hes the devil sick im boy i probably could have spared my breath the thought of sullivan the only person looney cared for dead at springs hand had probably completed the turning of that idiot brain he fairly flung himself up the ladder scrambled halfway through the hatch mouthing hideous oaths he thrust out the pistol and with an incoherent scream let fly with both barrels together before the echo of the shots had died i was tearing down to the main bulkhead and up the main hatch as my head came clear i looked aft spring was writhing on the deck beside the wheel his hat gone his hands beating at the planks looney was struggling in the grip of one of the hands yelling that hed killed the devil sullivan was sprawled face down in the scuppers and the after rail was a milling scene of men running every which way while another shot from the brigs bowchasers came whistling overhead to tear through the mainsail she was close up now and turning to port to show her starboard guns like grinning teeth there was a yell of alarm from the men aft and then hands were hauling at the flag lanyard with spring gone everyone knew what had to be done i was not backward either i strode over to the men at the rail who were still gripping the chain and in my parade ground voice ordered them to bring it inboard smartly they obeyed without a seconds pause and when i ordered them to free the slaves ankleirons they did that too falling over each other in their hurry i lent a hand myself patting the yellow sluts on the shoulder and assuring them that all was well now and that i would see they came to no harm i trusted this would go a little way to ensuring that i came to no harm myself and as the yankee brig ran up on our port beam i began to rehearse in my mind the scheme i had formed for getting old flash safely out from under this time by and large im partial to americans they make a great affectation of disliking the english and asserting their equality with us but ive discovered that underneath they dearly love a lord and if youre civil and cool and dont play it with too high a hand you can impose on them quite easily im not a lord of course but ive got the airs when i want em and know how to use them in moderation thats the secret a nice blending of the plain polite gentleman with just a hint of norman blood and theyll eat out of your hand and boast to their friends in philadelphia that they know a man whos on terms with queen victoria and yet by gosh is as nice a fellow as theyve ever struck when they came aboard the balliot college raging angry and full of zeal i bided my time while they herded us all forward and didnt say a word until the young lieutenant commanding them had ordered us all under hatches they were pushing us to the companion and being none to gentle about it when i stepped smartly out of the line and said to him very rapidly and civilly that i wanted to see his commander on a most urgent matter he stared down his yankee nose at me and snaps goddam your impudence youll do your talking in new orleans much good may it do you now git below i gave him a cool stare believe me sir says i in my best cherrypicker voice i am in most solemn earnest please do nothing untoward i tilted my head slightly towards the balliol college hands who were being pushed below these people must not know i said quietly but i am a british naval officer i must see your commander without delay he stared at me but he was sharp he waited till our last man was down the companion and then demanded an explanation i told him i was lieutenant comber royal navy on special service from the board of admiralty which i assured him i could prove with ease that settled it and when one of his men had collected my traps from below i was hustled off under guard the yankee officer still eyeing me suspiciously but he had other things to think about there was spring shot through the back and unconscious being taken down on a stretcher mrs spring was under guard in the cabin there were three corpses on our deck including sullivans looney was below with the other prisoners raving in a voice you could have heard in aldershot there was blood and wreckage on the deck and a dozen weeping nigger girls huddled by the rail i made the most of them drawing the lieutenants attention to them and saying take care of those poor people they must suffer no more than they have done miserable souls they have come through hell today i left him not knowing what to think and allowed myself to be conducted aboard the uss cormorant by my leatherneck escort and there it was plain sailing all the way as i knew it must be captain abraham fairbrother a very spry young gentleman didnt believe a word i said at first but once i had slit open my belt and laid combers papers before his bulging eyes he hadnt a leg to stand on it was all so impressively official and my own bearing and manner although i say it myself were so overwhelming that the poor soul took it all in like a hungry fish why shouldnt he i would have done of course i had to tell him a tremendous tale but that sort of thing has never presented me with difficulty and barring the fact that i wasnt comber the whole thing was gospel true which always makes lying easier he shook his fair young head in amazement and vowed that it beat everything he had ever heard he was full of venom against slavers i discovered and so naturally he was all admiration for me and shook my hand as though it was a pump handle i feel it an honour to welcome you aboard sir says he i had no notion that such a thing that such people as yourself sir were engaged in this work by george its wonderful my congratulations sir and believe it or not he actually saluted well i fancy i can carry off this sort of situation pretty well you know modest and manly thats flashy when the compliments are flying with a touch of a frown to show that my mind is really on serious matters which it was because i knew i hadnt got farther than the first fence so far and would have to tread delicately but captain fairbrother was all eager assistance what could he do to serve me i confess i may have given him the impression that the entire slave trade could expect its coup de grace when once id laid my report before the british and american governments and he was itching to help oil the wheels have you noticed once you have succeeded in convincing a man of something incredible he believes it with an enthusiasm that he wouldnt dream of showing for an obvious simple fact it had been like that with looney now it was so with fairbrother he simply was all over me i just had to sit back and let him arrange matters first i must be delivered to washington with all speed the bigwigs would be in a positive lather to see me i doubted that myself but didnt say so nothing would do but he must carry me to baltimore in his own brig while the sioop could take the balliol college into new orleans with a prize crew there observes mr fairbrother darkly the miscreants would meet with condign punishment for slavery piracy and attempted murder of course i would give evidence eventually but that could wait until washington had been thrown into transports by my advent there washington i could see was going to present problems they wouldnt be as easy to satisfy as captain fairbrother who was your genuine northern niggerlover and violently prejudiced in my favour he was one of these direct virtuous souls bursting with decency whose very thought was written plainly on his fresh handsome face arnold would have loved him and young chard could have used a few of him at rorkes drift too brainless as a bat of course and just the man for my present needs i impressed on him the need for not letting any of the balliol college crew know what i truly was and hinted at dangerous secret work yet to come which might be prejudiced if my identity leaked out he agreed solemnly to this but thought it would be an excellent plan to take some of the freed slaves to washington just for effect tangible evidence sir of your noble and heroic endeavours in the great crusade against this vile traffic i didnt object and so about six yellows and lady caroline lamb were herded aboard and bedded down somewhere in the bowels of the brig fairbrother wondered about mrs spring whose presence on the college shocked and amazed him they had caught her hurling springs log papers and accounts out of the cabin window whereby much valuable evidence had been lost still she was a woman take her to new orleans is my advice says i there are not two more diabolical creatures afloat than she and her fiend of a husband how is he by the way in a coma says fairbrother one of his own pirates shot him through the back sir what creatures they are to be sure he will live i dare say which is no great matter since the new orleans hangman will if the fellow survives have the duty of breaking his neck for him oh the holy satisfaction of the godly when it comes to delight in cruelty im just a child compared to them his next remark didnt surprise me either but i am inconsiderate mr comber here have i been keeping you in talk over these matters when your most urgent desire has surely bзen for a moments privacy in which you might deliver up thanks to a merciful heavenly father for your delivery from all the dangers and tribulations you have undergone your pardon sir my urgent need was in fact for an enormous brandy and a square meal but i answered him with my wistful smile i need hardly tell you sir that in my heart i have rendered that thanks already not only for myself but for those poor souls whom your splendid action had liberated indeed says i looking sadly reflective there is hardly a moment in these past few months that i have not spent in prayer he gripped my hand again looking moist and then thank god he remembered at last that i had a belly and gave orders for food and a glass of spirits while he went off excusing himself to splice the binnacle or clew up the heads i shouldnt wonder well thinks i so far so good but we mustnt go too far the sooner i could slip out of sight the better for while the balliol college crew were alive and kicking there was always the risk that i would be given away i didnt want to get the length of the british embassy in washington for someone there might just know me or worse still they might know comber but for the moment with the brig heading east by north and the balliol college making north under guard to orleans it was all sunshine for harry provided i didnt trip myself up i was meant to be navy and fairbrother and his officers were navy also so i must watch my tongue as it turned out by playing the reserved briton and steering the conversation as often as possible to india about which they were curious i passed the thing off very well i had to talk some slavery of course and there was a nasty moment when i was almost drawn into a description of our encounter with the british sloop off dahomey but i managed to wriggle clear it would have been easier i think with englishmen for yankee bluebacks are deuced serious fellows more concerned with their d d ratlines and bobstays than with interesting topics like drink women and cash but i was very pious and priggish that voyage and they seemed to respect me for it however there was a human side i discovered even to the worthy biblethumping fairbrother i had made a great thing the second day of visiting the freed slaves and giving them some fatherly comfort husbandly comfort would have been more like it but with those sharp yankee eyes on me i darent even squeeze a rump lady caroline lamb was there eyeing me soulfully but i patted her head sternly and told her to be a good girl what she made of this i can only guess but that evening when i was settling down in the berth i had been allotted aft i was startled by a rapping on my door it was fairbrother in some consternation mr comber says he theres one of those black women in my berth indeed says i looking suitably startled my gd mr comber cries he shes in there now and shes stark naked i pondered this it occurred to me that lady caroline lamb following her balliol college training had made her way aft and got into fairbrothers cabin which lay in the same place as my berth had done on the slaver and being the kind of gentlyreared fool that he was fairbrother was in a fine stew hed probably never seen a female form in his life what shall i do says he what can she want i spoke to her shes the big very black one but she has hardly any english and she just stays there shes kneeling beside my cot sir have you tried praying with her says i he goggled at me pray why i i dont know she looks as though he broke off going beetroot red my g d do you suppose that slaver captain has been using her as as a woman humanity never ceases to amaze me here was this fine lad old enough to vote in command of a hundred men and a fighting ship which he could handle like a young nelson brave as a bull i dont doubt and quivering like a virgins fan because a buxom tart had invaded his cabin its this new england upbringing of course even a young manhood spent in naval service hadnt obliterated the effect of all those sermons do you suppose she has been degraded says he in a hushed voice i fear it is more than likely captain fairbrother says i there is no depth unplumbed by their depravity this unfortunate young woman may well have been trained to concubinage he shuddered monstrous terrible but what am i to do i find it difficult to know what to advise says i the situation is unique in my experience perhaps you should tell her to go back to the quarters she has been allotted yes yes of course i must do that he hesitated pulling at his lip it is frightful to think of these ignorant young creatures being misled in that way we must do what we can for them says i indeed indeed he cleared his throat nervously i must apologise mr comber for disturbing you i was startled i confess totally unexpected thing yes however i shall do as you advise my apologies again sir thank you er and good night he fairly fled into his cabin that good pious lad and i listened in vain thereafter for the sound of his door reopening not that i expected it next day he avoided my eye and went red whenever the slaves were mentioned he probably still does but ill wager his conscience has never been quite strong enough to make him regret his lost innocence we made capital speed to baltimore which is just another port at the far end of the uninviting chesapeake bay and from there after fairbrother had reported to his commodore and the importance of my presence had been duly emphasised we were taken by train to washington about forty miles off i was getting fairly apprehensive by now and looking sharp for a chance to make myself scarce although what i would do then in a strange country without any means of support i couldnt imagine i knew the longer i kept up my imposture the more chance there was of being detected but what could i do fairbrother who had wangled leave from his commander to be my personal convoy to the capital stuck like a leech he was looking for a share of the glory of course so i just had to sit back and see what came at worst i decided i could make a bolt for it but in the meantime i would carry the thing through with a wide eye and a bold bluff front washington is an odd place you could see the jonathans had designed it with an eye to the future when they envisaged it as the finest city in the world and even then in there were signs of building on every hand with scaffolding about even in the middle of the city and the outer roads all churned mud with the autumn rain but fringed with fine houses halfcompleted i got got to know it well in the civil war time but i never liked it sticky as calcutta or madras in summer and yet its people dressed as though theyd been in new york or london i could always smell fever in the air there and why george washington ever chose the site beats me but thats your rich colonial englishman all over never thinks twice about other peoples convenience but sticky or not the officials who lived there were d d sharp men as i discovered fairbrother delivered me at the department of the navy where a whitewhiskered admiral heard my tale and d d his stars at every turn then he handed me on to a section much like our board of trade where several hardfaced civilians took up the running and i went through the thing again they didnt seem to know what to make of me at all at first or what precisely they ought to do finally one of them a fat little fellow called moultrie asked me exactly what could i contribute to the antislave trade campaign apart from giving evidence against the crew of the balliol college in other words what was so remarkable about me that washington was being troubled with me at all where was the important report that had been talked about by captain fairbrother since it didnt exist i had to invent it i explained that i had gathered an immense amount of detail not only about the slavetraders but about those in britain and america who were behind them supplying them with funds and ships and organising their abominable activities under the cover of legitimate commerce all this i explained i had committed to paper as opportunity arose with such documents as i had been able to obtain and i had earmarked useful witnesses along the way i had consigned one report to a reliable agent at whydah and another to a second agent at roatan no i dare not disclose their names except to my own chiefs in london a third report i would certainly write out as soon as i could a rueful smile here and a reminder that life for me had been fairly busy of late yes yes sir says he this is excellent and very well in its way your prudence about the disposal of your earlier reports is commendable but from what you say you are obviously in possession of infonnation which must be of the first importance to the united states government information which her majestys ministers would obviously communicate to us you have names you say of americans who are behind the slave trade who at least are involved in it at a safe remove from slaving operations now sir here we have the root of the thing these are the men we must bring to book who are those men i took a deep breath and tried to look like a man in mental struggle while he and his two fellowinquisitors waited and the secretary sat with his pen poised mr moultrie says i i cant tell you please sir let me explain i solemnly checked his outburst i have many names both in my mind and in my reports i dont know much about american public affairs sir but even i recognise some of them as well not insignificant names now if i were to name them to you now what would they be but names the mass of evidence that would that will lead to their proven involvement in the traffic in black souls is already on its way to england as i trust obviously it will be communicated to you and these people can be proceeded against but if i were to name names now sir i stabbed a finger on the table you could do nothing you would have to wait on the evidence which has been assembled and while i trust your discretion perfectly gentlemen it would be an impertinence to do otherwise we all know how a word once spoken takes wings premature disclosure and consequent warning might enable some of these birds to escape the net and believe me gentlemen i gritted my teeth and forced moisture into my eyes believe me i have not gone through the hell of those dahomey raids and watched the torture of those poor black creatures on the middle passage i have not risked death and worse in order to see those butchers escape well it wasnt a bad performance and it took them pretty well aback moultrie looked d d solemn and his pals wore the alarmed expression of men in the presence of a portent they didnt understand then moultrie says yes i see you are in no doubt sir of the consequence that is the importance of some of those implicated do you suggest that when all is known their would be a er a political scandal perhaps i gave my mirthless laugh i may indicate that best sir by assuring you that among the britons whom i know to be involved in the traffic and whose complicity can be proved sir are two peers of the realm and one whose name was until lately to be found among her majestys ministers and i believe sir that the american names include men of comparable stature the profits of the slave trade sir are immense enough to tempt the highest judge whether a scandal may be expected he was regarding me roundeyed mr comber says he your knowledge makes you a very dangerous young man and therefore says i smiling keenly you would say a very endangered young man i am used to risk sir it is my trade i was almost believing it myself by now so i wasnt surprised that they took it in so much so that being yankees and no fools they made me go through my whole yarn again from the channel to whydah gezos village our escape the voyage west roatan and all the rest in the hope of my slipping out some information unawares but since i didnt have any they were wasting their time finally they conferred while i cooled my heels and announced that they would discuss matters with the british ambassador and in the meantime i would hold myself ready to go to new orleans to testify against the balliol college i didnt fancy this at all but again there was nothing to be done at the moment so i bowed and later that day i was hailed to the ambassadors housea very decent old stick and a pleasant change from those yapping jonathan voices i was a shade wary in case he or any of his people might by a chance in a thousand be acquainted with the real comber but all was well i told my story for a fourth time and that evening when he bade me to dinner with him i went through it yet again for the entertainment of his guests and ill swear i didnt put a foot wrong but there was one man at that table with as keen a nose for a faker as i have myself how or when he saw through me i shall never understand but he did and gave me one of the many nasty moments in my life there were about a dozen at the dinner and i didnt even notice him until the ladies had withdrawn and charterfield our host had invited me to regale the gentlemen with my adventures on the slave coast but he seemed to take an even closer interest in my story than the others he was an unusually tall man with the ugliest face you ever saw deep dark eye sockets and a chin like a coffin and a black cows lick of hair smeared across his forehead when he spoke it was with the slow deliberate drawl of the american backcountryman which was explained by the fact that he was new to the capital in fact he was a very junior congressman invited at the last moment because he had some antislavery bill in preparation and so would be interested in meeting me his name will be familiar to you mr lincoln let me say at once that in spite of all the trouble he caused me at various times and the slight differences which may be detectable in our characters i liked abe lincoln from the moment i first noticed him leaning back in his chair with that hidden smile at the back of his eyes gently cracking his knuckles just why i liked him i cant say i suppose in his way he had the makings of as big a scoundrel as i am myself but his appetites were different and his talents infinitely greater i cant think of him as a good man yet as history measures these things i suppose he did great good not that that excites my admiration unduly nor do i put my liking down to the fact that he had a sardonic humour akin to my own i think i liked him because for some reason which god alone knows he liked me and not many men who knew me as well as he did have done that i remember only a few of his observations round that table once when i was describing our fight with the amazons one of the company exclaimed you mean to say the women fight and torture and slay on behalf of their menfolk there can be no other country in the world where this happens and lincoln very droll inquires of him have you attended many political tea parties in washington lately sir they all laughed and the fellow replied that even in washington society he hadnt seen anything quite to match what i had described be patient sir says lincoln were a young country after all doubtless in time we will achieve a civilisation comparable with that of dayhomey i spoke about spring and charterfield expressed amazement and disgust that a man of such obvious parts should be so great a vfflain well now says lincoln why not some of the greatest villains in history have been educated men without that education they might have been honest citizens a few years at college wont make a bad man virtuous it will merely put the polish on his wickedness oh come now says charterfield that may be true but you must admit that virtue more often goes hand in hand with learning than with ignorance you know very well that a nations criminal class is invariably composed of those who lack the benefits of education and being uneducated they get caught says lincoln your learned rascal usually goes undetected why at this rate you will equate learning with evildoing cries someone what must your view be of our leading justices and politicians are they not virtuous men oh virtuous enough says lincoln but what they would be like if they had been educated is another matter when i had finished my tale and had heard much congratulation and expressions of flattering astonishment it was lincoln who remarked that it must have been a taxing business to act my part among the slavers for so long had i not found it a great burden i said it had been but fortunately i was a good dissembler you must be says he and i speak as a politician who knows how difficult it is to fool people well says i my own experience is that you can fool some people all the time and all the people some times but i concede that its difficult to fool all the people all the time that is so says he and that great grin lit up his ugly face yes sir mr comber that is indeed so i also carried away from that table an impression of mr lincolns views on slaves and slavery which must seem strange in the twentieth century since it varies somewhat from popular belief i recall for example that at one point he described the negroes as the most confounded nuisance on this continent not excepting the democrats oh come says someone that is a little hard it is not their fault it was not my fault when i caught the chicken pox says lincoln but i can assure you that while i was infected i was a most unconscionable nuisancealthough i believe my family loved me as dearly as ever come thats better laughs the other you may call the nigras a nuisance provided you love them too that will satisfy even the sternest abolitionist yes i believe it would says lincoln and like so many satisfactory political statements it would not be true i try to love my fellow man with varying success the poor slaves among the rest but the truth is i neither like nor dislike them more than any other creatures now your stern abolitionist because he detests slavery feels he must love its victims and so he insists on detecting in them qualities deserving unusual love but in fact those qualities are not to be found in them any more than in other people your extreme antislaver mistakes compassion for love and this leads him into a kind of nigraworship which on a rational examination is by no means justified surely the victim of a misfortune as grievous as slavery does deserve special consideration though indeed says lincoln special consideration special compassion by all means just such as i received when i had the chicken pox but having the chicken pox did not make me a worthier or better person as some people seem to suppose is the case with victims of slavery i tell you sir to listen to some of our friends i could believe that every plantation and barracoon from florida to the river is peopled by the disciples of jesus reason tells me this is false the slave being gods creature and a human soul is no better than the rest of us but if i said as much to cassius clay he would try to prove me wrong at the point of his bowie knife you have worked too long on your antislavery bill laughs charterfield you are suffering from a surfeit why sir that is probably so says lincoln i wish i had ten dollars for every time i have fought a clients case never doubting its justice and rightness pursuing it to a successful verdict with all my powers and finished the trial feeling heartily sick with that same worthy client i would not confess it outside this room but you may believe me gentlemen there are moments god forgive me when i become just a little tired of nigras your conscience is troubling you says someone by thunder there is no lack of people determined to make my conscience trouble me says lincoln as though i cant tend to my own conscience they must forever be running pins into it there was a gentleman the other day a worthy man too and i was illadvised enough to say to him much what ive said tonight that nigras while deserving our uttermost compassion and assistance were nevertheless a nuisance i said they were the rock on which our nation had been splitting for years and that they could well assume the proportions of a national catastrophe through no fault of their own of course i believe i concluded by wishing the whole parcel of them back in africa he was shocked strange talk this says he from the sponsor of a bill against slavery id sponsor a bill to improve bad drains says i theyre a confounded nuisance too a thoughtless remark no doubt and a faulty analogy but i paid for it good god cries he youll not compare human souls with bad drains surely not invariably says i but i got no further because he stalked off in a rage having misunderstood me completely you can hardly blame him says the other smiling no says lincoln he was a man of principle and conscience his only fault lay in his inability to perceive that i have both commodities also but i didnt buy mine readymade from cincinnati and i dont permit either to blind me to reality i hope and that reality is that the slave question is much too serious a matter for emotion yet i very much fear that emotion will override reason in its settlement in the meantime i pray to god i am wrong and continue to fight it in my own way which i believe to be as worthy as polemical journalism and the underground railroad after that the talk turned to the great california gold strike that i had first heard of at roatan and which was obsessing everyone the first rumours had spoken of fabulous wealth for the taking then word had spread that the first reports had been greatly exaggerated and now it was being said that the first reports had been true enough and it was the rumours of disappointment that were false thousands were already heading west braving the seas round cape horn or the perils of starvation weather and indian savages on the overland trails most of the men at that dinner agreed that there was obviously gold in quantity along the pacific streams but doubted if many of the enthusiastic seekers would find quite as much as they expected you are the cynic abraham says one what will the tennessee wiseacres say of the new eldorado when the laugh died down lincoln shook his head if they are real tennessee wiseacres senator they wont say nuthin but what theyll do if theyre real wiseacres is buy themselves up every nail every barrelstave every axehandle and every shovel they can lay hold on put em all in a cart with as many barrels of molasses as may be convenient haul em all up to independence or the kanzas and sell them to the fortunate emigrants at ten times their value thats how to make gold out of a gold strike well you can handle a team surely cries the merry senator why not make your fortune out of axehandles well sir ill tell you says lincoln and everyone listened grinning ive just put the return on axehandles at one thousand per centum but im a politician and sometime lawyer axehandles arent my style my stockintrade is spoken words you may believe me words can be obtained wholesale a powerful sight cheapern axehandles and if you take em to the right market youll get a far richer return for em than a thousand per cen turn if you doubt me ask president polk they guffawed uproariously at this and presently we went to join the ladies for the usual ghastly entertainment which i discovered differed not one whit from our english variety there was singing and reading from the poetic works of sir walter scott and during this lincoln drew me aside into a window alcove very pleasant and began asking me various questions about my african voyage he listened very attentively to my replies and then suddenly said i tell you what you can enlighten me a phrase puzzled me the other day in an english novel as a matter of fact youre a naval man what does it mean to clubhaul a ship for a moments my innards froze but i dont believe i showed it this was the kind of thing i had dreaded a question on nautical knowledge which i the supposed naval man couldnt have answered in a thousand years why says i lets see now clubhauling well to tell you the truth mr lincoln its difficult to explain to a landsman dont ye know it involves well quite complicated manoeuvres you see yes says he i thought it might but in general terms now what happens i laughed pleasantly perplexed if i had you aboard i could easily tell you or if we had a ship model you know he nodded smiling at me surely its of no consequence i just have an interest in the sea mr comber and must be indulging it at the expense of every sailor who is unlucky enough to lay alongside me as youd call it he laughed thats another thing now i recall forgive my curiosity but what precisely is longsplicing i knew then he was after me in spite of the pleasant almost sleepy expression in the dark eyes his canny yokel style didnt fool me i gave him back some of his own banter while my heart began to hammer with alarm its akin to splicing the mainbrace mr lincoln says i and is a term which anyone who is truly interested in the sea would have found out from a nautical almanac long ago he gave a little snorting laugh forgive me of course i wasnt really interested just testing a little theory of mine what theory is that sir asks i my knees shaking oh just that you mr comber if that is your name might not be quite so naval as you appear no dont alarm yourself its no business of mine at all blame my legal training which has turned a harmless enough fellow into a confounded busybody ive spent too long in courtrooms perhaps seeking after truth and seldom finding it maybe im of an unusually suspicious nature mr comber but i confess i am downright interested when i meet an english navy man who doesnt smother his food with salt who doesnt out of instinct tap his bread on the table before he bites it and who doesnt even hesitate before jumping up like a jackrabbit when his queens health is proposed just a fraction of a moments pause would seem more natural in a gentleman who is accustomed to drinking that particular toast sitting down he grinned with his head on one side but all these things are trivial they amount to nothing until the illmannered busybody also finds out that this same english navy man doesnt know what clubhauling and longsplicing are either even then i could still be entirely mistaken i frequently am sir says i tiying to sound furious with my legs on the point of giving way i fail to understand you i am a british officer and i hope a gentleman oh i dont doubt it says he but even that isnt conclusive proof that youre a rascal you see mr comber i cant be sure i just suspect that youre a humbug but i couldnt for the life of me prove it he scratched his ear grinning like a gargoyle and anyway its just none of my business i guess the truth is im a bit of a humbug myself and feel a kind of duty to other humbugs anyway im certainly not fool enough to pass on my ridiculous observations and suspicions to anyone else i just thought you might be interested to hear about the salt and the bread and so forth said this amazing fellow shall we go and listen to them laying it off about the last minstrel it was touch and go at this point whether i launched myself head first through the open window or not for a moment it seemed that the wiser course might well be headlong flight but then i steadied i cannot impress too strongly on young fellows that the whole secret of the noble art of survival for a single man lies in knowing exactly when to make your break for safety i considered this now with lincoln smiling down at me sardonically and decided it was better to brazen things through than to bolt he knew i was an impostor but he could hardly prove it and for some whimsical reason of his own he seemed to regard the whole thing as a joke so i gave him my blandest smile and said i confess sir that i have no idea what youre talking about let us by all means rejoin the company i think it puzzled him but he said nothing more and we turned back into the room i kept a bold front but i was appalled at being discovered and the rest of that evening passed in a confused panic for me i recall that i was dragooned into singing the bass part in a group song i believe it was tis of a sailor bold but lately come ashore which no doubt caused mr lincoln some ironic amusement but beyond that i can remember little except that eventually we all took our leave and fairbrother carried me off to quarters at the navy department where i spent a sleepless night wondering how i could get out of this latest fix they would send me back to new orleans assuming that the prying bumpkin lincoln kept his suspicions to himself which seemed likely and it was imperative that i should take french leave before there was any risk of my confronting the balliol college crew at their trial washington was no place to try to decamp so that left baltimore or new orleans i favoured the former but as it turned out there was no opportunity for when the navy department finally finished with me on the following morning i was sent back with fairbrother to his brig and he took me straight aboard we sailed within a few hours so there was nothing to do but resign myself to sitting out the voyage and make plans for escaping when we reached louisiana what i would do when i slipped away i didnt know if my own mother wit couldnt get me back to england hale and sound i wasnt the man i thought i was when youve come safe through an afghan rising and a german revolution with all manner of cutthroats on your tail you regard evasion from the united states as a pretty smooth course even if they set the traps after you for slaverunning and impersonation as fairbrother and his superiors eventually would do i fancied i could manage passably well if i minded my step oh the optimism of youth if id known what lay along the path to england home and beauty id have surrendered then and there told fairbrother the whole truth and taken my chance in a slavery trial any day thank god ive never had the gift of second sight the closer we got to new orleans the worse my prospects of successful desertion looked and by the time we dropped anchor at the big bend in the mississippi river off customs house levee i was well in the dumps having nothing to unload you see except me the brig stood well out in midstream so my notion of slipping down a gangplank to the quay was quite out of court we hove to at night with the whole splendid panorama of lights twinkling on either bank the glow of algiers to port and the french quarter to starboard but it was lost on me fairbrother was to take me ashore personally in the morning so my only hope must be to give him the slip when we landed i already had a good idea of what my first moves would be when i had won free so i set about my preparations first i went through the clothes which i hadnt worn since i first boarded the balliol college and which had been bundled up in my valise there was a superb coat by gregg of bond street in fine plum broadcloth now foully creased but i borrowed an iron from the steward waved away his offers of help and working secretly in my cabin soon put it to rights and sponged out the stains it had taken i had two good pairs of trousers excellent boots from todd a smart grey embroidered waistcoat several shirts which were beyond redemption and a fine neckercher of black china silk that was my wardrobe the coat and neckercher at least could be counted on for what i had in mind my other valuables consisted of a ruby pin and an oldfashioned gold and silver chain with seals which had belonged to my grandfather paget they could pawn for a tidy sum but i hoped this would be unnecessary as i had a more immediate use for them for the rest i had eleven gold sovereigns which would tide me over the beginning at least having completed my inventory i packed everything carefully in my valise and next morning when fairbrother took me ashore i stood forth in the dothes he had lent me since i should be staying ashore when he had presented me to the proper authorities it was natural that my valise should go with me in the boat we were rowed to the algiers side by four bluejackets fairbrother sweating in full fig and as we neared the bank my spirits rose the levee and wharves were positively teeming with people there was a forest of shipping along the bank with small craft scudding about everywhere hallnaked negroes toiling at the derricks as cargo was swung ashore folk bustling about every which way on the jettys nigger children playing and squealing among the piles ships officers and cargo bosses bawling above the hubbub a tremendous confusion of thousands of busy people which was just what i wanted at need i had been prepared to bolt for it but i didnt have to while i was handed ashore at the levee and one of the men swung up my valise fairbrother stopped a moment to give orders to the coxswain i picked up my baggage took three steps and in that moment i was lost in the throng jostling my way quickly along the wharf i didnt even hear a shout from the boat in two minutes i was striding along through the heaps of cargo and cotton bales and when i glanced back there wasnt a glimpse of fairbrother and his men to be seen they would be gaping around no doubt swearing at my carelessness at having got lost and would start a hunt for me but it would be an hour or so before they began to suspicion that my disappearance wasnt accidental then the fun would begin in earnest now i had considered carefully the possibility of trying to board an outgoing ship immediately and had dismissed the notion when fairbrother and his navy friends eventually decided i had slipped my cable there would be a tremendous hue and cry and the first places they would look for me would be on departing ships i couldnt be sure of finding a vessel that would be out and away before that happened anyway i hadnt much passage money so i had determined to lie low in new orleans until i could see what was best to be done and then carefully pick my best passage home perhaps from another port altogether so now when i had put a quarter of a mile between myself and the spot where the boat touched i halted on the levee waited till i spotted a likelylooking craft among the hundreds that were putting in and out along the bank and asked its rower to carry me over to the north shore he was a big grinning nigger with brass rings in his ears who chattered unceasingly in a queer mixture of french and english and in no time at all he set me down on the levee from which you walked up to the vieux carrй the old french quarter which is the very heart of new orleans i paid him in english shillings which didnt bother him at all provided its gold or silver the orleanais dont care whose head is on it there is no city quite like new orleans i loved it at first sight and i believe that setting aside london which is my home and calcutta which has a magic that i cannot hope to explain i still think more kindly of it than of any other place on earth it was busy and gay and bawdy and full of music and drink and pleasure nowhere else did eyes sparkle so bright voices sound so happy colours look so vivid food taste so rich or the very air throb with so much excitement in the unlikely event that there is a heaven for scoundrels like me it will be built on the model of the vieux carrй with its smiling women brilliant clothes and atmosphere of easy indulgence the architecture is also very fine spires and gracious buildings and what not with plenty of shade and places to lounge and sit about while you watch the ivory girls sauntering by in their gorgeous dresses indeed it was sometimes not unlike a kind of tropical paris but without those bloody frogs new orleans of course is where they civilised the french the first thing i did was to find a barber and let him remove the fine black beard which i had sprouted in the past two or three months i kept my whiskers of course where would flash be without his tartcatchers but had my hair trimmed fairly short to suit the role i intended to play then i passed on to a good tailor and laid out most of my cash on a new finelyfrilled shirt in the southern style a silvertopped cane and a curlybrimmed white stovepipe hat finally i sought out a printer in one of the back streets spun him a tale and placed an order for a gross of cards in the name of count rudi von starnberg which was my new identity it warmed me to think of how rudi would have delighted in this evil throatcutting b d that he was i had the printer who was all eagerness to oblige such a distinguished gentleman run me off half a dozen of the cards then and there for immediate use and promising to send round for the remainder next day when they would be ready bade him good morning i had no intention of collecting them of course and doubtless they are still there it occurred to me that if rudi ever visited america he might find himself billed for them which would have been most satisfactory now i was ready to face the united states in all my glory an immaculately dressed austrian nobleman speaking french and english with the accent of vienna and as different as you could wish from some english scoundrel calling himself comber who had vanished bearded and nautically attired some hours before true i had little cash and no place of abode but you would never have imagined that from a glance at the splendid gentleman who now strolled at ease through the vieux carrй stopping to refresh himself with wine and water at one of the wayside cafйs glancing over a newspaper and generally spying out the land i spent a few hours getting the sense of the place dined extremely well at a creole eating place where they had the good sense not to smother everying in garlic and then went to work what i did in my quest for quarters for the night was to test a theory suggested to me years before by old avitabile the italian soldier of fortune who had been governor of peshawar when youre likea light in the pocket boy in a strange town you got to find a whorehouse see an wheedlewheedle your way roun the madame you know do i got to tell you no sir your shoulders an moustaches jus likea mine its likea fall under a log you charm you talk you tell any goddam lies but you get that madame into bed boomboomboom why shes glad to lodge you for a week ne mind for a night didnt avitabile travel clear from lisbon to paris an i didnt pay one nights lodging nota one you bet goddam it does a gentleman got to stay in hotels well if he could do it so could i and towards evening i set out to find a likely bawdy house this in new orleans was childs play there may have been establishments in the vieux carrй which were not bordellos but precious few all i had to do was find one with a susceptible madame and take my ease for a few days it took me all evening and four false starts what i did in each case was to select a goodclass house send my card up to the proprietress by the nigger porter and then address myself to the archharpy herself i had a story all ready and even now i must say it sounds not half bad i explained that i was an austrian gentleman in search of his sister who had eloped with a profligate englishman and been abandoned by him during a visit to the united states since then we had heard nothing of her except an unconfirmed report that she had somehow found her way into into er an establishment such as madame was conducting we were beside ourselves with grief and horror and here was i the son of the family on a tragic quest to find the erring creature and bring her back to the bosom of her distracted but unforgiving parents her name was charlotte she was a mere eighteen blonde and of exquisite beauty could madame render me any assistance in tracing her money of course was of no object if only i could rescue my dear wilful sister from the dreadful plight into which she had fallen this of course was purely introductory to let me sum up the madame and see if she was likely game the first four werent beaky sharpeyed old harridans whom i wouldnt have galloped for a pension anyway but they swallowed the story no doubt it sounded well coming from sixfoot harry with his curly whiskers and melancholy brown eyes to say nothing of his wellcut clobber and light cavalry airs three of them even went the length of making fruitless inquiries among their staffs the fourth im afraid didnt fully understand me she said she had never heard of my sister but she would undertake to procure her for me for seventyfive dollars as with the others i bade her a courtly goodnight thanked her profusely and withdrew at the fifth knockingshop i struck pure gold it was a splendid establishment all plush and crystal with a nigger band playing wild music and in the saloons off the main hall the finest of trollops on view willowy creatures of every colour from cream to jet black with beautiful gowns cut away so that their breasts were bare and strutting like duchesses it was plain to see that outside new orleans fornication was still in its infancy however i had no time for these distractions my business was with the madame and as soon as i was ushered upstairs into her private apartment i knew i was home she was nearing fifty a stately buxom piece who must have been a rare beauty and was still handsome running to fat but well laced up in a green velvet gown which looked as though it must burst asunder at any moment she was painted and powdered and jewelled like a may day cuddy with an ostrich plume in her reddyed hair and a big peacock fan which she used to disclose her fine bust and shoulders it was this and the quizzy gleam in her eye as she sized me up and down that convinced me i need look no farther here was one who fancied flashy no error the fact that she appeared to have been at the bottle already that evening may have helped she swayed a mite too much as she walked even for a retired strumpet she was all affability and to my astonishment when she invited me to take a seat and state my requirements her voice was purest bow bells honnered to ave a gentleman of the nobility calling at hower little hestablishnt says she simpering and pressing my hand warmly ow may we be of service pray well thinks i if i cant charm this one flat on her back ive lost my way with women it took me exactly threequarters of an hour by her fine grandfather clock which i thought quite smart work on first acquaintance ten minutes disposed of my mythical sister of whom my plump hostess had naturally never heard although she expressed touching dismay another ten were spent in idle gossip after which she suggested some refreshment and i sipped a very reasonable moselle while she fluttered her eyelids and shoved her tits at me after half an hour we were quite intimate and i was murmuring in her ear and tweaking her bottom while she giggled and called me a great sauce with forty minutes gone i was unbuttoning her dress at the back i have uncanny skill at this and in a trice i had her standing in her corset before she could turn round i had impaled her and was subsiding into a chair with her on my lap she gave one protesting squeal of oh lor and then lay back against me god what a weight she was i thought my thighbones would crack but i bulled away for all i was worth and the baggage revelled in it plunging and writhing until i thought we must go over chair and all the clock chimed the threequarters i remember just as we finished this broke the ice splendidly of course and to cut a longish and damned tiring story short i didnt spend only the night at mrs susie willincks establishment but the best part of a week avitabile was absolutely right you see if you manage to get round a madame youre made but i must say in honesty that i doubt if many madames are as susceptible as susie was she proved to be one of those rare creatures who are even jollier and nicer and randier than they look give her a man who was handsome and impudent and made her laugh and was a good mount and she would do anything for him so it followed naturally that she took to me from the start of course the fact that i was english helped she found that out smartly enough on the first night the shrewd old strumpet but instead of being furious at the way id imposed on her she just shook with laughter and called me a bonny young rascal and hauled me on to the sofa again i had to tell her my name was comber and that i was on the run from the american navy which was true in its way although she naturally took it that i was a deserter she didnt care i was something new and a lusty rogue and that was enough for her mind you i earned my keep ive always been able to keep pace with most women but this one when roused was like a succubus gone berserk she had a knack of getting astride of me pinning me down with her weight and going to work in her own way it was fearful for the randy trollop would tease and plague me for close on an hour until i was nearly bursting and by the time she was done i would be ecstatically ruined and certain sure id never be able to present arms again on the other hand she could be as soft as mush and cry over me afterwards which was rather disturbing at first i put it down to her fondness for port but in fact it was just that she was a genuinely sentimental soul where lively young men were concerned anyway mind you i wasnt complaining either way i realised i was uncommon lucky to have found just the billet i was looking for and ill say this for susie although she was like a wild beast in bed she was damned good to me during my stay with her i soon recognised that it wasnt just that she was unusually partial to adams arsenal she was one of these largehearted females who cant go to bed with a man without conceiving an affection for him and wanting to cherish and own him even she was as soft in that way as any woman i can remember which was remarkable for she knew men and was far too worldlywise to have any illusions about me she must have seen i was a wrong un from the minute she laid eyes on me and especially when she realised i was only romping her for the sake of a few nights lodging but although she knew i was the kind of heartless scoundrel who would use her shamelessly and then slide out when it suited me she couldnt help liking me apparently she knew after the first couple of days that she was growing too fond of me and it frightened her so that she wished me away at the same time as she wanted me to stay this aint flashys vanity by the way she admitted it herself when id been there about four days and spoke about moving on i otter be thankful says she youre as big a villain as the rest worse probly i know youll just break my heart in the end if you stay thinking back to the previous night it struck me that whatever was in danger of breaking belonged to me and it wasnt my heart oh come now its short acquaintance to be talking like that says i you would though says she smiling kind of wry i know your sort an whats worse i know me i was a fool even to let you in the ouse youd think with all ive seen an the rotten swine ive known that id ave more sense ive been ere before you men you dont care a button its just another rattle to you an thanks ever so dearie an goodnight but i like you too much as it is an i know what comes of that another two days an youd be bored an a flabby ol faggot like me cant old a man against the kind of merchandise there is in this ouse little yellow sluts with hard titties humph she shook her head the trouble is itd hurt i spose you think thats funny from an ol bag like me no says i but since im not staying anyway you neednt worry ill tell you this much i may not love you susie but i like you and youre a damned sight better in bed than any of your fellow girls would be gammon says she hitting me with her fan but she looked pleased she didnt believe me for a moment of course but for once i wasnt buttering her its one of the great truths that young pieces arent in it where lovemaking is concerned compared with their mothers and aunts who have been about long enough to enjoy it for the real thing give me a wellfleshed matron every time with her eyes wide open and a mind of her own but women of course will never credit this the difficulty about my leaving of course was that the best way to get out of new orleans was by the river and that meant running the gauntlet of the navy people who might be looking for me thanks to susie whose acquaintances were legion there was no trouble about getting a passage to england and it was arranged that i should go two days later on a packet bound for liverpool one advantage to it was that she would weigh anchor at night when id have a good chance of slipping aboard unnoticed there was the question of my fare and here susie turned up trumps she would advance me the cash not she said that she expected it back i protested at this and she laughed and chucked me under the chin ive heard that an all says she if id a guinea for every dollar ive given to stake a man out of town id be a rich woman an never once did i see a penny of it back oh i know youre full o good intentions now when you need the cash but come next week youll ave forgotten all about it ill pay it back susie says i i promise ducky says she id rather not honest i dont want to hear from you no more really i dont why ever not oh hold your tongue snaps she and turned away dabbing at herself there now me facell be all to do up again go on let me alone and she went off sniffing which i must admit i found very gratifying you may think ive dwelt on my meeting with susie at some length but theres reason for it for one thing it may be a valuable pointer to young men who come after and who find themselves adrift in a strange town secondly it had a bearing on my life many years on as my later memoirs will show and she was unique too among all the women ive known she must be about the only one that i never had hard feelings with on either side and she could touch me somehow at least i remember thinldng the night i left that in all the journeys id set off on before never a woman had been at such pains to see i had everything packed and ready and that my clothes were brushed and my money safe and the rest of it she fussed over me in a way that none of the others wife aunts mistresses whores legions of them had ever done its strange and no doubt significant that the warmest leavetaking i remember should be from a bawdyhouse i set out about ten with a nigger carrying my valise and susie hustled me away give us a kiss dearie now be off with you ave a glass in the cider cellars for me she was absolutely crying the soft old slut an take care of yourself you you big scallawag you we slipped out of the side gate into the alley it was one of those lazy warm nights with many stars and above the hum of the town i could hear a distant steamboat whistle on the river where my ship the anglesey queen would be lying we set off down the dark lane together and just as we reached its end a dark shadow loomed up before us and i was aware of others suddenly coming in at my back i stopped dead and the figure in front of me a tall man in a broadbrimmed hat said hold it right there mister hands away from your sides now dont make a move because youre covered front and rear i must have heard the same sort of thing barked at me in a dozen different languages and it has never failed to paralyse me on the spot my first thought was that these must be american navy men and my heart froze inside me how the devil had they traced me could i bolt but there wasnt a hope they knew their business too well one a couple of yards dead ahead and two others on my flanks slightly behind me but if i couldnt bolt i could bluff wer ruft mich i demanded trying to sound angry was wollen sie dont come your dutch on me mr comber says the big one and that settled it they were navy men and i was done for you nigger gimme that bag he went on billy take him down to the levee and let him go and now mister you step ahead right lively do as youre told and you wont get hurt try to run and youre a dead man sick with fear i started forward with the big man and his mate right behind me down a sidestreet and then at their direction into a maze of alleys until i had no earthly idea where i was why were they taking me out of the main ways and why had they taken the nigger to the levee before letting him go my gd were they going to murder me and at that instant the big fellow growls stop right there and came up beside me at this my nerve broke what dyou want with me what are you going to do in gods name if youre the navy i can explain i can we aint the navy says he shortly and we aint gonna hurt you and amazingly he added youre the last man on gods earth id want to hurt i gaped at him trying to make out the shadowy face beneath the hat brim but he went on ive got a black bag here and im gonna put it over your head so you dont see where youre goin now dont fret yeself do as youre told an youll come to no harm he slipped the bag over my head and i choked in its coarse muffled folds panicking but he took my arm and said straight ahead now easy does it we walked for three hundred and sixty eight paces through innumerable turns and then stopped i heard a gate creak and when we went forward there was gravel beneath my feet then up stone steps and a door opened and we were in a house forward up stairs thickly carpeted too i was suffocating with dread and astonishment by the time we had passed down a wellcarpeted corridor and i heard knuckles knock on a door and a voice call enter i was pushed forward the bag was whipped from my head and as the door closed behind me i found myself blinking in the light of a great wellfurnished library behind a big oak desk a little baldheaded man was standing eyeing me benevolently over his spectacles and waving a hand to an empty chair pray be seated mr comber and before you assail me with angry protests which youre perfectly entitled to do i confess allow me to extend my most sincere and heartfelt apologies for the rather er cavalier manner of my invitation now wont you be seated sir please no one intends you the least harm quite the contrary i assure you sit down sir do who the blazes are you i demanded he was obviously friendly and a kindlylooking little fellow in his oldfashioned neckercher and breeches with bright grey eyes that peered eagerly at me and whats the meaning of this now that i was halfpast fear i was prepared to be angry there now thats exactly what i mean to tell you if youll only be seated says he soothingly thats better a glass of port no perhaps brandy would be better settling for the nerves eh though i dont think yours are nerves that need much settling young man from all ive heard well ill always take brandy when its kindly offered so i fastened on the glass and gulped a mouthful down and as he went back to his desk i took stock of the richlyfurnished room with its fine carpet and dark panelling and found myself reassured if bewildered now then says he that feels better eh well mr comber i owe you an explanation as well as an apology so you shall have it he was american but welleducated and when you took a closer view of him you saw that he wasnt quite such an old cheeryble as he looked let me begin by astonishing you i have been waiting to make your acquaintance this past few days indeed if you hadnt left tonight to board the anglesey queen there there sir all shall be made plain presently i was preparing to come and call on you oh yes i much wanted to meet you we have kept a very close eye on you indeed sir since you arrived in washington although i confess we lost you for a moment when you gave the good captain fairbrother the slip he chuckled very neat that of course we quite understood quite understood didnt we this was bewildering but i had my nerve back did you if you understand so much you wont mind enlightening me who or what are you are you american government he smiled no not exactly although we have great influence and many highlyplaced friends in that same government that government which im afraid has been rather embarrassing you lately with insistent questions naturally youre in possession of what i believe one senior official called dangerous information and washington wants it but you want to take it straight home to england perfectly right sir so you gave them the slip and behold you tonight preparing to set sail secretly for liverpool he hadnt quite got hold of the wrong end of the stick you see but very nearly his only mistake lay in believing that i was comber and in deducing the wrong reason for my attempted flight from new orleans a flight which rot him he was putting in severe jeopardy then would you kindly tell me says i why you have hauled me here at gunpoint instead of letting me catch my ship in heavens name sir i must get aboard her you would never have got aboard her says he the navy department want you mr comber as a witness against those slaver friends of yours and the us government i know wish to question you further about those certain names you have in your head slavetrade names i believe and suddenly he wasnt a genial little buffer any more his mouth was like a rattrap believe me mr comber the levee is wellwatched they know which way youll try to go and by what right would they try to stop me says i brazening by george if they ever found out i wasnt comber theyd have right enough maybe they had found out but if they had my onmiscient little friend evidently hadnt oh no right at all says he but governments can generally arrange diplomatic reasons for delaying departures i suppose they might hold on to you for a few weeks until your ambassador pressed them into letting you go home by then washington would hope you might have let slip those names they want to know about i saw i must play combers part for all i was worth so i smiled grimly they have no hope of that those names are for my chiefs in london and no one else and if you think whoever you are that you can get them out of me my dear mr comber he held up a hand im not interested my concern with the slave trade lies in quite another direction the same direction i believe as your own that is why you are here that is why my agents have traced you even into the house of ill fame where you took refuge well thinks i i hope they didnt trace too close or they must have got an eyeful thus we knew of the passage home its proprietress arranged for you i take it she is an english antislavery agent but there the less said the better thus we were able to intercept you tonight you know a lot says i now look here ive heard everything but what i want to know who are you and what dyou want with me he looked at me steadily you have heard i am sure of the underground railroad six months earlier i wouldnt have known what he meant but when youve been in the company of slavers as i had been you recognise the phrase spring had mentioned it id heard it spoken about lowvoiced in susies brothel its a secret society for stealing slaves and helping them to escape isnt it to canada it is an organisation for saving souls snaps he and once again he didnt look half amiable it is an army that fights the most horrible tyranny of our time the blasphemous iniquity of black slavery it is an army without colours or ranks or pay an army of dedicated men and women who labour secretly to release their black brethren from bondage and give them liberty yes we steal slaves yes we run them to free soil yes we die for doing it like them we are hunted with dogs and tortured and hanged and shot if we are caught by the brutes who own and trade in human flesh but we do it gladly because we are marching in christs army sir and we will not lay down our weapons until the last shackle is broken the last branding iron smashed the last rawhide whip burned and the last slave free i gathered he was an abolitionist by gad he was in a fine sweat about it too but now he sat back and spoke in a normal voice forgive me as though i need to say such things to you why you take a thousand risks for our one you put your life in the hazard in the nethermost hell of this foul traffic oh we know all about you mr comber as you yourself said in a certain washington office walls have ears the underground railroad has ears certainly and it heard your name in washington and the heroic work you did in bringing the balliol college and that scoundrel spring to book which reminds me of a privilege i had promised myself tonight but have overlooked he got to his feet mr comber may i have the honour to shake your hand and blow me he seized my fist and pumped it hard enough to start water out of me i didnt mind but the thought occurred to me here i was again being congratulated on my dauntless devotion when all the time it had been frantic poltroonery but it had done the trick which just goes to show we also serve who only turn and run thank you sir thank you says he you have made me a happy man now may i tell you how you may make me happier still i wasnt sure about this but i sat down again and listened i couldnt decide whether this little blighter was going to turn out well for me or not as you know we of the underground railroad rescue slaves wherever we can from plantations markets pens wherever they may be and send them north secretly to the free states beyond the ohio river and the mason dixon line alone they could never hope to make the journey so we send with them our agents who pose as slaveowners and slavedealers and convoy the unfortunates to safety it is perilous work as i have said and our roll of martyrs grows longer every day this is a savage country sir and while there are many in government who love and assist our work government itself cannot condone or protect us because we break the law mans law not gods we are criminals sir in the eyes of our country but we are proud of our crimes he was almost away again but checked himself now all slaves are important to us however lowly but some are more important than others such a one is george randolph have you heard of him no well you shall you have heard of nat turner the slave who led a great rebellion in virginia and was barbarously executed by his tormentors well randolph is such another but a greater man better educated more intelligent with a greater vision twice he has tried to organise insurrection twice he has failed three times he has escaped twice he has been recaptured he is a fugitive at this moment but we have him safe and god willing they shall never take him again comber would have applauded so i said oh bravo and looked pleased bravo indeed says he and then looked solemn but all is not done randolph must be taken in safety to canada what a blow that will be in our cause why sir think of what such a man can do when he is on free soil he can talk he can write he can go abroad not only in canada but in england in our own free states i tell you sir the burning words of such a man striking the ears of the civilised world will do more to rekindle the fire against slavery than all our white journalists and orators can accomplish the world will see a man like themselves and yet greater a man fit for a chair in our finest universities or to sit in the highest councils of a nation but a black man sir with the whipmarks on his back and the shacklescars on his legs they will understand as they have never understood what slavery is they will feel the whip and shackles on their own bodies and they will cry out this infamy shall not be well it seemed to call for something so i said capital firstrate this news will be welcomed with joy in england im sure and as soon as i am home again you may rely but mr comber says he this is still to be achieved george randolph is not in canada yet he is still here a hunted runaway the journey to freedom lies ahead of him but is that difficult for your splendid organisation i mean you have shown me tonight how farreaching it is why you know as much about me as i do myself almost your agents oh we have many agents our intelligence system is extensive we have an eye at every window in this land sir and an ear at every door information is no difficulty but most of our spies are black most are still slaves collecting intelligence is one thing but running slaves to canada is quite another here we need white agents dedicated resolute and bold and these are pitifully few many are willing but only a handful are able and even then they have become too well known of the gallant young men who ran our last three convoys one is dead one in jail and the third in canada unable to return because he would certainly be arrested i have not one that i can send with randolph sir not one that i could trust for with a cargo of such importance i cannot risk sending any but the hardiest the bravest the least suspected do you see my plight sir every day that randolph hides in new orleans his danger grows the enemy has spies also i must get him out and quickly can you understand i understood all right but ass that i was i didnt see what it had to do with me i suggested sending him by sea impossible the risk is too great ironically his safest route is the one that would appear most dangerous up the mississippi to the free states one slave in a coffle may pass unnoticed my one fearful problem is the white agent to go with him i tell you mr comber i was at my wits end and then in answer to my prayers i had word of you from washington and that you would be coming to orleans i absolutely said christ but he was in full spate i saw then that god had sent you not only are you a man dedicated to fighting the abomination of slavery but you are one who scorns danger who has come unscathed through perils ten times greater than this who has the experience the intelligence nay the brilliance and the cold courage such an enterprise requires and above all this you are not known he smacked his fist on the table excitedly if i had all the world to choose from i should have asked for such a man as you you who i had never heard of ten days ago mr comber will you do this for me and strike yet another greater blow above all those you have surely struck already well of all the appalling nonsense i had ever heard this beat everything even bismarck by george they were two of a kind the same fanatic gleam in the eye the same fierce determination to thrust a hapless fellowhuman into the stew head first to further their own lunatic schemes but bismarck had had a pistol to my head this idiot hadnt i was on the point of telling him straight what i thought of his revolting suggestion laughing right in his eager little face and i suddenly checked i was comber how would he have refused my god he probably wouldnt the reckless fool i had to go very canny well sir well is this not such a crusade as your heart desires there was a fine short answer to that but i darent give it sir says i tlth is a startling proposal oh you honour me indeed you do but sir my duty is to my country i must return at once he laughed exultantly but of course and you shall you may do this thing and be in england faster than if you wait here to catch a packet home listen sir you would go upriver by steamboat as a slavetrader with a coffle for kentucky let us say but you sail straight on to cincinnati why you will be there in six days pass randolph to our agent there and continue to pittsburgh you may be in new york in a week or a little more from now sir and a sailing there will have you home far more speedily than a boat from orleans if you could even get one here remember the navy are watching for you but sir i protested cudgelling fearfully for excuses con sider the danger not to me but to my own mission the information i hold if i went astray would be lost to my own government and yours i have thought of it cries he of course he would rot his measly little soul you may commit it to paper here sir this very night under seal and i swear upon my honour it shall go straight to london no one in washington no one at all shall see it you have my word but mr comber he went on earnestly there is no risk of that you will come through without the slightest danger no slavecatcher will give you a second glance they know us sir but not you and you will be serving the cause dear to your heart i implore you sir say you will aid us in this well i knew the cause dear to my heart if he didnt sir says i i am sorry believe me i would aid you if i could but my duty must come above my personal inclination but you will be doing that duty dont you see better than if you refuse for if you do why then i could only apologise for bringing you here and send you back to the navy department i should be reluctant it would delay you still further for they would keep you here for the trial of spring and his pirates but that would plainly be my only course so there it was blackmail the pious little scoundrel oh he was twinkling solemnly he thought you see that all i had to fear from being delivered back to the clutches of the navy and the us government was delay and more inconvenient questioning he didnt know that if i appeared at the balliol college trial my true identity must appear and it would be into the dock for flashy with the rest of the crew then it would be prison my god they might even hang us against that the risk which he said was no risk of running a fugitive nigger to ohio he had me the little serpent but he didnt know how he had me and he mustnt find out well if i refused him i was done for that was sure so presumably i must accept i tried to think straight tried to reason tried to see a way out but couldnt my innards quailed at what he had proposed but it was only a risk against a certainty and he didnt think the risk was much at all not that i put any faith in that what could i do though ive been trapped so often between two loathsome choices and its in my cowards nature to choose what seems the less dangerous that was all i could do now at this moment and see what turned up yes that was it i must accept and be ready to fly at the first hint of danger if i must take this lout randolph north well there it was if things went adrift id slide out somehow id deny him if i had to but if all went well and the chances were they would why id be half way home with spring and the us navy and the rest far astern looking back i can only say it seemed the lesser of two evils well ive been wrong before when you have to bow the knee do it with grace very well sir says i looking solemn i must accept i must combine duty and i forced myself to look him in the eye with the desire of my heart which is to assist you and your worthy cause comber couldnt have said it better and the little monster was all over me he wrung my hand and called me a saviour and then he got businesslike again he called in another chap a longfaced zealot this one and introduced me our own names he added to me i think it wiser not to divulge to you mr comber i choose to be known as mr crixus which you will no doubt consider appropriate haha and then it was all joy and good fellowship and be damned they were so delighted and my mind was in a turmoil but i couldnt for the life of me see a way clear crixus bustled about calling in two other chaps who i suspected were the men who had brought me and told them the glad news and they shook hands too and blessed me full of solemn delight yes they said all was ready and the sooner things were started the better crixus nodded eagerly rubbing his hands and then beamed at me and now i promise myself another little pleasure i told you mr comber that george randolph was in hiding he is in this house and it shall now be my privilege to present to each other two of the greatest champions of our cause come gentlemen so we filed out downstairs and came to the back of the house and into a plain room where a young nigger was sitting at a table writing by the light of an oil lamp he looked up but didnt rise and one sight of his face told me that here was a fellow i didnt like above half he was about my age slim but tall and a quadroon he had a white mans face bar the thickish lips with fine brows and a most arrogant damnyoumelad expression he sat while crixus poured out the tale turning his pencil in his hand and when he had been told that here was the man who would pilot him to the promised land and crixus had got round to presenting me he got up languidly and held out a fine brown hand i took it and it was like a womans and then he dropped it and turned to crixus you are in no doubt says he his voice was cold and very precise a right uppity white nigger this one was we cannot afford a mistake this time there have been too many in the past well this took me flat aback for a moment i almost forgot my own fears and crixus to my astonishment was all eagerness to reassure him none george none as i have told you mr comber is a proved fighter on our side you could not be in better hands ah says randolph and sat down again that is very well then he understands the importance of my reaching canada now tell me exactly how do we proceed from here i take it the modus operandi is as we have already discussed it and that mr comber is capable of falling in with it precisely i just gaped i dont know what i had expectedone of your woollyheaded darkies i suppose massaing everyone and pathetically grateful that someone was going to risk his neck to help him to freedom but not your lord george bloody randolph no indeed youd have thought he was doing crixus a favour as the old fellow went through the plan and our runaway sat nodding and occasionally frowning putting in his points and pursing his lips like a judge on the bench finally he says very well it should answer satisfactorily i cannot pretend that i welcome some of the er details to be chained in a gang of blacks that is a degradation which i had hoped was behind me but since it must be he gave crixus a pained little smile why it must be endured i suppose it is a small price to pay my spirit can sustain it i hope it can george it can cries crixus after all you have suffered it is a little thing the last little thing ah yes always the last little thing says randolph we know about the camel do we not and the final feather do you know when i look back i ask myself how i have borne it and this as you say is a trifle why should it seem so bitter a trifle but there he shrugged and then turned in his chair to look at me i was still standing too and you sir you know the gravity of what lies before us your task should not be hard merely to ride on a steamboat in rather greater comfort than i shall be are you confident of yes yes george says crixus mr comber knows i talked to to him in the library ah says randolph in the library he looked about him with a little crooked smile in the library oh now george cries crixus you know we agreed it was safer here i know randolph held up a slim hand it is of no importance however i was speaking to mr comber yes you will have been told sir how vitally important is this journey of ours so i ask again do you trust yourself entirely to carry it through simple though it should be i could have kicked the black bastard off his chair but caught as i was in the trap crixus had sprung on me what was there to do but cram down my resentment on top of my fears i was an overloaded man believe me and say no ive no doubts play your part on the lower deck and ill play mine in the saloon george he stiffened just a little you know i believe i prefer mr randolph on first acquaintance i nearly hit him but i held it in dyou want me to call you mr randolph on the steamboat says i people might talk dont ye think we shall be on the steamboat soon enough says he and there our discussion ended with crixus fidgetting nervously as he ushered me out and telling randolph to get some sleep because we must soon be off but when the door had closed i let out my breath with a whoosh and crixus says hurriedly please mr comber well i know what you may be thinking george can be difficult i guess but well we have not endured what he has endured you saw his sensitivity the delicacy of his nature oh he is a genius sir he is three parts white you know think what slavery must do to such a spirit i know he is very different from the negroes with whom you are used to dealing dear me i sometimes myself find it but there i remember what he means to our cause and to all those poor black people he blinked at me compassionate him sir as you compassionate them i know in your own loving heart you will do so compassion mr crixus is the last thing he wants from me says i and i added privately and its the last thing hell get too indeed as later i tried unsuccessfully to sleep under that strange roof i found myself thinking that id find master randolphs company just a little more than i could stomach not that i need see him much my god thinks i what am i doing how the devil did i get into this but even as my fears reawoke it came back to the same thing almost any risk was preferable to letting the us authorities get me unmask me and after all this would be the quicker way home and if things went adrift well master randolph could shift for himself while flashy took to the timber he would be all right he was a genius if ever you have to run slaves which seems unlikely nowadays although you never can tell what may happen if we have the liberals back the way to do it is by steamboat the sultana bound for cincinnati by way of baton rouge vicksburg memphis and cairo beat the old balliol college all to nothing it was like cruising upriver in a fine hotel with the niggers out of sight mind and smell no pitching or rolling to disturb the stomach and above all no john charity spring the speed and sureness with which crixus and his minions organised our departure had almost banished my first fears i had woken on a resolve to run from the house and take my chance with the navy but they kept far too close a watch on things for that and by the afternoon i was glad of it crixus spent four hours drilling me in the minu test details of the journey about cash and passage tickets and how the slaves would be fed en route how i might answer casual inquiries and take part in river gossip without appearing too out of place and by the end of it i realised how little chance i would have stood as a fugitive on my own account the main thing was to talk as little as possible there were enough englishmen on the river in those days to make an extra one nothing out of the ordinary but since i was meant to be a newfledged slave trader it was important that i shouldnt make any foolish slips my story would be that i had recently forsaken african blackbirding in favour of river dealing i had all the expert knowledge for that at any rate really it was astonishing how easy it was in midafternoon with a broadbrimmed planters hat my longtailed coat and halfboots i joined my coffle in the cellars of crixuss house there were six of them in light ankle irons with randolph in the middle looking damned miffed which cheered me considerably the other five by the way were free niggers in crixuss employ and like him devoted to the underground railroad there was much handshaking and godblessing and then we were conducted through what seemed like miles of cellars to a deserted yard from which it was a short step to the levee i had my heart in my mouth as i strode along trying to look like simon legree with my gang of coons shuffling behind i had protested to crixus that if the navy were on the lookout for me the waterfront would be a deuced dangerous place but he said not at the steamboat wharves and he was right we pushed through the crowds of niggers stevedores boatmen passengers and bummarees without anyone giving us a glance there were coffles by the score with fellows dressed like me shepherding and spitting and cursing bawling to each other and chewing on big black cigars old ladies with hatboxes and parasols and men with carpetbags and stovepipe hats were hurrying for their boats niggers with carts were loading piles of luggage the big twin smokestacks were belching and the whistles squealing it was like the tower of babel with the scaffolding about to give way i pushed ahead until i found the sultana and within an hour we were thrashing upstream close inshore on the slow bend past what is now called gretna and with the great jam of ships and rafts and scuttling small boats along its levee anything less like the real gretna you never saw my niggers were stowed down on the main deck at waterlevel where the baggage and steerage people go and i was reclining in my stateroom up on the texas deck smoking a cigar and deciding that things had turned out not so badly after all you see it had gone so well and naturally in the first hour that i was beginning to believe crixus the purser fellow had accepted my ticket in the name of james k prescott without a blink and bawled to one of his niggers to come an take the gennelmans coffle and see em disposed forrard thankee sir straight ahead there to the stairway an mind your head and with the boat so crowded with passengers i felt security returning this looked like an easy trip to the point where one caleb cape trader and auctioneer would meet me at cincinnati and take my coffle and i would steam on up the ohio free as a bird in the meantime i set out to enjoy the trip as far as possible the sultana was a big fast boat and held the new orleanslouisville record of five and a half days she had three decks from the texas to the waterline with the boiler deck in the middle this was where the main saloon and staterooms were all crystal chandeliers and gilding and plush with carved furniture and fine carpets my own cabin had an oil painting on the door and there were huge pictures in the main rooms all very fine in a vulgar way and the passengers matched it you may have heard a great deal about southern charm and grace and theres something in it where virginia and kentucky are concerned robert lee for instance was as genteel an old prig as youd meet on pall mall but it dont hold for the mississippi valley there they were rotten with cotton money in those days with gold watchchains and walkingsticks loud raucous laughter and manners that would have disgraced a sty they spat their terbacker juice on the carpets gorged noisily in the dining saloon the sight of jellied quail being shovelled down with a spoon and two fingers and falling on a shirtfront with a diamond the size of a shilling in it is a sight that dwells with me still and i aint fastidious as a rule they hawked and belched and picked their teeth and swilled great quantities of brandy and punch and roared to each other in their hideous plantation voices theirs werent the only manners to cause me concern either that first evening i went down to the main deck to see that my slaves were being properly housed and fed as a good owner should and to enjoy the sight of the precious master randolph regaling himself on pulse and pone a slaves life didnt suit him one little bit he had taken his place in the coffle that afternoon with a very ill grace and much selfpitying nobility for crixuss benefit when he and his fellows were herded off to their passage quarters he had still been damned peaked and sulky and now he was sitting with a bowl of hash from the communal copper sniffing at it with disgust how dye like it george says i you and the other niggers feeding well he gave me a glance of sheer hate and seeing there was no one else at hand he hissed this filth is inedible look at it smell it if you can bear the nauseating stuff i sniffed the bowl it would have sickened a dog capital stew says i eat it down heartily now or i shall begin to fear i have been spoiling you my boy now you other niggers are you all pitching into your vittles hey thats the spirit the other five all cried yes massa shore nuff mighty fine massa either they had more acting gumption than randolph or else they liked the awful muck but he all aquiver with indignation whispers fiercely capital stew indeed could you bear to eat this foulness probably not says i but im not a nigger dye see and without another glance at him i strolled off to my own dinner resolving to describe it to him later i never believe in neglecting the education of my inferiors it was worth describing too mississippi food once you get outside orleans tends to be robust and rich and i wolfed my stewed chicken prime steak and creamed chocolate with all the more relish for the thought of randolph squatting on the main deck grubbing at his gristle i had champagne with it too and a very passable brandy and finally topped the whole thing off with a buxom little cracker girl in my cabin her name was penny or jenny i forget which she had dyed gold hair which went vilely with her yellow satin dress and she was one of your squealing hoydens but she had tremendous energy and high pointed breasts of which she was immensely proud which made up for a lot most of the women on the boat were noisy by the way the respectable ones clacked and squawked to each other interminably and the mistresses and whores of whom there seemed to be a great number were brassy enough to be heard in san francisco penny was one of the quieter ones she didnt scream with laughter above once a minute i was lying there drowsy and well satisfied listening to her prattling when a nigger waiter comes up with a message that i was wanted on the main deck something to do with my coffle he said wondering what the devil was what i went down and to my rage and concern discovered that it was that confounded george up to his nonsense again the overseer was swearing and stamping over in the corner where my slaves were with randolph standing in front of him looking as arrogant as caesar whats the matter with it damn ye the overseer was shouting and then seeing me says look here mist prescott heres this jimdandy nigger o yours don like this yere commodation no suh pears like taint good enough for him now then whats this i hear george says i pushing forward what are you about my boy turning up your nose at the quarters whats wrong with them sir he looked me straight in the eye with as much side as old lord cardigan we have been given no straw to make beds for ourselves we are entitled to this it is covered in the money you have paid for our passage well me drunk will ye hear that now cries the overseer entye entitt entwhatthehellyousay don you give me none o your shines ye black rascal beds by thunder youll lay right down where youre told or by cracky youll be knocked down whore you that you gotta have straw to keep yore tender carcase offen the floor tother hands is layin on it aint they now you git right down there dye hear my master has paid for us to have straw says randolph looking at me the other slaves over yonder have it only our coffle goes without well there aint no more goddamed straw you nogood impident sonofabitch cries the overseer so now i never heerd the like i could have felled that bloody ass randolph on the spot perhaps i should have done couldnt the fool understand that he must behave as a slave even if he didnt feel like one how the devil he ever existed on a plantation was beyond me it must have taken a saint or a lunatic to put up with his insolent airs all i could do was play the just master kindly but firm come come george i said sternly let us have no more of this lie down where you are told directly what is this how you repay my kind usuage by impertinence have you forgotten yourself altogether that you speak back to a white man lie down at once sir this instant he stared at me i was urging him with my eyes and he had just wit enough to obey but with no great humility plumping down on the deck and folding his arms stubbornly round his knees the overseer growled id take the starch outer that jackanapes right smart if he was mine you be vised mist prescott an give that uppity yaller bastard a good dressin down or hell have the whole passel on em as bad as hisseif beds by christ an sassin back to me thats the trouble with all these fancy houseniggers with bein roun white folks they start thinkin they white too peacocky highanmighties every last dam one of them hell have bin brought up mong white ladies i dont doubt too much dam pettin when hes young you trim him up smart mist prescott like i say or hell be a heap o trouble to ye he stumped off muttering to himself and randolph sneered softly to himself the gentleman is not without perception says he he at least was not brought up among white ladies white sows perhaps he glared up at me we are entitled to straw to lie on why did you not insist that he provides it isnt it enough that i am chained up like a beast in this verminous place fed on nauseating slops arent you meant to protect me you who neglect me to the mercies of that uncouth white scum i wondered if the fellow was insanenot for the way he spoke to me but for the purblind stupidity with which he overlooked the position he was in the role he was meant to be playing he was five days away from freedom and yet the idiot insisted on drawing attention to himself and provoking trouble ordinarily id have taken my boot to him but he so mystified me that i was alarmed i glanced round the overseer was out of sight come over by the rail says i and when we were standing apart look havent you got sense enough to keep your mouth shut and your head down where the hell do you think you are the house of lords dye think it matters whether you get straw or not or whether ive paid for it or not dye expect me to take your side against a white man itd be the talk of the boat in five minutes you fool just you forget your lofty opinion of yourself for once and talk humble and dont be so damned particular or youll never see ohio this trip i need no advice from you he flashed back you would be better remembering the duty you have promised to do which is to take me north in safety than to spend your time in gorging with whitetrash sluts it took my breath away not just the insolence but the discovery of how fast news travels among niggers and there was just a note in his indignation that made me decide to put my anger aside and be amused instead whats the matter sambo says i jealous if looks could kill thered have been a corpse at his feet i have no words to express my contempt of you or of the slatterns you you associate with says he and his voice was shaking but i will not have you endanger my freedom do you hear what kind of guardian are you that swine of an overseer might have provoked me beyond endurance while you were at your beastliness it is your task to see me to canada that is all that matters there was no piercing this ones arrogance i saw not by reason or taunts so i put my hands on my hips and stuck my face into his all that matters you black mongrel ill tell you what matters and that is that you keep your aping airs to yourself touch your forelock and say yes massa whenever i or any white man talks to you that way you might get to canada you just might i shook my fist at him if you havent the brain in that ape skull of yours to see that kicking up the kind of shines youve been at today is the surest way of setting us all adrift if you cant see that ill teach it to you by god ill follow that overseers advice mr randolph and ill have you triced up mr randolph and theyll take a couple of stone of meat off you with a rawhide mr randolph then maybe youll learn sense if you think a quadroon cant go red with rage youre wrong you wouldnt dare he choked furiously to me why you you wouldnt i though dont wager your big black arse on that george or youll find youve only half of it left and what would you do about it eh holler im a runaway nigger and this man is smuggling me to canada think that over george and be wise you you scoundrel he mouthed at me this shall be reported when i reach cincinnati the underground railroad shall hear of it what manner of creature they entrust with oh shut up cant you i dont give a fig for the railroad and if you werent a born bloody fool you wouldnt even mention their name when you reach cincinnati no less you wont reach cincinnati unless i please so if you cant be grateful randolph just be careful now then take off your airs close your mouth and get back there among your brothers lively now cross me or that overseer again and ill have the cat to you i swear it jump to it nigger he stood there sweat running down his face his chest heaving with passion for a moment i thought he would leap at me but he changed his mind some day says he some day you shall repent this most bitterly you heap indignities on me when my hands are tied you insult me you mock my degradation as god is my witness you will pay for it there was no dealing with him you see it was on the tip of my tongue to yell for the overseer and have him string master george up and rawhide the innards out of him just for the fun of hearing him howl but with this kind of quivering violet you couldnt be certain what folly he mightnt commit if he was pushed too far there was a spite and conceit in that man that passed anything ive ever struck so i lit a cigar while considering how to catch him properly on the raw i doubt if ill pay for it says i but supposing i did its something you can never hope to emulate i blew smoke at him youll never be able to pay for this trip will you i turned on my heel before he had a chance to reply and strode off leaving him to digest the truth which i guess he hated more than anything else that would boil his bile for him but i wasnt so certain that my threats would have the desired effect on his conduct well if they didnt id carry them out by god and he could get to canada with a new set of weals to show on his lectures to the antislavery society what beats me looking back is the stupidity of his ingratitude here was the railroad and for all he knew myself in a sweat to save his black hide for him but would he show a spark of thanks or abate his uppity pride one jot not he he thought he had a right to be assisted and cosseted and that we had a duty to put up with his airs and ill humour and childishness and still help him for his own sweet sake well hed picked the wrong man in me i was ready to drop the bastard overboard just to teach him the error of his ways indeed i paused on the ladder going up to reflect whether i could get away with selling him to a trader or in one of the marts on the way north he would fetch a handy sum to help me on my way home but i saw it wouldnt do hed find a way to drag me down and even if he didnt the underground railroad would hear of it and id developed too healthy a respect for mr crixus and his legions to wish them on my tail with a vengeance no id just have to carry on with the plan and hope to god that randolph wouldnt get us into some fearful fix with his wilful whiteniggerishness its an interesting thought though that within a few short weeks id found myself engaged in running niggers into slavery and running em out again and all the hundreds of black animals on the balliol college with every reason to resist and mutiny and raise cain hadnt given a tenth of the trouble i was getting from this single quadroon who should have been on his knees in gratitude to me and crixus and the others of course he was civilised and educated and full of his own importance lincoln was right theyre a damned nuisance one consolation i had on that first night was that it didnt look as though our trip would be a long one and i could look forward to being shot of master george randolph within a week we thrashed up and down the river in fine style i say up and down because the mississippi is the twistiest watercourse you ever saw doubling back and forth and half the time you are steaming southeast or southwest round a bend to go north again its a huge river too up to a mile across in places and unlike any other i know in that it gets wider as you go up it there was nothing to see as far as the banks were concerned except mud flats and undergrowth and here and there a town or a landing place but the river itself was thick with steamboats and smaller vessels and great lumber rafts piled high with bales and floating lazily down the muddy brown waters towards the gulf its a slow ugly river and the ugliness isnt in what you can see but what you can feel theres a palling closeness and a sense of rot and corruption its cruel river to my mind at any rate both in itself and its people mind you i may be prejudiced by what it did to me but even years later when i came booming down it with the union army well they boomed and i coasted along with them i still felt the same oppressive dread of it i remember what sam grant said about it too thick to drink and too thin to plough it stinks not that hed have drunk it anyway unless it had been pure corn liquor from cairo down shes a treacherous river too as i realised on the morning after we had boarded the sultana and she ran aground on a mud bank on the bryaro bend not far below natchez the channels and banks are always shifting you see and the pilots have to know every twist and stump and current ours didnt we stuck fast and a special pilot the celebrated bixby had to be brought down from natchez to get us afloat again all of which consumed several hours with the great man strutting about the pilot house and making occasional dashes out to the texas rail to peer down at the churning wheel and scampering back to roar down his tube snatch her hard down let her go go go while the mississippi mud churned up in huge billows alongside and you could feel the boat shuddering and heaving to be off and when she finally snatched and reared off the shoal into the water bixby was half over the rail again yelling to the nigger leadsman and the scream of the whistles all but drowned their great bass voices singing out eight feet eight and a half nine feet quarterlesstwain and then as she surged out mark twaiaiain and the whole ship roared and cheered and stamped and bixby clapped his tall hat on his head and resumed his kid gloves while they pressed cigars on him and offered him drinks from their flasks it was quite fun really and id have enjoyed it if i hadnt been so anxious to get ahead for i like to see a man whos good at something doing it and throwing on a bit of extra side just for show as ive said i dont have many kindly memories of the mississippi but the best are of the steamboats riding tall and the swaggering pilots and the booming voices ringing deeep four and quartertwaam across the brown waters ill never hear them again but they wouldnt sound the same today anyway however after mr bixbys performance we steamed on to natchez and there any slight enjoyment id been getting from our cruise came to an abrupt end from now life on the mississippi was to be one horror after another and i was to regret most bitterly the day id clapped eyes on her dirty waters i had no inkling of anything wrong until we were away and steaming up river again and i sauntered down to see my coffle getting their evening meal and no doubt i thought to discuss the menu with black beauty himself i was considering a few taunts to add sauce to his diet and wondering if it was wise to stir up his hysteria again but the sight of his face drove them clear out of my mind he looked strained and ugly and quite deaf to the sneering abuse that the overseer gave him as he received his hash from the copper he shuffled off with his bowl glancing round at me and i followed him out of eyeshot round the bales to the rail where we could be alone whats the matter says i for i knew something had shaken him badly he looked left and right up the rail something dreadful has happened says he in a low voice something unforeseen my god it can undo us utterly it is the most terrible chance a chance in a thousand but crixus should have anticipated it he beat his fist on the rail he should have seen it i tell you the fool the blind incompetent blunderer to send me into this peril to what the hell is it i demanded now thoroughly terrified spit it out in gods name a man came aboard at natchez i was watching when the passengers came up the plank and by gods grace he did not see me he knows me he is a trader from georgia the very man who sold me to my first master the first time i escaped he was among those who brought me back dont you see imbecile if he should catch sight of me here we are finished oh he knows all about george randolph he will know me on the instant he will denounce me i will be dragged back to oh my god and he put his head in his hands and sobbed with rage and fear he wasnt the only one to be emotionally disturbed i can tell you he would be dragged back by george he would have company unless i looked alive i stood appalled this was what my very first instinct had told me might happen when crixus had proposed this folly to me but he had been so sure it would all be plain sailing and in my cowardice i had allowed myself to be persuaded i could have torn my hair at my own stupidity but it was too late now the damage was done and i must try to think and see a way out and quieten this babbling clown before panic got the better of him who could have thought that it would happen he was chattering not a soul in mississippi or louisiana knows me not a soul and this fiend from georgia has to cross my path what is he doing here why didnt crixus see that this could happen why did i let myself be driven into this calamity he jerked up his head glaring through his tears what are you going to do shut up says i keep your voice down he hasnt seen you yet has he i was trying to weigh the chances to plan ahead in case we were discovered perhaps he wont theres no reason why he should is there hell be travelling on the boiler deck or the texas theres no reason why he should come down here unless he has niggers with him by god has he no no there were no new coffles came aboard at natchez but if he should if he wont then even if he did why should he see you if you lie low and keep out of sight hes not going to go peering into the face of every nigger just for fun look whats his name omohundro peter omohundro of savannah he is a terrible creature i tell you look theres nothing to do but sit tight says i it was a nasty shaker no error but common sense told me it wasnt as bad as he made out it was i dont need any encouragement to terror as a rule but i can count chances and there wasnt a damned thing to be done except watch out and hope the odds were heavy that omohundro wouldnt come anywhere near him if he did thmks i then master randolph can look out for himself but in the meantime the best thing to do is get some of his almighty cockiness back into him you keep out of sight and keep quiet says i thats all we can do all you mean you intend to do nothing to wait until he sees me he wont unless your vapourings attract attention i snapped ill watch out for him never fear at the first hint that be may come down here ill be on hand youve got the key to your irons hidden havent you well then you stay behind the bales and keep your eyes open there isnt a chance in a million of his seeing you if you are careful that calmed him down a little i believe that he had been more angry than frightened really which in itself was a relief to me he blackguarded crixus some more and threw in a few withering remarks about my own shortcomings and there i left him with a promise to return later and report any developments i wont deny i was rattled but ive had a lot worse perils hanging over me and when i considered the size of the boat and the hordes of folk aboard white and nigger i told myself we should be all right the first thing was to get a sight of omohundro which wasnt difficult by discreet inquiry i got him pointed out to me by a nigger waiter a big likelylooking bastard with a scarred face and heavy whiskers one of your tough wideawake gentlemen who stared carefully at whoever was talking to him spoke in a loud steady way and laughed easily i also discovered that he was travelling only as far as napoleon which we ought to reach on the following evening so that was all to the good as i told randolph later he wasnt going to have much time for prying about the boat but i didnt sleep much that night even the outside risk of catastrophe is enough to keep me hopping to the water closet and reaching for the brandy bottle next day passed all too slowly we lost time at vicksburg and i became fretful at the realisation that we wouldnt reach napoleon ahd get rid of omohundro before midnight the man hunseif did nothing to set my bowels agallop he spent the morning loafing about the rail and sat long after luncheon with a group of arkansas planters gossiping but he never stirred off the boiler deck and i became hopeful again with evening and darkness coming it looked as though we were past the most dangerous time i kept an eye on him at dinner though and afterwards when he went into the saloon and settled himself with the planters to booze and smoke the evening away i was glad of a chance offered me to stay on hand through pennyjenny i had made the acquaintance of two or three fellows on the boat and one of them a redfaced old kentuckian called colonel potter invited me to make up a game of poker he was one of your noisy boozy sports full of heavy humour and hearty guffaws he fumbled at pennys thighs under table slapped backs twitted me about the battle of new orleans and generally played bacchus with him there was a potbellied planter named bradlee with a great fund of filthy jokes and a young arkansan called harney shepherdson who had a yellow whore in tow just the kind of company i like and i was able to watch omohundro at the same time he left his friends after a while and during a pause in our game he approached our table potter welcomed him boisterously pressed him to sit down introduced us all round called for another bottle and said would omohundro take a hand no thankee colonel says he matter of fact im taking the liberty of intrudin on your little party in the hope i can kindly have a little word with your friend here he indicated bradlee to my relief on a matter of business if the ladies will forgive that is im due off at napoleon in an hour or two so hopin you wont mind feel free suh help yself cries potter and omohundro turns to bradlee understand you have some niggers below sub says he and my innards froze at the words couple of mandes mong em accordin to my friends yonder now while im not on a buyin trip you understand i never miss a mande if i can help it wonder if you feel inclined to talk business suh an if so i might take a look at em i leaned back hoping no one would notice how the sweat was beginning to pump off me as i waited for bradlees answer always talk business anytime says he got to warn you though suh my niggers dont come cheap could be askin a right nice price could be payin one for the right kind of cattle says omohundro be deeply bliged to you suh if i might take a look at em for myself be much beholden to you bradlee said it was fine with him and heaved himself up with his apologies to the table i was shuddering by this time i must get down to the main deck before them and get randolph out of sight somehow i was on the point of jumping to my feet and making my excuses when potter the interfering oaf sings out say whynt you take a look at mr prescotts coffle while you about it suh he got some right prime stock there aint you though purtiest set o niggers i seen in a while its so suh i assure you reckon mr prescotts got good taste in mos things eh honey and he set penny squealing with a pinch what possessed him to stick his oar in god knows just my luck i suppose i found omohundros eyes on me that so suh well i aint rightly buyin like i said but if nothing for sale im afraid i strove to sound offhand and he nodded in that case your servant ladies colonel gentlemen and he and bradlee went off towards the staircase leaving me floundering i had to get away so i started to my feet saying i must fetch something from my cabin potter cried that we were just about to go on with the game and penny squeaked that without me to guide her she couldnt tell the little clover leaves from the other black things on the cards but by that time i was striding for the staircase cursing potter and with panic rising in my chest i saw omohundro and bradlee disappear downwards just ahead of me so i hung back and then slipped down the spiral staircase in their wake by the time i reached the main deck they were already over at the far port rail where bradlees coffle lay calling for the overseer to bring another light it was pretty dim on the main deck with only a few flare lamps which cast great black shadows among the bales and machinery the various coffles of niggers were scattered about nesting among the cargo with my own crew up forward away from the rest i lurked in the shadows debating whether to go and warn strung gentleman might do if he thought there was danger close randolph and decided not to you never knew what that high by it seemed best to lurk in the shadows unobserved keeping an eye on bradlee and omohundro and ready to intervene god alone knew how if they decided to take an interest in my coffle the truth was i just didnt know what to do for the best and so did nothing peeping over a box i watched while omohundro by the light of the overseers lantern examined a couple of bradlees slaves walking round them prodding and poking i couldnt hear what was said what with the churning of the great paddle wheel and the steady murmur and crooning of the slaves but after about five minutes omohundro shook his head i heard bradlee laugh and then the three of them moved slowly amidships where omohundro stopped to light a cigar from where i lurked among the bales i began to hear their voices and of course i dont blame you pricin high omohundro was saying reckon your figure is about right these days but that wouldnt leave any margin of profit still im right sorry good bucks you have sub an well schooled guess i can train a nigger says bradlee yessir i jus about think i can whup seldom but whup good my ol dad used to say an he was right guess i aint laid a rawhide on a nigger o mine this las twelvemonth dont have to they got a respect for me on count they know if i do trim one of em up hell stay trimmed thats the style with em chips in the overseer ony way otherwise they git spoiled breaks my heart to see good niggers spoiled too by soft handlin like the coffle that englishman brung aboard hows that says bradlee i hear theys prime so potter sayin oh prime enough just now but he dont know how to handle em an he in a right way to ruinin em to my way thinkin shame it is and then to my horror he added care to see em gennelmen my heart stopped beating and then omohundro said reckon not he aint sellin so he tell me no chuckles the overseer i guess hell be glad nough to come a year or so leastways with one of em the uppitiest yaller sonofabitch you ever see firstrate nigger too clean straight smart an talks like a college pfessor oh you know his sort i reckon all frills an goddam lip uhhuh says bradlee educated likely an spoiled to hell an gone got no use for em myself that kind of fancy fetches a good price though once the tars been taken out of em says omohundro make valets butlers an so forth ladies in awlins an mobile payin heavy money for em he paused think the englishman knows what this fellers worth how could he says bradlee he tells me he spent all his time in afriky slave ships till now he dont know the value of talkin niggers shut up shut up about my bloody niggers i found myself whispering mind your own business and get upstairs where you belong cant you and they would have done but for that benighted swine of an overseer talkin niggers is right this one of prescotts sure can handle his gab highestf alutin smartassed buck in creation answers back sassy as be damned an what you think mist prescott do gennelmen hey why he jus pats and smooths him yessir makes a body sick to listen the english is soft on niggers evyone know that says bradlee id like to see the buckd talk back to me id just about like to hear that well suh you dont have to stir moren twenty feet to see him cries the infernal clod here gennelman step across this ways i see mist omohundro kinda interested anyway that right suh i should have strode out then and there i know and done something anything to keep them away from my coffle i might have talked them away or damned their eyes for going near my blacks or made some diversion but my consternation had reached the point where i had lost my nerve altogether i hesitated and then the overseer was up forward barking at my niggers to rise and let the white men have a look at them i waited helpless for the blow to fall where that george the overseer was shouting here you george ye black varmint step out when i calls ye it was like watching a play i had seen before and a bloody tragedy at that randolph unsuspecting stood up among his fellows blinking in the light that one says bradlee well he dont look so dam pert eh omohundro good clean buck too quadroon i reckon why whats the matter with you boy you seen a ghost randolph was staring with his hand to his mouth at omohundro who was stooping to peer at him whats that wait though hold on a minute whats your name boy i seen you before somewheres aint i yes by god i have his voice rose in a shout of amazement youre george rand in that moment randolph was on him like a tiger carrying the big man to the deck and then falling himself as his shackles tripped him he was up in an instant though agile as a cat smashing a fist into bradlees face before the overseer swearing in astonishment managed to close with him they reeled against the bales locked together and then randolph jerked his knees up and the overseer staggered away yelping clutching his groin get him bawls omohundro hes a runaway randolph stop him bradlee hobbled by his irons he hadnt time to get at his hidden key randolph half hopped half ran for the rail with bradlee clutching at his shirt trying to drag him back omohundro got a hold too but stumbled and fell cursing as they tried to grapple him randolph broke away and before his irons ftnally tripped him he had covered half a dozen yards which brought him to the big box where i was crouching he saw me as he fell and shouted help help me prescott fight them off such an appeal addressed to flashy meets a prompt response i ducked back behind cover just as omohundro came crashing over the bales clutching at randolphs feet the quadroon kicked free scrambled on to the rail and was trying to roll over it when he must have realised that he would fall plumb in the path of the great thirtyfoot paddle wheel he shrieked rearing up on the rail the overseers pistol banged and i saw randolphs body arch and his face contort with agony he fell outwards and the huge wheel blades came churning down on him as he hit the water i daresay that if i had had a few minutes for quiet reflection it would have occurred to me that the safest course would be to stand my ground playing the innocent trader amazed at the news that there had been a runaway in his coffle and brazen it out that way but i hadnt those few minutes and im not sure id have acted any differently anyway the overwhelming feeling that i had when i saw randolphs body fall with omohundro and bradlee roaring bloody murder and the whole deck in uproar was that here was no place for flashy any longer i was skipping away between the bales before the echo of the shot had died omohundros bellow to me to stop merely assisted my flight i crossed the deck in half a dozen strides and launched myself over the starboard rail in a fine flat dive there was no wheel on that side i knew and when i surfaced in the warm mississippi water with all the breath knocked out of me the sultana was already a hundred yards away upriver even today i cant feel anything but irritation and dislike for george randolph if he had only had the sense to keep his mouth shut and act humble for once hed never have been confronted by omohundro that night the odds are hed have reached canada without fuss and embarked immediately on a happy life as a professor at some liberal university or the leader of a nigger minstrel troupe or something equally useful instead his pride and folly had bought him a bullet in the belly and a grave in the mississippi mud as far as i could see more important he had put me in a highly dangerous and embarrassing position my wits must have been cleared by the water for i had the immediate presence of mind not to swim for the arkansas shore a mere hundred yards away but to strike out instead across the stream for the mississippi bank which was almost threequarters of a mile off im a strong swimmer and the water was warm so i made it easily enough by the time i climbed out across a mud bank and plumped down among some willows the sultana had stopped at the next bend but after half an hour she started off again doubtless to stop at the next landing and start the hue and cry i blasted randolph bitterly at the thought that i was a hunted fugitive once more in the middle of a strange land with only a few dollars in my pocket the one consolation was that they would scour the arkansas side first and i would have time to get inland in mississippi unmolested and then whither there could be no going back south with the navy still doubtless on the lookout for me and it would be madness to try to continue north along the river on foot but north i would have to go eventually if i were to reach home again in the meantime i must find some place to lie up undetected until all the hullabaloo had died down and i could work cautiously upriver to the free states and so to the atlantic seaboard and a passage home it was a damned tall order and depressing prospect and i had a grand old curse that night at my folly in being bullied into this fearful fix by crixus my one hope was that mississippi was such a big place where i assumed news travelled slowly and uncertainly that i ought to be able to find a bolthole i reasoned that itinerant strangers must be commonplace in the western states so i might escape remark if i was careful how i went i slept that night among the cottonwoods and struck due east before sunrise as i wanted to get away from the river as quickly as possible and so began three of the most dam dismal days of my life in which i skulked through woods and along byroads living the life of a vagrant stopping only at the loneliest farms and places i could find to buy a meal out of the few dollars i had left the one thing that cheered me was that none of the people i saw paid me any close attention which confirmed my belief that they were used to all sorts of odd fellows trudging about the country i tried to speak as american as i could when i spoke at all and must have made a passable job of it for nobody appeared to take me for anything else however i realised that this could not continue soon i would be destitute and since ive never been any hand at petty theft or highway robbery i came to the reluctant conclusion that i must try and find work its a last resort of course but it seemed to me if i could get some employment in an outoftheway spot i could lie up and save money for my eventual flight at one and the same time i made one or two cautious inquiries without success beyond an afternoons labour splitting logs for my supper and i was in despair by the fourth morning when by sheer chance i lit on the very thing i was looking for i had slept in the woods and spent my last few cents on bread and milk at a rundown store when a burly chap on a grey horse comes cantering up roaring for the storekeeper that he had come to settle his debt whats the row then jim says the storekeeper where you off to headed west cries jim i seen my last load o goddamned cotton i can tell you that its calif orney for me my boy an a pisspotful of gold theres your four dollars jake an much obliged to ye well that beats all says the storeman californey eh wisht i could go myself by thunder say but whats mandeville goin to do without a driver in the middle o pickin time do his goddamned drivin his goddamned self says the other cheerfully i guess ill worry about him wont i all the way to the diggins im off to see the elephant yehhoo its californey or bust and he waved his hat and thundered away leaving the storeman scratching his head in wonder i didnt inquire at the store the less said the better but i met a nigger up the road found where mandevilles place was and after a fourmile walk came to his imposing front gates they were made of granite no less and the place was called greystones an impressive spread of cotton plantation with a fine white colonial house at the head of a treelined drive it looked a likely spot for me so i strode up and presented myself as a driver in need of work mandeville was a broad bullnecked man of about fifty with heavy whiskers on a coarse red face who told you i needin a driver says he standing foursquare on his verandah and squinting down at me suspiciously i said i had met his former employee on the road hub that fool jim bakewell ups an off in the middle o pickin cool as you please to go to californey ifn he aint any better at diggin than at drivin hell finish up cleanin out privies which is all he good for anyways triflin useless bastard he cocked his head at me reckon you kin drive anything that moves says i oh my niggers move says he they move ifn someone on hand to make em skip you driven cottonhands befo i guess by the look o you in the surprise of realising what driving meant i overlooked the doubtful compliment where you from an what your name tom arnold says i from texas a while back uhhuh the texies well no denyin gotta have a driver dunno where i get one this season ifn i dont take ye aint no slouch of a job min you be th only white driver on the place thirty dollas a month an yo keep satisfy ye tom i said it would and at that moment a nigger came round the house leading a fine white mare and a lady came through the pillared front door dressed for riding mandeville hailed her eagerly why annie dahlin there you are fine fine jus off aridin i see thats fine fine and then seeing her eyes on me he hurried to explain this heres tom arnold honey jus hired him as a new driver in room o that nogood bakewell right piece o luck i reckon him turnin up yes sub is it said the lady and you could see she doubted it she was one of the tiniest women ive ever seen somewhere under five feet although wellshaped in a dainty dolllike way but there was nothing dolllike about the sharp little face with its pointed elfin chin tight lips and cold grey eyes that played over me with a look of bleak disdain i became conscious of my bedraggled appearance and unshaven face three days in the woods make a poor toilet we may hope he is a better driver than bakewell says the lady coldly at the moment he looks as though he was more accustomed to being driven and without another word or glance at me she mounted her mare mandeville fussing to help her and cantered off along the drive with the nigger groom trotting at her heels mandeville waved after her his red face beaming and then turned back to me that mrs mandeville says he proudly she the lady o my plantation yessuh mrs mandeville then his eyes slid away and he said he would show me my quarters and instruct me in my duties as it turned out these were easy enough slavedriving is as pleasant an occupation as any if you must work you ride round the cotton rows on horseback seeing that the niggers dont let up in filling their baskets and laying on the leather when they slack greystones was a fairsized place with about a hundred niggers working the great snowy fields that stretched away from behind the house to the river and they were a welldrilled pack by the time id done with em i can tell you i vented the discontent i felt at america on them and enjoyed myself more than id done since my rugby days when lacing fags was the prime sport although i had a couple of black drivers to help me i became quite expert with my hide you could make a sleepy nigger jump his own height with a wellplaced welt across his backside squealing his head off and if any of them were shortweighted at the end of the day you gave them half a dozen cuts for luck mandeville was delighted with the tally of cotton picked and told me i was the best overseer hed ever had which didnt surprise me it was work i could take a hearty interest in after the first few days he left me alone to the job for he frequently had business in helena about fifty miles away on the other side of the mississippi river or in memphis over the tennessee border and would stay away for nights at a time he always went alone leaving his wife in the house which seemed damned indiscreet to me i didnt realise fortunately for my selfesteem that while a southern planter wouldnt have dreamed of leaving his wife unchaperoned in a house while there was a white man there hed never think twice if that man was a hired servant living in a cottage fifty yards away however she kept out of my way in those early days and i out of hers knowing me you may think that strange but all my thoughts at this stage were on my own plight greystones seemed to be just the kind of outoftheway spot i required it was isolated in the woodland and marsh and was seldom visited but even so i had my heart in my mouth every time hoofbeats sounded on the drive and i kept well out of sight when one of mandevilles neighbours called it didnt seem likely that if there was a search going on for me it would reach this far from the river and there was nothing to connect the steamboat fugitive with mandevilles new driver but even so i kept a sharp eye open at first for any hint of danger as the days passed and none appeared i began to feel easier another reason why i kept out of annette mandevilles way was that i disliked her and she me apparently i had guessed two things from our first brief meeting one was that she was an unpleasant arrogant little piece and the other that she had her big powerful husband on a string he was more than twice her age of course and ive noticed that there are few things that a middleaged man will go in such awe of as an imperious young wife hell face a wounded buffalo or go headlong into a sabre charge but hell turn pale and stutter at the thought of saying id rather not dearest well i can understand it when the wife holds the purse or is bigger than he or can get the law on him but even without these things mandeville went in awe of her and she knew it and enjoyed using her power to torment him she wasnt just spoiled and petulant she was cruel in a subtle ways and i say it who am a recognised authority i saw enough of them together to judge the pleasure she took in fretting and hurting him with her ready sneers and icy disdain the more eager be was to please her this man who was so coarse and masterful in other things the more she seemed to delight in making him uneasy and bewildered much of this i learned from mandeville himself not that he dreamed he was instructing me but he loved to talk and there not being another white man on the place he took to inviting me up to the house at night after his wife had retired for a booze and prose he was a decent enough fellow i suppose in his rough way and greatly given to foxing himself on corn toddy and nothing pleased him more than to yarn away about his niggers and his horses and when he was well maudlin about his wife and this most often after she had set him down which she did most days yes suh this infatuated idiot would say smiling blearily at his glass im a lucky man an she a wonerful lil lady yes suh deed she is well you kin see that tom you a travelled man i guess you kin see she is course she git a lil short time to time like today now but it aint nuthin at all my own fault i guess ysee the truth is although this heres a pretty fair spread at greystones taint altogether what she bin used to nosuh she come from one o the best french families in nawlins the delaneys likely you heard o them gotta tremendous big estate out to lake pontchartrain trouble is ol man delaney he a bit stretched an i helped him out over a couple o deals five years ago that was when i married annie here jonah light a seegar for mist arnold fill your glass suh by now he would be well launched convincing himself for the thousandth time against all reason yees five years ago happiest day o my life suh but ill admit you take a gel whos bin brought up a real lady whos got real blood bin to convent had a halfdozen yaller maids waitin on her an whos used to livin in the top society in nawlins well i do her pretty good here i reckon but it aint the same not much society even in memphis an the local folks aint xactly the kin o bucks an belles she used to meet at home so its natural she gits these fits an starts now an then but you ppreciate that tom an no denyin either me bein oldern she is a little she get kinda bored i dont talk quite her way you see an i aint got her tastes so to speak so she get a mite resless like i say an boy don she dress me down then and he would giggle drunkenly as though at some good joke which he thoroughly enjoyed say you oughta hear her when she got a real head o steam my stars course taint often not more than twice a day and three times on sundays i would say to myself serve the clown right for marrying out of his class say but don get me wrong here have nuther drink don get me wrong she a real lovin gel yessuh she the lovinest little creatur you ever did see when i say she sometimes bored don think i mean she goin short hoho i guess not and he would nudge me winking ponderously with a lewd leer i tell you im bout wore out pilin inter that lil darlin fact she caint seem tget enough o me do it again johnny lover do it again that what she say an don i do it oh i should say not i should jus bout reckon not an don she know how to rouse a man on hey why i see some men like parkins down at helena an young mackay who got the yellowtree place they jus itchin for her jus at the sight of her why i could see you fancy her youself no dont fret youself dont fret i dont mind one lil bit its only natural aint it i dont take no offence cos i know she never think o no one but me do it again johnny lover that what she say talk bout your nigger wenches pish it was from drunken meanderings such as this that i formed my conclusions about the mandevilles an obvious one being that they didnt bed together and probably never had well that could explain a lot about madame annettes behaviour and in other circumstances i would probably have set myself to supply her want for she was a trim little halfpint bar her shrew face but she was so damned unpleasant that the thought didnt cross my mind when we met she either looked straight through me or treated me as though i were no better than the blacks if i hadnt needed the work id have taken the rough side of my tongue to her and as it was i gave her back sneer for sneer as far as i dared so that before long we hated each other as cordially as man and woman can and mind you i dont like this sort of thing it aint usual to find a woman who isnt prepared to be civil to me and id grown my whiskers long again and a rakish little black imperial too however i had my own affairs to attend to i was working quietly away towards the day when id have enough saved to be able to move off north again i reckoned two or three months would see me set and ready and by that time all the haroosh caused by my flight from the sultana would have died down and id be able to take the road in safety so i laboured away whopping niggers mounting the occasional black wenth in my quarters and counting my dollars every fortnight and never gave a thought to annette mandeville which was foolish of me equally foolish was the way in which i allowed a sense of security to grow on me as the weeks passed and no hue and cry came to disturb the peace of greystones picking time passed and with less to do i got restless and impatient to be up and away for england i suppose that made me more thoughtless and shorttempered than usual all of which was to lead to my undoing it was the approach of christmas that finally broke my patience i think i suppose everyones thoughts turn home then whether they really wish they were there or not i had only elspeth to miss and the baby id never seen not that ive any use for brats mind you but any excuse will do for a selfpitying weep when youre alone in your quarters in a foreign land with two inches left in the bottom of the corn bottle and the rest gurgling in your belly and making you feel sick and miserable i imagined elspeth fair and radiant bending over a crib and shaking a rattle at its occupant and looking adoringly across at me with that lovely pink bloom on her cheeks and myself toasting my arse at the nursery fire with my coat tails pulled back and a fine helping of duff and brandy inside me quite the proud papa while waits sang in the street outside instead here i was halffoxed and croaking to myself in a draughty shack with no elspeth but a black slut snoring openmouthed in the corner and in place of waits the eternal caterwauling of the field hands as they sang one of their morbid chants i sat there blubbering boozily trying to put the home picture out of my mind and telling myself it was all a sham that elspeth would be back in the saddle with one of her gallants by now and old morrison would ruin christmas anyway by whining about the cost of geese and holly it was no good i was homesick bloody homesick and the thought of morrison was an added incentive by god id make the old scoundrel skip when i got back and flourished springs papers under his ugly nose the thought cheered me up and when i had finished the bottle been sick and thrashed the nigger girl for snoring i felt more like myself again but i was still chafing to be away and with only two weeks of my enforced sojourn to go i was in a thoroughly ill humour and ready to take my spite out on anyone even annette mandeville or her soused clown of a husband not that i was seeing much of either of them by now for mandeville was absent more and more and annette kept to the house but she had her eyes open too as i was to discover to my cost i mentioned a black girl in my quarters she was the least ugly and smelly of the field women whom i had taken as a carnal cook a bedfellowcumhousekeeper that is she was little use as either but one has to make do anyway it happened that one evening after a long day down by the river where the slaves were cutting a ditch i came home to find her whimpering and groaning on her mattress with a couple of nigger girls tending her and looking mighty scared whats this says i oh massa says the wenches hermia she powful sick she real poly she is and she was someone had flogged her until her back was a livid mess of cuts and bruises who the devils done this roars i in a great rage and it was hermia herself who told me between her wails oh massa tom it the miz miz annette she done tell me is inslent en shed trim me up good i don done nuthin massa tom but she git hector to whup me en oh is hurtin hurtin suthin awful massa hector he lay on til is swoondin en aint done nuthin oh massa tom whut inslent mean well i knew annette was hard on the niggers who went in terror of her and id no doubt this sffly slut had offended her in some way so i gave no thought to it but turned hermia out since she was of no use for anything in her present state next day i picked another wench to take her place and went off to the fields in due course and when i came home there she was beaten black and blue just as hermia had been again on miz annettes orders now i can take a hint as fast as the next man but i confess i didnt see all the way through this one which was foolish of me i took it that the spiteful little harridan was bent on denying me female companionship but it never occurred to me why which shows what a modest chap i am i suppose in any event i had to do something about it for i was seething with anger at her malice and since mandeville was away in memphis i went straight up to the house to have it out with the mistress she was obviously just back from a canter round the plantation for she was still in her grey riding suit issuing orders to jonah in the hall when he had gone i tackled her straight two of the field girls have been flogged on your instructions says i may i be permitted to ask why she didnt even look at me what concern is it of yours says she taking off her gloves as your husbands overseer im responsible for his slaves under his authority and mine says she and started off upstairs without another word i wasnt having this so i strode after her by all means says i but i find it strange that you undertake to discipline them yourself why not leave the matter to me since its what im paid for we were at the head of the stairs by now but she kept right or towards her room i kept pace with her fuming and suddenly she snapped at me what you are paid for is to obey orders not to question what i do your place is in the fields not in this house be so good as to leave at once im damned if i do youve had the tar whaled out of two of those girls and i want to know why dont be impertinent she wheeled on me her face screwed up with fury how dare you follow me in this way how dare you take that tone get out before i call the servants to throw you into the fields not another word and she flounced into her room but she left the door open now listen to me you vicious brat you i was in a fine fury by now if you wont tell me ill tell you you had them thrashed because they were my girls didnt you you thought your girls she spat it at me your girls since when could a penniless beggar like you talk of your girls my slaves do you hear and if i choose to punish them i shall do it she was fairly hissing the words as i choose and you will keep your place you mongrel i think the only reason i didnt strike her was that she was so tiny snarling up at me that i was frightened of breaking her and even in my anger i saw a better way of hurting her always flashys forte as tom hughes has testified well now says i holding myself in i dont think the word mongrel is one that comes at all well from a creole lady i let it sink in and added i dont have to worry about my fingernails it was quite false of course i dont suppose she had a drop of black blood in her but it struck her like a blow she stood glaring her face chalkwhite unable to speak so i carried on amiably you whipped those girls because i was bedding them and no doubt youll be prepared to go on whipping until youve halfkilled every wench on the plantation well see if i care they aint my property see if your husband cares though he maynt like having his investment wasted hell maybe ask you why you did it because your overseers covering em youll say using a ladylike term im sure and why not hell say whats that to you why he may even wonder and there i stopped for there and only there the light dawned as i say im overmodest she had been so damned uncivil to me you see that it honestly hadnt crossed my mind that she fancied me usually of course im ready to accept that every woman does well they do but she was such a shrewfaced pipsqueak and so unpleasant i stared at her now and noted with interest that from white her witchface had turned flushed and her breathing was slow and thick well well thinks i what have we here lets see if our manly charms have truly captivated this unlikely creature after all and purely by way of scientific experiment i leaned forward picked her up with my hands at her waist it was like lifting a puppet and kissed her she didnt struggle or kick or cry out so i kept at it and very slowly her mouth opened and she gave a little sob and then she took my lip in her teeth and began to bite harder and harder until i pulled her free holding her at arms length her eyes were shut and her face tight set then she motioned me to set her down and she stood against me her head touched my top weskit button wait said she in a little whisper and quickly closing the door she vanished into her dressingroom i could have laughed but instead i began peeling off my coat reflecting that the road to fornication is truly often paved with misunderstanding i was sitting on the bed removing my boots when she reentered and she was a startling sight for she was stark naked except for her riding boots that took me aback for it aint usual among amateurs something to do with her french upbringing no doubt but it was the rest of her that took the eye id known she was wellshaped but in the buff she was an undoubted little nymph scientific research be damned says i reaching out for her and she came with her mouth open and her eyes shut straining at me you silly little popsy says i why didnt you let me know before and so to work which proved none too bad bar one unexpected and painful surprise i was settling into my stride when i discovered why she had kept her boots on for she suddenly clapped her legs round me and so help me those boots were spurred hair brushes i was used to but being stabbed in the buttocks is an arse of a different colour if youll forgive the pun and it was fortunate the bed was a wide one or wed have flown off it there was no untangling her for she clung like a limpet and i could only wrestle away yelping from time to time until we were done i was stuck like a derby winner then she pushed me away slipped off the bed and picked up a robe she put it on without looking at me and then she said now get out and without another word she went into her dressingroom and bolted the door well im not used to this kind of treatment and in other circumstances id have kicked the door in and taught her manners but in a house full of niggers you cant conduct an affair as though you were man and wife so i dressed staunching my wounds and muttering curses and presently limped away vowing that shed had the last of me but of course she hadnt mandeville returned next day and i kept well clear of the house but come the end of the week he was off to helena again to meet some fellows on business with only a week of my time left i should have gone about my business ignoring madame annette but human nature being what it is i didnt no woman tells me to get out with impunity especially a haughty dwarf who was no great shakes in bed anyway this is illogical of course but those of us who study immoral philosophy are guided by some contrary rules at all events i came sniffing round the day after he left well she was white and interesting and apart from her face she was a wellsetup piece in a miniature way to my surprise she didnt either rebuff me or welcome me with open arms we discussed the piece of plantation business which id made my pretext for coming and when i assailed her she fell to with a will but never a word or a smile or anything but a fierce cold passion that almost scared me it was damned spooky when i think of it now and afterwards when i tried to engage her in sociable chat she sat moody and withdrawn hardly saying a word and not a stitch on mark you not even her boots id taken good care of that i gave up halfpuzzled and halfannoyed i couldnt fathom her at all and i still cant my experience with women has been i dare say considerable and varied ive had them fighting to get at me and running for dear life to escape all ages shapes and colours in beds haylofts thickets drawingrooms palaces hovels snowdrifts baths billiard rooms cellars camps covered wagons and even in the library of corpus christi college cambridge which is probably a record of some sort ive sometimes regretted that the flying machine was invented so late in my life but things move so fast nowadays its difficult to keep pace anyway my point is that only three women that i can recall out of that darling multitude have refused to be sociable afterwards provided there was time of course my afghan lotusblossom narreeman was one but she had been constrained as they say and wanted to murder me anyway queen ranavalona was another but apart from being as mad as a hatter she had affairs of state to attend to which is some excuse annette mandeville was the third and i believe she was neither mad nor murderous but whos to say i doubt if shed have been an entertaining talker anyway she didnt have much education for all her careful upbringing she was avid enough however for pleasure itself and since mandevile seemed to be making a protracted stay in helena i visited her on each of the next three days this was foolishness of course for it increased the chances of detection but when i voiced my doubts remarking that i hoped none of the niggers would guess what brought me to the house she laughed unpleasantly and said who cares if the whole plantation knows not one of these black animals would dare breathe a word they know what would happen to them i didnt like to think what that would be knowing madame annette but since she seemed so unconcerned i saw no reason why i should fret and consequently grew careless i had been in the habit of opening one of her bedroom windows so that we might hear if anyone approached the house from the road but on the third day i forgot so that we never heard the pad of hooves across the turf we had just finished a bout annette was lying face down on the bed silent and sullen as usual and i was trying to win some warmth out of her with my gay chat and also by biting her on the buttocks suddenly she stiffened under me and in the same instant feet were striding up the corridor towards the room mandevilles voice was shouting annie hullo annie honey im home ive brought and then the door was flung open and there he stood the big grin on his red face changing to a stare of horror my mouth was still open as i gazed across her rump terrorstricken my god he cries betrayed well id heard the same sort of exclamation before and ive heard it since and theres no doubt its unnerving but i doubt if theres a man living who can move faster with his pants round his ankles than i can i was off that bed and diving for the window before the last word had left his lips and had the sash half up before i remembered it was a cool twentyfoot drop to the ground i turned like a cornered rat just as he came for me swinging his horsewhip and bawling with rage i ducked the cut and slipped past him to the door stumbing on the threshold i glanced back in panic but he was heading straight on for the bed yelling filthy strumpet and raising his whip again but annette who had sprung up into a kneeling position just snapped dont you dare touch me drop that whip and he did he fell back before that tiny naked figure mouthing and then he turned and hurled himself at me with a face of apoplexy i was afoot again by this time dragging up my breeches and baring for the landing and then a mans figure loomed up at the head of the stair i heard mandeville shout stop him and although i tried to dodge the upraised riding crop i wasnt quick enough something smashed against my forehead knocking me backwards the white ceiling spun dizzily above me and then i was falling into nothing i cant have been unconscious more than a few minutes but when i came to my own leather belt was round my wrists blood was caking one of my eyelids and there was an unholy pain in my brow i was lying at the foot of the staircase and a man was hestriding me one of his booted feet planted on my ankle there was a tremendous hubbub of voices with mandeville yelling blue murder and others trying to quieten him i turned my head two or three men were holding him back and when he saw me conscious be waved his arms and shouted you slimy bastard you stinkin hound ill have your hearts blood for this ill crucify you let me at him boys an ill tear his dirty innards out they struggled with him and one of them sings out get that feller outa here luke quick now afore he gits done a mischief damn ye mandevile wont ye hold still ill murder him ill butcher him sif he was a hog oh turn me loose boys hes dishonoured me hes bin an tried to ravish my wife my dear annie pore defenceless little critter you got to let me at him the man above me chuckled leaned down and grabbed me by the waistband and with surprising strength dragged me across the hall and threw me bodily through a doorway then he stepped into the room shut the door and growled now you just lie there easy friend or itll be the worse fer you he had a whip in one hand and i guessed he was the fellow who had hit me he was a tall rangy chap with a heavy moustache and bright grey eyes which surveyed me sardonically as he went on layin still oughtnt to be no hardship fer you i reckon youre a right smart hand at layin mandeville seems to think so anyways and he nodded to the door beyond which we could hear mandeville still roaring i was getting my wits back and they told me that this fellow wasnt unfriendly for heavens sake sir i cried cut me loose i can explain i promise you mandevile is mistaken believe well now i reckon he is leastways bout his little lady gittin ravished i seen her an a less ravishedlookin female i never clapped eyes on say aint she a sight when shes nekkid though mighty trim little tail he laughed and leaned down towards me tell me friend what she like in the hay i often fancied cut me free i assure you i can explain well can ye now i would doubt that i really would he laughed again an if i was mandeville i wouldnt listen id cut your goddamned throat here an now yessir hold on though sound like hes comin to do it his own self i struggled on to my knees as the tumult in the hall increased it sounded as though mandevilles friends were still having to restrain him by main force i knelt there quaking and pleading with luke to cut me free but he shook me off and when i persisted he kicked me flat on my back didnt i tell ye to lay still any more out o you an ill take this hide to ye he laughed again and i suddenly realised that his good humour was not at all friendly as id supposed he was just enjoying himself i didnt dare move after that but lay shaking with dread and then after what seemed an age the door opened and the others came in mandeville was in the lead panting and dishevelled but he seemed to have himself in hand for the moment not that that was any consolation i hope i never see eyes glaring at me like that again you says he and it was like the growl of a beast i going to kill you dye hear that now kill you for the sneakin scum you are yes sir i goin to watch you die for what you done there was froth at the corner of his mouth he was appalling but before i do you goin to tell these here gennehuen somethin you goin to confess to em that you tried to rape my wife that so isnt it you snuck up there an you tuk her unawares an try to ravish her he paused livid now then you tell em it was so terrified i stared at the man but i couldnt have spoken for the life of me and suddenly he lost control and flung himself at me kicking and clawing the others hauled him back and luke says it dont signify a damn thing john hold him off you fellows you think youre goin to get the truth out of him anyways we know he tried to rape your good lady dont we boys were all satisfied i reckon he knew it was a lie and so did they but they chorused assent and eventually it pacified mandeville at least to the point where his only interest lay in disposing of me i ought to burn you alive he snarled i ought to nail you to a tree an have the niggers geld you in fact thats just what ill do ill hold on there fohn says luke this is jus wild talk you cant murder him thataway why caint i after what he done because wordd git out an it dont do to murder a man even if he is a rapin stinkin skunk im not i cried i swear im not you shet up says luke fact is john mandeville while i dont deny hes got killin comin to him i dont see how you can do it lessn you fight him on the square fight him shouts mandeville damned if i do he aint deservin anythin but execution well now aint i atellin you it caint be done even ifn you hang him or cut his throat or shoot him how you gonna be sure word aint gonna git out whos to tell luke johnson theys ony us here an niggers with mighty long ears no sir unless you fight him which you aint willin to do and caint say as i blame you for he dont deserve the consideration well then we got to study out some way of givin him whats comin to him they argued on and i listened in horror as they discussed means of slaughtering me for that was what they meant to do not a doubt god the value men place on a rogered woman i tried to intervene pleading to be heard but mandeville smashed me in the face and luke stuck a gag in my mouth and then they went on with their dreadful discussion it was terrible but all i could do was listen until one of them motioned the others away and they fell to talking in lowered voices and all i could catch was snatches and words like alabama and tombigbee river and very place for him and no i reckon there aint no risk whos to know and then they laughed and presently mandevile came over to me well mr arnold says he smiling like a hyena i got good news for you yes sir mighty good we aint goin to kill you how you like that no sir we value you a mite too high for that i reckon youre a sneakin varmint that took advantage of a mans hospitality to try and steal his honour we got suthin better for you than jus killin you like to hear about it i wanted to stop my ears but i couldnt mandeville smirked and went on one of my friends here he got a prime idea his cousin a planter over to alabama quite a ways from here now my friend goin over that way takin a runaway back to another place and he ready to blige me by takin you a stage farther to his cousins plantation nobody see you leave here nobody see you git there an when you do you know what goin to happen to you suddenly he spat in my face you goin to be stripped an put in the canefields long with the niggers you pretty dark now i seen mustees as light as you an by the time you laboured in the sun a spell you brown up pretty good i reckon an there youll be slave arnold see you wont be dead but youll wish you were aint nobody ever goin to see you on account it a lonely place an no one ever go there ifn they do why you just a crazy mustee nobody know you here nobody ever ask for you an you never escapeon account no nigger ever run from that plantation swamps an dogs always git em so you safe there for life see you think youll enjoy that life slave arnold he stood up and kicked me savagely now aint that a whole heap bettern jus killin you quick an easy i couldnt believe my ears i must be dreaming the whole ghastly thing i writhed and tried to spit the gag out tried to beg for mercy with my eyes but it was useless they laughed at my struggles and then they tied my feet and threw me into a cupboard before they shut the door luke leaned over me with his friendly grin and said softly reckon youll count it a pretty dear ride you had friend was she good i hope for your sake she was cos shes the last white woman youll ever see you dirty texian bastard i couldnt believe what id heard i still find it incredible that white men civiised white men could doom another white man to be dragged away to some vile plantation herded with niggers flogged to work like a beast it couldnt be true surely all id done was rattle mandevilles wife well if i ever caught a man doing the like to elspeth id want to kill him probably and i could understand mandeville wanting to as well but how could he doom me to the living hell of black slavery it must be their ghastly idea of a joke it couldnt be true it just could not be but it was how long i lay in that cupboard i dont know but it was dark when the door opened and i was dragged out they had brought my coat and it was wrapped over my head and then i felt the horror of fetters being clapped on my ankles i tried to scream through my gag and struggled but they carried me away bodily muttering and laughing and presently i was flung on to the hard surface of a cart i heard luke say take good care o that valuable merchandise tom little and laughter and then we were jolting away in the darkness i twisted in my bonds halfcrazed with the abomination of it and then the jacket was pulled away and in the dimness of the cart a womans voice said lie still theres no use struggling believe me i tried struggling once its no good you must wait wait and hope she pulled out the gag but my mouth was too parched to speak she laid her hand on my head stroking it and in the dark her voice kept whispering rest dont struggle wait and hope lie still wait and hope her name was cassy and i believe that without her i must have gone mad on that first night on the slave cart the darkness the close animal stench of the enclosed space in which we were cooped up and most of all the horror of what lay ahead reduced me to a croaking wreck and while i lay shuddering and moaning to myself she stroked my head and talked in a soft sibilant voicehardly a trace of nigger more new orleans frenchy like annettes telling me to be easy and rest and not to waste my breath on foolish raving all very well but foolish raving is a capital way of releasing ones feelings however she talked on and in the end it must have soothed me because when i opened my eyes the cart was stopped and a little sunlight was filtering through cracks in the board roof giving a dim illumination to the interior the first thing i did was to crawl about the placeit wasnt above four feet high examining it but it was as tight as a drum and the doors appeared to be padlocked i couldnt see a hope of escape i was chained by the legs the woman had managed to untie the cord at my wrists and even if i had succeeded in breaking out what could i have done against two armed men they would doubtless be making for alabama by back roads and trails far from any hope of assistance and even if by some miracle i got out and gave them the slip they would easily run me down hobbled as i was the horror of it overcame me again and i just lay there and wept there was no hope and the womans voice suddenly came to confirm my fears it wont seem so bad after a while she said nothing ever does i turned to look at her and for a moment a crazy thought struck methat she too was white and the victim of some fearful plot like my own for she was no more like a nigger than i was at first glance you have seen her head on old egyptian carvings both chin and forehead sloping sharply away from a thin curved nose and wide heavy lips with great almondshaped devils eyes which can look strong and terrible in that delicate face she was unusually tall but everything about her was fine and fragile from the high cheekbones and thin black hair bound tight behind her head to the slender ankles locked in slave fetters even her colour was delicate like very pale honey and i realised she was the lightest kind of nigger what they call a musteefino she reminded me of a siamese cat graceful and sinuous and probably far stronger than she looked mind you my thoughts werent running in their usual direction i was too powerfully occupied with my predicament for that and i fell to groaning and cursing again i must have babbled something about escape because she suddenly said why do you waste your breath dont you know better by now theres no escape not now or ever my god i cried there must be you dont know what theyre going to do to me im to be enslaved on a plantation for life is that so strange said she bitterly youre lucky you havent been there before what were you a house slave im not a bloody slave i shouted im a white man she stared at me through the dimness oh come now we stop saying that when were ten years old its true i tell you im an englishman cant you tell she moved across the cart peering at my face frowning then give me your hand she says i let her look at my nails she dropped my hand and sat back staring at me with those great amberflecked eyes then what are you doing here in gods name you may be sure i told her at length but leaving out the juicy parts mandeville suspected me unjustly i told her she sat like a graven image until it was done and then all she said was well now one of you knows what it feels like she went back to her corner now you know what a filthy race you belong to but dear christ i exclaimed i must get out of it i must how her lips writhed in a sneer do you know how many times ive run three times and each time they caught me and dragged me back escape bah you talk like a fool but but last night in the dark you said something about waiting and hoping that was to comfort you i thought you were one of us she gave a bitter little laugh well you are now and i tell you there isnt any hope where can you run to in this vile country this land of freedom with slavecatchers everywhere and dogs and whippinghouses and laws that say im no better than a beast in a sty her eyes were blazing with a hatred that was scaring you try and run see what good it does you but slavecatchers cant touch me if only i can get out of this cursed wagon look i went on desperately there must be a chancewhen they open the doors to feed us how little you know of slavery she mocked me they wont open the doors not till they get me to forsters place and you to wherever youre going feed us thats how they feed us like dogs in a kennel and she pointed to a hatch in the door which i hadnt noticed for the rest you foul your sty why shouldnt you youre just a beast did you know that was what the romans called us talking beasts oh yes i learned a lot about slavery in the fine house i was brought up in brought up so that i could be made the chattel of any filthy ruffian any beggar or ignorant scum of the levees just so he was white she sat glaring at me then her shoulders drooped what use to talk you dont know what it means but you will you will well you may guess how this raised my spirits the very fierceness of the woman her bitter certainty knocked what little fight i had out of me i sat dejected and she silent until after a while i heard little and his companion talking outside and presently the hatch was raised and a tin dish was shoved in and a bottle of water i was at the hatch in a flash shouting to them pleading and offering money which set them into roars of laughter say hear that now aint that bully what about you cass aint you got a thousand dollars to spare for ifn we let you go no well aint that a shame though no my lord im sorry but truth is me an george here we dont need the money anyways an i aint too sure wed trust your note o hand either hawhaw and the cruel brute slammed down the hatch and went off chuckling through all this cass never said a word and when we had tried to eat the filthy muck they had given us and rinsed our throats from the bottle she went back to her corner and sat there her bead against the boards staring into vacancy presently the cart started up and for the rest of the day we jolted slowly over what must have been a damned bad road while the atmosphere in the cart grew so hot and stifling that i was sure we must suffocate before long once or twice i bawled out to little pleading with him but all i got was oaths and obscene jokes so i gave up and all the time cassy sat silent only occasionally turning to stare at me but making no reply to my croaks and questions i cursed her for a black slut but she didnt seem to hear towards sunset the cart stopped and immediately cassy seemed to come to life she peered through a crack in the side of the wagon and then crawled over to me motioning me to talk in whispers listen she said you want to escape i couldnt believe my ears escape i quiet in heavens name now listen if i can show you how to escape will you make me a promise anything my god anything the great almond eyes stared into mine dont protest too easily i mean what i say will you swear by all that you believe to be holy that if i help you escape you will never desert me that you will help me in my turn to gain my freedom id have sworn a good deal more than that with hope surging through me i whispered i swear i promise ill do anything no ill never desert you i swear it she stared at me a moment longer and then glanced towards the door soon now they will bring our food when they do you will be making love to me do you understand i couldnt follow this but i nodded feverish with excitement in a whisper she went on when they see us whatever they say defy them do you understand me taunt them swear at them anything then leave the rest to me whatever i do or say do nothing further what are you going to do what can i quiet she started up theyre coming i think now over there where theyll see us and as footsteps came round to the back of the cart she sprawled into the middle of the floor dragging up her dress and pulling me down on top of her trembling and for once not for the usual reasons i clung to the pliant body crushing my mouth down on hers and plunging like mad gad as i look back what a waste of good effort it was in the circumstances i heard the hatch flung open and in that moment cassy writhed and began to sob in simulated ecstasy clawing at me and squealing there was an oath and commotion at the hatch and then a cry of tom tom come quick that damned texian feller hes screwin the wench more commotion and then littles voice what you think youre doin blast ye get offa her this minute get off dye hear or ill fill yore ass with buckshot i bawled an obscenity at him and then there was a rattling at the lock the door was flung wide to the gathering dusk and little glared in his piece levelled at me i decided i had defied him sufficiently and rolled away cassy scrambled up into a reclining position damn you bawls little dont you never get enough i stayed mum while he cursed at me his pal staring popeyed over his shoulder and then cass shrugging her shoulders petulantly and moving to display her fine long legs remarked why cant you let us be whats the harm in it littles piggy little eyes went over her he licked his lips still keeping his gun pointed at me harm in it his voice was thick you ol forsters wench aint you think you can rattle with everyone you please not while im around my gel you dirty nigger tail you she shrugged again pouting and spoke in a voice very unlike her own ifn massa say cassy don mind none anyways this feller aint bait for a gel like me i used to real men littles eyes opened wide is that a fact his loose bearded mouth opened in a grin well think o that now i didnt know you was thataway inclined cass fancy yellow gel like you with all them lady airs he was thinking as he talked and there was no doubting what those thoughts were well now you just come out o that cart this minute dye hear you this was to me keep yourself mighty still lessn you want a bellyfull o lead come on my gel git your ass outa that wagon smart cassy slid herself to the tail of the cart while they watched her closely and dropped lightly to the ground i stayed where i was my heart hammering little motioned with his gun and the other fellow slammed and locked the door leaving me in darkness but i could hear their voices plain enough now then cass says little you step roun there lively now so now you jus shuck down dye hear there was a pause and then cassys new voice massa gwine ter be nice to cassy cassy a good gel please massa ever so much by god an so ye will look at that george here you hol the gun an make yourself scarce by gosh im goin to tend to this lil beauty right here an now what you waitin

your piece when im done here gimme back that gun reckon ill keep it by case her ladyship gits up to anythin but you wont honey will you i heard georges reluctant footsteps retreating and then silence i strained my ears but could hear nothing through the wagon side a minute passed and then there was a sudden sharp gasp and a thin whining sound halfway between a sigh and a wail and the sound of it made the hairs rise on my neck a moment later and cassys voice in sudden alarm mas george mas george come quick suthin happen to mas tom he hurt himself come quick whats that georges voice sounded from a little way off and i heard his feet running what you say what happened tom you all right tom what the gunshot crashed out with startling suddenness near the back of the wagon there was a scream and a choking groan and then nothing until i heard the padlock rattle the door was flung back and there was cassy even in the dusk i could see she was naked she still had the musket in her hand quickly she cried come out theyre both done for i was out fetters and all in a twinkling george lay spreadeagled at my feet the top half of his face a bloody mash she had given him the buckshot at pointblank range i looked round and saw little crouched on his knees by the campfire his head down even as i started towards him he rolled over with a little bubbling sob and i saw the knife hilt sticking out of the crimson soaking mess that stained his shirt he twitched for a moment bubbling and then was still cassy was at the wagon holding weakly to the door her head hanging i hopped over to her grabbed her round the waist and swung her off her feet oh you wonderful nigger i shouted spinning her round you little black beauty you bravo two at one stroke by george well done indeed and i kissed her gleefully set me down she gasped in gods name set me down so i put her down and she shuddered and sank to the ground all of a heap for a moment i thought shed fainted but she was a prime girl that one with her teeth chattering she grabbed up her dress pulling it down over her head which seemed a pity for she cut a truly splendid figure in the firelight i patted her on the shoulder telling her what a brave wench she was oh god says she with her eyes tight shut oh horrible i didnt know what it was like when i drew the knife from his belt and she put her face in her hands and sobbed serve him right says i youve done him a power of good and the other one too couldnt have done better myself by jove no i couldnt youre a damned goodplucked un young cassy and you may tell em that tom arnold said so but she sat there shivering so i wasted no more time but searched toms pockets for the keys to our fetters and soon had us both loose then i went through their pockets but apart from fifteen dollars there was nothing worth a curse i stripped georges body because it struck me that he was about my size and his togs might come in handy then i looked to their guns one musket two pistols with powder and ball saw that the wagon horse was all to rights and all the time my heart was singing inside me i was free again thanks to that splendid nigger wench by gum i admired that girl and still do shed have made a rare mate for my old sergeant hudson and while i heated up some coffee and vittles left by the late unlamented i told her what i thought of her she was crouched by the fire staring straight ahead of her but now she seemed to shake herself out of her trance for she threw back that lovely egyptian head and looked at me you remember your promise says she and i assured her i did assured her twenty times over i can see her now those wonderful almond eyes watching me while i prattled on praising her resource and courageit was a strange meal that a runaway slave girl and i sitting round a camp fire in mississippi with two dead bodies lying by and before it was done she had thrown off her fit of the shakes after all when youre new to it killing is almost as disturbing as nearly being killed and was telling me what we must do next my admiration increased why she had thought it out all beforehand in the wagon down to the last detail it had been my remark about slavecatchers not touching a white man that had set her thinking and shown her how she could make a successful run this time with me to help her we must travel as master and slave says she that way no one will give us a second thought but we must go quickly it may be a week before mandeville discovers that this wagon never reached forsters place and that these two men she gave a little shudder are missing it might even be longer but we dare not count on it we dare not long before then we must be out of the state on our way north in that says i nodding to the cart and she shook her head it can take us no farther than the river we must go faster than it will carry us we must go by steamboat hold on though that costs money and these two hadnt but fifteen dollars between them we cant get a passage on that then well steal money says she fiercely we have pistols you are a strong man we can take what we need but i wasnt having that not that im scrupulous but im no hand as a footpad its too risky by half and so i told her risk she blazed you talk of risk after what i have done this night dont you seewe have two murders on our hands isnt that a risk do you know what will happen if were caught you will be hanged and ill be burned alive and you talk of robbery as a risk holding someone up will only increase the danger says i for then we would be hunted whereas if we go our way quietly therell be no hue and cry until these two are found if they ever are whoever we robbed could go the way these went says she then there would be no added danger by god she was a coldblooded one that when i protested she lost her temper why should we be squeamish over white lives dyou think i care if every one of these filthy slavedriving swine is torn to pieces tomorrow and why should you shrink from it after what they would have done to you are they your people these i tried to convince her it wasnt principle but pure lack of nerve and we argued on she waxing passionate she hated with a lust for revenge that frightened me but i wouldnt have it and eventually she gave up and sat staring into the fire her hands clenched on her knees at last she says very quietly well money we must have however we come by it and if you will not steal for it well there is only one other way it does not add greatly to the risk but but i would do almost anything to avoid it possibly im a naturalborn pimp for i jumped to the conclusion that she was thinking of whoring her way upriver with me as her protector but it was something far grander than that we must go to memphis says she it is a town on the river not more than fifty miles from here so far as i can judge that would be for the day after tomorrow perhaps another day that in itself is no great risk for we have to go to the river anyway and if god is kind to us none of mandevilles friends or people of forsters who would know me will cross our path and when we are there we can find the money oh yes we can find the money and to my astonishment she began to weep not sobbing but just great tears rolling down her cheeks she dashed them away and then fumbled inside her dress and after a moment she produced a paper soiled but very carefullyfolded which she passed to me wondering i opened it and saw that it was a bill of sale dated february for one cassy a negro girl the property of one angel de marmalade of new orleans now duly sold and delivered to fitzroy howard of san antonio de bexar there was another scrap of paper with it which fluttered down she made a grab but not in time to prevent me seeing the words scrawled on it in a coarse lumpy hand wensh cassy ten lashys wun dollar and a signature that was illegible she drew away and spoke with her head turned from me that was my second bill of sale i was fourteen i stole it from howard when he was drunk and i ran from him they caught me but he was dead by then and when they auctioned me with his other goods they didnt bother to look for the old bill i kept it to remember just to remember so that when i was free and far away i should never forget what it was to be a slave no one ever found it they never found it her voice was rising and she swung her head round to stare at me her eyes brimming i never thought it might serve to win my freedom but it will how in heavens name youll carry it to memphis youll be mr fitzroy howard no one knows him this far north he died in texas four years ago four years hes been screaming in hell and youll sell me in memphis oh ill fetch a fine price youll see a thousand two thousand dollars maybe three for a choice mustee wench fancybred only nineteen and schooled in a new orleans brothel oh theyll buy all right well this seemed firstrate business to me and i said so three thousand dollars why woman what were you ever thinking of highway robbery for half that sum will see us rolling upriver in stylebut wait though if youre sold howll you get away can run oh believe me i can run the moment you have the money youll buy passages on a boat north well have decided which one beforehand leave it to me to run at the right time well meet at the levee or somewhere and go aboard together youll be what they call a niggerstealer then and i a runaway slavebut they wont catch us what mr and mrs whateverwechoosetocallourselves firstclass passengers to louisville oh no well be safe enough if you keep our bargain well it had crossed my mind of course in the last two seconds from the moment shed reminded me of the nasty stigma of niggerstealing that it would be a sight safer to catch a different boat all on my own with the three thousand dollars and leave miss cassy to fend for herself but she was as quick as i was if i didnt get out of memphis says she slowly and intently leaning forward to look into my face id give myself up and tell them how we had run together and you had killed two men back in mississippi and where the bodies were and all about you you wouldnt get far mr what is your name anyway er flash er brown i mean but look here my dear girl i promised not to desert you remember dyou think im the kind to break his word i must say i dont know says she slowly i only tell you what will happen if you do it may cost me my life but it will certainly cost you yours mr flasherbrown i wouldnt dream of leaving you says i seriously not for a moment but i say cassy this is a tophole plan why didnt you tell me beforeits absolutely splendid she gazed at me and took a deep breath and then turned to gaze into the fire you would think so i suppose perhaps it seems a little thing to you to be placed on a block and auctioned like a beast to the highest bidder to be pawed over and fumbled by dirty hands stripped even and gloated over the tears were starting again but her voice never shook how could you even begin to imagine it the hideous shame the humiliation she swung round on me again a habit of hers which i confess made me damned jumpy do you know what i was until i was thirteen i was a little creole girl in a fine house in baton rouge with my papa and two brothers and two sisters all older than i their mother was dead she was whiteand my mother who was a slave mustee was mother to them as well we were the happiest family in the world i loved them and they loved me or so i thought until my father died and then they sold us my loving brothers sold me their sister and my mother who had been more than a mother to them they sold us my mother to a planter me to a bawd in new orleans she was shaking with passion something seemed called for so i says pretty steep work that bad business i was a whore at thirteen i ran away back to my family and they gave me up they put me in a cellar until my owner came and took me back to new orleans you saw that other paper with the bill of sale do you know what it is it is a receipt from a whippinghousewhere slaves are sent to be corrected i was only thirteen so they were lenient with me only ten lashes can you understand what that did to me can you for they make a spectacle of it oh yes i was tied up naked and whipped before an audience of men can you even begin to dream what it is like the unbelievable frightful shame of it but how could i make you understand she was beating her fist on my knee by now crying into my face you are a man what would it do to you to be stripped and bound and flogged before a pack of leering laughing women oh well says i i dont really know they cheered me do you hear that cheered me because i wouldnt cry and one of them gave me a dollar i ran back blind with tears with that receipt in my hand and the shedevil who kept that brothel said keep it to remind you of what disobedience brings and i kept it with the other so that i shall never forget she buried her head on my knee weeping and i was at a loss for once i could think of one good way of comforting us both but i doubted if shed take kindly to it so i patted her head and said well its a hard life cassy theres no denying but cheer up theres a good time coming you know well be away to memphis in the morning raffle you off collect the cash and then hey for the steamboat why we can have a deuced good time of it i daresay for im bound for the east coast you know and we can travel together why we can do you swear it she had lifted her head and was gazing up at me her face wasted with crying god she was a queer one one minute all cold steel and killing two men and then getting the jumps over em and from that she was plotting calmly and suddenly raging with passion and now imploring me with the wistful eyes of a child by george she was a handsome piece but it wasnt the time or place i knew she was too much in a taking ill wager she had talked more that night than shed done for years but women have always loved to confide in me i think its my bluff honest manly countenanceand my whiskers of course you do promise she begged rue you will help me and never desert me never until im free well you know what my promises are still i gave it and i believe i meant it at the time she took my hand and kissed it which disturbed me oddly and then she says looking me in the eyes strange that you should be an englishman i remember years ago on the pierrepoint plantation the slaves used to talk of the underground railroad the freedom road they called it and how those who could travel it in safety might win at last to canada and then they could never be made slaves again there was one old man a very old slave who had a book that he had gotten from somewhere and i used to read to them from it it was called nores epitome of navigation all about the sea and ships and none of us could understand it but it was the only book we had and so they loved to hear me read from it she tried to smile with her eyes full of tears and her voice was trembling on the outside there was a picture of a ship with a union jack at its mast and the old man used to point to it and say dats de flag o liberty chillun dat de ol flag and i used to remember what i had once beard someone say i cant recall where or when but i never forgot the words she paused a moment and then said in a whisper almost whoever stands on british soil shall be forever free its true isnt it oh absolutely says i were the chaps all right dont hold with slavery at all dont you know and strange as it may seem sitting there with her looking at me as though i were the second coming well i felt quite proud you know not that i care a damn but well its nice when youre far away and dont expect it to hear the old place well spoken of god bless you says she and she let go my hand and i thought of making a grab at her for the third time but changed my mind and we went to sleep on opposite sides of the fire after id stoked it up and shoved littles body into the bushes deuce of a weight to move he was too it took us two full days to memphis and the closer we got the more uneasy i became about the scheme we had undertaken the chief risk was that we would be recognised by somebody and if looking back i can say that it was only a chance in a thousand well thats still an uncomfy chance if your neck depends on it i was in high enough spirits when we set off from our camping place at dawn for the glow of being free again hadnt worn off it was with positive zest that i hauled the corpses of little and george well into the thickets and dumped them in a swampy pool full of reeds and frogs then i tidied up the tracks as well as i could and we set off cassy sat in the back of the cart out of sight while i drove and we rolled along through the woods over the rutted road it was more like a farmtrack really until i came to a fork running northwest which was the direction we wanted to go we followed it until noon without seeing a soul which i now know was pretty lucky but soon after we had cooked up a fry and moved on we came to a small village and here something hap pened which damped my spirits a good deal for it showed me what a small place even the american backwoods can be and how difficult it is to pass through without every tom dick and harry taking an interest in you the village was dozing in the afternoon with only a nigger or two kicking about a dog nosing in a rubbish tip and a baby wailing on a porch but just the other side of town there was the inevitable yokel whittling on a stump with his straw hat over his eyes and his bare feet stuck in the dust i decided it was safe to make an inquiry and pulled up hollo says i cheerily hollo yself says he am i on the road to memphis friend says i he thought about this chewing and polishing up one of those crackerbarrel witticisms which are mississippis gift to civiisation at last he said well if ydont know for sartain youre a damfool to be headin along it aint you i would be if i wasnt sure of direction from a smart man like you says i he cocked an eye at me how come youre so sure its like talking before salt with the arabs or doing business with a turk you must go through the ritual because its a hot day that makes you sure makes me sure youre thirsty which makes me sure youll take a suck at the jug ive got under my seat and then youll tell me the road to memphis i threw the jug at him and he snapped it up like a trout taking a fly guess i might sample it at that says he and sampled about a pint jayzus thats drinkin liquor yeah i reckon you might be on the memphis road sure enough should git there too provided you dont fall in coldwater creek or git elected guynor or die afore you arrive he threw the jug back and i was about to whip up when he says you fm nawth you dont talk like ol miss nor arkinsaw neether no im from texas you dont say long ways off the texies young jim noble be went down there bout two years back ever run across jim i reckon not no he considered me the sharp sleepy little eyes peeping out under the frayed straw brim would that be tom littles wagon your drivin seems i know that broken spoke an the horse for a moment my blood ran cold and i stopped my hand from going to the pistol in the back of my belt well it was tom littles wagon says i still would be if be hadnt loaned it me yesterday when i take it back it will be his again i guess if id stayed in that country and learned to whittle with a barlow knife and chew tobacco id have made president that a fact says he first time i heerd o tom lendin anything well im his cousin says i so he didnt mind lending it to me and i whipped up and made off good for him calls the yokel after me he might ha told you the road to memphis while he was about it by george it rattled me i can tell you when we were out of sight i conferred with cassy and she agreed we must press on as hard as we could go with every loafer in the county weighing us up the sooner we were clear the better so we pushed on and might have made it next day if i hadnt had to rest the horsespavined old bitch she was we had to sleep another night out and the following morning we left the cart beside a melon patch telling a nigger to mind it for us and walked the last mile into memphis town it was a fairsized place even in those days for half the cotton in the world seemed to find its way there but to my jaundiced eye it appeared to be made entirely out of mud it had rained from first light and by the time we had walked through the churnedup streets and been splashed by wagons and by damfools who didnt look where they were going we were in a sorry state but the crowded bustle of the place and the foul weather made me feel happier because both lessened the chance of anyone recognising us now all that remained to be done was for me to sell a runaway slave and arrange for us to get out of town without any holes in our hides easy enough you may think for a chap of flashys capabilities and ill admit your confidence wouldnt be misplaced but i wonder how many young chaps nowadays in this civilised twentieth century would know how to go about it if they were planked down near penniless and with their boots letting in on a foreign soil and asked to dispose of a finestrung mustee woman whose depression and nervousness were growing steadily as the crisis approached it takes thought i tell you and a strong grip on ones own gorge to keep it from leaping out the first thing was to find when the next sale was and here we were lucky for there was one in the market that very afternoon which meant we could do our business and god willing be out by nightfall next i must inquire about steamboats so leaving cassy under the shelter of a shop porch i pioshed down to the levee to make inquiries it was pouring fit to frighten noah by now with a howling wind as well and by the time i tacked up to the steamboat office i was plastered with gumbo to the thighs and sodden from there up to add to my difficulties the ancient at the office window wearing a dirty old pilot cap and a vacant expression was both stone deaf and three parts senile when i bawled my inquiries to him above the noise of the storm he responded with a hand to his ear and a bewildered grin is there a boat to louisville tonight i roared hey boat to louisville caint hear you mister speak up caint ye i dragged my collar closer and dashed the rain out of my eyes boat to louisville tonight i yelled boat to where oh for pitys sake louis i gathered all my lung power ville is there a boat tonight at last he beamed and nodded shore nough mister the new missouri leaves at ten i thanked him forcibly and ploughed back up town now all that must be done was render myself and cassy as respectable as possible and go to work with our hands on our hearts the first part we managed roughly in the back room of a cheap apartment house which i hired for the day my good coat which had been thrown over my head when i left greystones a prodigious stroke of luck that for it had springs precious papers sewn in the lining was sadly soiled but we made the best of it and rehearsed the final details of our plan i was in a sweat about how cassy would slip away from her new owner but this she brushed aside what made her grit her teeth to stop them chattering was the thought of mounting the slave block and being sold which seemed strange to me since it had happened to her before and didnt involve any pain or danger at all she was to run late that evening make her way back to the apartment house knock at my window which was on the ground floor and be admitted i would have clothes for her by then and wed make our way to the levee and go aboard the missouri as mr and mrs james b montague of baton rouge travelling north in the dark it should be simple enough if i do not come wait says she i will come in the end if i dont come by tomorrow ill be dead and you will be able to go where you will but until then i hold you to your word your pledged promise remember i remember i remember says i jittering but suppose you cant run suppose he chains you up or something what then he wont says she cahnly be assured i can run there is nothing hard about running any slave can do it but to stay free that is the impossible part unless you have a refuge a protector i have you well ive been called a few things in my time but these were new if shed known me better shed have thought different no doubt but she was desperate and i was her only hopea hellish pickle for a girl to be in youll agree i strove to calm my fluttering bowels and presently we set out for the slave market if youve never seen a slave auction i can tell you its no different from an ordinary cattle sale the market was a great low shed with sawdust on the floor a block at one end for the slaves and auctioneer and the rest of the space taken up with the buyers and spectators wealthy traders on seats at the front very much at ease casual buyers behind and more than half the whole crew just spectators loafers bumarees and sightseers spitting and gossiping and hawhawing the place was noisy and stank like the deuce with clouds of baccy smoke and esprit de corps hanging under the beams id been scared stiff that when i entered cassy for sale there would be all sorts of questions crossexamination and the like which i wouldnt be able to answer convincingly but i had been fretting unduly i believe if you entered a swedish albino at a memphis sale and swore he was a nigger theyd stick him on the block no questions asked that auctioneer would have sold his own grandfather and probably had he was a small furious redbearded man with a slouch hat a big cigar and a quart bottle of fortyrod in his coat pocket which he sucked at in between accusing his assistants of swindling him and bawling to everyone to give him some sellin room when i entered cassy he hardly glanced at her bill of sale but spat neatly between my feet and asked me aggressively if i was an underground railroad agent whod thought better of convoying a nigger to canada and decided to sell her off for private gain the crowd round him all hawhawed immensely at this and said he was a prime case which relieved my momentary horror at his question and the auctioneer said he didnt give a damn anyhow and where the hell was eli bowless niggers papers because he hadnt got them and theyd drive a man out of his mind in this country what with their finickin regulations and would they get the hell out of his way so he could start the sale no he wouldnt put up jacksons buck perseus because he was rotten with pox and everyone knew it jackson had better put him out to stud over in arkansas where nobody noticed such things no he wouldnt take notes of hand from any but dealers he knew hed enough tarnation paper as it was and his clerk just used it to confuse him and line his own pockets and he knew all about it and one of these days wouldnt he make that clerks ass warm for him and strike him dumb but his bottle was half empty and he hadnt even started the sale yet would they git out from under his feet or did they want to be still biddin their bollix off at two in the morning and more of the same all of which was mighty reassuring i left cassy to be herded off with the other niggers and got a place by the wall to watch the sale which the little auctioneer conducted as if he was a ringmaster pattering away incessantly and keeping up his style of irascible confusion all the time the crowd loved it and he was good too taking an occasional swill at his bottle and firing his comments at the lots while the bids came in see this here old wench of mastersons who died last week masterson died that is not her not a day over forty an a prime cook well yonly had to look at the belly masterson had on him thats testimony enough i reckon yes sir it was her fine cookin that kilt him now then what say eight hurinert to start nine for the best vittlesslinger tween evansville an the gulf or again this buck of tomkins he sired more saplins than methuselah thats why they call him george after george washington the father of his country why thout this boy the nigger poplationd be only half what it is we wouldnt hardly be havin this sale today but for this randy little hero there was talk of a syndicate to send him back to afriky to keep the numbers up now then wholl say a thousand but there was someone there who knew more about raising prices than even he did and that was cassy when she took the block after a whispered conference with the auctioneer he went on about how she spoke french and could embroider and tend to growing children or be a ladys maid or governess and play the piano and paint but it was all sham he knew what she would be sold for and the mob kept chorusing shuck her down lets get a look at her while she stood very demure with her hands folded in front of her and her head bowed she was pale and i could see the strain in her face but she knew what to do and presently when the auctioneer spoke to her she took off her shoes and then let down her hair very carefully so that it hung down her back almost to her waist that wasnt what they wanted of course they yelled and stamped and whistled but the auctioneer got the bidding up to seventeen hundred before he nodded to her and without a change of expression she shrugged her shoulders out of the dress let it slip down and stepped out as bare as a babe by gad i was proud of her as she stood there like a pale golden statue in the dim light under the beams with the mob goggling and roaring approval the price ran up to twentyfive hundred dollars in less than a minute at that there were only two bidders left a fancyweskitted young dandy in a stovepipe hat with his mouth open and a greybearded planter in the front row with a red face and big panama hat who had a little nigger boy behind his seat to fan him i reckon cassy got another thousand dollars out of those two all on her own she put one hand on her hip twentyseven hundred then she put her hands behind her head three thousand she stirred her rump at the dandy thirtytwo hundred and the planter shook his head his face sweating she looked straight down at him gravefaced and winked the crowd yelled and cheered and the dirty old goat slapped his thigh and bid thirtyfour the dandy swore and looked sulky but that was the bottom of his poke evidently for he turned away and cassy was knocked down to the other amidst whoops and cries of obscene advice to him hed better send his wife away to visit her folks in nashville for a spell they shouted and when she came back she could give him a decent burial for hed have killed himself by then hawhaw wish id a wench like that every day says the little auctioneer at payingout time you never saw such a heap of gold coin on one dirty deal table id make my fortune say if youd given me time to advertise proper wed ha had four mebbe five thousand where dyou git her mr eh howard as you said she was a ladys maid at my academy for gentlewomen says i gravely and the crowd in his office roared and clapped me on the back and offered me swigs from their bottles i was a card they said i had no opportunity to see what happened to cassy after she came down from the block her buyer was obviously a local man so presumably she wouldnt be taken far for the hundredth time i found myself wondering how she was going to make her escapes and what i would do if she didnt come before steamboat time i darent leave without her for fear shed split i would just have to wait jumping at every shadow no doubt but in the meantime i had plenty to occupy myself with and i set off for town weil weighted down with my newfound wealth it was the deuce of a lot of cash to be carrying or so i thought i didnt know america well then or id have realised that they dont think twice about carrying and dealing in sums that in england would be represented by a bankers draft odd in such a wild country but they like to have their cash about em and dont mind killing in its defence the first thing i now did was to repair to the best tailor in town and buy myself some decent gear and from there i made for a dressmakers to do the like for cassy ive never numbered meanness with cash among my many faults and i do like my women to have the very finest clothes to take off and all the little vanities to go with em there had been just north of three thousand dollars left when the auctioneer had taken his commission a man could do worse than be a slaveknocker it occurred to meand i made a fine hole in them with my purchases i spent probably twice on cassy what id spent on myself and didnt grudge it the creole woman who ran the shop was in a tremendous twitter showing every gown she had and the deuce of it was i could see cassy looking peachy in every one in any event i had two trunks full of gear which i ordered to be delivered to the levee labelled to go aboard the missouri that evening and took only enough clothing away with me for us to look respectable when we went aboard while i was doing my buying i had the dressmaker send a nigger to buy the tickets god the tiny things that change ones life if id gone in person all would have been different but there he brought them back and i stuffed them into the pocket of my new coat and that was that the business of sitting back like a sultan buying all the silks and satins in sight and gallantly chaffing madame threadneedle had put me in excellent fettle but as the afternoon wore away i began to feel less bobbish my worries about cassys escape returned and brandy didnt drive them away i couldnt bring myself to eat anything and finally i went back to my mean little room and busied myself removing springs papers from my old coat and stitching them into the waistband of one of my new pairs of pants after that i sat and chewed my nails while seven oclock went by and then eight and outside the rain pattered down in the dark and i envisaged cassy being overtaken in some dirty alley and hauled off to a cell or being shot climbing a fence or pulled down by hounds give me leisure in my fearful moments and my imaginings can outrun dantes any day i was standing staring at the candle guttering on its stand feeling the gnawing certainty that shed come adrift when a scratching at the window had me leaping out of my skin i whipped up the sash and she slipped in over the sill but my momentary delight was quickly snuffed when i saw the state she was in she was plastered from head to foot with mud her dress was reduced to a torn sodden rag her eyes were wild and she was panting like a spent dog theyre after me she sobbed slithering down against the wall there was blood oozing through the mud from a cut on her foot they spotted me slipping out of the pen and like a fool i ran for it oh oh i should have waited theyll rouse the section find us oh quick let us go now at once before they come she might as she said be an experienced runner but she wasnt up to flashys touch steady and listen says i keep your voice low how far behind are they she sobbed for breath i dont know they lost me when i doubled back oh dear god but they know ive run theyll scour the town take me again she lay back against the wall exhausted how long since you last heard em oh oh five minutes i dont know but they have dogs track us here not on a night like this they wont and certainly not through a town my mind was racing but i was thinking well should i bolt and leave her no shed talk for certain could we make the boat yes if i could put her in order up says i and hauled her to her feet she sagged against me weeping and i had to hold her up now listen cassy we have time they dont know where you are and every hunt in rutland couldnt nose you out here we cant run until youre clean and dressed wed never get aboard the boat haste wont serve when mr and mrs montague step out on to that street to go to the levee theyll go nice and sedate as i talked i was already sponging at her with the wet cloths i had ready now rest easy while i get you shipshape i cant run any longer she sobbed i cant she tossed her head from side to side crying with fatigue i just want to lie down and die i went on towelling her cleansing away the filth whispering urgently all the while we would make it i told her the boat was waiting we were rotten with money if we kept calm and went ahead without flinching we were bound to win free i had bought her a wardrobe that would take canada by storm yes canada i told her the freedom road an hour from now we would be steaming upriver safe as sleep i was trying to convince myself as much as her as i sponged and dried away frantically with one ear cocked for sounds of approaching pursuit it was tremendous work because even when i had got her clean she just lay there quite played out in mind and body moaning softly to herself i was almost in despair as i tried to haul clothes on to her she just lay back in the chair her golden body heaving gad she was a picture but id no time to enjoy it i struggled away coaxing pleading swearing come on come on you cant give up cassy not a staunch girl like you you stupid black bitch and finally i shook her and hissed in her ear all you have to do is stand up and walk confound it walk we cant fail now and youll never have to call anyone massa again that was what did it i think for she opened her eyes and made a feeble effort to help i egged her on and we got her into the long coat and adjusted the broadbrimmed bonnet and veil and i jammed the shoes on her feet and gloved her and stuck the gamp in her hand and when she managed to stand leaning against the table she looked as much like the outward picture of a lady as made no odds no one would know there wasnt a stitch on her underneath i had to halflead halfdrag her out of the back way and there was a feverish ten minutes while a nigger boy went and found a trap for us and we waited crouched on the boardwalk against the wall with the rain slashing down but there was no sign of her pursuers they must have lost her utterly and presently we were rolling down to the levee through the mud and bustle of the memphis waterfront and there in the glare of the wharf lamps was the good ship missouri with her twin whistles blasting the warning of departure i lorded it with the purser at the gangplank explaining that i would take madame directly to our stateroom as she was much fatigued and he yessirred me all over the place and roared up boys to escort us everyone was too occupied with crying goodbye and stand clear and all aboard to notice that i was holding up the graceful veiled lady on my arm by main strength when i laid her on the bed she was either in a swoon or asleep from exhaustion and fright i was so tuckered myself that i just collapsed in a chair and didnt stir until the whistles shrieked again and the wheel began to pound and i knew wed done it then i began to siop the brandy down lord i needed it the lastminute scare and hurry had been the final straw the glass was chattering against my teeth but it was as much exultation as nervous reaction i think cassy didnt stir for three hours and then she could hardly believe where she was not until i had ordered up a meal and a bottle of bubbly did she understand properly that we had got away and then she broke down and cried swaying from side to side while i comforted her and told her what a damned fine spunky wench she was i got some drink into her and forced her to eat and at last she calmed and when i saw her hand go up shaking and push her hair back i knew she was in command of herself again when they can think of their appearance theyre over the worst sure enough she went to the mirror pulling the coat round herself and then she turned to me and said i dont believe it but we are here she put her face in her hands god bless you oh god bless you without you id be back yonder tuttut says i champing away not a bit of it without you wed be in queer street instead of jingling with cash have some more champagne she didnt answer for a moment then she says in a very low voice you kept your word no white man ever did that to me before no white man ever helped me before ah well says i you havent met the right chaps thats all she was overlooking of course that i hadnt any choice in the matter but i wasnt complaining she was grateful which was firstrate and must be promptly taken advantage of i walked over to her and she stood looking at me gravely with the tears brimming up in her eyes no time like the present thinks i so i smiled at her and set the glass to her lips and slipped my free hand beneath her coat her breast was as firm as a melon and at my touch she gave a little whimper and closed her eyes the tears squeezing out on to her cheeks she was trembling and crying again and when i pushed away the coat and carried her over to the bed she was sobbing aloud as she clasped her arms round my neck i blame myself if there is one thing that can make me randier than usual it is danger safely past and with a creature like cassy to occupy me i dont give a thought to anything else she for her part was probably still so distraught that she was ready to abandon herself altogether she said later that she had never willingly made love to a man before and i believed her i suppose if youve been a goodlooking female slave used to being hauled into bed by a lot of greasy planters whether you like it or not it sours you against men and when you meet a fine upstanding lad like me who knows when to tickle rather than slap well youre grateful for the change and make the most of it but whatever the reasons the upshot was that mr and mrs montague spent that night and the rest of next day in passionate indulgence never bothering about the world outside and that was how i came adrift yet again of course a moralist would say that this was to be expected he would doubtless point out that i had fornicated my way almost continuously along the mississippi valley and draw the conclusion that all my trials arose from this i dont know about that as a general statement but ill agree that if i hadnt made such a beast of myself in cassys case i would have avoided a deal of trouble what with sleeping and dallying it was late on the next afternoon before i tumbled out to dress myself and take a turn on the promenade it was a splendid sunny day the good ship missouri was booming along in great style and i was in that sleepy wellsatisfied state where you just want to lean on the rail smoking and watching the great river roll by with the distant bank half hidden in haze and the lumber rafts and river craft sweeping down their crews waving and the whistles tooting overhead cassy wouldnt come out though she decided that the less she was seen the better until we were up among the free states which was sensible well thinks i youve had some bad luck my boy but surely its behind you now charity spring and his foul ship the noseyparkering mr lincoln the yankee navy they were all a long way south i could smile at the ludicrous figure of george randolph although he had brought me catastrophe enough at the time the abominable mandeville and his shrew of a wife the terror of the slavecart and the anxieties of memphis all by and done with up the ohio to louisvffle and then pittsburgh a quick trip to new york and then it would be england again and not before time and flashy the vampire could go to work on his fatherinlaw i was looking forward to that rather i wondered as i watched the brown water swirling by what would become of cassy if shed been a woman of less character id have been regretful at the thought of parting soon for she was a fine rousing gallop all sleek hard flesh like an athlete except for her top hamper but she was too much the spitfire really her present lazy compliance didnt fool me id bid her farewell around pittsburgh where shed be as safe as the bank and could travel easily to canada if she wanted there with her looks and spirit shed have no difficulty in getting a fortune somehow id no doubt not that i minded but she was a game wench presently i went back to the stateroom and ordered up a dinner the first full meal we had sat down to in style and the first cassy had had since she was a little girl she told me although we were alone in the cabin she insisted on putting on the finest dress i had bought her it was a very pale coffeecoloured satin i remember and those golden shoulders coming out of it and that strange egyptian head of hers with its slanting eyes quite kept me off my food that night she tasted port for the first time in her life i recall her sipping it and setting down the glass and saying this is how the rich live is it not then i am going to be rich what use is freedom to the poor well thinks i it doesnt take long to get ambition yesterday all you wanted was to be free however all i said was what you want is a rich husband shouldnt be difficult she clicked her lips in contempt i need no man from now on you are the last man i shall be indebted to i should hate you for it but i dont do you know why it is not just because you helped me and kept your word but you were kind also i shall never forget that poor little simple black girl i was thinking to mistake absence of cruelty for kindness just wait till it serves my interest to do you a dirty turn and youll form a different opinion of me and then she took me aback by going on and yet i know that you are not by nature a kind man that there is little love in you i know there is lust and selfishness and cruelty because i feel it when you take me you are just like the others oh i dont mind i prefer that i tell myself that it levels the score i owe you and yet it cannot quite level it ever because even although you are such a man as i have always taught myself to hate and despisestill there were moments when you were kind do you understand clearly says i youre maudlin its the port of course tell the truth i was halfamused halfangry at the way she told me what she thought of me still if the fool wanted to think i was kind she was welcome she was looking at me in her odd solemn way and do you know it made me somehow uncomfortable those big eyes saw far too much youre a strange chit i told her not as strange as the man who buys a dress like this one for a runaway slave girl says she and blast me if the tears didnt start again well there you are understand em if you can so to cheer her up and put an end to her foolish talk i came round and took her across the table this time with the crockery rattling all over the place the wine splashing on the floor and my left knee in a bowl of fruit it was a fine frenzied business and pleased me tremendously when it was over i looked down at her with the knives and forks scattered round her sleek head and told her she should run away more often she reached over an apple and began to eat it her eyes smouldering as she looked up at me i shall never have to run again she said never never never that was all she knew our blissful little idyll was coming to an end for next morning i made a discovery that turned everything topsyturvy and drove all thoughts of philosophy out of her head i had determined to breakfast in the saloon and leaving her in bed i took a turn round the deck to sharpen my appetite it seemed to me that we ought to be making louisville sometime that day and seeing a bluff old chap leaning at the rail i inquired of him when we might expect to arrive he looked at me in amazement removed his cigar and says gawd bless mah soul suh did you say louisville certainly says i when will we get there on this boat suh never pon my word what i gazed at the man thunderstruck this boat suh is for st louis not louisville this is the mississippi river suh not the ohio for louisville you should have caught the j m white at memphis he regarded me with some amusement do i take it you have boaded the wrong steamer suh my god says i but they told me and then i remembered my shouted conversation in the rain with that drivelling buffoon at the steamboat office the useless old bastard had caught the word louis only and given me the wrong boat which meant that i was some hundreds of miles from where i wanted to beand cassy was as far from the free states as ever if i was dismayed you should have seen her she went blazing wild and hurled a pot of powder at my head which fortunately missed you fool you blockhead hadnt you the sense to look at the tickets so much for all my kindness that shed been so full of it wasnt my fault says i trying to explain but she cut me off do you realise the danger we are in these are slave states and we should have been close to ohio by now your idiocy will cost me my freedom stuff and nonsense we can catch a boat from st louis back to louisville and be there in two days wheres the danger for a runaway like me turning south again towards the people who may be coming up river to look for me oh dear lord why did i trust an ape like you ape you insolent black slut blast you if you had taken thought yourself instead of whoring about this last two days like a bitch in heat youd have seen we were on the wrong road dyou expect me to know one river from another in this lousy country our discussion continued on these lines for a spell and then we quieted down there was nothing to be done except wait through an extra two days in the slave states and while cassy was fearful of the prolonged risk she said she supposed we could make louisville and then cincinnati and pittsburgh safe enough however the shock didnt make our voyage any happier and we were barely on speaking terms by the time we reached st louis where some more bad news awaited us although the river was thick with steamboats traffic was so heavy that there wasnt a stateroom or even a maindeck passage to be had for two days which meant that we must kick our heels in a hotel waiting for the bostona which would carry us up the ohio we kept under cover for those fortyeight hours except for one trip that i made down to the steamship office and to buy one of the new army colt revolvers just in case at the same time i was able to take a look at the town which interested me because in those days st louis was a great swarming place that never went to bed and was full of every species of humanity from the ends of america and beyond there were all the mississippi characters steamboat people niggers planters and so on and in addition the place was chocabloc with military from the mexican war with easterners and europeans on their way to the western gold fields with hunters and traders from the plains men in red shirts and buckskins bearded to the eyes and brown as nuts salesmen and drummers clergymen and adventurers ladies in all the splendours of the eastern salons shuddering delicately away from the sight of some raucous mountain savage crouched vomiting in the muddy roadway with his bare backside tanned black as mahogany showing through his cutaway leather leggings there were skinners with their long whips sharps in tall hats with paste pins in their shirts tall hard men chewing tobacco with their long coats thrown back to show the new five and sixshooters stuck in thefr belts there was even a fellow in a kilt lounging outside a billiard saloon with a bunch of yarning loafers as they eyed the white and yellow whores gay as peacocks tripping by along the boardwalk from the levee crammed with bales and boxes and machinery to the narrow mudchurned streets uptown it was all bustle and noise and hurry and stuck in the middle was the church st louis was all so proud of with its grecian pillars and pointed fresco just like a london club with a spire stuck on top and i was sauntering back to the hotel smoking a cigar and congratulating myself that we would be on our way tomorrow when i chanced to stop outside an office on one of the streets just to cast an idle eye over the official bills and notices posted there you know the way of it you are just gaping for gapings sake and then suddenly you see something that shrivels the hairs right down to your backside there it was a new bill staring me full in the face one hundred dollars reward i will pay the above sum to any person or persons who will capture dead or alive the murderer and slave stealer calling himself tom arnold who is wanted for the brutal killings of george hiscoe and thomas little in marshall county mississippi and stealing away the female slave cassiopeia the property of jacob forster of blue mountain spring plantation tippah county mississippi the fugitive is six feet in height longlegged and well built customarily wears a black moustache and whiskers and has genteel manners he pretends to be a texian but speaks with a foreign accent satisfactory proofs of identity will be required one hundred dollars reward offered in the name and authority of joseph w matthews governor of mississippi i didnt faint away dead on the spot but i had to hold on to a rail while the full import of it sank in they had found the bodies and assumed i had murdered them and the traps were in full cry but herehundreds of miles away and then i remembered the telegraph theyd be looking in every town from st louis to memphis by now youd have thought with killings happening every day in their savage country that they wouldnt make such a row over another two but of course it was the slavestealing that had really stirred them up here was added reason for getting to the free states quickly in ohio they wouldnt give a damn how many niggerbeaters throats id cut especially in such a good causeid learned enough in my brief unhappy experience of the united states to know that it was two countries even then and they hated each other like poison yes up there id be safe and on trembling legs i hurried back to the hotel to break the glad news that they were after us with a vengeance cassy gasped and went pale but she didnt cry and while i was stamping about chewing my nails and swearing she got out a map which we had bought and began to study it her finger was trembling as she traced the route down from st louis to the cairo fork and then northeast up the ohio river at louisville she stopped well what now says i thats only a twoday journey and well be beyond their reach wont we she took her head you do not understand the ohio river is the boundary between the slave states and the free but even in the free states we are not safe until we have gone well upriver see she traced again from louisville to cincinnati and far beyond that we still have slave states on our right hand first kentucky and then virginia if we were to land on the indiana or ohio shores we should be in free states but i could still be retaken by the slavecatchers who are thick along the river but but i thought the free state folk sheltered slaves and helped them surely they cant take you off free state soil of course they can there were tears in her eyes now oh if we could be sure of finding an abolitionist settlement or an underground railroad station all would be well but how do we know there are laws forbidding people in ohio to aid runaways slaves are caught and dragged back across the river daily by these bands of catchers with their guns and dogs and with the time we have lost here notices of my running from memphis will have reached the kentucky shore my name will have been added to the list of the other poor hunted creatures trying to escape north well what the blazes can we do she traced on the map again we must stay aboard our steamboat all the way to pittsburgh if indeed the boats run so far in this weather if not they will at least take us far enough up the ohio to catch a train from one of the eastern ohio towns into pennsylvania once we are in pittsburgh we can laugh at all the slavecatchers in the south and you will be far beyond the reach of the mississippi law well that was a comforting thought how long does it take says i to pittsburgh by boat five days she bit her lip and began to tremble again within a week from now i shall be either free or dead i wish shed thought of some other way of putting it and it crossed my mind that i might be a good deal safer parting company with her on the other hand a boat to pittsburgh was the fastest way home and if we kept to our cabin the whole way we should come through safe they dont look for runaway slaves in staterooms they might look there for a murderer though and blast it i hadnt even done the murders could i fob them off on her if the worst came to the worst but it wouldnt there must be a limit to the distance they could chase us it was in a fine state of the shakes that we boarded the bostona the next morning and i didnt know an easy moment until we had passed the cairo fork that night and were steaming up the ohio i drank a fair amount and cassy sat gazing out towards the northern shore but early on the second morning we reached louisville without incident and i began to breath again evening saw us at cincinnati and cassy was in a fever of anxiety for the boat to move off again cincinnati although on the ohio side was a great place for slavecatchers and she cried with relief when the sidewheel started at last and we churned on upriver but at breakfast time next day there was a rude awakening the weather had grown colder and colder throughout our journey and now when you looked overside there were great cakes of dirty brown and green ice riding down the current and a powdering of snow lying on the ohio bank the fellows in the saloon were of opinion that the boat would go no farther than portsmouth if that far the captain wouldnt risk her in this kind of weather and sure enough down comes the captain presently all gravity and grey whiskers to announce to the saloon that he couldnt make portsmouth this trip on account of the ice but would put in at fishers landing which was three miles short of the town and set anyone ashore that wanted to go the rest he would carry back to cincinnati they raised a tremendous howl at this waving their tickets and demanding their money back and one tubby little chap in gold glasses cries out angrily intolerable fishers landing is on the kentucky shore how am ito be in portsmouth tonight there wont be a ferry running in this weather the captain said he was sorry the ohio side was out of the question because the ice was thick all down the north channel but i must be in portsmouth tonight fumes the tubby man perhaps you dont know me captain congressman smith albert j smith at your service it is imperative that i be in portsmouth to support my congressional colleague mr lincoln at tonights meeting well im sorry congressman smith says the captain but if you were going to support the president i couldnt land you in ohio today infamous cries the little chap why ive come from evansville for this and mr lincoln has broken his journey home specially for this meeting and is awaiting me in portsmouth really captain when matters of such national importance as the slave question are to be discussed by eminent the slave question cries the captain well sir you may land in kentucky for me let me tell you and i hope they welcome you warmly and off he stumped red in the face leaving the little chap wattling and cursing i didnt have to be told the captain was a southerner but i was vastly intrigued to find my path crossing so close to mr lincolns again that seemed to me a good reason for turning back to cindnnati and giving portsmouth a wide berth he and his sharp eyes and embarrassing questions were the last things i wanted to meet just now but cassy wouldnt have it even landing in kentucky was preferable to cincinnati and she pointed out that the farther i was upriver the safer ild be she was sure there must be a ferry running at portsmouth it was only a short walk along the shore she said and once across we could journey inland to columbus and from there quickly to pittsburgh if she didnt mind i didnt because i felt we must be beyond pursuit by now but i noticed she hesitated at the gangplank scanning the shore at fishers landing and her steps were slow as we walked over the creaking wooden stage suddenly she stopped caught my arm and whispered let us go back i never thought to stand on this soil again i feel evil hanging over us oh we shouldnt have landed please let us go back quickly before its too late but it was too late even then for the steamboat having landed about a dozen of us including the incensed congressman was already backing away from the stage her whistle whooping like a lost soul cassy shuddered beside me and pulled her veil more tightly round her face truth to tell i didnt care for the look of the place much myself just the stage and a mean little tavern and bleak scrubby country stretching away on both sides however there was nothing for it now the other passengers crowded round the tavern asking about a ferry and the yokel there opined that there might be one later that day but with the ice he couldnt be sure the others decided to wait and see but cassy insisted that we should push on along the bank we could see portsmouth in the distance on the far shore and it did seem there would be a better chance of a ferry there so we set off together carrying our bags along the lonely little road that wound among the trees by the river it was a cold grey afternoon with a keen wind sighing among the branches and through the trunks the brown ohio ran by with the massive floes grinding and booming in the brown water there was low cloud and a threat of snow and a dank chill in the air that was not just the weather cassy was silent as we walked but her words still sounded in my ears and although i told myself we were safe enough by this time surely i found myself ever glancing back along the deserted muddy track lying drear and silent under the winter sky we must have walked about an hour and although it was still early afternoon it seemed to me to be growing darker when we saw buildings ahead and came to a tiny village on the river bank we were nearly opposite portsmouth by now and already some lights were twinkling across the water the river here seemed to be more choked with ice than ever stirring and heaving but moving only gently downstream the keeper of the tavern that served the place laughed to scorn our inquiries about a ferry however in his opinion the ice would freeze again overnight and then we could walk across he couldnt give us beds but we were welcome to couch down for the night and in the meantime he could give us fried ham and coffee we should have stayed at fishers landing says i but cassy just sank down wearily on a bench without replying i offered her some coffee but she shook her head and when i reminded her it was only for one night she whispered it is very near us now i can feel the dark shadow coming closer oh god oh god why did i set foot on this accursed shore again what bloody shadow snaps i for she had my nerves like fiddle strings were snug enough here girl within spitting distance of ohio weve come this far in gods name whos going to stop us now and as though in answer to my question from somewhere down the road outside came the yelping and baying of hounds cassy started and i own that my heart took a sudden leap although whats a dog barking after all and then came the sound of footsteps and mens voices and presently the door was shoved open and half a dozen or so rough fellows came in and bawled for the landlord to bring them a jug of spirits and some food i didnt like the look of them by half big toughlooking men with pistols in their belts and two of them carrying rifles their leader was a tall blackbearded villain with a broken nose who gave me a hard stare and a curt good day and then strode to the door to curse the dogs leashed up outside i felt cassy sink shuddering against me and just caught her whisper slavecatchers oh god help us i fought down my instinctive desire to make a dash for the door id made too many sudden dashes on this trip already my throat was dry and my hands trembling but i forced myself to drink my coffee and even asked cassy in a loud steady voice if she required anything more to eat plainly we would have to get out of here as soon as possible but we must not rouse an instants suspicion or we were done for the newcomers were talking so much by now that our silence went unnoticed and almost their first words confirmed what cassy had said that nigger of thompsonsll be hidin up in masons bottom says one thats whar they always run afore they try the portsmouth ferry well he aint gettin no ferry tonight for sure he can lay out an freeze an the dogs kin pick him up in the mornin too bad about the ferry though says the leader kinda had a notion to go over tonight to th abolitionist meetin since when you go to abolitionist meetins buck since i heerd that sonofabitch of an illinoy lawyer goin to be speakin thats since when precious mr goddam congressman lincoln thats a bastard i get real discontented with that is you figurin on takin a few bad eggs along says the other laughing could be could be if things had looked right i might have taken me a picket rail a nice big bag o feathers an mustered up some hot tar to boot i reckon thats th only way to discourage some o these niggerlovin duff ers discourage em a dam sight better with a rope or a good spread of buckshot says a third and other suggestions followed most of them unrepeatable all this time i had felt cassy trembling beside me but now she suddenly whispered in a shaking gasp we must leave i cant bear it any longer please let us go anywhere away from them i knew she was near breaking this same wench whod killed two men on a dark country road so i helped her to her feet and with a muttered good day led her towards the door naturally they turned to look at us and the leader buck says aint no ferry movin tonight mister where you figurin on goin er fishers landing says i no ferry there either says he you be best here tonight i hesitated i think well move on says i come my dear and we were almost at the door when he said hold one one moment mister he was sitting forward on his stool and there was a grin on his loose mouth that i didnt care for pardon my askin but would your companion be a white lady sickened i turned to face him and if she is not says i thought she warnt says he standing up mighty fancy dressed though for a nigger i like my women well dressed i tried to keep my voice level but it wasnt easy sure sure says he hooking his thumbs in his belt jus that when i see nigger ladies an their wearin veils an shiverin like they had the ague well i get curious he kicked his stool away and walked forward whats your name wench i saw cassys eyes flash behind her veil and suddenly she was no longer trembling which made up for me ask my master she said he gave a growl but checked himself right pert too all right mister whats her name belinda is it now suddenly he reached forward before i could stop him and twitched away her veil laughing as she started back well well now right pretty as well as pert youre a lucky feller mister an what might your name be j c stubbs says i and ill be damned if youll be damned anyway unless im mistaken he snapped his face vicious belinda an j c stubbs eh jus you wait right there then while i have a little look here and he pulled a handful of papers from his pocket i been keepin an eye on you this few minutes mr j c stubbs an now i get a look at your little black charmer i got me a feelin where is it now yes here we have it uh huh mr stubbs i got a suspicion you aint mr stubbs at all but that youre a mr fitzroy howard who offered a spankin mustee gal named cassy at memphis a few days back an he broke off with a shouted oath because he was looking down the barrel of my colt there was nothing else for it at the hideous realisation that we were caught i had snatched it from the back of my waist and as he started back and his hand swept away his coattail i jammed the gun into his midriff with the violence of panic and bawled in his face move and ill blow your guts into ohio you others get your hands up lively now or ill spread your friend all over you i was red in the face with terror and my hand was quivering on the butt but to them i was probably a fearsome sight their hands shot up a rifle clattered to the floor and bucks ugly face turned yellow he fell back before me his mouth trembling and the sight of it gave me a sudden surge of courage down on the floor damn you all of you down i say or ill burn your brains buck dropped to the boards and the others followed suit i hadnt the nerve to go among them to remove their weapons and for the life of me i couldnt think what to do next i stood there swearing at them wondering if i should shoot buck where he lay but i hadnt the bate for it he raised his head to cry hoarsely you aint gonna run nowhere mister well get you before youre gone a mile you an that yaller slut well make you pay for this i snarled and mowed at them brandishing my gun and he cowered down and then i backed slowly towards the door still covering them the colt was shaking like a jelly i couldnt think there wasnt time if we ran for it now where would we run to theyd overhaul us with their filthy dogs if only there was some way to delay them a sudden inspiration struck me and i glanced at cassy she was at my elbow quivering like a hunted beast and if she too was terrified at least it wasnt with the terror that is helpless cassy i snapped can you use a gun she nodded take this then says i cover them and if one of them stirs a finger shoot the swine in the stomach there catch hold good girl good girl ill be back in an instant what is it her eyes were wild where are you dont ask questions trust me and with that i slipped out of the door pulled it to and was off like a stung whippet id make quarter of a mile maybe more before she would twig or they overpowered her and that quarter mile could be the difference between life and death but even as i was away with my first frenzied spring a duncoloured whitefanged horror came surging up at my side teeth dragged at the tail of my coat and i came down in a sprawling tangle of limbs with one of those damned hounds snarling and tearing at me by the grace of god i fell just beyond reach of its leash i suppose the brute had gone for me because it knew a guilty fugitive when it saw one and now it tore and frothed against its chain to be at me i jumped up to resume my flight and then i heard cassy scream in the tavern the colt banged somebody howled and the door flew open cassy came out at a blind run making for the thicket that bordered the river i spared not a glance for the tavern door but went highstepping after her for all i was worth expecting a bullet between the shoulders at every stride as luck had it the thicket was only a dozen yards away but by the time i had burst through it cassy was well ahead of me i suppose it was blind instinct that made me follow her now that my own chance of a clear getaway had been scuppered by whatever had gone amiss in the tavern the stupid bitch could have held them longer than two seconds youd have thought and there was nothing to do but shift like blazes it was growing dusk but not near dark enough for concealment and she was running for dear life along the bank eastwards i pounded down the slope yelling to her at my wits end over where we were going to run to could we hide no my god the dogs we couldnt outstrip them along the bank where then the same thoughts must have been in cassys mind for as i closed on her and heard the din of shouting rise a hundred yards behind me she suddenly checked and with a despairing cry leaped down the bank to the waters edge no no i bawled not on the ice well drown for certain but she never heeded there was a narrow strip of brown water between her and the nearest floe and she cleared it like a hunter slipping and falling but scrambling up again and clambering over the hummocks beyond oh christ thinks i shes mad but then i looked behind and there they were running down from the tavern with the dogs yelping in the background i took a race down the bank and jumped my feet flew from under me on the ice and i came down with a sickening crash i staggered up plunging over the mass of frozen cakes locked like a great raft ahead of me and saw cassy steadying herself for a leap on to a level floe beyond she made it and i tumbled down the hummocks and leaped after her somehow i kept my footing and slithered and slipped across the floe which must have been thirty yards from side to side beyond it there were great rough cakes bucking about in the current but so close together that we were able to scramble across them once my leg went in and i just avoided plunging headlong cassy was twenty yards ahead and i remember roaring to her to wait for me god knows why but one does these things and then behind me came the crack of a shot and glancing over my shoulder i saw that our pursuers were leaving the bank and taking the ice in our wake god it was a nightmare if id had a moment to think id have given up the ghost but fear sent me skipping and stumbling over the pack babbling prayers and curses sprawling on the ice cutting my hands and knees to shreds and staggering up to follow her dark figure over the floes all round the ice was grinding and groaning fearfully it surged beneath our feet cracking and tilting and then i saw her stumble and kneel clinging to a floe she was sobbing and shrieking and two more shots came banging behind and whistled above us in the dusk as i overtook her she managed to regain her feet glaring wildly back beyond me her dress was in shreds her hands were dark with blood her hair was trailing loose like a witchs but she went reeling on jumping another channel and staggering across the rugged floe beyond i set myself for the jump slipped and fell full length into the icy water it was so bitter that i screamed and she turned back and came slithering on all fours to the edge i grabbed her hand and somehow i managed to scramble out the yelping of the dogs was sounding closer a gun banged a frightful pain tore through my buttock and i pitched forward on to the ice cassy screamed a mans voice sounded in a distant roar of triumph and i felt blood coursing warm down my leg my god are you hurt she cried and for some idiot reason i bad a vision of a tombstone bearing the legend here lies harry flashman late th hussars shot in the arse while crossing the ohio river the pain was sickening but i managed to lurch to my feet clutching my backside and cassy seized my hand dragging me on not far not far she was crying and through a mist of pain i could see the lights on the ohio bank not far away on our right if only we could make the shore we might hide or stagger into portsmouth itself and get assistance but then my wound betrayed me my leg wouldnt answer and i sank down on the ice we werent fifty yards from the shore with fairly level ice ahead but the feeling had gone from my limb i looked round buck and his fellows were floundering across the ice a bare hundred yards away cassys voice was crying up up only a little farther oh try try rot you cries i im shot i cant she gave an inarticulate cry and then by god she seized my arms stooped into me and somehow managed to halfdrag halfcarry me across the ice there must have been amazing strength in the slim body for im a great hulking fellow and she was near exhaustion but she got me along until we fell in a heap close to the bank and then we slithered and floundered through the icefilled shallows and dragged ourselves up the muddy slope of the ohio bank free soil sobs cassy free soil and a bullet smacked into the bank between us to remind her that we were still a long way from safety that shot must have done something to my muscular control for i managed to hobble up the bank with cassy hauling at me and then we stumbled forward towards the lights of portsmouth it was only half a mile away but try running half a mile with a bullet hole in your rump with cassys arm round me i could just stagger we plunged ahead through the gloaming and there were figures on the road ahead people staring at us and calling out just before we reached them we passed a tree and my eye caught the lettering on a great yellow bill that had been stuck there it read something about great meeting tonight all welcome and in large letters the names lincoln and smith i was gasping all in but i remembered that the little tabby man on the steamboat had been smith and he had said lincoln was speaking in portsmouth and i had sense enough to realise that wherever lincoln was there would be enemies of slavery and friends to all fugitives like us two hours ago id been wanting to avoid him like the pox but now it was life or death and there was something else stirring in my head i dont know why it was but i remembered that big man and his great hard knuckles and dark smiling eyes and i thought by god get to lincoln get to him well be safe with him they wont dare touch us if hes there and as cassy and i stumbled along the road and i heard voices calling out in concern who are they what is it great snakes hes bleeding look hes been shot i managed to find the breath to cry out mr lincoln where can i find mr lincoln great snakes man a face was peering into mine who are you whats slavecatchers cries cassy behind us with guns and dogs whats that girl slavecatchers my stars get them up here harry lend a hand john you run to your uncles quick flow tell him slavecatchers come over the river hurry boy theres no time to lose i could have cried out in relief but as i turned my head i saw in the distance figures clambering the bank and heard the yelp of those accursed dogs get me to lincoln for gods sake i shouted where is he what house lincoln you mean mr abraham lincoln why hes up to judge paynes aint he harry cmon then mister it aint that far ifn you can manage along harry help the lady there this way then best foot forward somehow i managed to raise a run and by blessed chance the house proved to be not more than a few furlongs away i was aware of a hubbub behind us and gathered that buck and his friends had run into various ohio citizens who were disputing their progress but only verbally for as we turned into a wide gateway and our helpers assisted us up a long pathway to a fine white house i heard the barking again and what i thought was bucks voice raised in angry defiance we stumbled up the steps and someone knocked and beat on the panels and a scaredlooking nigger put his head round the door but i blundered ahead pushing him back with a man helping cassy beside me we were in a big welllit hall and i remember the carpet was deep red and there was a fine mural painted on the wall above the stairs people were hurrying out of the rooms two or three gentlemen and a lady who gave a little shriek at the sight of us good god cries one of the men what is the meaning who are you lincoln i shouted and as my leg gave way i sat down heavily wheres lincoln i want him ive been shot in the backside slavecatchers lincoln at this there was a great hubbub and women swooning by the sound of it and i hobbled to the newell post of the stair and hung on i couldnt sit down you understand cassy with a man supporting her tottered past me and sank into a chair while the nicelydressed ladies and gentlemen gaped at us in consternation two horrid bleeding scarecrows leaving a muddy trail across that excellent carpet a stout man in a white beard was confronting me shouting how dare you sir who are you and what lincoln says i pretty hoarse wheres lincoln here i am says a voice what do you want with me and there he was at my shoulder frowning in astonishment im fitzhoward says i you remember fitzhoward i dont no not fitzhoward blast it wait though arnold oh god no my mind was swimming no comber lieutenant comber you must remember me he took a pace back in bewilderment comber the english officer how in the world thats a slave girl i gasped out i i rescued her from down south the slavecatchers found us chased us across river still coming after us and praise be to providence i had the sense to hit the right note dont let them take her back save her for gods sake it must have sounded well at least to the others for i heard a gasp of dismay and pity and one of the women a little ugly battleship of a creature bustles over to cassy to take her hands but but here sir the stout chap was all agog what a runaway girl septy shut that door this minute whats that my god more scarecrows what the devil is this who are i looked to the door and my heart went down to my boots the old nigger was clinging to the handle as though to support himself his eyes rolling the people of the house were rustling back to the doorways off the hall the stout man who i guessed was judge payne had fallen silent buck stood in the doorway panting hard his clothes sodden and mudspattered with his gun cradled in his left arm and behind him were the bearded faces of his fellows buck was grinning though with his loose lower lip stuck out and now he raised his free hand and pointed at cassy thats a runaway slave there mister an im a warranted slavecatcher that scoundrel at the stair theres the thievin skunk that stole her he took a pace forward into the hall im gonna take both of em back where they belong payne seemed to swell up good god says he what what this is intolerable first these two and now is my house supposed to be a slave market or what i want em both buck was beginning and then he must have realised where he was kindly sorry for intrudin on you mister but this is where they run to an this is where i gotta follow so jus you roust em out here to me an we wont be troublin you or your ladies no further for a moment you could have heard a pin drop then buck added defiantly thats the law i got the law on my side i felt lincoln stiffen beside me for gods sake i whispered dont let them take us he moved forward a pace beside judge payne and i heard one of the ladies begin to sob gently the first sobs before hysterics then lincoln says very quietly theres a law against forcing an entry into a private house indeed there is cries the judge take yourself off sir this instant and your bandits with you buck glared at him aint forcin nuthin im recapturin a slave like im legally entitled to anyone gits in my way is harbourin runaways an thats a crime i know the law mister an i tell you either you put them out o doors for us or stand aside because if they aint comin out were comin in judge payne fell back at that and the other people shrank away some of the women bolting back to the drawing room but not the ugly little woman who bad her arm round cassys shoulders dont you move another step she cries out nathan dont permit him they dont touch a hair of this poor creatures head in this house stand back you bully but my dear cries payne in distress if what they say is true we have no choice i fear who says its true there now child be still they shant harm you look missus buck swaggered forward limbering his rifle and stood foursquare with his pals at his back you best tend to what your ol man says we got the law behind us he glanced at lincoln who hadnt moved and was right in his path step aside lincoln still didnt move he stood very easy and his drawl was steady as ever on the subject of the law says he you say shes a runaway and that this man stole her we dont know the truth about that though do we perhaps they tell a different tale i know a little law myself friend and i would suggest that if you have a claim on these two persons you should pursue it in the proper fashion which is through a court an ohio court he added and id further advise you as a legal man not to prejudice your case by armed housebreaking or for that matter by dirtying this good ladys carpet if you have a just claim go and enter it in the proper place he paused good night sir it was so cool and measured and unanswerable that i could have wept with relief to hear him but i didnt know much about slavecatchers buck just grunted and sneered at him oh yeah i know about the courts i guess i do i bin to court before ill believe that says lincoln yeah youre a mighty fancy goddam legal beanpole aint you though well ill tell you suthin mister i know about courts an writs an all an there aint one o them worth a lick in hell to me im here them dam runaways is here an if i take em away nice an quiet we don have to trouble with no courts nor nuthin an afterwards well i reckon ill answer right smart for any inconvenience caused here tonight but i aint bein fobbed by smart talk theyre comin with me and he pushed the barrel of his piece forward just a trifle youll just take them says lincoln by force is that so you bet its so i reckon the courts wont worry me none neither well have done justice see i quailed to listen to him god i thought were finished he had the force behind him if he wanted to march in and drag us out bodily the law would support him in the end there would be protests no doubt and some local public outcry but what good would that be to us once they had us south of the river again i heard cassy moan and i sank down done up and despairing beside the newell and then lincoln laughed shaking his head so thats your case is it mr buck robinsons my buck will do thats your style is it buck brute force and talk about it afterwards well it has its logic i suppose but dye know buck i dont like it no sir thats not how we do things where i come from i dont give a damn how you do things where you come from mr smart buck spat out get out of my way i see says lincoln not moving well ive put my case to you in fair terms and youve answered it admirably after your own lights and since you wont listen to reason and believe that might is right well ill just have to talk in your terms wont i so you hold your gab and stand aside mister shouts buck now im warnin you fair and im warning you buck lincolns voice was suddenly sharp oh i know you i reckon youre a real hardbarked kentucky boy own brother to the smallpox weaned on snake juice and grizzly hide arent you youve killed more niggers than the dysentery and your grandma can lick any white man in tennessee you talk big step high and do what you please and if any legal beanpole in a store suit gets in your way youll cut him right down to size wont you just hes not a practical man is he but you are buck when youve got your gang at your back yes sir youre a practical man all right buck was mouthing at him redfaced and furious but lincoln went on in the same hard voice so am i buck and more for the benefit of any shirttail chawbacon with a big mouth im a whosyar boy from indiana myself and ive put down better men than you just by spitting teeth at them if you doubt it come ahead you want these peopleyoure going to take them he gestured towards cassy all right buck you try it just try it the rest of the world decided that abraham lincoln was a great orator after his speech at gettysburg i realised it much earlier when i heard him laying it over that guncarrying bearded ruffian who was breathing brimstone at him i couldnt see lincolns face but ill never forget that big gangling body in the long coat that didnt quite fit towering in the centre of the hall with the big hands motionless at his sides god knows how he had the nerve with six armed men in front of him but when i think back to it and hear that hard rasping drawl sounding in my memory and remember the force in those eyes i wonder how buck had the nerve to stand up in front of him either he did though for about half a minute glaring from lincoln to cassy to me and back to lincoln again twice he was going to speak and twice thought better of it he was a brawny violent man with a gun in his hands but speaking objectively at a safe distance now he has my sympathy as a fellow bully and coward i can say that buck bebayed precisely as i should have done in his place he glared and breathed hard but that was his limit and then through the open door came the distant sound of raised voices and a hurrying of many feet on the road i doubt if thats the kentucky militia says lincoln better be going buck buck stood livid still hesitating then with a curse he swung about and stumped to the door he turned again there dark with passion and pointed a shaking finger ill be back says he dont you doubt it mister ill be back an ill have the law with me well see about this by thunder ill get the law they clattered down the steps buck swearing at the others and as the door closed and the exclamations started flying lincoln turned and looked down at me his forehead was just a little damp the ancients in their wisdom made a great study of rhetoric says he but i wonder did they ever envisage buck robinson yes they probably did he pursed his lips hes a big fellow though likely big fellow he is i i think id sooner see cicero square up to him behind the barn than me yes i rather think i would he adjusted his coat and cracked his knuckles and now mr comber ive been wounded several times all of them damned painful but you may take my word for it that a ball in the bum is the worst by the time that hamfisted sawbones had hauled it out i was weak and weeping and my immediate recuperation wasnt eased by the fact that judge payne and lincoln agreed that cassy and i must be spirited out of the house without delay in case buck and his friends returned with an officer and a warrant with two men to support me and my buttocks in a sling i was helped about half a mile to another establishment where i gathered the folk were redhot abolitionists and put to bed face down of course i had already given a rough account of what had happened in answer to the questions they fired at me after buck had gone the judge wasnt concerned with anything but the events of the last few hours and was full of praise for my daring and endurance while his wife the ugly little woman and the other females made much of cassy and called her a poor dear and clucked over her cuts and bruises they were all stout antislavers of course as id guessed they would he and would you believe it while that blasted doctor was probing and muttering over my bottom the women downstairs actually sang now israel may say and that truly with harmonium accompaniment this to celebrate what judge payne called our deliverance and the others cried amen and were furious in their wrath against these vile slavetraffickers who hounded poor innocents with dogs and guns and she such a sweet and refined young thing oh my land the pity of her poor bruised limbs you ought to see her with a knife sometime thinks i or stripping for the buyers and for me they had nothing but blessings and commiseration for my torn arse which the judge called an honourable scar taken in the defence of liberty lincoln stood in the background watching under his brows but when they had taken us to the new house and i had been tucked up in bed he came along very patient and begged our hosts for a little time alone with me im afraid the good people of portsmouth will have to do without me this evening says he they might find my presence in public somewhat embarrassing anyway one successful speech in a day is quite enough so they left us and he sat down beside the bed with his tall hat between his feet now sir says he pointing that formidable head of his at me may i hear from you at some length i last parted from a respectable british naval officer in washington tonight i meet a wounded fugitive running an escaped slave across the ohio im not only curious you understand im also a legislator of my country a maker and guardian of its laws which on your behalf i suspect i have broken fairly comprehensively this night i feel im entitled to an explanation pray begin mr comber so i did there was no point in lying much i hadnt time for invention anyway and he would have seen through it so from new orleans on i told him the truth crixus my escape with randolph what happened on the steamboat the mandevilles the slave cart and cassy memphis and our eventual flight i kept out the spicy bits of course and mandevilles barbarous treatment of me i explained by pretending that omohundro had turned up at greystones with searchers and identified me that was how they treated underground railroad men in the south i said he listened attentively saying nothing the bright eyes never leaving my face when i had finished he sat silent a long while studying then he said well and then a long pause thats quite a story another pause yes sir that is quite a story he coughed havent heard anything to touch it since last time i was in the liberal club theres nothing you wish to add to it at all no detail you may have uh overlooked that is all sir says i wondering i see i see no no i just thought oh a balloon flight over arkansas or perhaps an encounter with pirates and alligators in the bayous of louisiana you know i demanded did he not believe me on the contrary i dont doubt it for a moment more or less anyway no i believe you sir my expressions of astonishment are really a tribute to you in america as in most other places its only the truth that we find hard to believe no its not what youve told me but what you havent told me that i find downright fascinating however i shant press you i would hate to force you off the path of veracity if you doubt me says i stiffly you may ask the girl cassy i already have and she confirms a great part of your story remarkable young woman that she has much character he cracked his knuckles thoughtfully very beautiful too very beautiful had you noticed yes i guess the queen of sheba must have looked something black but comely wasnt it however i was also going to add that your narrative of randolph fits very well with what i read in the papers about his escape from the steamboat his escape oh yes indeed he turned up in vermont of all places about two weeks ago and is now in canada i understand the liberal sheets were full of his exploits he smiled i dont hold it against you that there was no mention of you in his very full relation no mention of anyone much except george randolph but from all ive heard of him that is consistent extraordinary fellow he must be he should be grateful to you though up to a point at least i doubt it says i is that so well well ive no doubt youve noticed that even when gratitude costs nothing folks are often reluctant to show it theyll even pay hard money to avoid giving it where its due strange but human i suppose he was silent a moment youre sure theres nothing further you wish to tell me mr comber why no sir says i i can think of nothing i doubt that very much says he drily i really and truly do youve never seen the day when you couldnt think of something but do you know what i think mr comber speaking plain as man to man i look at you fine bluff british figurehead wellspoken easy frank splendid whiskers and i cant help remembering the story they tell in illinois about the honest southern gentleman you ever hear that one i said i hadnt well what they say about the honest southern gentleman he never stole the mississippi river no dont take any offence its as i said in washington i dont know about you except what my slight knowledge of humanity tells me which is that youre a rascal but again i dont know the trouble with people like you and me i guess is that nobody ever finds us out just as well maybe but it lays a burden on us we dont meet with regular punishments and penalties for our misdeeds which will make it all the harder for us to achieve salvation in the long run he frowned at the carpet anyway im a lawyer not a judge dont really believe that i want to know all about you its enough for me that you brought that girl across the ohio river today i dont know why for what reason or out of what strange chance its sufficient that shes here and will never wear chains again well since that was what counted most with him i was all for it his talk about suspecting me for a rascal had been downright unnerving it seemed a good time to butter him a bit sir says i eagerly all my efforts on that poor unfortunate girls behalf the hardships of the flight the desperate stratagems to which i was forced the wound taken in her defence wound did i say scratch rather why all these things would have been without avail had you not championed us in our hour of direst need that sir was the act of a christian hero of a sublime spirit if i may say so he stood looking at me with his head cocked on one side i must have been mad says he mind you i quite enjoyed it there for a moment he laughed uncertainly at least now that its over i think i did do you realise what i allowed myself to do you sir are in a way to being as highly successful a slave stealer as ever i heard of at least arnold fitzroy prescott or whatever his name is hes one hes also an accessory to two murders thats what theyd call it although id say it was moral selfdefence myself but a southern jury certainly wouldnt agree in the eyes of the law youre a deepdyed criminal mr comber and i the junior congressman from illinois a pillar of the community a trusted legislator a former holder of the united states commission a godfearing respected citizen its all there in my election address and the people believed it so it must be true i allowed myself in a moment of derangement moved by pity for that girl cassys distress i allowed myself sir to aid and abet you god knows what the penalty is in ohio for harbouring runaway slaves assisting slavestealers resisting a warranted slavecatcher and offering to disturb the peace by assault and battery but whatever it is im not in a hurry to answer for it i can tell you he scratched his head ruefully and began to fidget about the room twitching at the curtains and tapping the furniture with his foot his head sunk on his chest not that i regret it you understand ild do it again and again and again in spite of the law fine thing for a lawyer humph but theres a higher thing than the law and it belongs in the conscience and it says that evils such as slavery must be fought until the dragon is dead and in that cause i hope ill never stand back he stopped frowning also if theres one thing can get my dander good and high its a big mouthed kentuckian hill rooster with his belly over his britches and a sassmeandseewhathappens look in his eye yes sir bigchested bravos like our friend buck robinson seem to bring out the worst in me still i dont imagine well hear much more from his direction and if we do judge payne is fortunately a man of considerable influence or mrs payne is im never sure which and by the time the good judge has come out from under the bedclothes and scrambled into his dignity again i dont think ill have much to fret over anyway i can look after myself and lose no sleep but you mr comber would be better a long way from here and as quickly as may he now he was talking most excellent sense i twisted round from my prone position to cry agreement and gave my backside a nasty twinge indeed sir says i the sooner i can reach england i wasnt thinking of quite so far as that not just yet awhile i know youre all on fire to get home which is why you say you slipped away in new orleans in the first place pity you allowed yourself to be uh distracted along the way however since you did and have broken federal laws in the process it puts a different complexion on things for me you could go home now but its not that simple the way i see it my government my country needs you they still want you down in new orleans to give evidence against the crew of the bailioi college wasnt it your testimony as i understand it can put those gentlemen where they belong but mr lincoln there is evidence enough against them without me i cried all asweat again well perhaps there may be but a little more wont hurt if it makes certain of them after all that was why you sailed with them why you risked your hide as an agent wasnt it he was smiling down at me to bring them to book to strike another blow against the slave trade oh of course to be sure but well er youre perhaps reluctant to go back to new orleans because you feel it may be unsafe for you after recent events exactly youre absolutely right sir have no fear of that says he no one is going to connect the eminently respectable lieutenant comber rn with all those goings on far away up the river that was the work of some scoundrel called arnold fitzprescott or prescott fitzarnold or someone and if anyone did connect them i can assure you there would be no lack of influence working on your behalf to keep you out of trouble there are enough sympathetic ears in high places in the federal government to see to that at need provided of course that you are doing your duty by that same government and incidentally by your own by george this was desperate i had to talk him out of it somehow without raising more suspicions of me than he had already even so mr lincoln im sure it would be best if i could proceed home directly the case against the balliol college can surely be proved without my help well i daresay but thats not the point any longer this is quite a delicate situation you know see here ive stood up for you tonight and for that girl helped you both to break my countrys laws and broken em myself in a just fine cause which i believe to be in my countrys true interest and if it ever got out which i pray to the lord it wont there is enough antislavery sentiment in our federal government to ensure that it would all be winked at and no more said but theyre not going to wink if i a congressman help a witness in an important case to avoid his duty thats why im bound to send you back to orleans believe me you have nothing to fear there you can say your piece in the witness box and then go home as fast as my distant influence and that of grateful friends will send you aye and wait till the balliol college scoundrels denounce me as flashman their fellowslaver posing as a dead man thinks i well see how much influence is exerted on my behalf then i made a last effort mr lincoln says i believe me that nothing would give me more satisfaction than to accede to your request capital says he because thats what youre going to do he regarded me quizzically why you should be reluctant beats mei begin to wonder if theres an outraged husband waiting for you in orleans or something of that order if so tell him to go to blazes i daresay youve done that before there was one i could cheerfully have consigned to blazes as i lay there going hot and cold chewing my nether lip i have damnable luck truly how many poor devils have had to try and wriggle clear in arguments with folk like lincoln and bismarck he had me with my short hairs fast in the mangle and i darent protest any longer what the devil was i to say with those dark caverns of eyes smiling down at me i doubt if its anything as simple as an outraged husband though says he however you dont choose to tell me and i dont choose to press you i owe you that much on behalf of randolph and the girl cassy in return you owe it to me to go to orleans he stood beside the bed that odd quirk to his mouth watching me come mr comber it isnt very much after all and its in the cause dear to your heart remember there was nothing else for it and i tried to keep the despair out of my voice as i agreed so thats settled says he cheerily you can go south again but by a safe eastern route ill speak to judge payne and see that a hint reaches governor bebb well arrange for a us marshal to accompany you youll be safe that way and you wont run the risk of straying again he was positively benign the long villain i could have sworn he was enjoying himself the trouble with you jolly tars is you dont seem to find your way on land any too well he talked a little more and then picked up his hat shook hands and went over to the door good luck in new orleans mr comber or whatever your name is in the unlikely event that we ever meet again try and find out for me what clubhauling is wont you he pulled on his gloves and god bless you for what you did for that girl it was some consolation to think that id fooled mr lincoln some of the time at least he believed i had a spark of decency apparently so i thought it best to respond with a few modest and manly phrases about saving an innocent soul from bondage but he interrupted me with his hand on the door keep it for the recording angel says he ive a feeling youre going to need it and then he was gone and i was not to see him again until that fateful night fifteen years later when as president of the united states he bribed and coerced me into ruining my military reputation and risking my neck in order to save his union from disaster but thats another tale for another day that night in portsmouth he left me in a fine frustrated fury after all my struggling and running and ingenuity i was going to be shipped back to new orleans and inevitably a prison cell or worse i couldnt even run any more what with my behind laid open and there would be a marshal to see that i got safe into the clutches of the american navy too by george i was angry i could have broken lincolns long neck for him youd have thought after all id done for his precious abolitionist cause albeit against my will and better judgment that hed have had the decency to let me go my ways and given me a pound or two out of the poor box to boot but politicians are all the same theres no trusting them whatever not only because theyre knaves but because theyre even more inconsistent than women selfish brutes too at least though i was still alive and fairly full of sin and impudence when i might easily have been dead or chained on an alabama plantation or rotting at the bottom of the mississippi or the ohio for the future although it looked pretty horrid i would just have to wait and see and take my chance if it came i was allowed up next day and sat in state on the edge of a chair with my wounded cheek over the edge and various people came to see me abolitionists of course who wanted to shake the heros hand and in the case of the older ladies of the community to kiss his weathered brow they came secretly because like all towns thereabouts portsmouth was split between proslavers and abolitionists and my whereabouts was known only to a safe few they brought me gingerbread and good wishes and one of them said i was a saint normally id have basked in it as id done on other occasions but the thought of orleans took the fun out of it one of my visitors i even assailed with a thrown boot he was a small boy i suspect a child of the house who came in when i was alone and asked is it right you got shot up the ass mister say can i see i missed him unfortunately another glum thing was that cassy left that evening she isnt one of my prime favourites looking back too strongwilled and high strung but i hate to lose a good mistress just when im getting the taste of her however they said it wasnt safe for her to remain so near the ohio and an underground railroad man was to take her to canada we didnt even have the chance of a lusty farewell for when she came to say goodbye the ugly mrs payne was on hand to see fair play with cassy looking uncommonly demure and rather uncomfortable in a drab brown gown and poke bonnet i gathered she hadnt realised that id done my level best to desert her on the far bank of the ohio for she thanked me very prettily for all my help while mrs payne stood with her hands in her muff nodding severe approval cassiopeia is quite recovered from her ordeal says she and looks forward with the liveliest anticipation to reaching canada there our friends will see to it that she is provided with shelter and such employment as fits her station i have no doubt that she will prove a credit to all of us her benefactors and especially to you mr comber cassys face was like a mask but i saw her eyes glint in the shadow of the bonnet oh i dont doubt it says i cassiopeia is a very biddable child are you not my dear i patted her hand there there just be a good girl and mind what mrs payne and her kind friends tell you say your prayers each night and remember your er station there says mrs payne i think you may kiss your deliverers hand child i wouldnt have been surprised if cassy had burst out laughing or in a fit of rage but she did something that horrified mrs payne more than either could have done she bent down and gave me a long fierce kiss on the mouth while her chaperone squawked and squeaked and eventually bustled her away such liberties cries she these simple creatures my child this will never goodbye says cassy and that was the last i ever saw of her or of the two thousand dollars we had had between us ive never been able to recall for the life of me where it was stowed when we got off the steamboat at fishers landing but i know i didnt have it on my person which was careless of me ah well ive no doubt she put it to good useand it had been paid for her anyway however money was the least of my concerns just then unless there was some unexpected turn of events in the next few weeks i could see the american republic would be paying my board and lodging for some time to come i had nightmares about it in which i was in a place like the old bailey but with great stainedglass windows and a hanging judge in scarlet on the bench and spring and his mates all chained up leering in the dock and a voice droning out call beauchamp comber rn and i saw myself creeping into the witness box goaded on by lincoln and a us marshal and spring bawling out thats not comber combers dead thats the notorious flashy monstrum horrendum come to impose on your worships like the bloody liar he is and then consternation and i was dragged to the dock and chained to the others and the judge said it would be twice as bad for me as for them and upon conviction i would be shot in the other buttock and then hanged at which there was great cheering and i pleaded with them that i had been led astray and that it all came of playing vingtetun with disraeli and they said that made it worse still and then the faces and voices faded and i would find myself awake boiling with sweat and my wound aching like bedamned in the end it wasnt quite like that as you shall see have you noticed that things are never quite as bad or good as you expect them to beat least not in the way that you expect so it was now when my rump had healed enough for me to travel and judge payne brought along the marshal and with much handclasping and cheekkissing and hallelujahs i was despatched on my way to continue gods work as payne put it i wont bother you with the journey which was by coach and rail through columbus pittsburgh and baltimore and then by packet down to orleans sufficient to say that the marshal a decent enough fellow called cottrell watched over me like a mother over a chick very friendly very careful and that no official notice of our passage seemed to be taken until we came to new orleans there i was delivered into the care of captain bailey usn a very bluff gentleman who shook me cordially by the hand and said they were glad to see me hey and a fine commotion there had been when captain fairbrother had lost me by thunder yes but here i was safe and sound so all was well that ended well mind you mr comber in these days i dont ask too many questions says he im a sailor like you i do my duty the past few months are a closed account to me sir one hears all about outlandish things like underground railroads and what not but thats nothing to the point what i know is that facing me now is a brother officer in the service of a friendly power who is going to give evidence on behalf of the us navy against slaverunners capital work and he rubbed his hands more than that not my concern sir not my concern at all if anyone has been working for the underground railroad which is an illegal organisation of course well thats not our province is it thats for washington or state governments to worry about he grew confidential you see mr comber were a strangely divided country heresome for slaveholding others against now the government recognises it officially as you know but a lot of very important peoplesome in the government itself are against it we have the strange position where federal government people who may detest slavery nevertheless are bound to enforce the law against things like underground railroading so often as not a great many people frequently have to follow the example of your good lord nelson and turn a blind eye to a great many things such as what youve been doing between your er departure from captain fairbrother and this moment sir he frowned at me do i make myself clear sir i think so sir says i yees says he then suddenly look here comber between these four walls i heard from circles in washington that youve been slavestealing well fine i approve of that so does half the government but it couldnt approve officially my god no officially it should arrest you and heaven knows what besides but we cant even if we wanted to we need your evidence in this case youre a damned important agent by all washington accounts and we cant for the love of mercy have an international incident with the british he shook his head i could wish you had let well alone young man and yet by god from what i hear from the friends of a certain northern congressman you did a capital piece of work sir he beamed at me winking so there it is washington is concerned at all costs to keep your name and er recent activities quiet you just make your statement in court put on your hat and take the first packet out from this port you take me if only it could be that simple thinks i but i made one last effort to wriggle free is my evidence so necessary sir says i surely these balliol college people can be convicted convicted says he why were a long way short of that at the moment you know the procedure sir when a slavetrading ship is captured she must first of all be adjudged to be a slaver you know how it is in your own mixed commission courts at surinam and havana and so forth they hear evidence and pronounce themselves satisfied that she was carrying slaves you must have seen it a score of times and then when the ship has been confiscated and condemned then her master and crew may be charged with slavetrading and on conviction they can be hanged although they seldom are jail terms sometimes fines etc but with us its not quite the same as youll see i was hanging on every word hoping and praying that he would point out some loophole to me here in new orleans a court of adjudication will pronounce on the balliol college and according to that her master and crew may be charged with slavetrading and possibly since spring fought against ships of the us navy with piracy but none of these charges can even be brought sir unless the court of adjudication finds that the balliol college was indeed a slaver so far then we follow the same course as the mixed courts at havana and elsewhere but here sir there are much more powerful interests involved this is new orleans remember a long way from washington and new orleans holds no grudge against slavetraders like spring to secure the confiscation and condemnation of the balliol college as a slave ship the case must be proved to the hilt and beyond now do you see why your evidence is vital he tapped his desk this is not just a criminal a legal case mr comber its a political one sir see here he grew confidential again this man spring no ordinary blackbirder that why when he was brought in by fairbrothers peoplewhat happened the fellow was wounded i tell you sir there was a bail bond posted faster than you could sneeze a surgeon in attendance more lawyers running about than youd think existed why sir because theres money and power and political influence behind this damned tradethats why theres his ship how many hundreds of thousands of dollars investment dyou think she represents and not just dollars either but pounds sterling and pesos and francs they couldnt find any papers on her because that damned wife of springs heaved them all overside so what happens now but springs counsel enter papers to show shes registered in vera cruz mexico of all places and her owner is some bloody dago with a name as long as your leg mendoza y cascara or something mexico lord save us if theres one place we dont need complications with its mexico and they know it but they can prove shes mexicanowned for all shes baltimore built with an english skipper i could make little of this but one thing seemed clear but if she was carrying slaves when they took her and had slave gear aboard slave gear doesnt matter the equipment treaty doesnt hold up in new orleans sir mixed commission trials yes but not here the slaves sir theyre the thing well then precisely thats where weve got them there were slaves aboard and for all the treasure and effort that will be poured in on their side i dont see how they can get round it mind you sir the shifting and lying and trickery that goes on at a slave ship adjudication is something you must see to believe it wouldnt surprise me if spring claimed they were all his sons and daughters wearing chains because theyre perverted creatures ive seen excuses just as wild and in new orleans well you cant tell i would to god he added that fairbrother had had the sense to take the balliol college to havana shed have been nailed there fast enough and wed have been spared all this but with your evidence mr comber i dont see how we can go wrong oh theyll fight theyve got anderson whos as sharp a mind as ever took a brief or bribed a witness hell try every trick and dodge going and the adjudicator will be leaning his way remember but when you take the stand well sir where will they be then where they would be was of small interest to me where was flashy going to be i gulped and asked do they er do they know about that ill be giving evidence not yet says he smiling happily you see an adjudication isnt a trial we dont have to come and go with the other side much beforehand officially although i can tell you that the politicking thats been done in this case offers of settlement god knows what has been amazing whoever is behind spring theyre people who matter they want him and his ship clear probably frightened of what hell divulge if hes ever brought to trial oh its a fine dirty business mr comber the slime and corruption doesnt end on the slave deck i can tell you no they dont know about you yet but ill be surprised if a little bird doesnt tell em pretty soon lucky in a way that you didnt turn up until now court sits the day after tomorrow and if you hadnt been here wed have had to go in without our best witness lucky i thought just another few days lost up north and they might have started and got it over and id have been spared my appearance and inevitable unmasking i couldnt see anything for it now unless i got the chance to run again but bailey for all his amiability was no less watchful than the marshal had been even at the navy office there was a damned little american snotty keeping me company wherever i went and on the following day when i was taken down to the building where the adjudication court sat and was introduced to the counsel representing the us navy the snotty and a petty officer were trailing at my heels the counsel was a lordly man from washington with a fine aristocratic beak and silver hair falling to his shoulders his name was clitheroe and he talked to the air a yard above my head to hear him the business would be over in a couple of hours at most and then he would be able to get back to washington and direct his talents to something worth while he talked briskly for a moment or two about my part in the proceedings decisive corroboration was the expression he used and then consigned me to the care of his junior a quiet dark little fellow called dunne who had said very little and now took me apart into a side room instructing my escort to wait while he had a private word with me now what followed is gospel true and you will just have to believe me if it runs counter to your notions of how justice is done in the civilised world i cant help it nothing in my experience leads me to believe that things are any different in england or france even today this is what happened dunne talked to me for about five minutes around and about the case but all very vague and then begged to be excused for a moment he went out leaving me alone and then the door opened and in comes a prodigious fat man with a round face and spectacles for all the world like some friar tuck in a high collar he closed the door carefully beamed at me and says mr comber delighted to meet you sir my name is anderson marcellus anderson sir very much at your service you may have heard of me i represent the defendants in the case in which you are to be a distinguished witness my jaw dropped and i must have glanced at the door through which i had come from clitheroes office for he gave a fat mans chuckle and slid into a chair observing have no fears sir i shall not detain you above a moment the admirable clitheroe and your haha watchdog captain bailey would grudge me even that long no doubt but mr dunne is a safe man sir he and i understand each other he regarded me happily over his spectacles mr pickwick as ever was now very briefly mr er comber when we heard that you were to testify my client captain spring was mystified indeed sir do you know he even seemed to doubt your existence however you will know why i dare say i made rapid inquiry obtained a description of you and when this was conveyed to my client why sir a great light dawned upon him oh he was thunderstruck and i neednt go into distressing detail about what he said but he understood your haha position and the steps you had taken to safeguard yourself when the balliol college was arrested some months ago he took off his glasses and polished them regarding me benignly rash sir very rash if youll forgive me for saying so however its done now captain spring was incensed at what he considered justifiably i think to be a disloyalty on your part yes indeed and it was his first instinct to denounce you the moment you took the stand however sir it occurred to me its what im paid for that there might even be advantage to my client in having lieutenant he paused beauchamp millward comber as a witness for the plaintiff if his evidence was oh shall we say inconclusive it might do the defendant more good than harm do you take me sir i took him all right but without giving me a chance to reply he went on it amounts to this sir if my client is cleared as i feel bound to tell you i believe he will be for we have more shots in our locker than friend clitheroe dreams of then we have no interest in directing attention to the antecedents of lieutenant comber if captain spring is not cleared he shook his head solemnly then when the crew of the balliol college are arrainged for slavetrading and so forth their number will be greater by one than it is at present he stood up quickly now sir mr dunne will be impatient to speak to you again when we meet again at the hearing it will be as strangers until then i have the honour to bid you a very good day wait wait for gods sake i was on my feet my mind in a turmoil sir what am i to do do sir says he pausing at the door why it is not for me to tell a witness how he shall give evidence i leave that to your own judgment mr er comber he beamed at me again your servant sir and then he was away and two shakes later dunne was back aloof and businesslike describing to me the form and procedure of an adjudication court all of which went straight by me well ive been in some fearful dilemmas but this beat everything the navy expected my evidence to follow the lines of the statements id made in washington months back if it did spring would cut me down in open court and id be for the dock myself if it didnt if i lied myself hoarsespring would keep his mouth shut but the navy my god what would they do to me what could they do they couldnt arrest me surely no but they could investigate and question and god alone knew what might come of that the tangle was so terrible that i couldnt think straight at all there was nothing for it but to be carried along on the tide and do what seemed safest at the time i wondered if i should confess to bailey telling him who i really was and admitting my imposture but i darent id have been putting a rope round my own neck for certain there arent many blank periods in my memory but the rest of that terrible day is one i cannot remember the night that followed but i recall that on the next morning the day of the adjudication a strange recklessness had come over me i was beyond caring i suppose but i remember i stood muttering to myself before a mirror as i brushed my hair come on flashy my boy they havent got you yet remember gui shahs dungeon remember rudis point at your throat in the jotunberg cellar remember the ghazis coming at you on the road above jugdulluk remember the slave cart in mississippi remember de gautet drawing a bead on you well youre still here aint you your backside is better enough for you to run again if need be bristle up the courage of the cornered rat put on a bold front and to hell with them bluff my boy bluff shift and lie for the sake of your neck and the honour of old england and with these thoughts in my head and a freezing void in my bowels i was escorted to the adjudication court it was held in a great white room with brown panelling like a lecture theatre with tiers of crescentshaped benches to one end for the spectators a little rostrum and desk for the adjudicator and his two assessors at the other and in between right beneath the rostrum were three great tables at one sat clitheroe and dunne and on a bench behind were just myself and to my astonishment two of the prettiest yellow girls you ever saw all in new orleans finery with an old female in charge of them they were giggling to each other under the broad brims of their bonnets and when i sat down they looked slantendicular and giggled more than ever whispering in each others ears until the old biddy told them to leave off my escort left me and went to sit on the first of the public benches beside captain bailey who was in full fig he nodded to me and smiled confidently and i gave him back a terrified grin at the centre table were a few clerks but the far table was empty until just before the proceedings began by that time the public benches were crowded with folk nearly all men and consequential people at that talking and taking snuff and calling out to each other i felt plenty of eyes on me although most were directed at the two yellow girls who preened and simpered and played with their gloves and parasols who the blazes they might be i couldnt imagine or what they were doing here and then a door behind the far table opened in rolls anderson and to a rising buzz of chatter and comment john charity spring entered and took his seat with anderson pulling at his elbow the last time i had seen him he had been rolling on his own deck with looneys bullet in his back he looked a trifle paler now but the beard and tightbuttoned jacket were as trim as ever and when the pale eyes looked across directly into my own i saw his lips twitch and the scar on his forehead began to darken he stared at me fixedly for a full minute with his hands clenched on the table before him and then anderson whispered in his ear and he sat back looking slowly about the court he didnt look like a prisoner ill say that for him if anyone looked guilty you may have three guesses who it was then the adjudicator came in and we all stood up he was a little sharpfaced man who smiled briefly to clitheroe and anderson shot quick accusing glances at everyone else and told the nigger boy behind his chair to mind what he was about and fetch some lime juice directly everyone fell silent the two assessors sat either side of the adjudicator and the clerk called out the case for hearing of the barque balliol college reputedly owned and registered in mexico master john charity spring a british citizen the said barque taken by us brig cormorant in latitude west north or thereabouts on such and such a day and then carrying aboard her certain slaves and slaving equipment in contravention of united states law anderson was on his feet at once may the adjudicator take note that the balliol college was not and is not an american vessel and that her master is not an american citizen nevertheless says clitheroe rising may the adjudicator note that the ownership is disputed and recall the case of the ship butterfly condemned in similar circumstances further it will appear that the balliol college was carrying slaves intended for transshipment to the united states which is a clear violation of american law and that when challenged by a united states ship of war such challenge being proper and lawful the balliol college fired upon her challenger which is piracy under american law if these things are proved sir says anderson beaming as they will be manifestly proved says clitheroe proceed says the adjudicator the clerk read on that the balliol college had resisted arrest that an attempt had been made to dispose of the slaves aboard her by drowning them and that the plaintiff abraham fairbrother us navy it was news to me that the case was undertaken in his name sought the confiscation and condemnation of the balliol college as a slavetrading vessel that done clitheroe and anderson and the adjudicator went into a great wrangle about procedure which lasted most of the morning and had everyone yawning and trooping out and in and fidgetting until they had it settled it was beyond me but the result was that the business was conducted in a most informal way more like a discussion than a court but this apparently was the case with these adjudications they had evolved a strange procedure that was all their own for example when they were at last ready to begin it was anderson who got up and addressed the adjudicator not clitheroe i didnt know that it was common for the defendant to show his innocence rather than the other way about and for the life of me i couldnt see that spring had a leg to stand on but anderson went ahead quite unruffled the plaintiffs case he said such as it was rested on the hope that he might show the balliol college to be de facto americanowned or part americanowned secondly that it was carrying slaves for america in contravention of american law thirdly that in such illicit carriage it resisted arrest by an american ship of war such resistance amounting to piracy unless i mistake the plaintiffs case says he easily everything rests on the second point if the balliol college was not carrying slaves for the united states and so breaching american law it is immaterial whether she is americanowned or no further if she was not carrying slaves her arrest was illegal and such resistance as she showed cannot be held against her master or crew the plaintiff must show that she was a slavetrading ship carrying slaves illegally he beamed across the court may i hear counsel on the point clitheroe rose frowning slightly very austere that is the essence of the plaintiffs case sir says he we shall so demonstrate he picked up a paper i have here the sworn deposition of captain abraham fairbrother us navy commander of the brig cormorant who effected the capture deposition cries anderson where is the gentleman himself he is at sea sir as you well know i have already had a word to say and he looked hard at anderson on the point of delays engineered in my opinion by the defendants counsel in the knowledge that the witness would be compelled to resume his duties afloat and would therefore be unable to appear in person anderson was up like a shot protesting innocence to heaven with clitheroe sneering across at him until the adjudicator banged his desk and told them sharply to mind their manners when the hubbub and laughter on the public benches had subsided clitheroe went ahead with fairbrothers statement it was a fair truthful tale so far as i could see he had challenged the balliol college which had been flying no flag she had sheered off he had fired a warning shot which had been replied to an action had been fought and he had boarded a dozen or so slaves had been found aboard recently released from their shackles as he understood it this had been done by lieutenant comber rn who was aboard the ship ostensibly as one of the crew although in fact he was a british naval officer lieutenant comber would testify that it had been the intention of the master of the balliol college to drown these slaves and so remove all evidence there was a great humming in the court at this and many glances in my direction including a genial smile from anderson and a glare from spring the adjudicator banged his desk for quiet and clitheroe went on to describe how the balliol college crew had been arrested and the ship brought into new orleans for adjudication he sat down and anderson got up an interesting statement says he a pity that we cannot crossexamine the deponent since he isnt here however may i point out that the statement takes us no further so far as the status of the coloured people on board the balliol college is concerned negroes were found and slave shackles sir says clitheroe granted sir but the precise relation of one to the other is not determined by the statement no doubt my friend having delivered the statement which is the basis of his case will call witnesses in due course may i now enter my clients answer to the statement clitheroe nodded the adjudicator snapped proceed and at andersons request one of the clerks swore spring in to testify then anderson said tell us captain spring of your voyage in the balliol college prior to and including the events in question spring glanced at the adjudicator came to his feet and leaned his hands on the table the harsh grating voice took me back at once i could smell the balliol college again and feel the hot sun beating down on my head i sailed from brest in france with a cargo of trade goods for the dahomey coast says he there we exchanged them for a general cargo of native produce largely palm oil which i conveyed to roatan in the bay islands thence i was proceeding in ballast for havana when i was intercepted by an american brig and sloop who without justification that i could see ordered me to heave to and fired upon me i resisted and my ship was presently boarded by these navy pirates who seized my ship my person and my crew his voice was rising and the red scar burning we were carried in chains to new orleans i myself had been grievously wounded in defence of my ship and i have since been held here my ship confined and myself and my owners deprived of its use with subsequent loss to ourselves i have protested in the strongest terms at this illegal detention for which an accounting will be demanded not only of the person involved but of his government and in true spring fashion he growled qui facit per alium facit per se holds as good in american law as in any other i dare say that i was carrying slaves in contravention of this countrys enactments i emphatically deny my dear sir my dear captain this was anderson may i anticipate my friends question if this is so why did you not heave to when required and permit a search of your vessel then all might have been easily resolved spring made noises in his throat do i have to tell an american court of all places i responded to a signal to heave to from an american vessel in precisely the manner in which an american captain would have replied to a similar demand from a british naval ship in short sir i defied it there was a great shout of laughter from the public benches and feet drummed on the floor in applause the little adjudicator hammered his desk and when all was fairly quiet anderson asked as the british captain of a mexican vessel you saw no reason to heave to quite so you know captain spring it has been suggested that your vessel is not mexican owned i believe my friend may wish to pursue the matter and he invited clitheroe with a cocked eyebrow so clitheroe set about spring he threw names at him american british and french he pointed out that the balliol college was baltimorebuilt and originally yankeeowned he put it to spring that the papers now set before the adjudicator showing mexican ownership were forgeries and makeshift why he demanded if spring were an honest merchantman had his wife thrown the ships papers overboard when i am attacked by pirates sir says spring i do not permit my papers to fall into their hands how do i know that they might not be falsified and tampered with to be used against me here is a whole trumpedup business anyway to suggest that i am a slaver without a rag of proof and to badger me with nonsense about my papers he pointed to the adjudicators desk my papers are there sir certified vouched copies look at them sir litera scripta manet and get on to the point of your inquisition if it has one it seemed to me he was playing the bulldog british skipper a thought too hard for safety but the public were with him crying hear hear until the adjudicator had to call them to order clitheroe shrugged and smiled by all means captain since you desire it i pass from the matter of ownership which is secondary to the heart of the matter since you are fond of tags lets see if you remain quite so rectus in curia when i ask the adjudicator hammered his desk again ill be obliged if youll both speak english cries he most of us are familiar with the classics but not on that account will i permit this adjudication to be conducted in latin proceed clitheroe bowed captain spring you say you brought palm oil from dahomey to roatan an unusual cargo why then was your ship rigged with slave shelves slave shelves as you call them are a convenient way of stowing palm oil panniers says spring ask any merchant skipper and theyre also convenient for stowing slaves are they says spring may i point out that the shelves were not rigged when my ship was seized when you say i was running slaves i shall come to those same slaves if you please says clitheroe there were according to the affidavit we have heard negroes aboard your ship about a dozen women they were found on deck with slave shackles beside them evidence will be given that they had been chained and that you had been preparing to cast them overboard to destroy the evidence of your crime he paused and there wasnt a sound in court you are on oath captain spring who were those women spring stuck out his jaw considering then he answered and the words hit the court like a thunderclap those women says he deliberately were slaves clitheroe gaped at him there was a gasp from the public benches and then a great tumult hushed at last by the adjudicator who now turned to spring you admit you were carrying slaves ive never denied it spring was quite composed well the adjudicator looked about him permit me sir but i have been in error i thought that was what your counsel had been vigorously denying on your behalf anderson got to his feet not precisely sir may i suggest that my client be allowed to stand down for the moment while the court digests his statement and reflects upon it in the meantime perhaps my friend will continue with his case frankly sir says clitheroe it seems my case is made i move for an order of confiscation and condemnation against the balliol college proved to be a slavetrader on her own masters word not quite proved says anderson if i may invite my friend to provide the corroboration which he doubtless has at command clitheroe looked at the adjudicator and the adjudicator shrugged and clitheroe shuffled his papers and muttered to dunne for the life of me i couldnt fathom it spring appeared to have thrown away with those words his case his ship his liberty perhaps even his neck it made no sense not to the public or the adjudicator or to me the one thing i prayed for now was that my evidence wouldnt be needed clitheroe didnt like it you could see by the way he shot looks across at anderson that he smelled a rat but anderson sat smug and smiling and presently clitheroe shrugged illhumouredly and picked up his papers if the adjudicator wishes i shall continue says he but i confess i dont see the point of it the adjudicator peered at anderson thoughtfully perhaps it would be as well mr clitheroe very well clitheroe looked at his papers i shall call and examine the former slaves drusilla and messalina at this the yellow girls popped up with little squeaks of surpriseand i realised that these tarts must be two of the women we had been shipping to havana well here were the two final nails for springs coffin but he never batted an eyelid as they were brought forward fluttering nervously to the table and sworn in by the clerk the fellows on the public benches were showing great interest now nudging and muttering as the little beauties took their stand like two butterflies one pink and one yellow and clitheroe turned to the adjudicator with permission i shall examine them together and so save the courts valuable time says he as i understand it both you young ladies speak english the young ladies giggled and the pink one says yassuh we both speak english drusillan me very good now if you will answer for both messalina i believe you were in a place called roatan the bay islands you might call it a few months ago what were you doing there messalina simpered we wuz in a whohouse suh a what a whohouse a knockinshop suh she put her gloved hand up to her mouth and tittered and the public slapped their thighs and guffawed the adjudicator snapped for silence and clitheroe looking uncomfortable went on you were both employed in a whorehouse i see now then you were taken on a ship were you not they both nodded suppressing their giggles do you see here any of the men who were on that ship they looked round nervously at the adjudicator and then further afield a voice near the back of the public benches called out not me honey i was at home and a great hoot of mirth broke out and had to be quieted the adjudicator threatening to clear the room if there was unseemly behaviour then messalina timidly pointed to spring and then they both looked round at me and giggled and whispered and messalina finally said that one too with the nice whiskers he was awful kind to us ill bet he was says the voice again and the adjudicator got so angry he swore and said that was the last warning clitheroe gave me a look and said i see these two men captain spring and mr comber they and others took you on a ship where to do you know oh to havana evyone said an then we was goin on to here by nother ship to awlins right here i see did you know where you were going to in new orleans they giggled and conferred miz rivers whohouse so evyone reckon i see first to havana and then to mrs rivers er establishment in new orleans clitheroe paused there is i am told such an establishment there was some hawhawing from the public and a cry of he aint foolin but the adjudicator let it go now girls says clitheroe when you were in roatan what were you please suh we wuz whores giggled drusilla yes yes but what else were you free oh no suh we wuz slaves warnt we drusie yassuh wez slaves aright thank you and as slaves you were sent aboard the ship to be taken to havana and thence sold to mrs rivers ah whorehouse in new orleans but by the favour and mercy of god the ship was captured by the united states navy and clitheroe leaned forward impressively you were brought to new orleans and there set free is this not so oh yassuh wes set free sho nuff messalina smiled winningly at hun fine splendid you were liberated from that unspeakable servitude and you are now free women clitheroe was enjoying himself since when i dont doubt you have been happy in your newfound land of adoption and blessed free estate you are both safe in new orleans oh yassuh wes fine at miz rivers whohouse even the adjudicator didnt try to stop the peal of laughter and applause that this provoked and drusilla and messalina smiled around happily and preened themselves under all this male attention but clitheroe just sat down red in the face and anderson got up and waited for the noise to subside a very moving story says he and everyone roared again tell me drusilla and messalina i dont doubt for a moment that every word you have told us is true and i accept it as true but tell me you first messalina dear where were you born why baton rouge suh and you drusila nawlins suh indeed very interesting and how did you come to be at roatan messalina had been taken by a wealthy planter visiting cuba she had been his mistress but he had tired of her and sold her drusilla had been one of a party taken on a cruise by wealthy degenerates who had sold their doxies at various places in the caribbean so you are both americanborn i see and both born slaves yassuh the other girls on the ship with you were they also americanborn you dont knowof course not and they have not been cited as witnesses in this case and cant be called now accordingly anderson glanced knowingly across the court at clitheroe who was looking like a man who sees a ghost may i refresh the courts memory by referring to the enactment of he rattled off a string of numbers while he leafed through a large tome here we have it briefly it defines as piracy and illegal slavetrading he paused impressively the transportation for enslavement of any coloured person who is not already a slave under american law in the hush that followed anderson closed the book with a snap like a pistol shot there we have it sir captain spring as he has admitted freely and openly was carrying slaves american slaves born slaves and in so doing he was in no way contravening any united states law no more than a man breaks the law when he carries a slave across the mississippi river he was not running slaves or slavetrading in the illicit sense or clitheroe was on his feet raging this is an outrageous twisting of the truth why just because these two happen to be americanborn why they were only chosen to testify because they spoke english well half of their fellowcaptives on the balliol college i am certain were not americanborn and were therefore then its a pity you didnt bring them here today says anderson you should choose your witnesses more carefully sir this is monstrous cries clitheroe in the name of justice i demand to be allowed to call another in the name of justice youll keep us here till kingdom come cries anderson really sir are we to be detained while this distinguished counsel rakes the whole of louisiana for some witness who will suit his book he has entered his witnesses before this court let him abide by what they say if they let him down so much the worse for him and so much the better for justice there was no doubt whose side the spectators were on they cheered and stamped and drowned out everyone until the little adjudicator had to shout for silence and after several minutes when all was quiet he remarked you had ample time to consider who you should call sir ill hear the witnesses you have named i protest cries clitheroe his white hair flung back i protest but very well sir you shall hear my last witness who will prove my case for me and as my heart shot into my mouth he turned and boomed beauchamp millward comber royal navy i suppose i took the oath but i dont remember it then clitheroe was taking me through my antecedents my commissioning by the board of trade my shipping aboard the balliol college all of which i had to invent on the spur of the moment and it wasnt made any easier by the unseen voice growling goddam limey spy and so to the business he wanted to get his teeth into you can i think testify that when the balliol college reached dahomey she took aboard not palm oil as the defendant claims but a human cargo slaves is this not so but anderson bless his honest fat face was on his feet this is quite improper sir i demand that the witness be instructed to ignore the question we are not here concerned with what the british master of a mexican ship was doing many thousands of miles from our shore such a case if any there were would be for a british or mexican court or a mixed commission of the type to which the united states does not subscribe i demand nay insist that no irrelevant observations such as might prejudice my clients position be permitted we are here to determine the status of the balliol college at the time of her seizure and he went bounding on to cite a great string of precedents bright des patch rosalinda ladies delight heaven knows what it sounded a near thing to me i stood there with my palms sweating and if that adjudicator had been an honest man id have been sunk but someone had been to work ive no doubt for he shook his head and snapped i take the point of defendants counsel we are not concerned with the captains past history or his ships bawls clitheroe what about mendon uncas any number i could name sir why slavers have been condemned before ever they had taken a black on board simply on a question of intent this may i make a point sir says anderson i respectfully suggest that it would ill become an american court to deny to a british master the very rights which we insist upon for our own captains where british justice is concerned we demand that our captains be not interfered with unless they expressly break british law it cannot be argued that what captain spring was doing thousands of miles away in a mexican ship is any concern of ours humbug clitheroe was beginning but anderson added quickly the court would hardly wish to set a precedent of which foreign governments particularly the british might take note that clinched it the adjudicator glanced at me you will ignore that question sir mr clitheroe i must ask you to confine yourself to the matter in hand proceed sir i protest again most emphatically says clitheroe very well then mr comber were these negroes who were carried from roatan for havana were they chained sir most of the time not says i which was true but chains were placed upon them when the american brig challenged the balliol college yes i tried not to catch springs eye why were they chained sir to prevent their possible escape i imagine i was below decks at the time he gave me an odd look was there not another reason was it not so that a length of anchor chain could be rove through their shackles so that they could be brutally hurled into the deep and drowned he looked at his papers i quote from your own statement to the navy department up came anderson may i point out that this statement supposedly made by the witness is not in itself evidence we are concerned with what he says now not what he said then i could feel the sweat starting out on my brow how to balance the tightrope talk for your life flash thinks i so i looked perplexed and said addressing the adjudicator sir i have reflected much on this matter in the past few months that the slaves were shackled and the anchor chain passed between those shackles is true i myself released them later but in strict justice i must add that the shackling was performed by the late mr sullivan mate of the balliol college and it was followed by a most violent altercation between sullivan and captain spring clitheroes eyes narrowed and i saw bailey who was behind him sit up suddenly are you saying says clitheroe that spring was objecting to this shackling i cant say sir god i was treading warily what was the cause of their altercation i do not know i took a deep breath but i do know that mr sullivan had served aboard slave ships in the past and i dont believe he was quite right in the head sir clitheroe was staring at me in frank disbelief but this is totally out of accord with your earlier statement sir what he scrabbled over a page here we have you referring to spring as an unhuman beast a callous murderer a this is infamous roars anderson i have protested already sir he swung on clitheroe is that statement that rubbish you hold in your hand and read out to vilify my client is it signed sir it is not signed sir but then take it away sir remove it it is a scandal a disgrace i appeal to the adjudicator we will hear the witness says the adjudicator not what you say he once said mr clitheroe you must not lead the witness sir as you should know someone had greased his palm right enough clitheroe was in a quandary bailey i could tell from his face was in a fury clitheroe turned back to me and his face was ugly very well says he i now put the matter to you in different terms can you say from your own knowledge that there were slaves being carried on board the balliol college in contravention of american law that is to say nonamerican slaves and that an attempt was made to dispose of them by casting them overside whoever gave the order i was ready enough for that two hours ago sir i would have been able positively to answer your question as to the slaves however you must see in the light of what we have heard from the last two witnesses that i cannot in conscience answer positively now the distinction about americanborn slaves is new to me sir i cannot say whether the others were also american or not he gave a snort of impatience was there not on the balliol college an african woman brought from africa sir and carried to baltimore with the others by captain fairbrother a woman named he looked at his paper lady caroline lamb who spoke no english and had been carried from dahomey as a slave who could not possibly have been american whatever the others were i remember the woman perfectly says i as to her status i confess i am reluctant now to be too definite since she was certainly not among those shackled by mr sullivan reluctant clitheroe threw down his papers in disgust behind him i could see bailey muttering with rage reluctant on my word mr comber i find this most extraordinary are you here sir to testify against that man and he flung out a hand at spring or are you not damme sir i beg the adjudicators pardon what does this mean your whole tone your attitude the burden of your evidence is so far from what you led us to believe it would be that i could almost wonder his glance flickered to anderson but he thought better of it before he could go on i plucked up my courage and got in first i have answered your questions to the best of my ability sir says i if i am scrupulous i must say i find it hard that i should be blamed for that he looked as though he would burst scrupulous by all thats holy i dont ask you to be scrupulous i ask for the truth what did you sail aboard this damned slaver for if not to bring him to justice eh answer me that sir when in difficulty bluster it was the only weapon i had left and i seized it now that his loss of composure had given me the chance i sailed in the performance of my duty to my chiefs sir as you well know that duty i have done or will do as soon as i am permitted if you look in my statement sir you will see that i was reluctant from the first to appear in this case and that i appeared only because your navy department assured me it was necessary i had assumed wrongly i fear and i took my whole courage in my hands and tried to sound furious that such a simple case would be easily concluded without my intervention being called for he went white and then red and his breath came out in a great shudder he looked at me with pure hate and when he spoke it was with great care indeed sir very highminded and highhanded are we not very well mr comber let us examine this if you please your duty sir you have told us is to your chiefs you are an agent against the slave tradealthough one would hardly suspect it from your conduct today as such i understand you obtained possession during this voyage of papers belonging to the master of the balliol college out of the tail of my eye i saw spring stiffen in his seat will you tell us sir whether or not there was evidence in those papers as to the ownership of the vessel for exampleto prove that she was engaged illegally in the slave trade in contravention of american law you are on oath sir remember that my heart lurched because i had seen the way out i held my breath a moment to make my face red and let it out slowly i drew myself up and glared at him with all the venom i could muster this sir says i is intolerable it is precisely why i did not wish to appear you are well aware sir that there are facts which i am in duty bound not to disclosefacts of the highest import it is all explained in that statement sir which i cannot in honour convey to anyone except to my chiefs at home i was promised immunity from this brazening it for all i was worth i rounded on bailey captain bailey i appeal to you this is entirely unworthy i am badgered sir on the very grounds which it was promised to me would be inviolate i will not endure it sir the counsels questions must lead inevitably to the point which i was assured would not be touched i i theres nothing like a good stammer for conviction i was a fool to be coerced into this i should have known incompetence harm done there was tumult in the court even bailey was looking bewildered now the adjudicator was at a loss anderson clever man had the good sense to look amazed spring was looking worried clitheroe stuck between rage and astonishment looked to bailey and then to me on my word this was the adjudicator darting his nose at me what is this sir this outburst is quite sir says i i most humbly beg your pardon i intended no disrepect to you or to this august court i hesitated i found myself placed in an intolerable position sir if an explanation is necessary i beg that you will ask counsel for the plaintiff there was a moments silence in which the adjudicator looked at clitheroe and clitheroe stood with his face white and his mouth set then he shook his head i see no advantage to the court in examining this witness further says he and he sat down anderson jumped up and began to address the adjudicator but i was too bemused by my own eloquence to listen the next thing i knew there was an adjournment and i was hustled off to baileys office with clitheroe and dunne and the first two rounded on me like bears but i snatched the ball from their hands and laced into them for all i was worth it was my only chance i knew to play the mystery as i had done in the washington navy department and play it as furiously as i could if you so mishandle your case sir that you cant get a condemnation order that a child could obtain is that my fault the wrong slaves called as witnesses this fellow anderson permitted to shut me up on the very point where i could have given conclusive testimony and then the impudence to break the solemn assurance i was given in washington by questioning me in a way which if id been fool enough to answer must have elicited the names i am duty bound to conceal and you dare to raise your voice to me sir do you think ill see my work ruined two years of it well why not lay it on hard simply because some fool of a lawyer cant win a case which in itself is nothing nothing sir i tell you compared with what i and my people are trying to do oh this is too much how i managed to lose my temper so badly for so long when my innards were quaking i am far from sure they didnt take it lying down either especially bailey who was halfconvinced my indignation was sham but he couldnt be sure you see there was just enough mystery as a result of all the bloody lies id told in washington to make him wonder your conduct sir gives me the gravest suspicions says he i dont know this is a deplorable affair but well go into this sir believe you me well get to the bottom then youll do it in your own good time sir says i looking him in the eye not in mine im sick and tired of this whole sorry business i was promised protection sir protection cries he looking ugly you have forfeited all claim to that my departments protection is withdrawn you may take that as read thank god i exclaimed for all the good its been to me im better without it i intend to place myself at once under the protection of my ambassador in washington at once do you hear and whoever tries to hinder me will do so at his peril for a moment he looked as though he was believing me and then we were summoned back to the court and i sat redfaced squeezing myself to keep it up while clitheroe and anderson bandied away at each other and finally anderson challenged him on some point or other and clitheroe made a speech and concluded it by moving for the confiscation and condemnation of the balliol college there was much palaver over the matter of springs resisting arrest and anderson stuck to the point about an innocent merchantman being entitled to protect himself etc and finally the adjudicator took off his spectacles and asked did their cases rest they nodded and he put his spectacles back on and everyone stood up the adjudicator talked for about half an hour while our legs creaked and i couldnt for the life of me stop my hands trembling for there was no telling which way he was going he reviewed the evidence springs and the girls and my own and then came to his peroration it was short and decisive it rests with the plaintiff abraham fairbrother to show that the balliol college was carrying slaves in contravention of united states law there are grounds for believing that she was in view of her equipment and other circumstances related in evidence it may also appear that grounds could exist for charges to be brought in connection with damage done to united states property by captain spring on the other hand it may be that after the conclusion of this court the owners of the balliol college may hold that an action lies against the united states government for unlawful detention these are matters outside the scope of this adjudication the activities of the balliol college prior to her arrest may also be matters for a mixed commission court of the british or other governments it is precisely for the attention of such court if it be called that i have mentioned the conclusion of this adjudication that grounds exist for believing that the balliol college was carrying slaves in contravention of united states law but i cannot hold that the grounds have been proved conclusively to the satisfaction of this adjudication the motion for confiscation fails i pulled myself together and shot clitheroe as baleful a look as i could manage for baileys benefit the adjudicator turned to spring you are free to go as i understand it your vessel is in the river is it not under a prize crew hear our order that this prize crew be withdrawn forthwith and that such stores water and wood as may be required in reason for your departure shall be left aboard and in accordance with custom clearance be granted for your departure this very day or such date thereafter as you find fitting thank you sir says spring i thank the court i shall leave anchorage today the adjudicator banged his desk and scuttled out and at once there was a great rush from the public benches to springs table and he was being clapped on the back and fellows were shaking andersons hand and hurrahing clitheroe walked out of the court without a word and bailey after a lowering look at me followed him the two yellow girls giggling and ogling tripped away with their chaperone or bawd or whatever she was and suddenly i was standing alone but i doubted somehow if this happy state would endure for long my escort had gone with bailey but in spite of our violent exchanges they would be expecting me at his office or at least back at the navy place where he had housed me and then for all my fine talk they would keep a tight grip on me for what interrogation no doubt and at best a convoy to washington and my embassy and god knew what would come of that my buttock ached at the thought of sliding out again but i knew i darent stay for one thing the longer i was in this blasted country the greater the chance of my activities on the mississippi being brought home to roost i looked about me the spectators were all streaming out now by the entrances at the back of the room half a dozen steps and i was among them once outside i could easily find my way to susies brothel and this time surely she would be able to see me safe away at least she could hide me until i grew a beard or and then it struck me all in a moment the dazzling thought it was fearful at first but as i considered it on the steps leading down to the street it seemed the only safe way it was the answer surely and i found my legs taking me off to one side behind a pillar where i thought some more and then i stepped out into the busy street and walked across to the far side and took refuge beneath a tree waiting it was ten minutes before i saw what i wanted and my heart was in my mouth in case bailey or my escort would come on the scene but they didnt and then i was rewarded and i set off walking quickly along the street and into another and there i overtook the figure ahead of me captain spring says i captain spring its me he swung round as if stung as near startled as id ever seen him the devil he exclaimed you captain says i in gods name will you give me a passage out of here youre leaving on the college arent you for pitys sake take me with you out of this blasted what cries he his scar beginning to jump like st vitus dance take you why the devil should i you listen please captain says i look i played up today didnt i i could have sworn you to kingdom come couldnt i but i didnt i didnt i got you off you got me off he tilted back his hat and glared at me you saved your own dirty little neck you judas you and youve the nerve to come crawling to me ill buy my passage i pleaded look im not just begging i can buy it with something you want and what would that be but he stepped aside with me into a doorway the pale eyes fixed on me you heard in court i got combers papers the things hed filched from you well i forced myself not to notice the darkening scar on his brow ive still got em are they price enough his face was like flint where are they he growled in a safe place a very safe place not on me i lied praying hed believe it but i know where they are and unless i say the word well they could get into the wrong hands couldnt they youd be clear and away before that of course but your owners wouldnt like it morrison for one where are they he demanded and his hands came up as though to seize me but i shook my head ill tell you says i in liverpool or bristol not before theyll be safe until then on my word your word he sneered we know what thats worth you perjured rascal look at you he laughed softly post ecjuitem sedet atra cura your friends in the american navy are looking for you i dont doubt if they find me they find those papers says i but if you take me with you i swear youll have em and welcome i thought privately even when id handed them over the knowledge of what was in em would still be in my head and id use it to squeeze old morrison dry youll have them captain i repeated i promise by god i will says spring ill see to that he stood considering me what a worthless creature you are what shreds of loyalty have you you object plenty to myself says i just as you have captain spring his scar went pink then he laughed again well well youve picked up some yankee sauce over here i believe perhaps youre right though horace reminds me why should i sneer at you mutato nomine de te fabula narratur he looked up and down the street ill take you but you tell me those papers are safe do you for if theyre not by god ill drop you overside with a bag of coal on your feet if were within ten feet of the mersey or brest which is where im going well you have my word says i no says he but ive got your carcase and ill settle for that now then are these damned yankees close behind you then step lively mr flashman strange i thought how long it was since anyone had called me by my proper name for the first time in months i felt i was almost home again with elspeth and the youngster too aye and my dear papainlaw i was looking forward to presenting my account to him notes the great chartist demonstration of monday april was as flashman says a frost following the numerous continental revolutions there were those who feared that civil strife would break out in britain and in addition to extra troops brought to the capital the authorities enlisted special constables between april and io to deal with disturbances peel gladstone prince louis napoleon about half the house of lords and an immense number of middleclass volunteers were among the specials in the event only about twenty to thirty thousand chartists demonstrated instead of the half million expected and there was little violence apart from the fight between the butchers boy and the french agitator which happened as flashman describes it of the two million signatures to the great petition about onefifth are said to have been bogus punch noted caustically that if they had all been genuine the chartist procession should have been headed by the queen and seventeen dukes of wellington from this and other allusions it is obvious that flashman spent at least part of the period in madagascar and borneo he is known to have been both military adviser to queen ranavalona and chief of staff to rajah brooke of sarawak it now seems probable that he held these appointments between and other evidence suggests that he may also have taken part in the first sikh war of lord john russell was then prime minister lansdowne was lord president of the council berlins articles particularly gloves knitted of berlin wool attendance money a charge introduced on the railway about this time which amounted to a kind of cover or service charge it appears to have been levied for as small a service as asking a railway servant the time of day flashmans memory may be playing him false when he speaks of a railway bookstall it was more probably a railway library frances isabella locke was to become famous in later years as mrs fanny duberly victorian heroine campaigner and army wife extraordinary she left celebrated journals of her service in the crimea and the indian mutiny lord george bentinck one of the foremost sporting figures of his day and leader of the protectionist tory opposition in the commons handsome arrogant and viciously aggressive in political argument bentinck was widely respected as a guardian of the purity of the turf although after his death his former friend greville alleged that he was guilty of fraud falsehood and selfishness and a mass of roguery in his racing conduct bentinck resigned his leadership of the opposition early in but was still the power in his party at the time of his meeting with flashman at cleeve he died suddenly only a few months later on september disraeli who then succeeded him as tory leader in the commons was not to become prime minister for another twenty years flashmans view of him in fairly reflects the feeling of many tories they detest disraeli the only man of talent wrote greville in that year his extravagances of dress and speech his success as a novelist and his jewish antecedents combined to render him unpopular flashman like greville insists on spelling him disraeli although disraell himself had dropped the apostrophe ten years earlier the nickname codlingsby is a pun on coningsby perhaps his best novel published in surplice had just beaten shylock in the derby and on the following day the jewish disabilities bill failed in the house of lords with revolution everywhere on the continent in it was confidently expected that ireland would erupt and there was a small abortive rising in the summer john mitchel a leading agitator was sentenced in may to fourteen years transportation jane eyre by charlotte bronte was published in the autumn of varney the vampire or the feast of blood by malcolm rymer was an outstanding horror story even in a decade which was unusually rich in novels of ghouls vampires and gothic spinechilling miss fannys excuse was not very flattering to her fiancй whose position with the eighth hussars was that of paymaster the black joke schooner had a career befitting its romantic name being in turn a slaver a royal navy tender and an opium smuggler in the china seas under the anglo dutch treaty of a ship fitted out for slaving could be condemned as a slaver even if she was not carrying slaves what flashman says of the background to the slave trade in the s is accurate enough but obviously he does not give more than a hint of the complicated system of treaties and antislavery laws by which the civilised nations fought the traffic virtually all were prepared to pay at least lip service to the antislave trade cause but only britain mounted a continuous major campaign against the slaving vessels on the high seas and along the african coast although at the time of flashmans voyage the united states navy was also lending its assistance but there was no consistency about the various national laws against the trade and the slavers were quick to take advantage of the numerous loopholes what is sometimes not appreciated is the distinction that was drawn by governments between slavery and actual slave trading for example britain prohibited the trade as early as but did not abolish slavery within the empire until the united states prohibited the trade in but continued to practise slavery in her slave states until the civil war in this topsy turvy situation with huge private interests involved in the traffic slave trading flourished into the second half of the century pedro blanco was a leading slavebroker who specialised in collecting africans for sale to slaving ships his usual scene of operations was farther north on the sierra leone coast flashmans description of whydah and the kroos corresponds very closely with contemporary accounts with epidemics an everpresent danger on the middle passage slaver captains took every precaution against shipping diseased or weakly slaves however they had no scruples about marketing those who fell ill on the voyage and were at pains to disguise their disabilities spring is here referring to a particularly revolting means of hiding the symptoms of dysentery spring was giving considerably less space to his slaves than that allowed by the wilberforce committee in when the famous plan of the slaving ship broohes gave the following figures males six feet by sixteen inches females five feet by sixteen inches boys five feet by fourteen inches girls four feet six by twelve inches this as f george kay points out in the shameful trade meant that five men were packed into a space equivalent to two modern single beds and lay there for perhaps twenty hours a day over a period of several weeks parliament was prepared to accept a death rate of two per cent the genius of universal emancipation a newspaper published from to by benjamin lundy an early american abolitionist william lloyd garrison perhaps the greatest of antislavery journalists worked with lundy before founding his own paper the liberator in which ran until the end of the civil war arthur and lewis tappan were dedicated new york abolitionists the revolvers by flashmans description were probably early colt patersons of although it is not impossible that they were colt walkers of the type produced for the mexican war the needle guns must be the prussian dreyse singleshot breechloaders of which were the first boltaction military weapons the dahomeyans believed that human sacrifices were messengers to the gods and despatched about each year about a tenth of whom were killed at the annual custom as the great ritual slaughter festival was called the grand custom held only when a king died involved much greater bloodshed king gezo a liberal ruler by dahomeyan standards made ј a year from the slave trade according to royal navy intelligence estimates and also reorganised the army of amazons which had previously been composed of female criminals unfaithful wives etc gezo by recruiting from all the unmarried girls of his kingdom raised a force of about fighting women and there is ample evidence of their ferocity and discipline flashmans description of them is accurate gezo ruled dahomey for years dying of smallpox in quite apart from harriet beecher stowes famous villain there was a southern slave trader called legree in springs time methods of slavepacking varied according to a ships accommodation but flashmans account gives a vivid impression of what a hideous business it was his details of branding sizing and dancing are accurate even so it appears that spring despite his insistence on close packing was a more humane skipper than most on the middle passage conditions on the balliol college compare favourably with those on other slave ships of which contemporary records exist and which tell appalling tales of human cargoes thrown overboard epidemics mutinies and unspeakable cruelties even the sailors stories which flashman retells give only a pale impression of the reality figures compiled by warren s howard in his american slavers and the federal law indicate that on average onesixth of slaves shipped died on the middle passage the balliol colleges low mortality rate was not unique however in only three slaves died out of aboard the barque fame running to brazil captain robert waterman of the sea witch one of the great yankee tea clippers his passages from china to new york broke all records in the mids blackwall fashion competent but leisurely seafaring as opposed to the tough life aboard the packets one of the slavers common ruses was to fly whatever colours seemed safest according to their position at sea in fact american colours were most common on the middle passage although spain had banned the slave trade cuba continued to operate a large unofficial slave market and cargoes were smuggled in as circumstances permitted possibly these did not appear favourable to spring and he determined to run to roatan a popular clearing house on january james w marshall found gold at coloma california news of his discovery led to the great rushes of and prices varied enormously from year to year but the figures quoted generally by flashman are above average possibly was a good year from the sellers point of view slaves certainly were thrown overboard on the approach of patrol vessels abraham lincoln was at this time and the physical description tallies closely with his first known photograph taken in when he met flashman he was in the middle of his only term as a us congressman although he already had a successful career in local politics and as a lawyer behind him as a congressman he was not especially distinguished and his bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia was never brought in cassius clay a fighting kentuckian and fervent abolitionist who later became president lincolns minister to russia the underground railroad was a truly heroic organisation which ran more than slaves to freedom founded in the early s by a clergyman its agents included the famous john brown of the popular song and the extraordinary little negress harriet tubman herself a runaway she guided no fewer than nineteen convoys of escaped negroes out of the slave states including infants who had to be drugged to escape detection and is reputed never to have lost any of her many hundred passengers the true identity of mr crixus can only be guessed at obviously he had adopted the name from the gaulish slave who was a chief lieutenant to spartacus in the roman gladiators rebellion of bc the sultanas record for the trip was five days and twelve hours exactly set in although often exaggerated the performance of the mississippi steamboats was extraordinary and reached a peak with the run of captain cannon in the good ship robert e lee in when the miles from new orleans to st louis was covered in three days eighteen hours fourteen minutes normally a big sidewheeler could easily maintain an average of over mph upstream mr bixhy was later head pilot of the union forces in the civil war his other claim to fame is that he taught the craft of steamboat piloting to mark twain mustee a shortened form of musteefino or musterfino loosely a halfcaste but particularly one who was very pale skinned strictly speaking the child of one black and one white parent is a mulatto the child of a mulatto and a white is a quadroon the child of a quadroon and a white is a mustee it is a curious feature of colour prejudice that any admixture of coloured blood however small is deemed sufficient to make the owner a negro thanks to flashmans vagueness about dates it is impossible to say in exactly which week he and cassy were contemplating their journey up the ohio it must surely have been early spring in in which case flashman must have spent longer on the mandeville plantation than his narrative suggests he was there for cottonpicking which normally takes place in september and october but can extend into early december there can be little doubt that harriet beecher stowe who was living in cincinnati at the time must have heard of cassy and flashman crossing the ohio ice pursued by slavecatchers and decided to incorporate the incident in her bestselling uncle toms cabin which was published two years later she of course attributed the feat to the slave girl eliza it can be no more than an interesting coincidence that the burden eliza carried in her flight was a real handsome boy named harry but it seems quite likely that mrs stowe met the real cassy and used her name and all in that part of the book which describes life on simon legrees plantation incidentally mrs stowe timed elizas fictitious crossing for late february this provides a further due to the time of flashmans crossing in similar weather conditions a whosyar an indianan supposedly deriving from the rustic dialect for whos there although this is much disputed in fact although lincoln spent most of his youth in indiana he himself was a kentuckian by birth but not for much longer lincolns term in congress ended on march which can only have been a few days after his meeting with flashman in portsmouth it is curious that their conversation contains no mention of his impending retirement the butterfly a newlybuilt slave ship was captured before she had even reached africa let alone taken on slaves after a fierce legal battle she was condemned from flashmans account of the adjudication it is obvious that he has greatly simplified the procedure of the court no doubt after half a century only the highlights remained in his mind procedure in slaveship cases varied greatly from country to country and did not remain consistent and many such cases were never even printed so bearing in mind that what he is describing was a form of preliminary hearing and not a slaveship trial proper one can only take his word for what happened in the balliol college adjudication as to flashmans allegations ot corruption and pressure exerted in slaveship cases one cannot do better than quote the words of a contemporary skipper captain c e driscoll who boasted flatly i can get any man off in new york for a thousand dollars the owners of a ship arrested as a slaver but subsequently acquitted might well be in a strong position to claim damages from the arresting party for this reason there was some reluctance in the late s especially among american navy officers to capture suspected slaveships for fear of being sued
