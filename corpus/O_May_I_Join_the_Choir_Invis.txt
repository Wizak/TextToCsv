o may i join the choir invisible o may i join the choir invisible of those immortal dead who live again in minds made better by their presence live in pulses stirred to generosity in deeds of daring rectitude in scorn of miserable aims that end with self in thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars and with their mild persistence urge mens minds to vaster issues so to live is heaven to make undying music in the world breathing a beauteous order that controls with growing sway the growing life of man so we inherit that sweet purity for which we struggled failed and agonized with widening retrospect that bred despair rebellious flesh that would not be subdued a vicious parent shaming still its child poor anxious penitence is quick dissolved its discords quenched by meeting harmonies die in the large and charitable air and all our rarer better truer self that sobbed religiously in yearning song that watched to ease the burden of the world laboriously tracing what must be and what may yet be better saw rather a worthier image for the sanctuary and shaped it forth before the multitude divinely human raising worship so to higher reverence more mixed with love that better self shall live till human time shall fold its eyelids and the human sky be gathered like a scroll within the tomb unread forever this is life to come which martyred men have made more glorious for us who strive to follow may i reach that purest heaven be to other souls the cup of strength in some great agony enkindle generous ardor feed pure love beget the smiles that have no cruelty be the sweet presence of a good diffused and in diffusion ever more intense so shall i join the choir invisible whose music is the gladness of the world how they brought the good news from ghent to aix at aerschot up leaped of a sudden the sun pjpg i sprang to the stirrup and joris and he i galloped dirck galloped we galloped all three good speed cried the watch as the gatebolts undrew speed echoed the wall to us galloping through behind shut the postern the lights sank to rest and into the midnight we galloped abreast not a word to each other we kept the great pace neck by neck stride by stride never changing our place i turned in my saddle and made its girths tight then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right rebuckled the checkstrap chained slacker the bit nor galloped less steadily roland a whit twas moonset at starting but while we drew near lokeren the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear at boom a great yellow star came out to see at duffeld twas morning as plain as could be and from mecheln churchsteeple we heard the halfchime so joris broke silence with yet there is time at aerschot up leaped of a sudden the sun and against him the cattle stood black every one to stare through the mist at us galloping past and i saw my stout galloper roland at last with resolute shoulders each butting away the haze as some bluff river headland its spray and his low head and crest just one sharp ear bent back for my voice and the other pricked out on his track and one eyes black intelligence ever that glance oer its white edge at me his own master askance and the thick heavy spumeflakes which aye and anon his fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on by hasselt dirck groaned and cried joris stay spur your roos galloped bravely the faults not in her well remember at aix for one heard the quick wheeze of her chest saw the stretched neck and staggering knees and sunk tail and horrible heave of the flank as down on her haunches she shuddered and sank so we were left galloping joris and i past looz and past tongres no cloud in the sky the broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff till over by delhem a dome spire sprung white and gallop gasped joris for aix is in sight how theyll greet us and all in a moment his roan rolled neck and croup over lay dead as a stone and there was my roland to bear the whole weight of the news which alone could save aix from her fate with his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim and with circles of red for his eyesockets rim then i cast loose my buffcoat each holster let fall shook off both my jackboots let go belt and all stood up in the stirrup leaned patted his ear called my roland his pet name my horse without peer clapped my hands laughed and sung any noise bad or good till at length into aix roland galloped and stood and all i remember is friends flocking around as i sate with his head twixt my knees on the ground and no voice but was praising this roland of mine as i poured down his throat our last measure of wine which the burgesses voted by common consent was no more than his due who brought good news from ghent mother and poet dead one of them shot by the sea in the east and one of them shot in the west by the sea dead both my boys when you sit at the feast and are wanting a great song for italy free let none look at me yet i was a poetess only last year and good at my art for a woman men said but this woman this who is agonized here the east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head forever instead what art can woman be good at oh vain what art is she good at but hurting her breast with the milkteeth of babes and a smile at the pain ah boys how you hurt you were strong as you pressed and i proud by that test whats art for a woman to hold on her knees both darlings to feel all their arms round her throat cling strangle a little to sew by degrees and broider the long clothes and neat little coat to dream and to dote to teach them it stings there i made them indeed speak plain the word country i taught them no doubt that a countrys a thing men should die for at need i prated of liberty rights and about the tyrant turned out and when their eyes flashed oh my beautiful eyes i exulted nay let them go forth at the wheels of the guns and denied not but then the surprise when one sits quite alone then one weeps then one kneels god how the house feels at first happy news came in gay letters moiled with my kisses of camplife and glory and how they both loved me and soon coming home to be spoiled in return would fan off every fly from my brow with their green laurel bough then was triumph at turin ancona was free and some one came out of the cheers in the street with a face pale as stone to say something to me my guido was dead i fell down at his feet while they cheered in the street i bore it friends soothed me my grief looked sublime as the ransom of italy one boy remained to be leant on and walked with recalling the time when the first grew immortal while both of us strained to the height he had gained and letters still came shorter sadder more strong writ now but in one hand i was not to faint one loved me for two would be with me ere long and viva italia he died for our saint who forbids our complaint dead one of them shot by the sea in the east and one of them shot in the west by the sea pjpg my nanni would add he was safe and aware of a presence that turned off the balls was imprest it was guido himself who knew what i could bear and how twas impossible quite dispossessed to live on for the rest on which without pause up the telegraph line swept smoothly the next news from gaeta shot tell his mother ah ah his their mother not mine no voice says my mother again to me what you think guido forgot are souls straight so happy that dizzy with heaven they drop earths affection conceive not of woe i think not themselves were too lately forgiven through that love and sorrow which reconciled so the above and below o christ of the seven wounds who lookdst through the dark to the face of thy mother consider i pray how we common mothers stand desolate mark whose sons not being christs die with eyes turned away and no last word to say both boys dead but thats out of nature we all have been patriots yet each house must always keep one twere imbecile hewing out roads to a wall and when italys made for what end is it done if we have not a son ah ah ah when gaetas taken what then when the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport of the fireballs of death crashing souls out of men when your guns of cavalli with final retort have cut the game short when venice and rome keep their new jubilee when your flag takes all heaven for its white green and red when you have your country from mountain to sea when king victor has italys crown on his head and i have my dead what then do not mock me ah ring your bells low and burn your lights faintly my country is there above the star pricked by the last peak of snow my italys there with my brave civic pair to disfranchise despair forgive me some women bear children in strength and bite back the cry of their pain in selfscorn but the birthpangs of nations will wring us at length into wail such as this and we sit on forlorn when the manchild is born dead one of them shot by the sea in the west and one of them shot in the east by the sea both both my boys if in keeping the feast you want a great song for your italy free let none look at me natures lady three years she grew in sun and shower then nature said a lovelier flower on earth was never sown this child i to myself will take she shall be mine and i will make a lady of my own myself will to my darling be both law and impulse and with me the girl in rock and plain in earth and heaven in glade and bower shall feel an overseeing power to kindle or restrain she shall be sportive as the fawn that wild with glee across the lawn or up the mountain springs and hers shall be the breathing balm and hers the silence and the calm of mute insensate things she shall be sportive as the fawn pjpg the floating clouds their state shall lend to her for her the willows bend nor shall she fail to see even in the motions of the storm grace that shall mould the maidens form by silent sympathy the stars of midnight shall be dear to her and she shall lean her ear in many a secret place where rivulets dance their wayward round and beauty born of murmuring sound shall pass into her face to a skylark hail to thee blithe spirit bird thou never wert that from heaven or near it pourest thy full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditated art higher still and higher from the earth thou springest like a cloud of fire the blue deep thou wingest and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest in the golden lightning of the sunken sun oer which clouds art brightning thou dost float and run like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun the pale purple even melts around thy flight like a star of heaven in the broad daylight thou art unseen but yet i hear thy shrill delight keen as are the arrows of that silver sphere whose intense lamp narrows in the white dawn clear until we hardly see we feel that it is there all the earth and air with thy voice is loud as when night is bare from one lonely cloud the moon rains out her beams and heaven is overflowed what thou art we know not what is most like thee from rainbowclouds there flow not drops so bright to see as from thy presence showers a rain of melody like a poet hidden in the light of thought singing hymns unbidden till the world is wrought to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not like a highborn maiden in a palace tower soothing her loveladen soul in secret hour with music sweet as love which overflows her bower like a glowworm golden in a dell of dew scattering unbeholden its aerial hue among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view like a rose embowered in its own green leaves by warm winds deflowered till the scent it gives makes faint with too much heat these heavywinged thieves thou art unseen but yet i hear they shrill delight pjpg sound of vernal showers on the twinkling grass rainawakened flowers all that ever was joyous and clear and fresh thy music doth surpass teach us sprite or bird what sweet thoughts are thine i have never heard praise of love or wine that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine chorus hymeneal or triumphal chaunt matched with thine would be all but an empty vaunt a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want what objects are the fountains of the happy strain what fields or waves or mountains what shapes of sky or plain what love of thine own kind what ignorance of pain with thy clear keen joyance languor cannot be shadow of annoyance never came near thee thou lovest but neer knew loves sad satiety waking or asleep thou of death must deem things more true and deep than we mortals dream or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream we look before and after and pine for what is not our sincerest laughter with some pain is fraught our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought yet if we could scorn hate and pride and fear if we were things born not to shed a tear i know not how thy joy we ever should come near better than all measures of delightful sound better than all treasures that in books are found thy skill to poet were thou scorner of the ground teach me half the gladness that thy brain must know such harmonious madness from my lips would flow the world should listen then as i am listening now
