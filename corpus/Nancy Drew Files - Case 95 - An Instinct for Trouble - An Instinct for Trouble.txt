 an instinct for trouble by carolyn keene chapter one nancy bess marvin exclaimed listen thats randy deans new song lonely wil derness she leaned forward and turned up the volume on the car radio then rolled down her window and the trees sway against the blue blue sky but theres danger lurking nearby yes danger nearby its like it was meant for us bess said when the song ended i mean here we are with the trees swaying against the blue sky nancy drew brushed a lock of shoulder length reddish blond hair off her face lets hope theres no danger lurking nearby these mountains and forest are gorgeous bess said and yellowstone is supposed to be even betterone of the most beautiful places on earth it was a cool crisp wednesday in early may that morning nancy and bess had flown from their hometown of river heights to jack son wyoming where they had rented a car for the drive north to yellowstone national park george would love this nancy com mented as they passed a grove of aspen trees too bad she couldnt come george fayne besss cousin had been forced to pass up the trip because of a longplanned visit to friends in boston bet you cant wait to see ned bess said nancy smiled broadly her boyfriend was one of a small group of emerson college students who had been camping in yellow stone for three weeks studying the habits of the yellowbellied marmot a small furry mammal common in the park i do miss him i just wish it hadnt taken an emergency to get us together who was it who got hurt again bess asked a graduate student named brad keeler nancy replied he was badly burned when a propane stove exploded the night before last and ned doesnt think it was an accident because all those marmot traps were sto len right bess said right over the last couple of weeks about four dozen traps have disappeared it hap pened gradually and no one realized they were missing because they were stored in several different places nancy explained but brad finally noticed and was starting to look into it before that stove blew up in his face how awful bess exclaimed what was the study group doing with the traps any way they used them to catch the marmots last fall so they could attach transmitters to the animals nancy said thats how the emer son people keep track of the marmots move ments neat bess said but why would anyone want the traps ned thinks someone is planning to trap marmots with them and smuggle them out of the park which is totally illegal nancy an swered but he doesnt have any proof so he called you since you happen to be not only the love of his life but also an incredible detective thanks for the compliment but im really worried about this case this phase of the emerson study ends on saturday ned says that if any marmots vanish between now and then the study could be blamed the third phase of the project scheduled for this summer would be canceled and all the colleges work would go down the drain nancy sighed neds really upset you dont think that someone from the emerson group could be involved do you id hate to think it but weve got to check nancy said solemnly as they passed a sign that said south entrance yellowstone national park tall slender lodgepole pines lined the road on either side their tangy scent filling the car the trees were so thick in some places that it was like driving through a tunnel i cant wait to see the yellowbellied mar mots bess said nancy grinned ned said they look like chubby overgrown chipmunks only with yel low undersides which is how they got their name but most people call them whistling marmots because they communicate by mak ing highpitched sounds they sound cute bess began but stopped abruptly a herd of brown elk appeared from among the trees on the right nancy stepped on the brake paying no attention to the car the elk began prancing gracefully across the road oh nancy look at the babies bess cried nancy chuckled as a handful of little elk wobbled awkwardly in front of the herd the herd stopped in a meadow on the left side of the highway near the center of the sparse grass where the creatures were grazing nancy noticed a cone of gray rock about a foot high from its center wisps of white steam curled into the air its a geyser nancy exclaimed besss jaw dropped the whole park is covered with them nancy said as she started driving again which is why yellowstone is so special i read the guidebook too bess said teas ingly the geysers are remnants of volcanoes that erupted around here millions of years ago but i still cant believe it just wait until you see old faithful it erupts about every hour and a half and it will be right outside our window at the hotel nancy said thats why i wanted to stay there bess replied nancy shook her head and laughed at her friend you just didnt want to camp out even though it would be better if we were closer to the study group oh nan i cant she moaned i hate bugs but even worse i hate sleeping on the cold bumpy ground okay okay nancy said you convinced me but you may be passing up the chance to get close to a cute emerson guy she warned her friend nancy stepped on the brake at an intersec tion a sign pointed right to the grand loop road and left to the inn and visitors center before she could turn a tour bus passed in front other she followed it in the direction of the inn it seems a bit early in the season for tour buses nancy said its probably better to get here before the main tourist season starts bess replied is ned meeting us at the hotel he said hed try to but the emerson group is incredibly busy right now gearing up for the end of this phase of the study nancy ex plained if hes not there when we arrive well head over to the campsite after we check in the road grew steeper and nancy kept a safe distance between her white rental car and the bus in front on the far side of the pass the highway ran beside a gushing river that must be the hotel bess said point ing to the left have you ever seen anything like it in your life nancy leaned forward and saw a building that was at least seven stories high with a slanted roof and rows of little dormer win dows its walls were made of huge roughcut logs stacked one on top of the other it looks like a giant birdhouse nancy said delightedly as she turned onto the road that led to the inn and followed it to the front of the building then remembering that ned might be waiting for her inside she hastily stopped the car turned off the ignition and jumped out go on ahead nancy bess urged with a knowing smile ill find someone to help me with the bags then ill park the car in the lot over there she said pointing gratefully nancy tossed bess the car keys mounted the wooden stairs and entered the lobby the center of the building was an atrium that rose all the way to the roof along two sides were level after level of balconies a huge fireplace of gigantic lava stones dominated the big space half a dozen guests sat near the fire in oldfashioned rocking chairs another row of rockers faced tall windows overlooking sev eral geysers a few people were seated there enjoying the view but no ned nancy choked back her disappointment just then she saw bess enter the lobby followed by a bellhop pulling a trolley with besss two suitcases and nancys small carry on bag wheres ned she asked when nancy reached her side nancy shook her head at the campsite i guess id like to drive over and take a look okay go ahead bess said handing the car keys back to her friend ill check us in and start unpacking nancy walked to the parking lot briskly the sun shone brightly but the air was chilly she spotted the car dashed over and got in after glancing at the map ned had faxed her she started the engine and headed north for about fifteen miles at madison junction where there was a ranger station general store and campground she turned right she watched carefully until she spotted a dirt road leading off to the left then bumped along it for about a quarter of a mile to the campsite the emerson college research group was camping at the foot of a hill in a clearing partly ringed by lodgepole pines nancy parked next to a jeep and walked quickly up the path toward the little cluster of woodland green tents when she reached the fire pit at its center she found the campsite deserted several logs had been pulled around the fire pit to serve as benches not far away was the kitchen tent with sides made of mosquito netting and tables lined with pots pans and food a narrow trail snaked along the edge of the camp and then continued up the hill near the foot of the hill and about a hundred yards from the campsite was a very small wooden cabin nancy went over to inspect it there was a heavy padlock on the door and only one tiny window through which she could see a generator and computer next to the door on the outside of the cabin was a makeshift bulletin board nancy studied the work assignment chart posted there it was divided into categories such as computer data collection transmitter checking and observationfeeding stations through nancy saw that ned was assigned to watch feeding station from twothirty to five that afternoon where was he now though she wondered it was just about two she strolled back toward the tents the canvas flap that served as a door on the nearest one was tied back she glanced inside and saw a camera bag that reminded her of neds then started to raise the mosquito netting and go inside stop right there she heard someone shout behind her nancy spun around and saw two men in dark green coveralls running toward her the taller one who had piercing black eyes and black stubble for a beard reached her first he grabbed her by the arm and yanked her away from the tent hey nancy protested struggling to free herself from his grip i wasnt doing anything wrong just then the second man reached her he was built like a short redwood and had the ruddy complexion of someone who spent a lot of time outdoors yeah sure the tall man said twisting nancys arm behind her nancy had to bite her lip to keep from crying out looks like we caught ourselves a thief the short burly guy said taking a step toward her an ugly grin contorted his face and we know just what to do with her right rich ard right his buddy replied chapter two come on you richard growled he wheeled nancy around and started pulling her toward the fire pit get your hands off me nancy said furi ous not a chance he replied tightening his grip should we take her to the truck piker yeah the other man replied giving nancy a shove nancy swung her leg out and brought it up slamming her knee into richards stomach he bent over giving her the chance to pull away she was just taking off when she heard a familiar voice call her name she whirled around to see ned hurrying down the path toward her am i ever glad to see you she said with relief ned glanced at the two grimfaced men and put his arm around nancy whats going on here these guys accused me of being a thief nancy told him what ned was incredulous this is my girlfriend richard shrugged if you say so but she was nosing around camp right piker right piker said we were just looking out for your group he told ned we heard thered been some trouble around here well thanks ned replied but like i said nancys my girlfriend nancy watched piker nervously shift his weight at last he nodded and said well okay lets get back to work richard with that the two men headed off thats quite a welcoming committee nancy said before she could say anything else ned swept her into his arms hello there he said as he lifted her chin with two fingers the kiss that followed left her breathless hows that for a welcome mmm much better nancy sighed and took in his handsome squarejawed face and sparkling brown eyes ned led nancy to one of the logs near the fire pit and the two of them sat down who were those guys anyway she asked park maintenance men ned replied theyre building a walkway near here it goes to an old cabin near princess geyser what made them think you were a thief well nancy said i was peeking inside a tent wondering if it was yours when they grabbed me i guess i did look a little suspi cious even so ned growled they had no right to treat you badly he took her hand listen nan im really sorry i couldnt meet you at the hotel the fact is we have a major crisis you know weve tagged hundreds of marmots so we can track them well part of my job is to make sure the receiver is picking up their signals and sending them to the computer so theyre recorded properly nancy nodded this morning he said slowly the com puter printout showed no trace of almost fifty whistling marmots at first i thought we had a problem with the receiver or with the comput er but everything checked out okay we went out to check the marmot colonies a few hours ago and it was obvious that some were miss ing theres only one logical explanation some one is stealing them thats terrible nancy said do you have any idea when it could have happened we observe the marmots twice a day at four feeding stations he explained pacing now so it had to have happened after the second observation yesterdayprobably during the night nancy shook her head its hard to believe that people would kill such cute little animals for their fur she said disgustedly ned stopped pacing its not the fur they want he replied they want the marmots for pets thats no excuse for taking them out of their natural habitat nancy said have you reported this to the park service sure ned replied but without more evidence the park service cant launch a full scale investigation they just dont have the financial resources to act on our suspicions thats awful nancy said my sentiments exactly ned agreed of course the park service did assign a really good ranger named jack billings to our proj ect but his job is to help us not track down poachers just what is it youre doing in this project nancy asked stretching her legs out i know youre studying marmots are they endan gered no but their cousins the vancouver island marmots are he said professor traineys plan is to research the whistling marmots in yellowstone so we can figure out what condi tions marmots best thrive in the information we gather here will be used by biologists to breed vancouver island marmots in captiv ity thats wonderful nancy said ned nodded from the first moment i heard professor trainey talk about the study i knew i wanted to help he even got a federal grant to buy a stateoftheart tracking sys tem nancy cocked her head curiously imagine a transmitter no bigger than a dime that tells us not only where the animal is ned went on but its body temperature blood pressure eating and sleeping cycles its just amazing and amazingly expensive i bet nancy commented ned nodded his agreement and pulled her to her feet come on ill show you around first stop is our command post he led nancy across the campsite to the tiny cabin she had stopped at earlier he pulled a key ring from his jeans pocket undid the padlock pushed open the door and switched on the light that dangled from the ceiling nancy followed him inside along one wall was a plank table that held the computer and printer a small file cabinet in the comer was heaped high with printouts the device that receives the radio signals from the transmitters is outside ned ex plained nancy pointed to a door at the other side of the room and asked where does that go to the supply room ned replied thats what we call it but its really just a glorified closet still its big enough to hold traps sacks of food pellets and other equipment is that where the traps were stolen from nancy said some of them ned answered but weve got four marmot observation stations and we keep traps in the huts there too ned leaned against the worktable it makes me sick to think that the poachers are using our equip ment to steal marmots nancy returned to the door and studied the padlock the shiny brass lock was un scratched who has keys to this cabin she asked just the professor and brad ned replied these are the professors keys i have he gave them to me we were at observation station two but he wanted me to come back to check the computer to see if any signals from the missing marmots had shown up could i see one of the traps nancy asked ned went through the other door and re turned with a wire cage with open doors at each end we put food inside ned explained when a marmot steps in to get it its weight triggers a spring that closes the doors ned picked up a small disk attached to a plastic collar then we attach a transmitter to the animals neck nancy studied the collar and the marmots dont mind usually not ned said with a smile now and then we have to tranquilize one he indicated a small hypodermic syringe on a shelf nancy shuddered it doesnt hurt he insisted and anyway we dont have to do it very often most of the marmots especially those under two years old are really cooperative what happens after the collar is on she asked each transmitter has its own identifying signal ned told her all of them are picked up on our receiver and automatically fed into the computer then two times a day we download the file and chart the movements of the animals were tracking since brads acci dent thats been my job hows brad doing nancy asked better ned said but theyve kept him pretty heavily sedated no ones been able to see him where did he get hurt nancy queried up the hill in the hut at observation post one ned replied id like to see it nancy said ned led nancy to the trail that wound up the hill at the top of the slope ned halted well he said with a sweep of his hand this is it we have three other feeding stations but this is the most important one nancy looked around they were on level ground now a circular area about the size of a football field had been fenced off with chicken wire this is a marmot community and thats one of their burrows ned explained point ing to a raised mound on the far side of the chicken wire inside the enclosure nancy noticed a slim girl about her own age leaning down to a burrow she was wearing a checked shirt straightlegged jeans and suede boots her long black hair was pulled back into a ponytail and she had pale blue eyes and an oval face with a pronounced widows peak when she saw nancy and ned she came over to greet them hi jennifer this is nancy drew ned said casually nancy meet jennifer trainey hi jennifer nancy said traineyare you related to the professor hes my dad jennifer said quickly then added with a slight smile ned didnt tell me he was expecting company nancy was about to respond when she no ticed a flicker of movement from inside the enclosure she saw a small head peering out of one of the burrows as she watched delighted a marmot emerged another was close behind they were reddish brown with yellow abdo mens and black rings near their bushy tails meet click and clack our most sociable specimens jennifer said theyre adorable nancy glanced at jen nifer you must have been in on this project from the very beginning jennifer laughed since before the very beginning she replied the two marmots finished eating one sat up on its hind legs the furry creature had a wide head with short rounded ears large eyes and a black button nose it cocked its head sideways as if to ask nancy what she was doing there and then began grooming itself wait until bess sees these shell go crazy nancy said it looks like theyd be really fun to work with oh they are jennifer exclaimed right now im monitoring the day care center day care center nancy echoed while the parents are out foraging for food the older members of the community stay in the entrances to the burrows making sure the babies are safe jennifer explained if they sense danger they give a shrill earpiercing whistle did many marmots disappear from this feeding station nancy asked jennifer raised her eyebrows its okay ned said quickly i told nancy about what happened she can be trusted shes my girlfriend oh jennifer said smoothly how long are you here for a few days nancy replied great jennifer said though nancy doubted her sincerity well id better get back to work she went on without answering nancys question see you later as jennifer walked away nancy turned to ned shes incredibly pretty she said ned reddened and shrugged then led nancy toward a small hut as they approached it nancy noticed a metal box on top of a pole she saw another one just like it about fifty yards farther along the fence what are those things she asked timelapse cameras ned replied theyre set to take exposures every fifteen minutes they even record the date and time at the bottom of each negative incredible nancy said then pointed to the hut is that where brad was hurt yeah ned replied we keep a few snacks and drinks in there apparently brad was heating water for coffee when boom i heard the explosion and ran up the hill brad was lying across the doorstep unconscious nancy shook her head sympathetically the force of the explosion must have blown him out the door hes lucky he wasnt killed inside the hut were two chairs and a folding table covered with computer printouts and camera gear several bags of food pellets and a stack of traps lined the far wall above it was a shelf with a canister of sugar instant coffee and tea bags nancy pointed to a blackened object in the comer of the room is that the stove that blew up ned nodded and she went over to it the stove consisted of one burner attached by a copper tube to a canister of propane nancy checked the propane tank the fitting between it and the tubing was tight but when she traced a path up the tubing to the nut that connected it to the burner she let out a gasp find something ned asked nancy held the tubing and the bolt up to the light look at this she said see those scratch marks someones tampered with the nut neds eyes narrowed that means when brad turned on the stove propane started escaping exactly nancy agreed and when he lit the match there was an explosion ned straighted up so it wasnt an accident someone deliberately tried to hurt brad chapter three or kill him nancy added as she de tached the tube and put it in the pocket of her jacket this is our first piece of evidence from the doorway someone spoke up whats going on here nancy turned and saw a lanky man of about fifty whose black hair was sprinkled with gray at the temples he had a deeply tanned face and a wide unsmiling mouth a tall dark goodlooking guy in a ranger uniform and a young woman clad in blue jeans and a purple emerson college sweatshirt stood just behind him ned moved toward the group i was just showing my friend nancy around professor trainey this is nancy drew he gestured to the two people behind trainey and added thats jack billings a park ranger and alicia nivel from emerson hi youre neds girlfriend from river heights arent you a brief smile flashed across alicias face he talks about you a lot for a minute no one said anything then the professor turned to ned did anything new turn up on the computer he asked ned ran his hand back through his hair nervously ummi didnt get a chance to look nancy showed up just when i got to the command post he explained i see trainey replied he crossed his arms at his waist and stared at ned weve got fifty marmots missing final observations to make before we leave on saturday at least a day of packing ahead of usand youve invited a visitor here i must say your timing surprises me ned swallowed but sir nancy is trainey held up his hand i need you down at camp in ten minutes to draft a plot of todays readings he turned and headed down the path alicia gave nancy an apologetic smile and said youll have to forgive us were all pretty tense these days what with the marmots miss ing and the grant extension hanging in the balance the ranger patted her on the back and said dont worry alicia youll make it thanks jack alicia replied ned shook his head despondently i just wish trainey had given me a chance to explain why i invited nancy shes a wellknown de tective and is going to track down the poach ers nancy would have preferred to keep her role a secret for a little while longer oh well too late now she thought jack gave nancy a big smile a private eye he said well ill be and a pretty one too nancy tried to keep from blushing but it was no use she thought that jack was amaz ingly handsomerugged and intelligent look ing too she turned to alicia and asked what did you mean about the grant exten sion our study is being paid for by a federal grant alicia said but there were cost over runs so professor trainey applied for an ex tension but in the meantime hes been paying some of the expenses out of his own pocket nancy whistled thats pretty daring of him she said is he wealthy i doubt it ned said he lives in a small cottage off campus and drives a beatup truck his work is about the only thing that seems to matter to him nancy turned to jack i met a couple of park maintenance men today named richard and piker do you know them jack hitched his thumbs in his belt and said yes i do why they werent exactly friendly when i met them at the campsite a little while ago nancy replied jack gazed at nancy im sorry if they gave you a hard time i told them about what happened to brad and asked them to be on the lookout for trouble actually piker and rich ard are really good guys jack went on theyre just better at building walkways than relating to the public oh nancy said keeping her doubts to herself ned told me about brads accident that was the day before yesterday at about eight in the evening right seven fiftythree to be exact ned said nancy flashed him a grateful smile and continued were either of you around when it happened jack gave a vigorous shake of his head not me i was at the ranger station giving a talk on the mammals of yellowstone it started at seven thats right alicia said jennifer and i were there the slides were terrific did either of you happen to use the stove that afternoon nancy asked her eyes casu ally moving from jack to alicia and back alicia frowned in concentration i think i did when i came up to change the film in the cameras i made some hot chocolate what time was that nancy pressed sixthirty alicia replied i left about ten minutes later to go to the lecture i made it just in time i remember you huffing and puffing as you ran into the room jack said with a grin but speaking of time trainey told us to meet him in ten minutes and me in the doghouse already ned exclaimed come on nancy nancy and ned jogged down the path to the campsite with alicia and jack close behind them when they reached the parking area ned gave nancy a quick kiss then dashed off nancy drove away thinking about the inves tigation if alicias recollection was correct the propane stove was working at sixthirty on the day of the accident but by seven fifty three it had been sabotaged if she could place someone at the observation hut during that time period it would go a long way toward breaking the case as she drove up to the hotel she saw bess standing on the porch peering anxiously at the road the moment she spotted nancy she started waving wildly nancy parked and ran over to her what is it bess she demanded whats wrong nothings wrong bess replied i think i just solved the whole case what do you mean nancy sank down onto a porch swing bess dropped down next to nancy and handed her a piece of paper just look at this she said nancys eyes widened when she read the title hot new pet crazewhistling mar mots the sheet had been photocopied from a magazine in the article the words native to yellowstone were highlighted in orange nancys heart began to race where did you get this i was sitting in the lobby bess explained when a richlooking couple came in and stopped near me as they moved away i noticed a piece of paper on the floor so i picked it up hmm nancy scanned the page and read out loud rock star randy deans fondness for collecting marmots has made the creature a soughtafter pet among the rich and famous according to one us wildlife specialist some people are willing to pay as much as five hundred dollars for one of these animals randy keeps a bunch of marmots on his california estate bess said according to the article one of them escaped a neighbor found it in her kitchen munching its way through a box of cereal the story made the newspapers and ever since then people have wanted marmots thats very interesting nancy said slow ly i guess we should find out the couples names and where they come from bess grinned proudly theyre gerald and edith turkower and theyre fromjust guess bel air california nancy stared how do you know simple bess said smugly while they were registering i checked their luggage tags good work nancy told her friend tell you what she added as a reward ill treat you to a cup of tea and a snack ill also fill you in on what ive learned so far the dining room had log walls and wooden ceiling beams as they sat down at a table near the windows bess leaned forward and whis pered two tables to your leftthose are the turkowers nancy casually glanced in their direction as the waitress arrived to take her order then just as their pie and tea arrived a bellhop walked through the dining room say ing nancy drew telephone call for nancy drew nancy waved to him and identified herself it sounds like an emergency he told her pulling a cordless phone from a holster on his belt hello yes nancy said nancy thank goodness i got you a breathless voice said its alicia nivel youve got to come at once neds been hurt chapter four nancy clutched the phone so tightly that her knuckles turned white what happened we dont know alicia replied we found him on the floor at the command post uncon scious he must have fallen and hit his head on something when he came to he asked us to call you right away so i drove down to the general store at madison junction ill be there as soon as possible nancy switched off the phone and sprang up from her seat neds been hurt she told bess i have to go to him right away ill go too bess waved for the waitress and paid the check while nancy went on ahead to get the car the fifteen miles to the campsite seemed to take forever when nancy turned in to the parking area she flung the door open in one movement then dashed up to camp and straight to the tiny cabin bess followed in side nancy saw jack jennifer and alicia clustered around ned with an open firstaid kit on the floor nearby ned was sitting propped up against the wall holding his head in his hands ned nancy cried as she rushed in and knelt beside him are you all right i feel a lot better now that youre here jennifer reluctantly moved aside so nancy could look at the back of neds head there was a huge bump and dried blood on it what happened she asked ned shifted and as he did nancy noticed something gleaming on the floor behind him she picked it up and tucked it into her pocket let me think i was on my way over to the command post the door was ajar and its supposed to be kept shut because theres a lot of valuable hardware in here so i decided to make sure everything was okay i got inside and the next thing i knew i was lying here with this lump on my head and the mother of all headaches somebody must have hit me just then bess arrived ned she gasped are you okay hi bess he answered trying his best to sound normal guys this is bess marvin jennifer and alicia nodded to bess jack glanced at her smiled broadly and held out his hand to shake hers hello there im jack billings boy does ned nickerson have some greatlooking friends bess blushed but said nothing nancy got to her feet someone obviously wanted something is all the equipment still here alicia had been studying the computer ta ble it doesnt look as if anything was taken nancy crossed to the supply room every thing looked much as it had when she had seen it a couple of hours earlier then she noticed the hypodermic syringe and several vials of tranquilizer were missing did anyone take a syringe and some tran quilizer vials out of here nancy asked over her shoulder alicia stepped inside and checked the shelf ohthey are missing but who would have taken them nancys thoughts raced first the group had discovered fifty marmots missing and now someone seemed to have stolen tranquilizers that could sedate more marmots was some one planning to tranquilize the fifty stolen creatures so they could be quietly shipped out of the park before she could ask more questions nancy saw professor trainey at the doorway now what he demanded slightly out of breath cant i leave this project for five minutes without his voice faded as he noticed ned on the floor someone hit ned over the head jennifer told her father and tranquilizers are missing from the supply room traineys eyes widened as he knelt beside ned weve got to get you up to the hospital in gardiner as soon as we can he glanced around the room clearly upset can someone drive him there we cant take chancesnot with a head injury ill go nancy quickly offered where is it gardiner is just over the state line in montana right outside the north entrance of the park ill ride along and show you the way jack offered just give me a couple of minutes to clear it with headquarters nancy remembered the object she had stashed in her pocket she slipped it out unob trusively it was a phi beta kappa key turning it over she saw the initials dt engraved on the back dan trainey she leaned down to pat neds shoulder then crossed the room professor she said quietly may i speak to you privately for a moment frowning trainey followed her outside if youre concerned about neds care dont be he began its not that nancy replied she showed him the gold medallion i found this just now under ned its yours isnt it trainey took the key from her palm and examined it yes he said i noticed id lost it a few days ago thanks how do you suppose it came to be lying under nednow nancy asked trainey flushed what are you implying professor trainey nancy said im a de tective something strange is going on here ned asked me to help find out what it is now look here trainey said impatiently i have a research assistant in the hospital another of my students on the way there fifty marmots missing and a crucial deadline com ing up in a couple of days the last thing i need is an amateur detective in my hair do i make myself clear nancy remained calm do you realize she asked that someone from your group could be behind all the trouble traineys eyes narrowed what do you mean knowing she finally had his full attention nancy continued as i understand it each marmots transmitter has its own distinctive code right yes of course trainey replied his voice ominously low so someone could use the computer to pin down an animals location at any given mo ment she pressed thats what the equipment is designed to doif you know the codes trainey replied nancy fixed her eyes on the professors face and who knows them trainey shrugged everyone here i sup pose the list is in the computer the professors voice trailed off as he realized the significance of what he had just said it all points to an inside job professor nancy said quietly trainey scowled look ms drew are you suspecting me of jeopardizing my project thats insulting and crazy im not saying nancy began the professor interrupted her i dont have time for this why dont you go sightseeing or something he barked then stalked away as nancy returned to the shed she thought that it was unlikely the professor would jeopar dize his own project but until she could prove otherwise he had to be a suspect when she got back to the command post ned was sitting up near the computer nancy was glad to see that his color was better can you walk she asked him he smiled and assured her that he could all right we can go jack said from the doorway as they walked across the camp ground to the parking area he moved to besss side are you coming to the hospital too bess nodded and nancy noticed the interest in her friends blue eyes good jack continued opening the door for ned and then the back door of the car for bess he slipped in next to her as they started off in the direction of the north entrance ned asked what were you talking to the professor about the problems the study is having nancy replied being deliberately vague he seemed tense he has a right to be ned said his reputation is riding on the success of this project for the rest of the trip nancy concentrated on her driving while jack pointed out land marks ned leaned back in his seat with his eyes closed at the hospital the group easily found the emergency room after ned and nancy spoke with the nurse there an orderly led ned into an examining room explaining to nancy that only the patient was allowed inside the rest of the group found seats in the waiting room i am totally starved bess announced its dinnertime there are some vending machines down stairs jack said is this the hospital brad is in nancy asked after bess borrowed some quarters and headed for the elevator yes jack replied i wonder if hes allowed visitors yet i dont know jack said we can ask i hope he isnt badly scarred burns can be pretty awful as he spoke he rubbed a reddish scar on the back of his left hand so tell me about you and ned you seem to know each other pretty well he continued nancy nodded weve been going together for a long time too bad jack said with a charming smile if ned werent such a nice guy id ask you to the square dance tomorrow night at the old faithful inn thats where were staying nancy re marked then youve got no excuse for missing it he said casually draping an arm across the back of nancys chair are you sure i cant tempt you to go with me jack asked teasingly nancy felt flattered but shook her head i have a feeling ned wouldnt like that too much she answered lightly but maybe ill see you there jack gave a mock sigh of disappointment too bad neds a lucky guy from the doorway ned said i sure am the doctor says ill be fine no concussion or anythingbut i had to have a few stitches he gestured to the bandage wrapped all the way around his head it gave him a roguish look just then bess came rushing up are they done with you already she asked can we go now id like to meet brad nancy replied if theyll let us in to see him good idea ned said they asked for brads room number at the front desk then filed into the elevator at the nurses station they learned that he was con scious and able to receive visitors a couple of minutes later the group piled into brads room his face and arms were heavily ban daged but his eyes lit up when he saw them ned jack he said and grinned its great to see you he turned his gaze to nancy and bess this is my girlfriend nancy drew and her friend bess marvin ned explained nice to meet you brad said then he noticed neds bandage hey guy what hap pened ned told him we are some hard luck bunch brad said first me and now you dont forget that marmot that nipped me on the nose last week jack interjected with a laugh thats right brad replied maybe you should watch your step if youre going to hang around with us nancy ned filled brad in about the missing mar mots after the stove exploded i asked nancy to come out to look into it shes a detective and if anyone can figure out whos causing all the trouble she can tell me about your accident brad nancy began theres not much to tell the first thing i did when i went on duty was make a cup of coffee of course ned said grinning hes a caffeine addict brad smiled back then continued when i went to light the stove there was a whoosh and then flames were everywhere the next thing i knew i woke up here how terrible bess exclaimed brads face hardened yeah well im not so sure it was an accident i saw someone sneaking out of the hut as i walked up the path nancy leaned forward eagerly could you tell who it was brad stared up at the ceiling for a long time finally he said i hate to say it but it looked an awful lot like dan trainey chapter five no way ned said how could you even think that the professor had anything to do with it brad shook his head all i can tell you is that whoever it was was wearing a dark green hat and a green coat like the professors and considering the way he ran behind the hut id say he didnt want to be seen well it wasnt professor trainey ned insisted and thats that reluctantly nancy told them about finding the professors phi beta kappa key ned scowled theres bound to be an ex planation did you ask him about it yes nancy told him he said he noticed he lost it a few days ago well there you are ned concluded it was probably on the floor all this time nancy glanced at ned who looked upset she decided to drop the subject for a while turning back to brad she asked can you think of any reason why anyone would want to hurt you when i noticed that the traps were missing the others divided up my chores so i could look into it maybe my investigation bothered somebody brad suggested nancy nodded thoughtfully did you dis cover anything before brad could answer a nurse came bustling in nancy could almost hear the starch rustling in her white uniform sorry folks visiting hours are over she took brads wrist between her fingers and checked her watch the group said their goodbyes as they left nancy decided to return the next day to ques tion brad further on the way back ned sat silently beside nancyshe could tell he was thinking about the professor jack and bess kept up a steady stream of conversation in the backseat and nancy was glad of it i have an idea jack said as nancy turned onto the dirt road leading to the campsite theres a new little cafe with disco music in west yellowstone i know ned has to rest this evening but we could go dancing that sounds great bess replied thanks but ill pass nancy said you guys go without me sure you dont mind bess asked nancy shook her head when she parked the car jack climbed out then put his head in through the window ill come by the hotel around eight okay he said to bess if you change your mind you can still join us he added to nancy oh wait bess called getting out and walking up the path after jack what kind of place is this i need to know what to wear jack laughed and put his arm around besss shoulders the two of them bent their heads together and launched into an animated con versation nancy looked over at ned he was sitting very stiffly staring straight ahead are you feeling all right she asked im fine he said in a tense voice but then he added theres no way dan trainey tam pered with that stove nancy nancy was silent and ned guessed the rea son youre not listening to me are you im listening nancy said but i have to check him out and what brad said makes him a suspect when ned didnt respond she continued of course im investigating every one nancy hoped for a goodbye kiss but ned simply opened the door and walked away without a word he passed bess as she re turned to the car brrr bess said climbing into the passen ger seat did you and ned just have a fight nancy swallowed back tears but didnt feel like talking on the drive back to the hotel bess was quiet too until they turned in to the parking lot then she said lets go watch old faithful nancy would have preferred to lie down with a book but she laughed and said okay old faithful it is the girls went through the lobby and fol lowed a path to the geyser come on bess urged i see two spots on that bench over there wed better grab them they sat down and studied the center of attention a fourfoothigh cone that looked like a shrunken volcano small puffs of white steam trailed lazily upward from it suddenly there was a rumbling sound as if a truck were passing water bubbled up over the surface of the cone and shot at least a hundred feet into the air finally after two or three minutes the column of water slowly sank and then vanished wow bess exclaimed nancy just smiled touching her arm bess said in an under tone look over there see the guy with all the camera equipment thats turkower nancy saw a couple in their forties the man was tall with saltandpepper hair and a mus tache he had two expensivelooking cameras around his neck and a leather camera bag over one shoulder mrs turkower could have just stepped out of a beauty salon come on bess nancy urged i want to meet them the two girls strolled around the geyser and stopped next to the turkowers nancy took the photocopied article about the marmots out of her pocket excuse me she said politely did you drop this i looked for you earlier but youd already gone upstairs so thats where it went the woman said with a tittering laugh as she accepted the sheet of paper she added thanks for return ing it im nancy drew and this is my friend bess marvin gerald and edith turkower here the man replied smile he said suddenly before nan cy and bess could react he raised the camera and took three quick shots of them i wasnt ready bess protested gerald really edith admonished hes such a camera nut i couldnt help looking at that article nancy said casually those whistling mar mots are so cute wouldnt it be fun to have one as a pet oh yes edith replied i know a woman back home who has three of them edith likes owning unusual things gerald said shooting a keen glance at nancy i know there are lots of them here in yellowstone but isnt it illegal to take animals out of a national park nancy asked sound ing naive gerald nodded sure then he smiled knowingly but there are ways around that nancys heartbeat quickened did this cou ple want to buy a marmot or were they somehow involved in the poaching scheme she decided to dangle a little bait and see if one of them took it i might consider it but only if i was sure i wouldnt get into any trouble nobody likes trouble gerald said to nancys disappointment he didnt say more before they wandered off what do you think nan bess asked could they be stealing the marmots nancy frowned they seem more like buy ers than sellers she said but either way well keep an eye on them somewhere downstairs a clock chimed nancy glanced at her wrist eleven oclock she was lying in the comfortable brass bed in her hotel room she realized that she had had her book open to the same page for almost half an hour the thought that kept running through her mind was that ned cared more about professor trainey than he did about the truth suddenly she couldnt stand it any longer and put her book down stood up and got her jacket from the closet a little fresh air maybe a drive would clear the cobwebs from her mind she thought nancy headed outside the night was cold and crisp as she walked toward the parking lot she heard voices that sounded familiar just then the headlights of an incoming car swept across a small group of people about fifty feet away nancy ducked behind a parked car edith and gerald turkower were deep in conversation with richard and piker the two park maintenance men nancy crouched down and began moving between cars to get close enough to hear them but the group broke up before she got there she went back to her room and tried to sort out her thoughts the only link she could think of between a rich california couple and two yellowstone maintenance men was poaching would any of them know how to track the marmots on the computer nancy doubted it someone in the camp had to be involved someone like dan trainey nancy was still thinking when the door opened and bess rushed in her face aglow the disco was great she exclaimed and it wasnt even crowded we had lots of room to dance you should have come nancy smiled next time jack is really something bess fell into a chair he is totally dedicated to his work and knows absolutely everything about the park i just hope i can get him as interested in me as he is in whistling marmots she finished with a laugh nancy smiled i get the feeling you had a good time she said then couldnt help sighing bess stared at her whats wrong nan its just that neds upset because dan irainey is on my list of suspects i guess he thinks his friends should be exempt from my investigating them thats ridiculous bess said ned knows better than that nancy hes just tired and stressed out hell feel different tomorrow nancy shook her head i hope so she said hey i know bess continued theres going to be a square dance tomorrow night here at the hotel jack asked me to go with him why dont you and ned come too well have a great time good idea nancy said feeling uncom fortable that was the same dance that jack had offered to take her to just a few hours before sure he had been fooling around but still was jack one of those guys who had to charm every girl he met if so bess was letting herself in for grief judging by the gleam in her eye this was not the time to give her any warnings as nancy and bess were finishing their breakfast the next morning edith turkower came over to their table were doing a rangerguided tour of upper geyser basin she announced gerald and i thought you might like to come along nancy gave bess a gentle kick on the ankle and said i cant but i know bess would love to as edith walked away nancy said softly keep a close eye on them bess its impor tant no problem bess replied once bess left the table nancy decided to go to the gardiner hospital to see brad again she headed for her car lost in thought she was already climbing a steep grade on the mountain road that led to gardiner when she noticed a van close behind hertoo close it seemed to be tailgating her she pressed harder on the gas pedal but the van kept pace with her the road wound between a sheer wall of rock on the left and a deep ravine on the right as they came around a long curve the van pulled out to pass nancy edged over toward the ravine to give it more room but instead of going ahead the van stayed next to her alarmed nancy hit the brakes to let the other vehicle move ahead instead the van slowed then without warning it swerved toward her its front bumper banging into nancys door she struggled to control the wheel but the van slammed into her again forcing her car toward the edge of the ravine she glanced to her right and her stomach twisted the drop was endless and she was just about to go over chapter six all that separated nancy from a drop into the ravine was a couple of feet of shoulder and the van was continuing to nudge her over nancy accelerated attempting to pull ahead of her pursuer she knew she couldnt keep driving at this speedthe road was too treach erous in seconds the van was behind her again moving up to slam into her from the rear she rounded a curve and spotted a sign for a scenic overlook as she approached it she took a deep breath and jerked the wheel sharply to the right the wheels skidded on the gravel the van followed and was just about to ram into her again when nancy saw a tall lodgepole pine at the far end of the overlook parking area she steered her car straight at it she was just about to hit it when she swerved left and shot back onto the highway in the rearview mirror she saw the van graze the tree she had just missed then to her astonishment the driver of the van backed up turned and roared off in the other direction puzzled nancy stopped her car when she looked ahead of her she saw a park service vehicle pulling into the parking area and un derstood why the driver of the van had headed off in such a hurry hed seen the ranger too the ranger stopped his car next to hers and jumped out he was about forty and had a crewcut and neat mustache are you all right he asked nancy nodded even though she felt shaken a van tried to run me off the road did you see who was driving the ranger leaned his elbows on the edge of her window nancy noted the name on the plate pinned to his breast pocket martin robbins she shook her head will you come to my office to make a report its near the north entrance he con tinued nancy followed him back up the road to the ranger station once inside and settled in a chair she watched while robbins filled out a report i dont suppose you got the license number nancy shook her head ruefully sorry things happened too fast i did notice the words minden linen painted on the door of the van does that mean anything to you its the biggest linen service in this area all the hotels in yellowstone get their sheets and towels from there i know their chief dispatch er ill call him martin suggested even though she only heard martins half of the conversation nancy could tell that some thing was wrong well she asked eagerly once he had hung up one of their drivers bert heckleby missed a couple of deliveries this morning martin replied hes not answering calls on his radio either could someone have paid heckleby to at tack her or stolen his van i get the feeling that theres more to this than youre telling me martin said taking a deep breath nancy explained everything including the propane stove explo sion and the missing marmots martin nodded jacks kept me up to date on the problems but hes not convinced the marmots are being poached he thinks some one may be trying to sabotage the study thats a possibility nancy replied but traps and tranquilizers have been stolen that points to poaching the ranger frowned i did pass on word of this to the people at the fish and wildlife service he said but theres no telling what theyll do about it i wish i could help more but i simply dont have the staff after nancy told martin that she was a detective he grinned and nodded apprecia tively id welcome any help you can give but be careful poaching is dangerous business especially when big money is at stake i understand that whistling marmots can bring as much as five hundred dollars apiece on the black market nancy remarked if fifty of them really were stolen the poachers stand to make twentyfive thousand dollars martin glanced above nancys shoulder she turned to see jack billings at the open door of the office he grinned at her and put a slide projector on the table in the comer of the room that ought to work now martin hey nancy what brings you here youd better look after this girl jack martin cautioned somebody doesnt like her a guy in a van just tried to run her off the road what are you serious jack moved clos er to nancy and put his hand on her shoulder solicitously are you okay you want me to drive you back to the hotel no need nancy replied im on my way to visit brad anyway she thanked martin and then walked out side with jack the morning sun glinted against the dent in the side of the white rental car you need to be more careful nancy id feel terrible if anything happened to you so would i she joked she couldnt help feeling attracted to him but the warmth and concern she saw in his eyes made her feel awkward ill tell bess i saw you she added pointedly please do shes a great girl jack said smiling ill see both of you later right nancy got into her car and drove off with only a wave for an answer on the way to the hospital she kept thinking about jack she hoped bess wasnt getting into something shed regret brads face broke into a welcoming smile when he saw nancy hi its great to see you hi yourself she replied dropping into a chair by the bed how are you feeling great the doctor said ill be out of this place in a day or two im glad nancy leaned forward listen brad i want to talk about the problems the studys been having did you find out anything while you were investigating the professor is in real financial trouble brad replied reluctantly i found lots of overdue bills in his tent you know hes put his own money into this study yes nancy said but once the extension comes through hell be reimbursed thats just it brad said unhappily i found a letter from the department of interior in his tent there wont be any extension traineys application was turned down what nancy exclaimed thats terri ble that means the professors out all that money brad nodded im afraid so wow nancy thought for a moment you know professor trainey pretty well dont you brad nodded i think so ive worked with him pretty closely for a couple of years could he be desperate enough to try to get his money back by selling marmots nancy asked brad hesitated for a long time i guess he could try to recoup his losses he said sighing does everyone know that you drink a lot of coffee nancy went on brad grinned glad to change the subject sure everybody kids me about always hav ing a cup of the stuff glued to my hand so it would have been a safe assumption that at some point in the evening you would light the stove to boil water yes he confirmed what time did you get to the hut that night about seventhirty brad replied nancy nodded thoughtfully the daily as signments were posted outside the command post shed so everyone would have known that brad was monitoring feeding station alicia left the hut around sixthirty that left the place empty for an hourplenty of time to sabotage the stove i understand that you and professor trainey have the only keys to the command post nancy said turning her thoughts to how the poachers could have gained access to the computer that monitored the marmots sig nals technically i guess thats true nancy was puzzled what do you mean we had a spare that we kept hidden under a rock near the doorin case we lost the oth ers brad laughed i guess it wasnt such a great place to hide it because one morning about two weeks ago we couldnt find it nancys eyes widened just then a nurse came in to change brads bandages nancy got up and said well i guess id better go youve been a great help as she drove back to the inn nancys mind was spinning whod taken the key to the command post was it someone unconnected to the study grouplike the two maintenance men piker and richard she felt uneasy every time she thought of them especially since shed caught them in the parking lot at the hotel with the turkowers was it possible that the professor piker and richard and the turkowers were all involved somehow it seemed a strange group of people to be working together still she needed to keep her eye on them all when nancy opened the door to her room she found bess bubbling over with enthusi asm i had a fabulous morning upper geyser basin was amazing did you know that yel lowstone sits in the middle of the crater of a gigantic volcano she paused and glanced around you dont suppose it could erupt again do you i doubt it bess nancy laughed what did you find out about the turkowers bess wrinkled her forehead gerald must have shot about a hundred pictures and edith never stopped talking about her neighbors back in california but i dont think theyre tourists at all in fact im now betting theyre in charge of kidnapping the marmots nancy turned that around in her mind she had been thinking of the turkowers as buyers who might lead her to the poaching ring what if bess was right though and they were the sellers instead but wait bess added i havent told you my most exciting news guess whos coming to yellowstone park smokey the bear nancy suggested bess threw a pillow at her okay she said i give up youll never believe it bess cried her eyes wide with excitement randy dean chapter seven really randy dean here nancy said are you sure bess nodded emphatically uhhuh the ranger told us this morning hes coming to make a television special about the impor tance of leaving animals in their natural envi ronments oh what about all those marmots of his nancy asked bess shrugged he must have had a change of heart her face lit up again and not only that hes going to be staying right in this hotel we might even meet him wouldnt that be awesome george is going to be so jealous when she hears we havent met him yet nancy pointed out to herself she wondered about the rock stars change of heart was it for real or simply a good excuse for a tv special i had a rather eventful morning myself bess she told her friend about what brad had said and the attempt to run her off the road nan thats terrible bess exclaimed you could have been killed well i wasnt and the main thing is this attack shows that were on the right track the poachers are getting desperate so whats our next move bess asked lunch nancy said firmly i dont know about you but im starved downstairs they found the dining room crowded as they were waiting by the hostess station edith and gerald turkower came in well hello again edith said with a smile just then the hostess came over i have a table for four by the window she announced wonderful edith said brightly why dont we all eat together sure nancy replied here was a perfect opportunity to find out more about the turkowers the hostess led them to a round oak table near the window and handed them menus the cutthroat trout caught in the yellow stone lake are supposed to be the best in the world gerald told them placing his cameras on the windowsill really bess closed her menu ill try it so will i nancy said ill just have the vegetarian platter edith said its a little chilly in here dont you think she added slipping into a beige sweat er with a fur collar the waitress came and took their orders as she left nancy asked casually hows the hunt for whistling marmots going edith made a face not very well we havent even seen one yet what about you any luck gerald asked why yes nancy replied theres a re search group here studying the marmots i visited their camp yesterday and saw a couple of them at one of the feeding stations theyre every bit as cute as i expected too nancy paused as the waitress placed bowls of green salad in front of everyone nancy picked up her fork and took a bite of salad then leaning forward she lowered her voice a guy from the group told me that some of the marmots are missing she scrutinized the turkowers and thought she saw an uneasy expression in geralds eyes do you think someone is stealing them he asked nancy shrugged i have no idea gerald put down his fork i suppose its possible that someone on the emerson team might be stealing marmots he mused col lege students are always short of cash nancys breath caught in her throat she had never mentioned emerson college had gerald noticed her reaction with a wary expression he added i think i saw an article about that research project maybe we should pay them a visit edith wont be happy until shes had a chance to watch the little critters in action he beamed fondly at his wife and winked edith smiled back at him in some ways she began a marmot would be better off with us than in the wild wed give it such a good home she cooed gerald and i are staunch animal rights supporters why ive even be come a vegetarian nancy noticed the startled expression on besss face but before she could figure out what caused it their broiled trout had arrived after lunch the turkowers excused them selves saying they planned to drive to yellow stone lake that couple is definitely phony bess said in the main lobby what makes you say that nancy asked bess rolled her eyes if edith is so into animal rights she demanded why was she wearing a sweater with a mink collar maybe it was fake fur nancy suggested no way bess scoffed i can tell the dif ference believe me come on bess i just saw the turkowers head out the front door i want to check out their room nancy led the way to the house phones and asked the switchboard for the turkowers after half a dozen rings the operator said sorry room three twentysix doesnt answer nancy and bess climbed the stairs to the third floor at the turkowers door nancy rapped lightly then tried the knob it was locked after a quick glance up and down the hall she pulled a small case of lockpicks from her shoulder bag and went to work a few moments later the door sprang open bess you stand guard while i search the room nancy said bess nodded and nancy slipped inside like the room nancy and bess were sharing this one had roughhewn plank walls brass beds and an oldfashioned washstand com plete with porcelain bowl and pitcher the window looked out onto a steaming geyser field nancy opened the oak wardrobe in the comer the right side held womens clothes to her amazement there were only three out fits hanging there nancy had expected edith to be like bess and bring virtually everything she owned she moved to the dresser and started pulling drawers open quickly she riffled through a pile of mens shirts and sweaters she came up emptyhanded as she pushed the drawer closed she noticed that it seemed to be sticking she pulled it all the way out and held it up so she could see the underside there was a manila envelope taped to the bottom of the drawer carefully removing it she opened the enve lope and pulled out a sheet of fax paper there were no headings simply a list of animals each followed by a dollar amount and one or two locations she scanned the list her eyes stopping at an entry that said whistling marmot yellowstone park someone had inked a little star next to it shocked nancy realized that she was look ing at a list of how much wild animals would bring on the black market taking care not to crease the fragile sheet nancy put it back in the envelope and retaped it to the underside of the drawer then she took one last peek at the room to make sure she hadnt left anything out of place and slipped out the door on the way downstairs she told bess what she had found well that settles it bess declared i knew right from the start that edith and gerald werent ordinary tourists theyre in the marmot black market up to their necks nancy frowned i still think someone from the emerson group has to be involved too all the thefts not to mention brads and neds injuries point to an inside job whats next nan bess asked lets head out and find richard and piker i want to ask them a few questions about what they were discussing with the turkowers she said bess rolled down her car window but the breeze was too chilly so she put it up again the road led along the bank of the firehole river kept warm by the hot springs in its bed a layer of white mist hid the surface of the water nancy slowed down as they passed the fountain paint pots a series of pools turned vivid colors by the algae that lived in them all at once she hit the brakes what is it bess asked alarmed is some thing wrong lookin the middle of those aspens nancy replied pointing what is it bess repeated a bear no its a van nancy said and if im not mistaken its the same one that tried to run me off the road this morning are you sure bess gasped nancy nodded and pulled onto the shoulder of the road getting out she walked down a dirt trail toward the halfconcealed van as she approached she saw the words minden linen painted on the side this is it she said over her shoulder you can see the dent where it grazed off the tree and look she pointed to a streak of white paint on the bumper thats from our car bess glanced around nervously do you think the people who did it are still around i doubt it nancy said she pulled open the drivers side door and peered inside the keys were in the ignition im going to search the cab keep an eye out for me okay just make it quick bess urged hastily nancy climbed into the cab and opened the glove compartment she found nothing except the registration and insurance card both issued to the linen supply company under the seat she found a creased map of the park she was climbing out when she suddenly heard a thumping sound beth paled nancy lets get out of here the sound came again louder this time theres someone in the back of the van nancy exclaimed she ran around to the rear doors and yanked the handle down it was locked bess grab the keys theyre in the ignition bess grabbed the large key ring then dashed back to nancy with it the third key worked and she yanked the door open the van was piled with neatly folded linen and lying on a pile of towels in the center was a middleaged man with round wild eyes his hands and feet were tied and in his mouth was a gag chapter eight nancy and bess scrambled into the van and quickly released the man mr heckleby nancy inquired as the man rubbed his chafed wrists he nodded are you all right bess asked ive been better he replied massaging his ankles but i sure am glad you came along ive been tied up for hours what happened nancy asked heckleby pushed back his unruly gray hair beats me he said i was driving along near madison junction when i saw a car blocking the road i stopped and got out to see if i could help and someone grabbed me from behind i felt something jab my arm when i woke up i was hogtied and gagged on the floor of the van you must have been drugged nancy ex claimed whoever it was hijacked your truck and tried to run me off the road with it who would do a thing like that and why he demanded i dont know nancy replied remember ing the missing syringes and tranquilizer vials at the campsite the girls helped heckleby out of the van id better call the office and have them get a ranger over here he reached into the cab for his radio less than ten minutes later a park service cruiser pulled up behind nancys car and two officers got out they introduced themselves as rangers dillon and cramer and took state ments from both nancy and heckleby before leaving the officers offered to drive heckleby to the hospital in gardiner but he said he was too far behind on his rounds already after thanking nancy and bess for rescuing him he got into the van and drove off nancy was silent as she started the car and swung onto the road what are you thinking nan bess asked nancy told her about the syringes you think someone from neds group drugged mr heckleby and tried to kill you i cant really narrow it down that far nancy replied slowly anyone could have taken the spare key to the command post nancy drove past madison junction toward the emerson campsite we need to find out where everyone was this morning around ten thats when i was forced off the road ill do my best bess promised as nancy got out of the car she heard hammering squinting against the afternoon sun she spotted richard and piker about fifty yards away come on she said to bess in a low voice they approached the workers who were lining up long smooth planks of wood and nailing them to stout crosspieces hi bess called gaily building a new walkway the two men raised their heads pikers face was expressionless but richard gave bess a slight grin yeah he answered why here bess asked there arent any geysers around are there princess geyser is about a half mile north richard explained this looks like a big job nancy com mented how long have you been at it since first thing this morning he said why nancy acted puzzled no reason except that i thought i saw you in gardiner this morning richard chuckled must have been my double because ive been here all day nancy and bess headed through the woods to the campsite jack was beside the command post checking out the assignment sheet when he saw them he smiled and yelled well hello there his gaze moved warmly from nancy to bess and back again bess moved close to him and said hello yourself it seems like ages since i saw you have you been having an exciting day nancy smothered a laugh bess might be falling in love but as promised she was trying to help out with the case oh very exciting jack replied his smile broadening this morning ned and i started packing up station four then came the high pointi repaired a park service slide projec tor i tell you the life of a park ranger is full of thrills bess giggled is ned still around nancy asked he was up at feeding station one a while back jack told her i think ill hike up there nancy told bess go ahead she replied ill stay here nancy was about halfway up the hill when she heard a shrill whistling sound startled she stopped and looked around it came again from a clump of bushes about sixty feet to the left of the path she made her way there and cautiously parted the scraggly branches then let out a cry under the bushes was a wire trap just like the one ned had showed her the day before inside was a little marmot one of its hind legs was caught in the door and was badly swollen nancys first impulse was to run for help but she couldnt bear to leave the suffering creature she knew that handling an injured animal could be dangerous so she took the scarf from around her neck and wrapped it around her hand even if the marmot tried to bite her the scarf would keep its teeth from breaking her skin she knelt down and opened the door gingerly freeing the marmots leg there there she crooned as she slowly withdrew her hand youll be all right now just then she heard besss voice shouting nancy where are you over here nancy yelled she shut the cage door and stood up as bess and jack came hurrying up the path bess was huffing when she reached nancys side what happened we heard a terrible noise jack came to a stop behind bess i told her it was a marmot he said youre right it is a marmot see its leg was caught in the trap oh no bess gasped is it badly hurt jack bent down and carefully examined the animal then stood up his face angry his legs not broken but hes definitely hurt he told them lets take him back to camp well clean the cut and bandage it can i help jack bess asked her eyes fixed on the injured animal of course jacks face relaxed into a smile with a pretty angel of mercy like you this little guy will recover in no time are you coming nancy bess asked nancy shook her head im going up to the feeding station to see if neds still there as she made her way up the hill she kept thinking about the marmot had the thieves overlooked that trap when they collected the other mar mots or were they starting to trap more when she approached the fencedoff area she saw ned and jennifer their heads close together making some adjustments to one of the timelapse cameras the sight made her a little uneasy she took a deep breath pasted a confident smile on her face and called out hi guys nancy ned dashed over and gave her a big hug and a quick kiss nancys spirits soared ned wasnt angry with her any longer she turned to find jenni fer watching them a hint of challenge in her eyes i can finish up here by myself if you want to take a break jennifer said we got a lot accomplished today nancy will you be at the square dance tonight it should be lots of fun ned dont forget you promised me a virginia reel ned shifted his feet uncomfortably oh i wont he said then turned to nancy i worked straight through lunch so im due an hour or so you want to drive to mammoth hot springs its my favorite place in the park she touched his arm lightly that would be great they walked down the hill and stopped at the campsite to tell bess and jack where she was going bess was so occupied with helping jack that she only nodded ned led nancy to one of the camps jeeps the top was down so nancy zipped up her jacket before climbing in during the twentyminute drive nancy told ned everything that had happened since shed last seen him she mentioned the turkowers the attack on the road and how shed found the linen service driver bound and gagged in his van ned was appalled to learn how close nancy had come to being run off the road youve got to be more careful nan he said anxious ly i dont know what id do if anything happened to you she felt a sudden glow dont worry i know what im doing she told him and anyway what about you im not the one who got himself knocked out hows your head today ned lilted one hand from the wheel to touch the back of his head where it was bandaged its still there he joked i can take this bandage off tomorrow though i hope youve been taking it easy are you kidding he exclaimed we have to wrap up everything by saturday ive been going like crazy since daybreak we all have he pulled the jeep onto an embankment and parked come on he said pocketing the keys from here we walk they crossed the road and made their way up the path mammoth hot springs is a twentyfoot high stack of limestone with one side cut away by erosion ned told her and its gorgeous look nancy gasped in delight as they cleared the trees and she saw steaming water flowing softly down a series of stone terraces that looked like giant multicolored steps near the top the stones were pure white but farther down they were splashed with red brown pink and tan at the top the water is so hot that nothing can live on the stones ned told her but the water cools off as it flows downward allowing algae to grow on the lower terraces thats why those ledges are so many different colors its beautiful nancy exclaimed i wanted to be sure you saw this he said putting his arm around her waist but im afraid i have to get right back to camp you cant imagine how much work we still have to do after another long look at the limestone terraces they reluctantly headed back to the car hows the case going nancy ned asked as he drove back to the campsite im making some progress but not a lot she said ive got too many suspects anyone could have taken the key from under the rock by the command post which means i have to consider outsiders like piker and richard ned nodded well if the key was stolen professor trainey obviously didnt do it hes got one of his own nancy remained silent for a moment then told ned the news about the grant extension he looked crushed dan didnt say a word about it he began i guess hes too upset its awful i know nancy said carefully and im afraid ive still got to watch the professor he must be pretty desperate for money now neds knuckles whitened as he gripped the wheel tighter thats ridiculous professor trainey is the last person on earth whod get involved in poaching marmotsno matter how hard up he is he said indignantly nancy took a deep breath try to see it objectively hes got a strong motive and he has complete access to the equipment i cant rule him out on your sayso ned was silent for a long time as he pulled into the parking area he finally spoke im beginning to wish id never asked you to help some help doesnt the poor guy have enough problems just trying to get this part of the project completed by saturday if you cant manage to leave dan trainey alone youd better just turn around and go back to river heights nancys anger spoke for her i dont think you want this case solved youre more inter ested in protecting your precious professor and not offending dear jennifer than you are in finding out whos been poaching marmots at least jennifer pays attention to what i say ned retorted hotly nancy knew even as the words rose to her lips that she was going to regret them she couldnt stop herself though is jennifer will ing to shut her eyes to the truth just because you tell her to she demanded then all i can say ned nickerson is that the two of you deserve each other chapter nine if thats the way you feel i guess i know what to do about it ned jumped out of the jeep and stomped away nancy sat still what had ned meant did he want to break up she started to follow him up to the campsite but then checked her steps maybe she should wait a bit to give him a chance to cool off in the meantime she decided to talk to bess nancy found her at feeding station strok ing the injured marmot through the bars of its cage oh nancy bess said look at spike isnt he adorable her blue eyes sparkled with enthusiasm in spite of the way she felt nancy managed a faint smile spike i call him that because of the way his fur stands up around his head bess explained look jack bandaged spikes leg while i held him the little guy didnt even try to bite me so how did things go with ned bess asked glancing at her then she quickly added uh oh not so well huh no nancy said she gave bess a full account of their most recent argument includ ing their parting words that doesnt sound good bess replied frowning but you dont really think that ned and jennifer i dont know what to think nancy said theyve been together every day for two and a half weeks now but im sorry i said what i dideven if i meant every word of it nancy heard footsteps hoping it was ned she spun around eagerly it was professor trainey she couldnt help letting out a sigh of disappointment trainey nodded to her and gave bess a distracted glance then bent down to peer inside the cage this must be the little fellow jack told me about he said hes so cute bess announced maybe in my next life ill come back as a marmot trainey actually smiled at herit was the first time nancy had seen him happy bess turned to nancy and said come on lets go check out a few sights while the lights still good well have plenty of time to eat dinner and change before the square dance nancy sighed and said ill probably skip the dance bess gave her a sharp glance then replied we can discuss that later right now what do you say to a waterfall without waiting for an answer bess hooked her arm in nancys to lead her down to the car after a few minutes of driving nancy said bess i think somebodys following us a dark blue cars been right behind us the whole time all at once the car pulled off at a scenic overlookso much for that nancy said with a laugh i guess im getting paranoid bess reached over to touch her shoulder nancy she said in a tentative voice are you positive that the professor is involved in the poaching positive of course not nancy replied surprised by the question i dont have evi dence to prove it either way brad says he saw him just before his accidentbut he wasnt positive and then there was that phi beta kappa key then he is your chief suspect well nancy said slowly no one is in a better position to set up a poaching operation than he is what happens if we dont find the missing marmots bess asked or if more of them disappear i guess the study will be ruinedand so will the professors career nancy answered so poaching and selling marmots wouldnt exactly solve his problem bess went on in some ways it would only make it worse nancy nodded i see what you mean bess nancys thoughts were churning was she focusing too hard on trainey in that case she owed ned an apologyif she could ever get him to listen to it she slowed the car down theres a sign for the falls she announced after finding a spot in the crowded parking area nancy and bess followed a sawdust covered path through the woods as they walked they heard a low persistent rumble in the distance when they emerged from the trees at the base of the falls the sound was overwhelming bess tapped nancys arm nancy turned and saw her friends lips moving but couldnt hear anything above the roar of the water bess pointed up the path and raised an eyebrow nancy nodded and followed her friend to an observation platform perched a dozen feet above the river just beyond the reach of the spray she craned her neck to peer up at the top where the water cascaded over a ridge of red and yellow volcanic rock the constant mo tion of the water made her feel a little dizzy so she clutched the railing for support bess leaned her head close to nancys would you like the binoculars she shouted holding them out nancy took them and could see the individual droplets of water splashing into the river along the banks bright wild flowers grew a large group of sightseers jostled onto the platform behind nancy two middleaged women pushed up and flanked her as her gaze swept farther down the riverbank she noticed a man with black hair frowning she focused the binoculars to get a clearer image she let out a gasp because she was looking at dan trainey who was holding a marmot trap nancy focused in tighter and realized that trainey was talking to someone who was part ly hidden by a tree trunk all she could make out were the other persons hands gesturing to trainey she wanted to get a better view so she started edging her way along the railing she had almost reached the comer of the platform when someone shouted look a redtailed hawk as the crowd on the platform surged for ward nancy felt someone put both hands on her back and give her a powerful shove a moment later she was falling over the rail into the swirling river below chapter ten nancy gasped as she hit the icy water she had just enough time to fill her lungs and clamp her mouth shut before the river swirled over her she fought her way to the surface and tried to make it to the nearest bank but the raging current pulled her downstream as an eddy spun her around she got one last glimpse of the platform she had just been pushed from and saw bess frantically making her way through the stunned crowd trying to reach the riverbank the current tumbled her again pushing her into a somersault nancy flailed her arms wildly and managed to keep her head up but she didnt know how much longer she could hold on downstream a boulder rose up above the surface about half a dozen feet from shore if only she could get to it she thought she might have a chance of saving herself nancy put all the energy and determination she had into powerful strokes and kicks just as she was sure she couldnt keep it up any longer the rock was right in front of her she wrapped her arms around it and took a deep breath nancy over here startled she looked over and saw gerald turkower standing on the riverbank near her hang on he shouted cautiously stepping off the bank he inched forward the water swirling around his knees now then leaned forward and stretched out his hand nancy reached out and grasped it gerald steadied himself then reeled nancy in to the bank as if she were one of those cutthroat trout he had talked about at lunch nancys legs were numb and wouldnt hold her up thanks she said to gerald through chattering teeth nancy are you all right bess demanded running up cccold was all nancy could manage gerald took off his fleecelined leather jacket and draped it around nancys shoulders bess turned to him where did you come from she asked curiously his eyes flickered i was in the woods taking pictures nancy looked sharply at him and struggled to find her voice was anybody with you she asked after a second gerald shook his head come on nancy ill help you to your car you need to get in and turn the heater on full blast how did you happen to fall in he asked as they walked i didnt she replied somebody pushed me what geralds face registered shock are you sure couldnt you just have been jostled nancy shook her head i distinctly felt two hands shoving against my back it was no accident take my word for it did you see anything bess no im sorry bess replied on the verge of tears i was lookingat the falls dont worry about it nancy said you had no reason to think somebody was going to push me in as they reached the car gerald told nancy to go back to the hotel and take a hot shower ill drive nan bess offered you relax nancy gave bess the keys then thanked gerald again for rescuing her im glad i was there to help he replied holding the door for her bess turned on the heater and soon nancy stopped shivering it was a man who pushed me she said as i went over the railing i got an impression of his hands they were too big and hairy to belong to a woman oh bess nancy said interrupting herself your binoc ulars they must have fallen into the river with me im so sorry do you think i care about some old binoc ulars when i just watched you nearly drown bess scolded as bess turned into the hotel parking lot she continued who could have pushed you i dont know i just dont know in fact i dont know what to think anymore a large shiny bus was stopped in front of the hotel entrance people were spilling out of it onto the sidewalk look nancy bess said excitedly point ing out the bus which said randy dean pro ductions do you think randys with them she asked nancy smiled i doubt if a big star like randy dean would arrive on a bus she said hes probably coming by private helicopter i guess youre right bess said parking the car come on lets get you inside and warm nancys legs felt like lead as she climbed the steps to the hotel lobby all i want to do is lie down in a warm tub and soak for a month or two she announced as bess unlocked the door to their room bess gave her a concerned look are you sure you dont want to see a doctor im sure nancy replied firmly after a hot bath and a little rest ill be as good as new at besss urging the girls had dinner in their room as the waiter took away the tray bess gave nancy a close look and said you look a lot better you may not be up for an evening of square dancing but at least you can sit and watch you really think i ought to go nancy asked bess was now standing in front of the mir ror smoothing the waist of her kneelength denim skirt you want to see ned dont you of course i do nancy replied then paused but i dont know what to say to him bess spun around went to nancy and sat beside her on the bed first youll tell him youre sorry she stated flatly then youll say that you love him then hell take you for a moonlight drive bess giggled and im not going to say what happens after that nancy shook her head sadly i only wish it could be that easy bess gave nancy a hug stop worrying its going to be fine while nancy pulled on a fullskirted blue corduroy dress bess went on i talked to jack while you were napping hell meet us in the lobby at eight us nancy repeated well sure bess said this is a group event you know not a date when they reached the head of the stairs bess began searching through her purse i forgot my compact she said ive got to go back okay nancy said ill meet you in the lobby jack in worn but perfectly fitting jeans and a red plaid shirt was standing near the foot of the stairs he saw nancy coming and gave her a warm smile i called bess after you got back to the hotel and she told me what happened he said concerned are you all right good as new nancy said bess will be down in a minute she took in the transformed lobby all the furniture had been cleared away from the central area and a small stage had been set up near the windows paper lanterns dangled from the log rafters and bales of hay had been placed along the walls they did a great job of decorating this place didnt they jack said and led the way to a table at the edge of the dance floor im glad you felt well enough to come ive been really looking forward to the dance he added with a glance full of meaning so has bess nancy replied pointedly as she spotted her friend coming down the stairs jack sprang to his feet as bess approached hey you look terrific bess blushed becomingly and threw in a little curtsy the other tables were filling up two men and a woman in matching shirts climbed up on the stage and started tuning a guitar fiddle and string bass a woman in a fringed leather vest joined the trio on stage and picked up a microphone okay folks she said were going to start out real easy this evening you dont need a partner for this one dont be shy just form two long lines gents on the left and ladies on the right the name of the tune is rabbit in the peapatch come on you two jack urged springing up as the band launched into the rollicking tune nancy saw ned and jennifer come in the door jennifer was pulling ned toward the two lines of dancers as he passed ned spotted nancy and smiled at her tentatively then the dance started and nancy was too busy following the callers instructions to pay attention to ned this is fun bess exclaimed breathlessly when the first number ended nancy smiled but her eyes were now search ing for ned there he was she thought near the stage he was looking around too for her taking a deep breath nancy crossed the room hi ned she said he didnt say a word only took her hand and led her off to the far side of the fireplace they turned to face each other nancy could hear the music start for the next dance but the only thing that mattered now was ned he was staring down at the floor she was about to say something when he spoke up i really lost it this afternoon he said his brown eyes shining im sorry nan you know i didnt mean those things i said of course i do nancy responded i said things i didnt mean too and im sorry i really do understand the way you feel about professor trainey its just that its just that youre too good a detective not to follow up on all the evidence you find no matter where it leads he finished and i wouldnt want you any different nancy put her arms around his neck oh nedim so glad you understand she pulled his head down to hers and their lips met in a kiss that lasted a long time when they parted ned held her close and ran his fingers through her hair why dont we get our coats and go for a drive he said breathlessly its a beautiful night id love it nancy replied they were walking past the alcove that held the house phones when ned squeezed her elbow he put his finger to his lips and pulled her back out of sight gerry its me nancy recognized profes sor traineys voice she strained to make out the words yes i know she heard the professor say into the phone it cant be helped late tomorrow night yes the camp should be quiet no junior detectives to get in our way chapter eleven nancy heard trainey hang up and then watched him walk away ned was slumped against the wall his eyes filled with misery he stared at her you were right about the professor all along the bitterness in his voice surprised nancy her heart ached for him im sorry ned she said slipping her arms around him i kept hoping it wasnt him but junior detectives ned spat out and i kept telling you how much he respected and cared about his students he thinks were a joke he must be pretty desperate nancy pointed out i dont think he would have gotten involved if it werent for his money problems and lets face itif he is involved our investigation must really be getting in his way neds eyes widened if of course hes involved you heard what he said hes plan ning something for tomorrow night and he was talking to turkower nancy remained impassive ive got to admit that surprises me she began slowly after what gerald did today to save me i was starting to think he was okay ned was obviously confused and nancy realized that she hadnt told him about her dip into the river she took a deep breath and told the whole story gerald pulled me out she concluded i just cant believe that someone i admired so much could be involved in something so awful ned shook his head trainey is such a hypocrite nancy stepped back look ned i dont have any real proof against the professor just what brad said so lets not jump to conclusions what i really need to do is catch the poachers in the act and it sounds like i might be able to do that tomorrow night ned brightened a little are you still up for that drive he asked i know i am im sick of thinking about this mess ill run upstairs for my jacket nancy replied when she came back down dressed for the outdoors she waved goodbye to bess who was dancing in a square with jack her friend gave her a big grin then nancy went out to the parking lot it was quite chilly and she was glad to see that ned had put the top up feel like looking at the moon from the shore of yellowstone lake he asked her softly as he started the jeep on an impulse nancy leaned over and kissed him on the cheek he reached over and squeezed her hand will you forgive me for being so pigheaded i already have ned theyd just turned onto the parkway that ran beside the lake when nancy said ned look somebodys in trouble parked on the opposite shoulder was a low slung italian sports car the driver was stand ing with a flashlight pointed under the raised hood ned pulled over and then carefully turned around so he could light up the sports car he leaned out and called need help the driver moving toward them was very familiar they had both seen that face on countless posters and cds is that who i think it is ned said to nancy nancy studied the mans liquid brown eyes and curly honeycolored hair it is its ran dy dean hi there randy stopped next to neds door and leaned over to peer into the window thanks for coming to my rescue you have car trouble ned asked the rock star shrugged it looks that way i went over a big bump a while back and heard a loud thump then about half a mile back the engine started sputtering now its stopped do you know anything about cars we both know a little ned replied we can take a look if youd like great randy backed away and ned and nancy got out of the jeep he held his hand out to ned im randy dean ned grinned yeah we figured that out im ned nickerson and this is nancy drew hi nancy she was surprised at how personable and open randy seemed ned reached for randys flashlight clicked it on and peered under the hood nancy joined him they poked around under the hood for a few minutes then ned said i dont know whats wrong let me see if i can start it ned climbed into the drivers seat but when he turned the key in the ignition the engine only coughed and sputtered nancy leaned inside and looked at the array of gauges on the dashboard did you know youre out of gas randy frowned thats impossible i filled the tank just an hour ago ned got down on the ground and shone the flashlight under the car youve got a leak in your fuel line he reported it must have happened when you hit that bump all your gas has leaked out he said getting up and slapping his palms against his jeans ned offered to take randy to the hotel the rock star transferred his luggage from the tiny trunk of the sports car to the jeep and climbed into the backseat next to it i read a magazine article about you the other night nancy said casually it men tioned that you collect whistling marmots i used to have quite a few of them randy admitted they make fun pets but i dont collect them anymore why not nancy asked i realized how wrong it is to take animals out of the wild he replied earnestly in fact thats why im here im doing a tv program on the importance of protecting wild animals and their habitats would you guys like to come watch us film wed love to nancy promptly replied do you think i could bring a friend too shes a big fan of yours ned pulled into the hotel parking lot of course you can randy said ill write a note to the production crew as soon as i get upstairs thanks for everything i would have had to sit out there all night glad we could help ned replied he gave randy a hand carrying his luggage into the lobby while nancy parked the jeep the square dance was still going on as nancy and ned found a quiet spot and settled down on a couch on the far side of the big room i keep thinking about that phone call ned said you think the turkowers are the buyers it seems that way what do you think theyre arranging for tomorrow night he asked my hunch is that traineys going to turn over the marmots hes already captured to the turkowers ned acted surprised you think the animals are still in the park yes i do nancy said if they werent why would the turkowers be hanging around and ill bet theyre being kept somewhere fairly close to the campsite too so whats our next move we have to keep our eyes on the turkowers and traineyand im still interested in piker and richard it could be that the professor hired them to do the rough work she specu lated but the main thing is its obvious that this whole case is centered at your camp we cant hope to solve it if im always somewhere else i think its time bess and i move to the campsite so you and bess are going to camp ned grinned id love to be there when you break the news to her nancy grimaced do you have any idea what we can do about equipment well need a tent and sleeping bags at least there are outfitters in west yellowstone and jackson that sell camping gear but why not ask martin robbins at the ranger station i bet he could lend you what you need good idea she said he put his arm around nancys shoulders and she settled back against him im glad youre moving to the camp he continued softly having you so near will be the only bright spot in this whole awful situation i cant believe that you actually met randy dean bess exclaimed thats too awesome whats he like nancy yawned the morning sun was streaming through the window really nice bess he acts like a regular guy but youll have a chance to meet him nancy said hes staying right here in the hotel and he invited us to come watch him making his tv special i hope we can what do you mean you hope we can bess demanded wild horses couldnt stop me nancy smiled i dont know about wild horses but we are here on an investigation remember bess stared at her aghast then immediately brightened oh well solve it in plenty of time she proclaimed listen bess nancy said as she ran a brush through her hair i think the missing marmots are being shipped out tonight she told her friend about the phone call i know youre not going to like this she continued slowly but we need to move to the campsite to watch the situation more closely oh no bess wailed leave the hotel just when randy dean arrives and move into a cold tent ill die oh come on wheres your sense of adven ture nancy asked lightly besides if im right that tonight is the night it wont be for long wellokay bess said gloomily ill do it but dont expect me to enjoy it after breakfast im going to head over to the ranger station to talk to martin robbins maybe he can assign some rangers to patrol the campsite tonight ned also thought he might have a tent and a couple of sleeping bags we can borrow nancy said bess dusted powder on her nose then frowned at her image in the mirror what about me she asked i want you to track down the turkowers nancy said see if you can find out what theyre up to today ill pick you up here when i come back from seeing robbins and we can go out to the campsite together as she walked toward her car nancy no ticed a piece of paper tucked under the wind shield wiper it might be a circular of some sort she thought but she had a hunch it wasnt distinctly uneasy she unfolded the paper the message was short and to the point mind your own business nancy drew mar mots arent the only things that can disap pear chapter twelve nancy stared at the note it had been written in large square letters with a red marker on a piece of computer paper it resem bled the paper they were using at the campsite but shed have to compare it to be sure still with the key to the command post missing that hardly narrowed things down she leaned against the side of the car and thought the poachers were obviously desper ate to get her off the case theyd tried to put her out of commission twice the day before and now this note shed planned to watch her main suspects closely but it made her un easy to think that they had their eyes on her too nancy put the threatening note in her pock et got into the car and started for the ranger station as she drove she found herself fre quently checking the rearview mirror but she didnt see any sign that she was being followed when she entered martin robbinss office he was standing at the big wall map of yellow stone with a sheaf of papers in his hand he turned and said hello nancy what brings you here i wanted to fill you in on whats been hap pening with the case she said joining him at the map as she recited everything beginning with the incident at the falls and ending with the conversation shed overheard between trainey and gerald turkower martins frown deep ened youve been busy and it looks like youre making progress flushing these charac ters out he crossed his arms and said slowly but from what you say youve havent got enough proof for me to move on he went behind his desk and sat down then gestured toward a chair i know that nancy said sitting down thats why im moving to the emerson camp site today from what trainey said on the phone i think the missing marmots are going to be shipped out tonight and im pretty sure theyre being kept someplace nearby she replied the ranger nodded he remained silent for a moment then hit the desk with his fist i feel as if my hands are tied on this without more proof i cant justify a fullscale search of the area around the camp but i will beef up the patrol vehicles along that stretch of the high way tonight nancy smiled slightly that will help and that reminds metheres something else you can do for me i was wondering if you have some camping gear i could borrow all my friend bess and i really need is a tent and two sleeping bags robbins chuckled and a couple of air mattresses too believe me otherwise youll be so sore after one night that you wont be able to walk let me think i know i have a couple of sleeping bags here but i may have to call around to get you a tent and anyway im not sure its such a great idea these people have already shown how ruthless they are i know that nancy replied grimly thats why i have to stop them now robbins rubbed his chin thoughtfully fi nally he said well all right but on one conditionyou call me the second anything starts to go down i dont want to take any chances i understand nancy told him he made a call one of the rangers over at tower junction has a tent he can lend you hell be passing by here in half an hour so hell drop it off okay great nancy replied thanks a lot i guess ill go get bess and drop her by the campsite then come back she started to get up then sank back down in her seat theres one more thing youve got two park maintenance men named rich ard and piker i saw them talking to the turkowers thats just one of the things that makes me suspicious of them how well do you know them martin leaned back in his chair and gazed toward the ceiling if you mean personally i hardly know them at all he finally said as far as their work goes no complaints about them nancy looked at martin earnestly i know this is slightly irregular but could i please see their personnel files martin frowned im sorry nancy those files are confidential oh of course i understand nancy re plied i wouldnt dream of asking you to do something thats against the rules but you have the right to consult their files dont you of course i do martin said and if you looked through them and no ticed anything that might be important for me to know it would be only natural to mention it wouldnt it a slow smile spread across his lips thats so he said getting up and crossing to a bank of gray metal file cabinets he scanned the labels on the drawers then opened one near the bottom and pulled out two olivecolored hanging file folders here we are he said richard geismar and piker slattery he opened the first of the files and glanced through it next he looked at the second one thats funny he said these two guys both grew up in ashland idaho thats a little town about forty miles west of the park they were bom in the same year too he flipped back and forth between the two files odd he continued their job records are practically identical would you mind if i check one or two of their references nancy asked id need to use your phone i think that would be all right martin said he grabbed a scratch pad and scribbled a couple of names and addresses on it then passed it over here are the most recent references nancy dialed but the first number martin gave her was disconnected she tried the next one hopper and wade construction a polite voice said may i help you nancy put on her most professional voice i hope so im calling from the national park service in yellowstone she gave martin an apologetic look but he just grinned she turned her attention back to the phone telling the woman that richard and piker were look ing for jobs and had listed hopper and wade as a reference gee im sorry but i dont recognize the names the woman said just a minute let me punch them into our computer nancy held her breath as the woman put her on hold finally she heard a click over the line im sorry but we dont have a record of anyone with either of those names are you sure you have the right company yes nancy replied well thanks very much she hung up richard and piker lied on their applications she told martin thats enough to get them fired its strange we usually check references martin said but it doesnt prove that theyre poachers only liars come on ill get those sleeping bags and air mattresses for you they loaded the gear into the trunk then martin said ill see you later and went back inside at the hotel nancy found bess sitting in the lobby wearing a blue workshirt and wellcut blue denim overalls im all ready to go camping she announced at least as ready as ill ever be whats with the turkowers the desk clerk told me they went off for a daylong hike through the grand canyon of the yellowstone bess replied dutifully i wonder if thats where they really are nancy said then explained that shed gotten mattresses and sleeping bags from martin but had to go back for the tent ill drop you off at the campsite first she went on a little tensely i want you to keep track of the professor fifteen minutes later nancy watched bess trudge up the path to the campsite two sleep ing bags slung over her shoulder and a suitcase in her left hand back at the ranger station nancy found a very grim martin robbins i checked out the other references those clowns gave he re ported every one of them a fake theyre out of here first thing monday morning whether you turn up anything against them or not my next job will be to find out how they got through the hiring process in the first place the system is supposed to prevent this kind of thing this place is deserted bess told nancy back at the campsite everyone went off to the feeding stations to pack up what about trainey nancy asked thats the weird thing bess replied i went up to the command post a while ago and noticed the professor riming through a stack of photos when he got to one of them he got livid i mean his face turned bright red and he stalked off to his tent then hopped into a jeep and blew out of here she stared at her friend what do you think it means i have no idea nancy replied jack acted strange too bess continued frowning i asked him to help me feed spike but he brushed me off i dont understand it just last night he was saying he could get really serious about me and today youd think i had the plague i dont know quite how to say this nancy said slowly but jack has been more or less flirting with me too really besss eyes grew round with sur prise nancy nodded bess was silent for a long time tears welled up in her eyes but she shook her head and angrily wiped them away finally she said you must think im a real idiot falling for such a total phony he was faking his interest in me the whole time wasnt he nancy shook her head hes very convinc ingshe said and maybe he is sincere in a way he may be one of those guys who doesnt feel good about himself unless hes got some body falling in love with him so he convinces himself that the lines hes passing out are true bess straightened up then put on a smile believe me from now on im staying away from him come on bess nancy said to change the subject this is the perfect opportunity to search traineys tent bess became alarmed but he might come back at any time you can stand outside and keep watch wellokay bess said reluctantly the two girls walked across the campground that was half packed already nancy looked at the piles of boxes with a feeling of urgency she had to get to the bottom of things before time ran out while bess stood guard in front of traineys tent nancy slipped inside there was a sleep ing bag spread out atop an army cot a single wellworn suitcase and a folding table with a laptop computer nancy knelt down and opened the suitcase but all it contained were clean neatly folded clothes she turned her attention to a few papers next to the computer which turned out to be notes for a report on the project traineys green coat and floppy green hat were lying on the cot nancy picked them up and felt through the coat pockets in the inside pocket was an envelope that contained a single photograph it was too dark to make it out she put the coat and hat back the way they had been and hurried outside what is it bess demanded did you find something yes this picture in the bright sunshine it was easy to distinguish the figure of a person in a green coat and green hat walking out of the hut by feeding station the hat and coat were traineys bess flashed her friend a puzzled look whats so important about this picture nancy pointed look at the date and time at the bottom bess read then counted on her fingers nancy she exclaimed that was just be fore the propane stove exploded that proves it trainey caused brads accident chapter thirteen this picture is proof nancy bess re peated trainey had to have tampered with the stove im not positive bess nancy said the pictures too blurry it could be anybody wear ing that hat and coat and if it is trainey why would he keep such an incriminating picture why not destroy it bess gave the photograph back to nancy i dont know and besides nancy continued it seems likely that this is the picture that made trainey so upset what if this isnt trainey when he saw it he must have realized that somebody was trying to frame him he may even have figured out who nancy scrutinized the photograph the flop py hat and turnedup collar of the coat made an effective disguise all that showed of the persons face was one cheek and part of the nose frustrated she was about to put the photo away when she noticed a small white spot on the persons nose she studied it closely but couldnt tell what it was it could just be a speck of dust on the lens of the enlarger she slipped the photo into her pocket just as she heard ned jennifer and alicia come down the path from the feeding station welcome to camp marmotville alicia called thanks nancy replied hows it going weve got the packing under control jen nifer said hey you havent seen my dad have you he left here in a jeep about fortyfive minutes ago bess reported jennifer frowned huh he was supposed to meet us up the hill but he never showed up i think ill check the other feeding stations maybe a problem came up she walked off toward the road are those maintenance guys around to day nancy asked i havent seen them ned replied what about jack nancy went on is he still at the feeding station no he came through about an hour ago but said he had paperwork to do ned ex plained im sure hell show up in a little while so you guys moved out here just in time for our big cookout alicia said smiling cookout bess asked with interest our farewell dinner alicia explained to celebrate the end of stage two of the study im about to make potato salad anyone want to help bess gave nancy an inquiring look then said sure im game as they walked away nancy told ned about richard and pikers references can you get away i want to check those guys out sure ned said ill just take the time im a little concerned about professor trainey now ned nancy said as she started the car and headed for the western entrance of the park she told ned about the photograph she found in traineys tent what if ive been wrong about him if he knew who was in that photo and went to confront him he could be in danger do you think we should go back and look for him ned asked nancy shook her head lets leave that to jennifer for now the narrow road led down into a valley and across a railroad track into a town she turned onto the main street it was lined with two story wood frame buildings and resembled the set for a western just past the business district was a white building with a green slate roof the sign out front identified it as the town hall nancy parked and they walked in the ashland police department occupied one big room on the ground floor a husky man of about thirty was sitting at one of the two desks the name plate on the desk said chief tucker as nancy and ned approached the counter separating the waiting area from the office he raised his head with a friendly smile hi folks can i help you nancy introduced herself and ned and ex plained that they were investigating a poach ing scheme in yellowstone park you can call chief ranger robbins to check us out she added thanks ill do that he swiveled to face the telephone and spoke for a couple of min utes then turned back to them well now nancy and ned what can i do for you we need information about two men named richard geismar and piker slattery nancy said according to their files they grew up in ashland tucker frowned those names dont ring a bell but ive only been here three years he went over to the file cabinets along the back wall weve got files here that go back pretty far he remarked as he flipped through one of the drawers if either of these guys were ever involved in anything illegal it should show in this drawer ah here we go he returned to his desk with two manila folders and began to leaf through them well well he said definitely not model citizens vandalism grand theft auto breaking and entering arson they did time for that one wow ned said it looks like you were right to suspect them nancy tucker showed her a photo of a much young er piker thats one of them she confirmed you watch your step with these fellows tucker said you know who could tell you all about them margery milliken the principal at the consolidated high school before she retired go down to the end of the street and turn right he said gesturing its a white house ill call to tell her youre coming nancy thanked tucker for his help and she and ned returned to the car they found the house easily the woman waiting on the porch steps was wearing a dark skirt and a white blouse her gray hair was twisted up in a french roll a pair of reading glasses dangled from her neck ms drew mr nickerson im margery milliken i understand you want some infor mation about two of my former students come in she motioned them to the sofa now what do you want to know about richard and piker whatever you can tell us nancy replied the woman tightened her lips then shook her head sadly not among my successes im afraid they both had bad records in school but i think they might have straightened out if it hadnt been for jeff barnes he was a year younger than they but there was no question who was the ringleader especially at the end what happened ned asked ms milliken clicked her tongue one night the three of them stole a car when it ran low on gas they broke into a filling station about twenty miles west of here to cover their tracks they set the place on fire but something went wrong jeffs hand was badly burned and of course they were caught richard and piker went to jail but jeff was still a juvenile so he was given a suspended sentence the barnes family moved away right after that and rich ard and piker have never shown their faces around here since thank you so much nancy said they chatted a little while longer then nancy and ned told ms milliken goodbye and returned to the car ned offered to drive nancy was certain now that richard and piker were involved in the poaching but they didnt sound like the organizers who then if that jeff barnes were around hed be a perfect candidate by the time they got back to camp the sun was low in the sky preparations for the cook out were in full swing ned alicia asked could you bring that big table from the shed jack said hed do it this morning but he never showed up sure ned said and headed off is your father back nancy asked jenni fer jennifer was obviously worried no and i cant understand it where can he be nancy wanted to say something reassuring but she was worried herself when darkness fell nancy helped ned build a fire while bess set out plates napkins and bowls of cole slaw and potato salad the hamburgers and franks tasted delicious but professor traineys absence spoiled the good time people kept glancing over their shoulders into the surrounding darkness then inching closer to the fire maybe jack and the professor went off together and had car trouble alicia sug gested jennifer shook her head jack has a two way radio in his car she pointed out all rangers do he could have called the station and had somebody come by with a message nancys thoughts spun what if her original idea that trainey was the head of the poach ers was right after all and jack had discovered it trainey and his gang might be holding jack captive to keep him from interfering with the last phase of the operation as the party broke up nancy took ned and bess aside we have to take turns keeping watch tonight she told them checking her watch its just eleven ill take the first two hours then ned can spell me bess nodded and quickly ducked into the tent leaving nancy and ned alone in the moonlight should i stay with you ned asked it might be safer nancy put her arms around his neck id love you to but you might distract me from my job besides you need to rest before your shift all right be careful nan ned whispered he gave her a lingering kiss then went to his tent nancy watched him go with a sense of regret and loneliness she crossed the campground to the spot she had picked out earlier next to a large lodgepole pine it gave her a clear view of the campsite but kept her hidden in deep shadows the camp grew quiet in the distance an owl hooted somewhere closer an animal crept stealthily through the underbrush nancy shiv ered and pulled the zipper of her jacket up higher ghostly wisps of white fog began to drift by nancy shifted her position folded her arms tight against her chest and scanned the camp as the minutes ticked by she felt her eyes closing so she decided to walk around to keep from falling asleep she circled the camp ground then walked halfway down the road that led to the highway stopping just before the last bend she saw a truck move by its empty rear end rattling she tensed it seemed odd to be traveling through the park at that hour without stop ping to think she raced down the road reach ing the highway just in time to see the truck turn into the woods about a quarter of a mile east it looked to nancy to be near the spot where piker and richard had been working on the new trail she jogged to the place where the truck had disappeared realizing that there was a dirt access road there the maintenance men had probably used it to move supplies into their work area nancy turned in and kept running shed covered about a half a mile when she saw the truck parked up ahead she slowed and made her way up to it cautiously she heard a low voice on the far side of the cab it was richard a flashlight clicked on illuminating the figures of the two mainte nance men hurry up piker said weve got a lot of work to do yeah richard replied im not looking forward to carrying all those cages nancys spine stiffened that meant the marmots had to be stashed someplace near by the two men began moving forward nancy followed at a safe distance the access road ended about twenty feet beyond the truck dwindling into a path that wound up a hill side her calf muscles were feeling the strain of the climb and she began to notice that the trees were thinning out nancy spied a cabin to the right of the trail piker unlocked the door and the two of them went inside nancy circled the cabin and saw a small window in the back she crept up to it pulled herself up and peered in through the dusty pane her breath caught in her throat lining the walls were dozens of cages of marmots nancy could hear piker that tranquilizer is strong theyll be under for a few hours plenty of time to get them all into the truck and out of here how much longer do we have to hang around here richard asked piker shrugged until the boss gets back he said he wanted to nose around the camp to make sure the kiddies were all in bed nancy let herself down from the window any minute the boss could come back she had to get out of sight she was turning to go when two strong hands grabbed her and forced her arms up behind her back chapter fourteen nancys captor hustled her around to the front of the cabin kicked the door open and shoved her through she stumbled into the light and fell to the floor piker and richard spun around startled weve got a visitor a familiar voice an nounced nancy looked up jack billings was standing next to the open door a revolver in his hand pointed toward her she sat up cautiously as he approached the gun was about two feet from her face when she noticed the bum scar on his hand just then everything fell into place hello jeff she said as calmly as she could didnt anyone ever tell you that keep ing the same initials when you take an alias is one of the oldest mistakes in the book you have been doing some investigating havent you he said nancy swallowed she desperately needed to play for time if she could stall the three of them ned might come searching for her or one of the patrol cars martin robbins had assigned to the area might check up the access road your poaching plan was pretty clever she told jack how did you come up with it jack leaned back against the doorjamb but kept the gun pointed at nancy i saw an article a while back about randy dean and his marmots it said that people were paying a lot of money for them nancy nodded and he continued apparent ly glad to have an appreciative audience a little later i was sorting the mail at the ranger station when i came across a letter from trainey about the marmot study i saw my chance right away and volunteered to serve as liaison to the project and you managed to get richard and piker hired as maintenance men in spite of their forged references nancy guessed you hear that guys jack said mockingly shes onto you come on enough chitchat richard said lets pack up and get out of here anger flashed across jacks handsome face im the one who makes the decisions around here he growled get those cages into the truck ill make our guest comfortable while piker and richard started carrying cages out of the cabin he took some rope and tied nancys wrists behind her back then tugged her toward a door in the comer of the room hey prof he called shoving it open heres some company for you trainey was sitting on the floor of the small storeroom his hands tied behind his back his face was caked with dried blood from a gash on his forehead are you all right she asked as jack pushed her down beside him he nodded im sorry they got you too he said in a low voice im sorry we got either of you jack cut in i dont like complications i did my best to convince you to stay out of our way but you wouldnt listen so you have to pay the price keep him talking nancy told herself how did you manage to steal so many marmots she asked easy jack bragged i had piker and richard steal some cages then i got a printout of the transmitter signals i knew the counts were done in the afternoon so we started trapping right after dark on tuesday and worked all night we hauled them up here and removed the transmitters long before the col lege crowd was even awake you missed spike nancy commented spike jack spat out that friend of yours is really something she is cute though ive got to give her that nancy wanted to punch him just then piker and richard returned for more cages as they gathered up a second load professor trainey asked why did you try to kill brad jack scowled i didnt he said robbing the scar on the back of his hand all i wanted to do was discourage him so i rigged the stove but you were giving a slide show during the time it was sabotaged nancy said jack gave her a selfsatisfied smile hey thats right i guess i didnt do it after all nancy thought quickly alicia used the stove to make hot chocolate at about six thirty and brad came on duty at seventhirty so the stove had been rigged by then jack leaned back against the door frame youre pretty good nancy but you should have checked that out more the narration for the show was taped i started it then slipped back to the campsite nancy nodded borrowing the professors coat and hat was a nice touch youve got to admit he went on if anyone saw me theyd suspect it was him except for the fact that one of the time lapse cameras caught you leaving the hut trainey said dryly the moment i saw it i realized it was you who had tampered with the stove nancy turned to trainey how i found the picture in your tent but couldnt tell who it was i had an advantage over you nancy trainey explained i remembered that jack had been bitten on the nose by a marmot and wore a bandage for a few days the white spot nancy gasped so thats what it was there was a loud crash outside and jack rushed out the door the moment he was out of sight nancy started struggling against her rope pain shot through her wrists and she could tell she was getting nowhere how did he capture you she asked professor trainey sheer stupidity he replied when i saw that picture i got mad and rushed off to find him i met up with him at feeding station two which is near here he hit me and when i came to i was in this cabin jack returned with piker okay lets go he said and grabbed trainey by the front of his shirt and pulled him to his feet nancy managed to stand up on her own to distract jack she asked were you the one who pushed me off the platform and tried to run me off the road not guilty he replied that was rich ard he knocked out your boyfriend too ned walked in while richard was stealing the tran quilizer youre a real bunch of creeps trainey lashed out calm down professor jack told him i gave you all plenty of warnings i even put a note on nancys windshield why didnt you pay attention its all your own fault okay piker grab that roll of tape and a flashlight where are you taking us nancy asked as jack shoved her and trainey toward the door i want to show you one of yellowstones natural wonders he replied blandly taking the pistol from his belt he and piker forced them to march up the hill behind the cabin while richard walked off toward the truck the fog had thickened even with the flashlight it was impossible to see more than a few yards ahead they reached the crest of the hill and started down at the foot of it nancy stopped abrupt ly just ahead was a large crack in the earth a dark ominous ribbon snaking its way across the ground whats that nancy asked trainey trying to hide the fright she felt it looks like a runoff fissure trainey said every geyser has one its the path the heated water takes after being shot into the air it comes down the side of the geyser cone col lects and runs along the fissure to under ground pools exactly professor jack said while jack held the gun piker taped nancys ankles together then picked her up and wedged her down into the fissure trainey was lowered next to her come on piker jack said weve got to finish loading the truck lets get out of here wait nancy cried but there was no response professor trainey she asked whats going to happen traineys voice was grave if i have my bearings right the water from princess geyser takes this path down the hill he stared at nancy it erupts every two hours or so you mean this fissure could fill up with boiling water soon trainey closed his eyes thats right a sudden hissing noise broke the silence nancy gasped it was the geyser any minute theyd be scalded to death chapter fifteen nancy shut her eyes and concentrated on rubbing the ropes on her wrist against a rough place on the fissure wall was it her imagina tion or could she feel one of them give just a bit besides her trainey groaned she twisted her right arm trying to get added leverage against the rope she was sure that her skin was raw by now the hissing grew louder nancy saw the glitter of reflected moonlight on rushing water below where she was wedged damp steam rose and enveloped her with a desperate yank she managed to pull one hand out of the looped rope then free the other she let the rope fall listen professor ive got my hands free im going to try to climb out then pull you to safety good luck trainey said nancy noticed the rotten egg smell of sul phur her eyes were stinging cautiously she brought her arms around in front of her and pressed her palms against the opposite wall of the fissure then moved her knees up a couple of inches were running out of time trainey gasped the water is rising too quickly i know nancy patiently worked her knees and hands upward her arm and leg muscles threatened to cramp but at last one hand touched the top of the fissure she grabbed hold then quickly twisted swinging her other hand to the other lip just above where her head had been before her lower body could slide down into the crevice she hoisted herself up for a minute her feet dangled dangerously near the bubbling water at the bottom of the fissure then she thrust herself onto the edge and rolled away she took a deep breath tore the tape off her ankles then leaned over to unbind traineys hands and feet the professor was panting by the time shed talked him through the maneuvers that al lowed him to climb out of the fissure we got out just in time trainey said once hed caught his breath he looked back at the crevice the boiling current was halfway up the walls now thanks to you nancy we can talk later nancy said right now weve got to stop that shipment from going out nancy raced up the hill with trainey behind her reaching the crest she abruptly skidded to a stop can you make it back to the campsite she asked trainey nodded good nancy said go get help martin robbins or his men have to be around here somewhere what about you trainey asked im going back to the cabin as the professor veered off in the direction of the campsite nancy crept down the hill toward the dark shape of the cabin she dashed to one side of it and crouched against the wall cautiously she poked her head out richard and piker were on the trail in front of the cabin heading downhill toward the road both carried cages of marmots where was jack her pulse leapt as she heard footsteps be hind her someone was coming nancy stood up and turned to find herself staring into neds eyes he threw his arms around her nancy he whispered are you all right i am now she replied returning his hug how did you find me i was in the woods and ran into the profes sor ned explained weve got to stop that shipment from leav ing nancy said urgently she risked a quick peek in the window her heart sank only a few cages were still inside there was no time to wait for reinforcementstheyd have to act alone follow me to the truck she whis pered to ned they crept quietly around the far side of it now we wait she told ned in a few moments richard and piker came down the hill im glad thats over piker said the two men climbed into the back of the truck nancy and ned raced up slammed the doors shut and pulled the metal latch into place richard and piker began to shout and pound on the door but there was nothing they could do they were trapped drawn by the noise jack came running down the path from the shadows at the edge of the trail ned launched himself toward jack in a flying tackle taken by surprise jack crashed to the ground but recovered quickly and hit ned in the face with his elbow ned recoiled and nancy saw jacks fingers grope at his belt for his revolver he was lifting it when nancy raced over and aimed a karate kick at his wrist jack screamed and fell back ill hold him ned said breathlessly find some rope or something once jack was tied up ned shoved him into the cab of the truck then walked ahead giving hand signals while nancy maneuvered the truck down the trail to the road as they drove up to the campsite the trucks headlights lit up a crowd gathered near the firepit nancy recognized bess trainey ali cia jennifer martin robbins and to her surprise edith and gerald turkower nancy hopped down from the cab as the others raced to the parking area nancy bess cried are you all right i am now nancy smiled and hugged her friend then she turned to martin richard and piker are locked up in the back and heres the man behind the whole scheme ned said triumphantly pulling jack from the cab jack billings i cant believe it martin exclaimed whats a few marmots the parks full of them and i could use the money jack said gerald stepped forward and to nancys astonishment produced a pair of handcuffs ill handle him he said edith and gerry are agents of the us fish and wildlife department trainey remarked bess looked startled what its true gerald untied the rope and snapped the cuffs on jacks wrists dan called us in when the marmot traps began to disap pear professor trainey called you in nancy repeated in surprise sure weve been friends for years edith replied thats why i didnt want you on the case nancy trainey explained i was afraid you might interfere with their investigation be sides look what happened to brad when he tried investigating i didnt want anyone else hurt two park service cars pulled up next to the truck martin pushed jack toward them ill get this bunch into the cruisers nancy turned to gerald and edith your act sure fooled me she said and when i overheard professor trainey calling you from the square dance i was sure that he was the brains behind the poaching scheme professor trainey laughed thatll teach me to let my daughter drag me to dances he said i asked dan to scout around for us today but when we got back from jackson a little while ago we found out that hed vanished im afraid i was out of action trainey said wryly fortunately nancy was on the job edith smiled great detective work nan cy did you know that theres a five thousand dollar reward for catching poachers wow nancy said better start thinking about what to do with it edith went on the next morning nancy was awakened by voices outside her tent bess was gone so nancy knew it had to be fairly late she got up threw on jeans and a sweatshirt combed her hair then stepped out into the sunshine the sight that met her made her gape two large trucks were parked near the camp site from one of them came the rumble of a powerful electrical generator dozens of peo ple were wheeling big blue metal equipment cases rolls of cable and light stands up the path to feeding station nan do you realize whats happening bess ran over to greet her friend randy deans going to shoot his special right here hell be here any minute and im going to meet him if i have to sprain my ankle to do it nancy looked around where is everyone else theyre all up at the feeding station bess explained come on hurry at that moment nancy heard the low throaty growl of a perfectly tuned racing en gine she looked over her shoulder and saw a bright red sports car pulling to a stop in the lot bess she said your prayers are about to be answered bess gasped as randy dean stepped out of his car hey nancy he called good to see you again hi randy nancy replied when the rock star joined them i want you to meet my friend bess marvin randy held out his hand hi bess bess turned pale then red as she took his hand still holding it she gasped out this is just so totally awesome i think youre the best singer ever well thanks randy replied he gently disengaged his hand and glanced up the hill is that the way to the feeding station bess nodded id better get up there my producer will kill me if im late want to come bess just about tripped over her own feet as she moved to randys side at the top of the hill randy sat down on a folding chair while a makeup artist went to work on him dan trainey was inside the enclosure holding a marmot the turkowers ned and the rest of the emerson students were off to one side watching to nancys delight brad was among them hi he grinned when she and bess went over i finally talked them into letting me out of that place nancy smiled and returned his greeting neds told me everything brad went on imagine jack being the mastermind of the whole scheme ned kissed nancy and then put his arm around her shoulders didnt i tell you she was a firstrate detective trainey brought spike over and handed him to bess he had removed the bandage this little fellows ready to be set free he said a stricken look appeared on besss face so soon its time trainey said firmly oh bess turned away from her friends nancy could see she was fighting back tears we have to do it bess she said softly he belongs in the wild randy joined the group i have a great idea he said to bess why dont you release your little marmot as part of my show besss eyes widened me on television randy nodded well release him together itll be a great sequence bess was too stunned to speak then she looked down at herself and shrieked ive got to change my clothes nancy laughed as bess placed spike in his cage turned and ran down the hill to their tent i dont think ive ever seen bess move that quickly she said thanks for everything youve done nan cy trainey said youve helped make this study a success and saved my reputation youre welcome nancy replied what about the last stage of the project trainey sighed that parts not as success ful we can retag the marmots you recovered but unless we can raise more money the study ends right now nancy smiled would five thousand dollars help

his arm around nancys shoulders thanks nan say alicia said with a broad smile may be you and bess could come back in august and help us with the last phase of the study id love to nancy said but i
