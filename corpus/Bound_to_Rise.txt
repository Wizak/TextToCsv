outlaw the young salesman and luke walton chapter i sit up to the table children breakfasts ready the speaker was a woman of middle age not goodlooking in the ordinary acceptation of the term but nevertheless she looked good she was dressed with extreme plainness in a cheap calico but though cheap the dress was neat the children she addressed were six in number varying in age from twelve to four the oldest harry the hero of the present story was a broadshouldered sturdy boy with a frank open face resolute though goodnatured father isnt here said fanny the second child hell be in directly he went to the store and he may stop as he comes back to milk the table was set in the center of the room covered with a coarse tablecloth the breakfast provided was hardly of a kind to tempt an epicure there was a loaf of bread cut into slices and a dish of boiled potatoes there was no butter and no meat for the family were very poor the children sat up to the table and began to eat they were blessed with good appetites and did not grumble as the majority of my readers would have done at the scanty fare they had not been accustomed to anything better and their appetites were not pampered by indulgence they had scarcely commenced the meal when the father entered like his wife he was coarsely dressed in personal appearance he resembled his oldest boy his wife looking up as he entered perceived that he looked troubled what is the matter hiram she asked you look as if something had happened nothing has happened yet he answered but i am afraid we are going to lose the cow going to lose the cow repeated mrs walton in dismay she is sick i dont know whats the matter with her perhaps it is only a trifle she may get over it during the day she may but im afraid she wont farmer hendersons cow was taken just that way last fall and he couldnt save her what are you going to do i have been to elihu perkins and hes coming over to see what he can do for her he can save her if anybody can the children listened to this conversation and young as they were the elder ones understood the calamity involved in the possible loss of the cow they had but one and that was relied upon to furnish milk for the family and besides a small amount of butter and cheese not for home consumption but for sale at the store in exchange for necessary groceries the waltons were too poor to indulge in these luxuries the father was a farmer on a small scale that is he cultivated ten acres of poor land out of which he extorted a living for his family or rather a partial living besides this he worked for his neighbors by the day sometimes as a farm laborer sometimes at odd jobs of different kinds for he was a sort of jack at all trades but his income all told was miserably small and required the utmost economy and good management on the part of his wife to make it equal to the necessity of a growing family of children hiram walton was a man of good natural abilities though of not much education and after half an hours conversation with him one would say unhesitatingly that he deserved a better fate than his handtohand struggle with poverty but he was one of those men who for some unaccountable reason never get on in the world they can do a great many things creditably but do not have the knack of conquering fortune so hiram had always been a poor man and probably always would be poor he was discontented at times and often felt the disadvantages of his lot but he was lacking in energy and ambition and perhaps this was the chief reason why he did not succeed better after breakfast elihu perkins the cow doctor came to the door he was an old man with irongray hair and always wore steelbowed spectacles at least for twenty years nobody in the town could remember ever having seen him without them it was the general opinion that he wore them during the night once when questioned on the subject he laughingly said that he couldnt see to go to sleep without his specs well neighbor walton so the cows sick he said opening the outer door without ceremony yes elihu she looks down in the mouth i hope you can save her i kin tell better when ive seen the critter when youve got through breakfast well go out to the barn ive got through now said mr walton whose anxiety for the cow had diminished his appetite may i go too father asked harry rising from the table yes if you want to the three went out to the small weatherbeaten building which served as a barn for the want of a better it was small but still large enough to contain all the crops which mr walton could raise probably he could have got more out of the land if he had had means to develop its resources but it was naturally barren and needed much more manure than he was able to spread over it so the yield to an acre was correspondingly small and likely from year to year to grow smaller rather than larger they opened the small barn door which led to the part occupied by the cows stall the cow was lying down breathing with difficulty elihu perkins looked at her sharply through his specs what do you think of her neighbor perkins asked the owner anxiously the cow doctor shifted a piece of tobacco from one cheek to the other and looked wise i think the critters nigh her end he said at last is she so bad as that pears like it she looks like farmer hendersons that died a while ago i couldnt save her save my cow if you can i dont know what i should do without her ill do my best but you mustnt blame me if i cant bring her round you see theres this about dumb critters that makes em harder to cure than human beins they cant tell their symptoms nor how they feel and thats why its harder to be a cow doctor than a doctor for humans youve got to go by the looks and looks is deceivin if i could only ask the critter how she feels and where she feels worst i might have some guide to go by not but ive had my luck theres moren one of em ive saved if i do say it myself i know you can save her if anyone can elihu said mr walton who appreciated the danger of the cow and was anxious to have the doctor begin yes i guess i know about as much about them critters as anybody said the garrulous old man who had a proper appreciation of his dignity and attainments as a cow doctor ive had as good success as anyone i know on if i cant cure her you may call her a gone case have you got any hot water in the house ill go in and see ill go father said harry well come right back we have no time to lose harry appreciated the need of haste as well as his father and speedily reappeared with a pail of hot water thats right harry said his father now youd better go into the house and do your chores so as not to be late for school harry would have liked to remain and watch the steps which were being taken for the recovery of the cow but he knew he had barely time to do the chores referred to before school and he was far from wishing to be late there he had an ardent thirst for learning and young as he was ranked first in the district school which he attended i am not about to present my young hero as a marvel of learning for he was not so he had improved what opportunities he had enjoyed but these were very limited since he was nine years of age his schooling had been for the most part limited to eleven weeks in the year there was a summer as well as a winter school but in the summer he only attended irregularly being needed to work at home his father could not afford to hire help and there were many ways in which harry though young could help him so it happened that harry though a tolerably good scholar was deficient in many respects on account of the limited nature of his opportunities he set to work at once at the chores first he went to the woodpile and sawed and split a quantity of wood enough to keep the kitchen stove supplied till he came home again from school in the afternoon this duty was regularly required of him his father never touched the saw or the ax but placed upon harry the general charge of the fuel department after sawing and splitting what he thought to be sufficient he carried it into the house by armfuls and piled it up near the kitchen stove he next drew several buckets of water from the well for it was washing day brought up some vegetables from the cellar to boil for dinner and then got ready for school chapter ii a calamity efforts for the recovery of the cow went on elihu perkins exhausted all his science in her behalf i do not propose to detail his treatment because i am not sure whether it was the best and possibly some of my readers might adopt it under similar circumstances and then blame me for its unfortunate issue it is enough to say that the cow grew rapidly worse in spite of the hotwater treatment and about eleven oclock breathed her last the sad intelligence was announced by elihu who first perceived it the critters gone he said taint no use doin anything more the cows dead repeated mr walton sorrowfully he had known for an hour that this would be the probable termination of the disease still while there was life there was hope now both went out together yes the critters dead said elihu philosophically for he lost nothing by her it was so to be and there want no help for it thats what i thought from the fust but i was willin to try wasnt there anything that could have saved her elihu shook his head decidedly if she could abeen saved i could ave done it he said what i dont know about cow diseases aint wuth knowin everyone is more or less conceited elihus conceit was as to his scientific knowledge on the subject of cows and horses and their diseases he spoke so confidently that mr walton did not venture to dispute him i spose youre right elihu he said but its hard on me yes neighbor its hard on you thats a fact what was she wuth i wouldnt have taken forty dollars for her yesterday forty dollars is a good sum it is to me i havent got five dollars in the world outside of my farm i wish i could help you neighbor walton but im a poor man myself i know you are elihu somehow it doesnt seem fair that my only cow should be taken when squire green has got ten and theyre all alive and well if all his cows should die he could buy as many more and not feel the loss squire greens a close man hes mean enough if he is rich sometimes the richest are the meanest in his case it is true he could give you a cow just as well as not if i was as rich as he id do it i believe you would elihu but theres some difference between you and him maybe the squire would lend you money to buy a cow he always keeps money to lend on high interest mr walton reflected a moment then said slowly i must have a cow and i dont know of any other way but i hate to go to him hes the only man thats likely to have money to lend in town well ill go good luck to you neighbor walton i need it enough said hiram walton soberly if it comes itll be the first time for a good many years well ill be goin as i cant do no more good hiram walton went into the house and a look at his face told his wife the news he brought before his lips uttered it is she dead hiram yes the cows dead forty dollars clean gone he said rather bitterly dont be discouraged hiram its bad luck but worse things might happen such as what why the house might burn down or or some of us might fall sick and die its better that it should be the cow youre right there but though its pleasant to have so many children round we shant like to see them starving they are not starving yet and please god they wont yet awhile some help will come to us mrs walton sometimes felt despondent herself but when she saw her husband affected like a good wife she assumed cheerfulness in order to raise his spirits so now things looked a little more hopeful to him after he had talked to his wife he soon took his hat and approached the door where are you going hiram she asked going to see if squire green will lend me money enough to buy another cow thats right hiram dont sit down discouraged but see what you can do to repair the loss i wish there was anybody else to go to squire green is a very mean man and he will try to take advantage of any need it is better to have a poor resource than none at all well ill go and see what can be done squire green was the rich man of the town he had inherited from his father just as he came of age a farm of a hundred and fifty acres and a few hundred dollars the land was not good and far from productive but he had scrimped and saved and pinched and denied himself spending almost nothing till the little money which the farm annually yielded him had accumulated to a considerable sum then too as there were no banks near at hand to accommodate borrowers the squire used to lend money to his poorer neighbors he took care not to exact more than six per cent openly but it was generally understood that the borrower must pay a bonus besides to secure a loan which added to the legal interest gave him a very handsome consideration for the use of his spare funds so his money rapidly increased doubling every five or six years through his shrewd mode of management and every year he grew more economical his wife had died ten years before she had worked hard for very poor pay for the squires table was proverbially meager and her bills for dress judging from her appearance must have been uncommonly small the squire had one son now in the neighborhood of thirty but he had not been at home for several years as soon as he attained his majority he left the homestead and set out to seek his fortune elsewhere he vowed he wouldnt any longer submit to the penurious ways of the squire so the old man was left alone but he did not feel the solitude he had his gold and that was company enough a time was coming when the two must part company for when death should come he must leave the gold behind but he did not like to think of that putting away the idea as men will unpleasant subjects this was the man to whom hiram walton applied for help in his misfortune is the squire at home he asked at the back door in that household the front door was never used there was a parlor but it had not been opened since mrs greens funeral hes out to the barn said hannah green a niece of the old man who acted as maid of all work ill go out there the barn was a few rods northeast of the house and thither mr walton directed his steps entering he found the old man engaged in some light work good morning squire green good morning mr walton returned the squire he was a small man with a thin figure and a face deep seamed with wrinkles more so than might have been expected in a man of his age for he was only just turned of sixty but hard work poor and scanty food and sharp calculation were responsible for them how are you gettin on asked the squire this was rather a favorite question of his it being so much the custom for his neighbors to apply to him when in difficulties so that their misfortune he had come to regard as his harvests ive met with a loss answered hiram walton you dont say so returned the squire with instant attention whats happened my cow is dead when did she die this morning what was the matter i dont know i didnt notice but that she was welt enough last night but this morning when i went out to the barn she was lying down breathing heavily what did you do i called in elihu perkins and we worked over her for three hours but it wasnt of any use she died half an hour ago i hope it isnt any disease thats catchin said the squire in alarm thinking of his ten it would be a bad job if it should get among mine its a bad job for me squire i hadnt but one cow and shes gone just so just so i spose youll buy another yes i must have a cow my children live on bread and milk mostly then theres the butter and cheese that i trade off at the store for groceries just so just so come into the house neighbor walton the squire guessed his visitors business in advance and wanted to take time to talk it over he would first find out how great his neighbors necessity was and then he accommodated him would charge him accordingly chapter iii hirams motto there was a little room just off the kitchen where the squire had an oldfashioned desk here it was that he transacted his business and in the desk he kept his papers it was into this room that he introduced mr walton set down set down neighbor walton he said well talk this thing over so youve got to have a cow yes i must have one the squire fixed his eyes cunningly on his intended victim and said goin to buy one in town i dont know of any thats for sale how much do you calclate to pay i suppose ill have to pay thirty dollars squire green shook his head moren that neighbor walton you cant get a decent cow for thirty dollars i haint got one that isnt wuth more though ive got ten in my barn thirty dollars is all i can afford to pay squire take my advice and get a good cow while youre about it it dont pay to get a poor one im a poor man squire i must take what i can get i aint sure but ive got a cow that will suit you a red with white spots shes a fustrate milker how old is she shes turned of five how much do you ask for her are you going to pay cash down asked the squire half shutting his eyes and looking into the face of his visitor i cant do that im very short of money so am i chimed in the squire he had two hundred dollars in his desk at that moment waiting for profitable investment but then he didnt call it exactly a lie to misrepresent for a purpose so am i moneys tight neighbor moneys always tight with me squire returned hiram walton with a sigh was you ameanin to pay anything down inquired the squire i dont see how i can that alters the case you know i might as well keep the cow as to sell her without the money down i am willing to pay interest on the money of course thats fair wall neighbor what do you say to goin out to see the cow is she in the barn no shes in the pastur taint fur ill go along with you they made their way by a short cut across a cornfield to the pasture a large tenacre lot covered with a scanty vegetation the squires cows could not be said to live in clover thats the critter he said pointing out one of the cows which was grazing near by aint she a beauty she looks pretty well said mr walton dubiously by no means sure that she would equal his lost cow shes one of the best ive got i wouldnt sell ef it wasnt to oblige i aint at all particlar but i suppose youve got to hev a cow what do you ask for her squire shes wuth all of forty dollars answered the squire who knew perfectly well that a fair price would be about thirty but then his neighbor must have a cow and had no money to pay and so was at his mercy that seems high said hiram shes wuth every cent of it but i aint nowise particlar about sellin her couldnt you say thirtyseven i couldnt take a dollar less id rather keep her maybe id take thirtyeight cash down hiram walton shook his head i have no cash he said i must buy on credit wall then theres a bargain for you ill let you have her for forty dollars giving you six months to pay it at reglar interest six per cent of course i expect a little bonus for the accommodation i hope youll be easy with me im a poor man squire of course neighbor im always easy that isnt your reputation thought hiram but he knew that this was a thought to which he must not give expression all i want is a fair price for my time and trouble well say three dollars extra for the accommodation three dollars down hiram walton felt that it was a hard bargain the squire was driving with him but there seemed no help for it he must submit to the imposition or do without a cow there was no one else to whom he could look for help on any terms as to the three dollars his whole available cash amounted to but four dollars and it was for three quarters of this sum that the squire called but the sacrifice must be made well squire green if that is your lowest price i suppose i must come to it he answered at last you cant do no better said the squire with alacrity if so be as youve made up your mind well make out the papers very well come back to the house when do you want to take the cow ill drive her along now if you are willing why you see said the squire hesitating while a mean thought entered his mind shes been feedin in my pastur all the mornin and i calclate im entitled to the next milkin youd better come round tonight just after milkin and then you can take her i didnt think he was quite so mean passed through hiram waltons mind and his lip curved slightly in scorn but he knew that this feeling must be concealed just as you say he answered ill come round tonight or send harry how old is harry now about fourteen hes got to be quite a sizable lad ought to earn concidable is he industrious yes harry is a good worker always ready to lend a hand thats good does he go to school yes hes been going to school all the term seems to me hes old enough to give up larnin altogether dont he know how to read and write and cipher yes hes about the best scholar in school then neighbor walton take my advice and dont send him any more you need him at home and he knows enough to get along in the world i want him to learn as much as he can id like to send him to school till he is sixteen hes had as much schoolin now as ever i had said the squire and ive got along pooty well ive been seleckman and school committy and filled about every town office and i never wanted no more schoolin my father took me away from school when i was thirteen it wouldnt hurt you if you knew a little more thought hiram who remembered very well the squires deficiencies when serving on the town school committee i believe in learning he said my father used to say live and learn thats a good motto to my thinking it may be carried too far when a boys got to be of the age of your boy hed ought to be thinking of workin his time is too valuable to spend in the schoolroom i cant agree with you squire i think no time is better spent than the time thats spent in learning i wish i could afford to send my boy to college it would cost a mint of money and wouldnt pay better put him to some good business that was the way he treated his own son and for this and other reasons as soon as he arrived at mans estate he left home which had never had any pleasant associations with him his father wanted to convert him into a moneymaking machine a mere drudge working him hard and denying him as long as he could even the common recreations of boyhood for the squire had an idea that the time devoted in play was foolishly spent inasmuch as it brought him in no pecuniary return he was willfully blind to the faults and defects of his system and their utter failure in the case of his own son and would if could have all the boys in town brought up after severely practical method but fortunately for harry mr walton had very different notions he was compelled to keep his son home the greater part of the summer but it was against his desire no wonder hes a poor man thought the squire after his visitor returned home he aint got no practical idees live and learn thats all nonsense his boy looks strong and able to work and its foolish sendin him school any longer that want my way and see where i am he concluded with complacent remembrance of bonds and mortgages and money out at interest that was a pooty good cow trade he concluded i didnt calc late for to get moren thirtyfive dollars for the critter but then neighbor walton had to have a cow and had to pay my price now for hiram waltons reflections im a poor man he said to himself as he walked slowly homeward but i wouldnt be as mean as tom green for all the money hes worth hes made a hard bargain with me but there was no help for it chapter iv a sum in arithmetic harry kept on his way to school and arrived just the bell rang many of my readers have seen a country schoolhouse and will not be surprised to learn that the one in which our hero obtained his education was far from stately or ornamental architecturally speaking it was a onestory structure about thirty feet square showing traces of having been painted once but standing greatly in need of another coat within were sixty desks ranged in pairs with aisles running between them on one side sat the girls on the other the boys these were of all ages from five to sixteen the boys desks had suffered bad usage having been whittled and hacked and marked with the initials of the temporary occupants with scarcely an exception i never knew a yankee boy who was not the possessor of a knife of some kind nor one who could resist the temptation of using it for such unlawful purposes even our hero shared the common weakness and his desk was distinguished from the rest by h w rudely carved in a conspicuous place the teacher of the school for the present session was nathan burbank a country teacher of good repute who usually taught six months in a year and devoted the balance of the year to surveying land whenever he could get employment in that line and the cultivation of half a dozen acres of land which kept him in vegetables and enabled him to keep a cow altogether he succeeded in making a fair living though his entire income would seem very small to many of my readers he was not deeply learned but his education was sufficient to meet the limited requirements of a country school this was the summer term and it is the usual custom in new england that the summer schools should be taught by females but in this particular school the experiment had been tried and didnt work it was found that the scholars were too unruly to be kept in subjection by a woman and the school committee had therefore engaged mr burbank though by so doing the school term was shortened as he asked fifty per cent higher wages than a female teacher would have done however it was better to have a short school than an unruly school and so the district acquiesced eight weeks had not yet passed since the term commenced and yet this was the last day but one tomorrow would be examination day to this mr burbank made reference in a few remarks which he made at the commencement of the exercises he was rather a tall spare man and had a habit of brushing his hair upward thus making the most of a moderate forehead probably he thought it made him look more intellectual boys and girls he said tomorrow is our examination day ive tried to bring you along as far as possible toward the temple of learning but some of you have held back and have not done as well as i should like john plympton if you dont stop whispering ill keep you after school i want you all to remember that knowledge is better than land or gold what would you think of a man who was worth a great fortune and couldnt spell his name mary jones cant you sit still till i get through it will be well for you to improve your opportunities while you are young for by and by you will grow up and have families to support and will have no chance to learn jane quimby i wish you would stop giggling i see nothing to laugh at there are some of you who have studied well this term and done the best you could at the beginning of the term i determined to give a book to the most deserving scholar at the end of the term i have picked out the boy who in my opinion deserves it ephraim higgins you neednt move round in your seat you are not the one there was a general laugh here for ephraim was distinguished chiefly for his laziness the teacher proceeded i do not mean to tell you today who it is tomorrow i shall call out his name before the school committee and present him the prize i want you to do as well as you can tomorrow i want you to do yourselves credit and to do me credit for i do not want to be ashamed of you peter shelby put back that knife into your pocket and keep it there till i call up the class in whittling there was another laugh here at the teachers joke and peter himself displayed a broad grin on his large goodhumored face we will now proceed to the regular lessons said mr burbank in conclusion first class in arithmetic will take their places the first class ranked as the highest class and in it was harry walton what was your lesson today asked the teacher square root answered harry i will give you out a very simple sum to begin with now attention all find the square root of whoever gets the answer first may hold up his hand the first to hold up his hand was ephraim higgins have you got the answer asked mr burbank in some surprise yes sir state it fortyfive how did you get it ephraim scratched his head and looked confused the fact was he was entirely ignorant of the method of extracting the square root but had slyly looked at the slate of his neighbor harry walton and mistaken the for and hurriedly announced the answer in the hope of obtaining credit for the same how did you get it asked the teacher again ephraim looked foolish bring me your slate ephraim reluctantly left his place and went up to mr burbank what have we here said the teacher why you have got down the and nothing else except where did you get that answer i guessed at it answered ephraim hard pressed for an answer and not liking to confess the truth namely that he had copied from harry walton so i supposed the next time youd better guess a little nearer right or else give up guessing altogether harry walton i see your hand up what is your answer twentyfive sir that is right ephraim looked up suddenly he now saw the explanation of his mistake will you explain how you did it you may go to the blackboard and perform the operation once more explaining as you go along for the benefit of ephraim higgins and any others who guessed at the answer ephraim i want you to give particular attention so that you can do yourself more credit next time now harry proceed our hero explained the sum in a plain straightforward way for he thoroughly understood it very well said the schoolmaster for this rather than teacher is the country name of the office now ephraim do you think you can explain it i dont know sir said ephraim dubiously suppose you try you may take the same sum ephraim advanced to the board with reluctance for he was not ambitious and had strong doubts about his competence for the task put down ephraim did so now extract the square root what do you do first divide it into two figures each divide it into periods of two figures each i suppose you mean well what will be the first period sixtytwo answered ephraim and what will be the second i dont see but one other figure nor i you have made a mistake harry show to point it off harry walton did so now what do you do next divide the first figure by three what do you do that for ephraim didnt know it was only a guess of his because he knew that the first figure of the answer was two and this would result from dividing the first figure by three to bring the answer he replied and i suppose you divide the next period by five for the same reason dont you yes sir you may take your seat sir you are an ornament to the class and you may become a great mathematician if you live to the age of methuselah i rather think it will take about nine hundred years for you to reach that point the boys laughed they always relish a joke at the expense of a companion especially when perpetrated by the teacher your method of extracting the square root is very original you didnt find it in any arithmetic did you no sir so i thought youd better take out a patent for it the next boy may go to the board i have given a specimen of mr burbanks method of conducting the school but do not propose to enter into further details at present it will doubtless recall to some of my readers experiences of their own as the school i am describing is very similar to hundreds of country schools now in existence and mr burbank is the representative of a large class chapter v the prize winner are you going to the examination today mother asked harry at breakfast i should like to go said mrs walton but i dont see how i can todays my bakin day and somehow my work has got behindhand during the week i think harryll get the prize said tom a boy of ten not heretofore mentioned he also attended the school but was not as promising as his oldest brother what prize asked mrs walton looking up with interest the master offered a prize at the beginning of the term to the scholar that was most faithful to his studies what is the prize a book do you think you will get it harry asked his mother i dont know said harry modestly i think i have some chance of getting it when will it be given toward the close of the afternoon maybe i can get time to come in then ill try i wish you would come mother said harry earnestly only dont be disappointed if i dont get it ive been trying but there are some other good scholars youre the best harry said tom i dont know about that i shant count my chickens before they are hatched only if i am to get the prize i should like to have mother there i know youre a good scholar and have improved your time said mrs walton i wish your father was rich enough to send you to college i should like that very much said harry his eyes sparkling at merely the suggestion but it isnt much use hoping continued his mother with a sigh it doesnt seem clear whether we can get a decent living much less send our boy to college the cow is a great loss to us just then mr walton came in from the barn how do you like the new cow father asked harry she isnt equal to our old one she doesnt give as much milk within two quarts if this mornings milking is a fair sample you paid enough for her said mrs walton i paid too much for her answered her husband but it was the best i could do i had to buy on credit and squire green knew i must pay his price or go without fortythree dollars is a great deal of money to pay for a cow not for some cows some are worth more but this one isnt what do you think she is really worth thirtythree dollars is the most i would give if i had the cash to pay i think its mean in squire green to take such advantage of you said harry you mustnt say so harry for it wont do for me to get the squires ill will i am owing him money ive agreed to pay for the cow in six months can you do it i dont see how but the moneys on interest and it maybe the squirell let it stay i forgot to say though that last evening when i went to get the cow he made me agree to forfeit ten dollars if i was not ready with the money and interest in six months i am afraid he will insist on that if i cant keep my agreement it will be better for you to pay and have done with it of course i shall try to do it if i have to borrow the money i suppose i shall have to do that meantime harry was busy thinking wouldnt it be possible for me to earn money enough to pay for the cow in six months i wish i could do it and relieve father he began to think over all the possible ways of earning money but there was nothing in particular to do in the town except to work for the farmers and there was very little money to earn ill that way money is a scarce commodity with farmers everywhere most of their income is in the shape of farm produce and used in the family only a small surplus is converted into money and a dollar therefore seems more to them than to a mechanic whose substantial income is perhaps less this is the reason probably why farmers are generally loath to spend money harry knew that if he should hire out to a farmer for the six months the utmost he could expect would be a dollar a week and it was not certain he could earn that besides he would probably be worth as much to his father as anyone and his labor in neither case provide money to pay for the cow obviously that would not answer he must think of some other way but at present none seemed open he sensibly deferred thinking till after the examination are you going to the school examination father asked our hero i cant spare time harry i should like to for i want to know how far you have progressed live and learn my boy thats a good motto though squire green thinks that live and earn is a better thats the rule he acts on said mrs walton he isnt troubled with learning no he isnt as good a scholar probably as tom here isnt he said tom rather complacently dont feel too much flattered tom said his mother you dont know enough to hurt you he never will said his sister jane laughing i dont want to know enough to hurt me returned tom good humoredly he was rather used to such compliments and didnt mind them no said mr walton i am afraid i cant spare time to come to the examination are you going mother it is quite common in the country for husbands to address wives in this manner i shall try to go in the last of the afternoon said mrs walton if you will come mother said harry well all help you afterwards so you wont lose anything by it i think i will contrive to come the examination took place in the afternoon mr burbank preferred to have it so for two reasons it allowed time to submit the pupils to a previous private examination in the morning thus insuring a better appearance in the afternoon besides in the second place the parents were more likely to be at liberty to attend in the afternoon and he naturally liked to have as many visitors as possible he was really a good teacher though his qualifications were limited but as far as his knowledge went he was quite successful in imparting it to others in the afternoon there was quite a fair attendance of parents and friends of the scholars though some did not come in till late like mrs walton it is not my intention to speak of the examination in detail my readers know too little of the scholars to make that interesting ephraim higgins made some amusing mistakes but that didnt excite any surprise for his scholarship was correctly estimated in the village tom walton did passably well but was not likely to make his parents proud of his performances harry however eclipsed himself his ambition had been stirred by the offer of a prize and he was resolved to deserve it his recitations were prompt and correct and his answers were given with confidence but perhaps he did himself most credit in declamation he had always been very fond of that and though he had never received and scientific instruction in it he possessed a natural grace and a deep feeling of earnestness which made success easy he had selected an extract from webster the reply to the hayne and this was the showpiece of the afternoon the rest of the declamation was crude enough but harrys impressed even the most ignorant of his listeners as superior for a boy of his age when he uttered his last sentence and made a parting bow there was subdued applause and brought a flush of gratification to the cheek of our young hero this is the last exercise said the teacher except one at the commencement of the term i offered a prize to the scholar that would do the best from that time till the close of the school i will now award the prize harry walton come forward harry rose from his seat his cheeks flushed again with gratification and advanced to where the teacher was standing harry said mr burbank i have no hesitation in giving you the prize you have excelled all the other scholars and it is fairly yours the book is not of much value but i think you will find it interesting and instructive it is the life of the great american philosopher and statesman benjamin franklin i hope you will read and profit by it and try like him to make your life a credit to yourself and a blessing to mankind thank you sir said harry bowing low i will try to do so there was a speech by the chairman of the school committee in which allusion was made to harry and the prize and the exercises were over harry received the congratulations of his schoolmates and others with modest satisfaction but he was most pleased by the evident pride and pleasure which his mother exhibited when she too was congratulated on his success his worldly prospects were very uncertain but he had achieved the success for which he had been laboring and he was happy chapter vi looking out on the world it was not until evening that harry had a chance to look at his prize it was a cheap book costing probably not over a dollar but except his schoolbooks and a ragged copy of robinson crusoe it was the only book that our hero possessed his father found it difficult enough to buy him the necessary books for use in school and could not afford to buy any less necessary so our young hero who was found of reading though seldom able to gratify his taste looked forward with great joy to the pleasure of reading his new book he did not know much about benjamin franklin but had a vague idea that he was a great man after his evening chores were done he sat down by the table on which was burning a solitary tallow candle and began to read his mother was darning stockings and his father had gone to the village store on an errand so he began the story and the more he read the more interesting he found it great as he afterwards became he was surprised to find that franklin was a poor boy and had to work for a living he started out in life on his own account and through industry frugality perseverance and a fixed determination to rise in life he became a distinguished an in the end and a wise man also though his early opportunities were very limited it seemed to harry that there was a great similarity between his own circumstances and position in life and those of the great man about whom he was reading and this made the biography the more fascinating the hope came to him that by following franklins example he too might become a successful man his mother looking up at intervals from the stockings which had been so repeatedly darned that the original texture was almost wholly lost of sight of noticed how absorbed he was is your book interesting harry she asked its the most interesting book i ever read said harry with a sigh of intense enjoyment its about benjamin franklin isnt it yes do you know mother he was a poor boy and he worked his way up yes i have heard so but i never read his life youd better read this when i have finished it ive been thinking that theres a chance for me mother a chance to do what a chance to be somebody when i get bigger im poor now but so was franklin he worked hard and tried to learn all he could thats the way he succeeded im going to do the same we cant all be franklins my son said mrs walton not wishing her son to form high hopes which might be disappointed in the end i know that mother and i dont expect to be a great man like him but if i try hard i think i can rise in the world and be worth a little money i hope you wont be as poor as your father harry said mrs walton sighing as she thought of the years of pain privation and pinching poverty reaching back to the time of their marriage they had got through it somehow but she hoped that their children would have a brighter lot i hope not said harry if i ever get rich you shant have to work any more mrs walton smiled faintly she was not hopeful and thought it probable that before harry became rich both she and her husband would be resting from their labor in the village churchyard but she would not dampen harrys youthful enthusiasm by the utterance of such a thought i am sure you wont let your father and mother want if you have the means to prevent it she said aloud we cant any of us tell whats coming but i hope you may be well off some time i read in the country paper the other day that many of the richest men in boston and new york were once poor boys said harry in a hopeful tone so i have heard said his mother if they succeeded i dont see why i cant you must try to be something more than a rich man i shouldnt want you to be like squire green he is rich but he is mean and ignorant i dont think i shall be like him he has cheated father about the cow yes he drove a sharp trade with him taking advantage of his necessities i am afraid your father wont be able to pay for the cow six months from now i am afraid so too i dont see how we can possibly save up forty dollars we are economical now as we can be that is what i have been thinking of mother there is no chance of fathers paying the money then it wont be paid and we shall be worse off when the note comes due than now do you think said harry laying down the book on the table and looking up earnestly do you think mother i could any way earn the forty dollars before it is to be paid you harry repeated his mother in surprise what could you do to earn the money i dont know yet answered harry but there are a great many things to be done i dont know what you can do except to hire out to a farmer and they pay very little besides i dont know of any farmer in the town that wants a boy most of them have boys of their own or men i wasnt thinking of that said harry there isnt much chance there i dont know of any work to do here nor i mother but i wasnt thinking of staying in town not thinking of staying in town repeated mrs walton in surprise you dont want to leave home do you no mother i dont want to leave home or i wouldnt want to if there was anything to do here but you know there isnt farm work wont help me along and i dont like it as well as some other kinds of work i must leave home if i want to rise in the world but your are too young harry this was touching harry on a tender spot no boy of fourteen likes to be considered very young by that time he generally begins to feel a degree of selfconfidence and selfreliance and fancies he is almost on the threshold of manhood i know boys of fourteen who look in the glass daily for signs of a coming mustache and fancy they can see plainly what is not yet visible harry had not got as far as that but he no longer looked upon himself as a young boy he was stout and strong and of very good height for his age and began to feel manly so he drew himself up upon this remark of his mothers and said proudly i am going on fifteen that sounds older than fourteen and i dont call that very young it seems but a little while since you were a baby said his mother meditatively i hope you dont think me anything like a baby now mother said harry straightening up and looking as large as possible no youre quite a large boy now how quick the years have passed and i am strong for my age too mother i am sure i am old enough to take care of myself but you are young to go out into the world i dont believe franklin was much older than i and he got along there are plenty of boys who leave home before they are as old as i am suppose you are sick harry if i am ill come home but you know i am very healthy mother and if i am away from home i shall be very careful but you would not be sure of getting anything to do ill risk that mother said harry in a confident tone did you think of this before you read that book yes ive been thinking of it for about a month but the book put it into my head tonight i seem to see my way clearer than i did i want most of all to earn money enough to pay for the cow in six months you know yourself mother there isnt any chance of father doing it himself and i cant earn anything if i stay at home have you mentioned the matter to your father yet harry no i havent i wish you would speak about it tonight mother you can tell him first what makes me want to go ill tell him that you want to go but i wont promise to say i think it a good plan just mention it mother and then ill talk with him about it tomorrow to this mrs walton agreed and harry after reading a few pages more in the life of franklin went up to bed but it was some time before he slept his mind was full of the new scheme on which he had set his heart chapter vii in franklins footsteps father said harry the next morning as mr walton was about to leave the house theres something i want to say to you what is it asked his father imagining it was some trifle ill go out with you and tell you outside very well my son harry put on his cap and followed his father into the open air now my son what is it i want to go away from home away from home where asked mr walton in surprise i dont know where but somewhere where i can earn my own living but you can do that here you can give me your help on the farm as you always have done i dont like farming father you never told me that before is it because of the hard work no said harry earnestly i am not afraid of hard work but you know how it is father this isnt a very good farm and its all you can do to make a living for the rest of us out of it if i could go somewhere where i could work at something else i could send you home my wages i am afraid a boy like you couldnt earn very large wages i dont see why not father im strong and stout and willing to work people dont give much for boys work i dont expect much but i know i can get something and by and by it will lead to more i want to help you to pay for that cow youve just bought of squire green i dont see how im going to pay for it said mr walton with a sigh hard moneys pretty scarce and we farmers dont get much of it thats just what im saying father there isnt much money to be got in farming thats why i want to try something else how long have you been thinking of this plan harry only since last night what put it into your head that book i got as a prize it is the life of franklin isnt it yes did he go away from home when he was a boy yes and he succeeded too i know he did he became a famous man but it isnt every boy that is like franklin i know that i never expect to become a great man like him but i can make something harry spoke those words in a firm resolute tone which seemed to indicate a consciousness of power looking in his sons face the elder walton though by no means a sanguine man was inclined to think favorably of the scheme but he was cautious and he did not want harry to be too confident of success its a new idea to me he said suppose you fail i dont mean to but suppose you do suppose you get sick then ill come home but i want to try there must be something for me to do in the world theres another thing harry it takes money to travel round and i havent got any means to give you i dont want any father i mean to work my way ive got twentyfive cents to start with now father what do you say ill speak to your mother about it today yes as soon as i go in with this harry was content he had a good deal of confidence that he could carry his point with both parents he went into the house and said to his mother mother fathers going to speak to you about my going away from home now dont you oppose it do you really think it would be a good plan harry yes mother and if youre sick will you promise to come right home yes ill promise that then i wont oppose your notion though i aint clear about its being wise well talk about that in a few months mother has harry spoken to you about his plan of going away from home asked the farmer when he reentered the house yes said mrs walton what do you think perhaps wed better let the lad have his way hes promised to come home if hes taken sick so let it be then harry when do you want to go as soon as i can youll have to wait till monday itll take a day or two to fix up your clothes said his mother all right mother i dont know but you ought to have some new shirts you havent got but two except the one you have on i can get along mother father hasnt got any money to spend for me by the time i want some new shirts ill buy them myself where do you think of going harry have you any idea no mother im going to trust to luck i shant go very far when ive got fixed anywhere ill write and let you know in the evening harry resumed the life of franklin and before he was ready to go to bed he had got two thirds through with it it possessed for him a singular fascination to harry it was no alone the life of benjamin franklin it was the chart by which he meant to steer in the unknown career which stretched before him he knew so little of the world that he trusted implicitly to that as a guide and he silently stored away the wise precepts in conformity with which the great practical philosopher had shaped and molded his life during that evening however another chance was offered to harry as i shall now describe as the family were sitting around the kitchen table on which was placed the humble tallow candle by which the room was lighted there was heard a scraping at the door and presently a knock mr walton answered it in person and admitted the thin figure and sharp calculating face of squire green how are you neighbor he said looking about him with his parrotlike glance i thought id just run in a minute to see you as i was goin by sit down squire green take the rockingchair thank you neighbor hows the cow adoin middling well she dont give as much milk as the one i lost shell do better bymeby shes a good bargain to you neighbor i dont know said hiram walton dubiously she ought to be a good cow for the price you asked and she is a good cow said the squire emphatically and youre lucky to get her so cheap buyin on time what are you doin there harry school through aint it yes sir i hear youre a good scholar got the prize didnt you yes said mr walton harry was always good at his books i guess he knows enough now youd ought to set him to work he is ready enough to work said mr walton he never was lazy thats good theres a sight of lazy shiftless boys about in these days seems as if they expected to earn their bread n butter adoin nothin ive been a thinkin neighbor walton that youll find it hard to pay for that cow in six months i am afraid i shall said the farmer thinking in surprise can he be going to reduce the price so i thought mebbe we might make an arrangement to make it easier i should be glad to have it made easier squire it was hard on me losing that cow by disease of course well what i was thinkin was you might hire out your boy to work for me id allow him two dollars a month and board and the wages would help pay for the cow harry looked up in dismay at this proposition he knew very well the meanness of the board which the squire provided how inferior it was even to the scanty but wellcooked meals which he got at home he knew also that the squire had the knack of getting more work out of his men than any other farmer in the town and the prospect of being six months in his employ was enough to terrify him he looked from squire greens mean crafty face to his fathers in anxiety and apprehension were all his bright dreams of future success to terminate in this chapter viii harrys decision squire green rubbed his hands as if he had been proposing a plan with special reference to the interest of the waltons really he conceived that it would save him a considerable sum of money he had in his employ a young man of eighteen named abner kimball to whom he was compelled to pay ten dollars a month harry he reckoned could be made to do about as much though on account of his youth he had offered him but two dollars and that not to be paid in cash mr walton paused before replying to his proposal youre a little too late he said at last to harrys great relief too late repeated the squire hastily why you haint hired out your boy to anybody else have you no but he has asked me to let him leave home and ive agreed to it leave home wheres he goin he has not fully decided he wants to go out and seek his fortune hell fetch up at the poorhouse growled the squire if he does not succeed he will come home again its a foolish plan neighbor walton take my word fort youd better keep him here and let him work for me if he stayed at home i should find work for him on my farm mr walton would not have been willing to have harry work for the squire knowing well his meanness and how poorly he paid his hired men i wanted to help you pay for that cow said the squire crossly if you cant pay fort when the time comes you mustnt blame me i shall blame no one i cant foresee the future but i hope to get together the money somehow you mustnt ask for more time six months is a long time to give i believe i havent said anything about more time yet squire green said hiram walton stiffly i dont see that you need warn me i thought we might as well have an understandin about it said the squire so you wont hire out the boy no i cannot under the circumstances if i did i should consider his services worth more than two dollars a month i might give him twon a half said the squire fancying it was merely a question of money how much do you pay abner kimball wal rather more than that answered the squire slowly you pay him ten dollars a month dont you wal somewheres about that but its moren he earns if he is worth ten dollars harry would be worth four or six ill give three said the squire who reflected that even at that rate he would be saving considerable i will leave it to harry himself said his father harry you hear squire greens offer what do you say will you go to work for him at three dollars a month id rather go away as you told me i might father you hear the boys decision squire wal wal said the squire a good deal disappointed for to tell the truth he had told abner he should not want him having felt confident of obtaining harry i hope you wont neither of ye regret it his tone clearly indicated that he really hoped and expected they would i bid ye good night ill hev the cow back agin said the squire to himself he neednt hope no massy if he dont hev the money ready for me when the time is up he shant keep her the next morning he was under the unpleasant necessity of reengaging abner come to think ont abner he said i guess id like to hev you stay longer theres more work than i reckoned and i guess ill hev to have somebody this was at the breakfast table abner looked around him and after making sure that there was nothing eatable left put down his knife and fork with the air of one who could have eaten more and answered deliberately ef i stay ill hev to hev more wages more wages repeated squire green in dismay moren ten dollars yes a fellow of my age orter hey moren that ten dollars is a good deal of money i cant lay up a cent offn it then youre extravagant no i aint i aint no chance to be my cousin paul bickford is gettin fifteen dollars and he aint no better workern i am fifteen dollars ejaculated the squire as if he were naming some extraordinary sum i never heerd of such a thing ill work for twelven a half said abner and i wont work for no less its too much said the squire besides you agreed to come for ten i know i did but this is a new engagement finally abner reduced his terms to twelve dollars an advance of two dollars a month to which the squire was forced to agree though very reluctantly he thought with an inward groan that but for his hasty dismissal of abner the night before on the supposition that he could obtain harry in his place he would not have been compelled to raise abners wages this again resulted indirectly from selling the cow which had put the new plan into his head when the squire reckoned up this item amounting in six months to twelve dollars he began to doubt whether his cow trade had been quite so good after all ill get it out of hiram walton some way he muttered hes a great fool to let that boy have his own way i thought to be sure hed oblige me arter the favor i done him in sellin him the cow theres gratitude for you the squires ideas about gratitude and the manner in which he had earned it were slightly mixed it must be acknowledged but though he knew very well that he had been influenced only by the consideration of his own interest he had a vague idea that he was entitled to some credit for his kindness in consenting to sell his neighbor a cow at an extortionate price harry breathed a deep sigh of relief after squire green left the room i was afraid you were going to hire me out to the squire father he said you didnt enjoy the prospect did you said his father smiling not much shouldnt think he would said his brother tom the squires awful stingy abner kimball told me he had the meanest breakfast he ever ate anywhere i dont think any of his household are in danger of contracting the gout from luxurious living i guess not said tom i think said jane slyly youd better hire out tom to the squire the squire would have the worst of the bargain said his father with a goodnatured hit at toms sluggishness he wouldnt earn his board however poor it might be the squire didnt seem to like it very well said mrs walton looking up from her mending no he fully expected to get harry for little or nothing it was ridiculous to offer two dollars a month for a boy of his age i am afraid he will be more disposed to be hard on you when the time comes to pay for the cow he told you he wouldnt extend the time he is not likely to after this but wife we wont borrow trouble something may turn up to help us i am sure i shall be able to help you about it father said harry i hope so my son but dont feel too certain you may not succeed as well as you anticipate i know that but i mean to try at any rate if you dont tom will said his sister quit teasin a feller jane said tom i aint any laziern you are if i am ill eat my head then youll have to eat it tom retorted jane and it wont be much loss to you either dont dispute children said mrs walton i expect you both will turn over a new leaf by and by meanwhile harry was busily reading the life of franklin the more he read the more hopeful he became as to the future chapter ix leaving home monday morning came and the whole family stood on the grass plat in front of the house ready to bid harry goodby he was encumbered by no trunk but carried his scanty supply of clothing wrapped in a red cotton handkerchief and not a very heavy bundle at that he had cut a stout stick in the woods near by and from the end of this suspended over his back bore the bundle which contained all his worldly fortune except the twentyfive cents which was in his vest pocket i dont like to have you go said his mother anxiously suppose you dont get work dont worry about me mother said harry brightly ill get along somehow remember youve got a home here harry whatever happens said his father i shant forget father i wish i was going with you said tom for the first time fired with the spirit of adventure what could you do tom said jane teasingly work of course i never saw you do it yet im no more lazy than you retorted tom offended dont dispute children just as your brother is leaving us said mrs walton goodby mother said harry feeling an unwonted moistening of the eyes as he reflected that he was about to leave the house in which he had lived since infancy goodby my dear child said his mother kissing him be sure to write yes i will so with farewell greetings harry walked out into the world he had all at once assumed a mans responsibilities and his face grew serious as he began to realize that he must now look out for himself his native village was situated in the northern part of new hampshire not far away could be seen indistinct in the distance the towering summits of the white mountain range but his back was turned to them in the south were larger and more thriving villages and the wealth was greater harry felt that his chances would be greater there not that he had any particular place in view wherever there was an opening he meant to stop i wont come back till i am better off he said to himself if i dont succeed it wont be for want of trying he walked five miles without stopping this brought him to the middle of the next town he was yet on familiar ground for he had been here more than once he felt tired and sat down by the roadside to rest before going farther while he sat there the doctor from his own village rode by and chanced to espy harry whom he recognized what brings you here harry he asked stopping his chaise im going to seek my fortune said harry what away from home yes sir i hadnt heard of that said the doctor surprised you havent run away from home he asked with momentary suspicion no indeed said harry half indignantly fathers given his permission for me to go where do you expect to go south said harry vaguely and what do you expect to find to do i dont know anything thatll bring me a living i like your spunk said the doctor after a pause if youre going my way as i suppose you are i can carry you a couple of miles thats better than walking isnt it i guess it is said harry jumping to his feet with alacrity in a minute he was sitting beside dr dunham in his oldfashioned chaise i might have known that you were not running away said the doctor i should be more likely to suspect your brother tom toms too lazy to run away to earn his own living said harry laughing as long as he can get it at home the doctor smiled and what put it into your head to start out in this way he asked the first thing was reading the life of franklin to be sure i remember his story and the next thing was because my father is so poor he finds it hard work to support us all the farm is small and the land is poor i want to help him if i can very commendable harry said the doctor kindly you owe a debt of gratitude to your good father who has not succeeded so well in life as he deserves thats true sir he has always been a hardworking man if you start out with such a good object i think you will succeed have you any plans at all or any idea what you would like to do i thought i should like to work in a shoe shop if i got a chance said harry you like that better than working on a farm then yes sir there isnt much money to be earned by working on a farm i had a chance to do that before i came away you mean working on your fathers land i suppose no squire green wanted to hire me what wages did he offer two dollars a month at first afterwards he got up to three the doctor smiled how could you decline such a magnificent offer he asked i dont think i should like boarding at the squires a dollar is twice as large at least in his eyes as in those of anyone else by this time they had reached a place where a road turned at right angles i am going down here harry said the doctor i should like to have you ride farther but i suppose it would only be taking you out of your course yes doctor id better get out ill tell your father i saw you tell him i was in good spirits said harry earnestly motherll be glad to know that i will certainly goodby goodby doctor thank you for the ride you are quite welcome to that harry harry followed with his eyes the doctors chaise it seemed like severing the last link that bound him to his native village he was very glad to have fallen in with the doctor but it seemed all the more lonesome that he had left him harry walked six miles farther and then decided that it was time to rest again he was not only somewhat fatigued but decidedly hungry although it was but eleven oclock in the forenoon however it must be considered that he had walked eleven miles and this was enough to give anyone an appetite he sat down again beside the road and untying the handkerchief which contained his worldly possessions he drew therefrom a large slice of bread and began to eat with evident relish there was a slice of cold meat also which he found tasted particularly good i wonder whether they are thinking of me at home he said to himself they were thinking about him and when an hour later the family gathered around the table no one seemed to have much appetite all looked sober for all were thinking of the absent son and brother i wish harry was here said jane at length giving voice to the general feeling poor boy sighed his mother im afraid hell have a hard time i wish he had stayed at home or even have gone to squire greens to work then we could have seen him every day i should have pitied him more if he had gone there than i do now said his father depend upon it it will be better for him in the end i hope so said his mother dubiously but you dont feel sure well time will show we shall hear from him before long we go back to harry he rested for a couple of hours sheltered from the sun by the foliage of the oak beneath which he had stretched himself he whiled away the time by reading for the second time some parts of the life of franklin which he had brought away in his bundle with his few other possessions it seemed even more interesting to him now that he too like franklin had started out in quest for fortune he resumed walking but we will not dwell upon the details of his journey at six oclock he was twentyfive miles from home he had not walked much in the afternoon when all at once he was alarmed by the darkening of the sky it was evident that a storm was approaching he looked about him for shelter from the shower and a place where he could pass the night chapter x the general the clouds were darkening and the shower was evidently not far off it was a solitary place and no houses were to be seen near by but nearly a quarter of a mile back harry caught sight of a small house and jumping over the fence directed his steps toward it five minutes brought him to it it was small painted red originally but the color had mostly been washed away it was not upon a public road but there was a narrow lane leading to it from the highway probably it was occupied by a poor family harry thought still it would shelter him from the storm which had even now commenced he knocked at the door immediately it was opened and a face peered out the face of a man advanced in years it was thin wrinkled and haggard the thin white hair uncombed gave a wild appearance to the owner who in a thin shrill voice demanded who are you my name is harry walton what do you want shelter from the storm it is going to rain come in said the old man and opening the door wider he admitted our hero harry found himself in a room very bare of furniture but there was a log fire in the fireplace and this looked comfortable and pleasant he laid down his bundle and drawing up a chair sat down by it his host meanwhile watching him closely does he live alone i wonder thought harry he saw no other person about and no traces of a womans presence the floor looked as if it had not been swept for a month and probably it had not the old man sat down opposite harry and stared at him till our hero felt somewhat embarrassed and uncomfortable why dont he say something thought harry he is a very queer old man after a while his host spoke do you know who i am he asked no said harry looking at him youve heard of me often pursued the old man i didnt know it answered harry beginning to feel curious in history added the other in history yes harry began to look at him in increased surprise will you tell me your name if it is not too much trouble he asked politely i gained the victory of new orleans said the old man i thought general jackson did that said harry youre right said the old man complacently i am general jackson but general jackson is dead thats a mistake said the old man quietly thats what they say in all the books but it isnt true this was amusing but it was also startling harry knew now that the old man was crazy or at least a monomaniac and though he seemed harmless enough it was of course possible that he might be dangerous he was almost sorry that he had sought shelter here better have encountered the storm in its full fury than place himself in the power of a maniac the rain was now falling in thick drops and he decided at any rate to remain a while longer he knew that it would not be well to dispute the old man and resolved to humor his delusion you were president once i believe he asked yes said the old man and you wont tell anybody will you no i mean to be again said the old man in a low voice half in a whisper but you mustnt say anything about it theyd try to kill me if they knew it who would mr henry clay and the rest of them doesnt henry clay want you to be president again of course not he wants to be president himself thats why im hiding they dont any of them know where i am you wont tell will you no you might meet henry clay you know harry smiled to himself it didnt seem very likely that he would ever find himself in such distinguished company for henry clay was at that time living and a united states senator what made you come here general jackson he inquired the old man brightened on being called by this name because it was quiet they cant find me here when do you expect to be president again next year said the old man ive got it all arranged my friends are to blow up the capitol and i shall ride into washington on a white horse do you want an office i dont know but i should like one said harry amused ill see what i can do for you said the old man seriously i cant put you in my cabinet thats all arranged if you would like to be minister to england or to france you can go i should like to go to france benjamin franklin was minister to france do you know him no but i have read his life ill put your name down in my book what is it harry walton the old man went to the table on which was a common account book he took a pen and with a serious look made this entry i promise to make harry walton minister to france as soon as i take my place in the white house general andrew jackson its all right now he said thank you general you are very kind said our hero were you ever a soldier asked his host i never was i thought you might have been in the battle of new orleans our men fought splendidly sir i have no doubt of it youll read all about it in history we fought behind cotton bales it was glorious general said harry if youll excuse me ill take out my supper from this bundle no no said the old man you must take supper with me i wonder whether he has anything fit to eat thought harry thank you he said aloud if you wish it the old man had arisen and taking a teakettle suspended it over the fire a monomaniac though he was on the subject of his identity with general jackson he knew how to make tea presently he took from the cupboard a bakers roll and some cold meat and when the tea was ready invited harry to be seated at the table our hero did so willingly he had lost his apprehensions perceiving that his companions lunacy was of a very harmless character what if mother could see me now he thought still the rain poured down it showed no signs of slackening he saw that it would be necessary to remain where he was through the night general can you accommodate me till morning he asked certainly said the old man i shall be glad to have you stay here do you go to france tomorrow i have not received my appointment yet true true but it wont be long i will write your instructions tonight very well the supper was plain enough but it was relished by our young traveler whose long walk had stimulated a naturally good appetite eat heartily my son said the old man a long journey is before you after the meal was over the old man began to write harry surmised that it was his instructions he paid little heed but fixed his eyes upon the fire listening to the rain that continued to beat against the window panes and began to speculate about the future was he to be successful or not he was not without solicitude but he felt no small measure of hope at nine oclock he began to feel drowsy and intimated as much to his host the old man conducted him to an upper chamber where there was a bed upon the floor you can sleep there he said where do you sleep asked harry down below but i shall not go to bed till late i must get ready your instructions very well said harry good night good night i am glad he is not in the room with me thought harry i dont think there is any danger but it isnt comfortable to be too near a crazy man chapter xi in search of work when harry awoke the next morning after a sound and refreshing sleep the sun was shining brightly in at the window he rubbed his eyes and stared about him not at first remembering where he was but almost immediately recollection came to his aid and he smiled as he thought of the eccentric old man whose guest he was he leaped out of bed and quickly dressing himself went downstairs the fire was burning and breakfast was already on the table it was precisely similar to the supper of the night previous the old man sat at the fireside smoking a pipe good morning general said harry i am up late it is no matter you have a long journey before you and it is well to rest before starting where does he think i am going thought our hero breakfast is ready said the old man hospitably i cant entertain you now as i could have done when i was president you must come and see me at the white house next year i should like to harry ate a hearty breakfast when it was over he rose to go i must be going general he said thank you for your kind entertainment if you would allow me to pay you general jackson does not keep an inn said the old man with dignity you are his guest i have your instructions ready he opened a drawer in the table and took a roll of foolscap tied with a string put it in your bundle he said let no one see it above all dont let it fall into the hands of henry clay or my life will be in peril harry solemnly assured him that henry clay should never see it and shaking the old man by the hand made his way across the fields to the main road looking back from time to time he saw the old man watching him from his place in the doorway his eyes shaded by his hand he is the strangest man i ever saw thought harry still he treated me kindly i should like to find out some more about him when he reached the road he saw just in front of him a boy of about his own age driving half a dozen cows before him perhaps he can tell me something about the old man hello he cried by way of salutation hello returned the country boy where are you going i dont know wherever i can find work answered our hero the boy laughed dad finds enough for me to do i dont have to go after it havent you got a father yes why dont you work for him i want to work for pay on a farm no ill work in a shoe shop if i get a chance or in a printing office do you understand the shoe business no but i can learn where did you come from granton you didnt come from there this morning no i guess not as its over twenty miles last night i stopped at general jacksons the boy whistled what at the old crazy mans that lives down here a piece yes what made you go there it began to rain and i had no other place to go what did he say asked the new boy with curiosity did he cut up cut up no unless you mean the bread he cut up that i mean how did he act all right except when he was talking about being general jackson did you sleep there yes i wouldnt why not i wouldnt sleep in a crazy mans house he wouldnt hurt you i dont know about that he chases us boys often and threatens to kill us you plague him dont you i guess we do we call him old crazy and that makes him mad he says henry clay puts us up to it ho ho ho he thinks clay is his enemy he told me so what did you say oh i didnt contradict him i called him general he treated me tiptop he is going to make me minister of france when he is president again maybe that was the best way to get along how long has he lived here what made him crazy i dont know folks say he was disappointed did he ever see jackson yes he fit at new orleans under him has he lived long around here ever since i can remember he gets a pension ive heard father say thats what keeps him here the boy reached the pasture to which he was driving the cows and harry bidding him goodby went on his way he felt fresh and vigorous and walked ten miles before he felt the need of rest when this distance was accomplished he found himself in the center of a goodsized village he felt hungry and the provision which he brought from home was nearly gone there was a grocery store close at hand and he went in thinking that he would find something to help his meal on the counter he saw some rolls and there was an open barrel of apples not far off what do you charge for your rolls he asked two cents ill take one how do you sell your apples a cent apiece ill take two thus for four cents harry made quite a substantial addition to his meal as he left the store and walked up the road with the roll in his hand eating an apple he called to mind benjamin franklins entrance of philadelphia with a roll under each arm i hope i shall have as good luck as franklin had he thought walking slowly he saw on a small building which he i had just reached the sign post office perhaps the postmaster will know if anybody about here wants a boy harry said to himself at any rate it wont do any harm to inquire he entered finding himself in a small room with one part partitioned off as a repository for mail matter he stepped up to a little window and presently the postmaster an elderly man presented himself what name he asked i havent come for a letter said harry what do you want then asked the official but not roughly do you know of anyone that wants to hire a boy whos the boy i am i want to get a chance to work what kind of work any kind thatll pay my board and a little over i dont know of any place said the postmaster after a little thought isnt there any shoe shop where i could get in that reminds me james leavitt told me this morning that his boy was going to boston to go into a store in a couple of months hes been pegging for his father and i guess theyll have to get somebody in his place harrys face brightened at this intelligence thats just the kind of place id like to get he said where does mr leavitt live a quarter of a mile from here over the bridge youll know it well enough its a cottage house with a shoe shop in the backyard thank you sir said harry ill go there and try my luck wait a minute said the postmaster theres a letter here for mr leavitt if youre going there you may as well carry it along its from boston i shouldnt wonder if its about the place bob leavitt wants ill take it with pleasure said harry it occurred to him that it would be a good introduction for him and pave the way for his application i hope i may get a chance to work for this mr leavitt he said to himself i like the looks of this village i should like to live here for a while he walked up the street crossing the bridge referred to by the postmaster and looked carefully on each side of him for the cottage and shop at length he came to a place which answered the description and entered the yard as he neared the shop he heard a noise which indicated that work was going on inside he opened the door and entered chapter xii the new boarder harry found himself in a room about twentyfive feet by twenty the floor was covered with scraps of leather here stood a deep wooden box containing a case of shoes ready to send off there was a stove in the center in which however as it was a warm day no fire was burning there were three persons present one a man of middle age was mr james leavitt the proprietor of the shop his son robert about seventeen worked at an adjoining bench tom gavitt a journeyman a short thickset man of thirty employed by mr leavitt was the third the three looked up as harry entered the shop i have a letter for mr leavitt said our hero that is my name said the eldest of the party harry advanced and placed it in his hands where did you get this letter at the post office i cant call you by name do you live about here no i came from granton no further questions were asked just then as mr leavitt suspending work opened the letter its from your uncle benjamin he said addressing robert let us see what he has to say he read the letter in silence what does he say father asked robert he says he shall be ready to take you the first of september thats in six weeks a little sooner than we calculated i wish it were a little later as work is brisk and i may find it difficult to fill your place without paying more than i want to i guess you can pick up somebody said robert who was anxious to go to boston as soon as possible wont you hire me asked harry who felt that the time had come for him to announce his business mr leavitt looked at him more attentively have you ever worked in a shop no sir it will take you some time to learn pegging ill work for my board till ive learned but you wont be able to do all i want at first suppose i begin now said harry and work for my board till your son goes away by that time i can do considerable i dont know but thats a good idea said mr leavitt what do you think bob better take him father said robert who felt that it would facilitate his own plans how much would you want after you have learned asked the father i dont know what would be a fair price said harry ill give you three dollars a week and board said mr leavitt after a little consideration that is if i am satisfied with you ill come said harry promptly he rapidly calculated that there would be about twenty weeks for which he would receive pay before the six months expired at the end of which the cow must be paid for this would give him sixty dollars of which he thought he should be able to save forty to send or carry to his father how did you happen to come to me asked mr leavitt with some curiosity i heard at the post office that your son was going to the city to work and i thought i could get in here is your father living yes my father and mother both what business is he in he is a farmer but his farm is small and not very profitable so you thought you would leave home and try something else yes sir well we will try you at shoemaking robert you can teach him what you know about pegging come here said robert what is your name harry walton how old are you fifteen did you ever work much yes on a farm do you think youll like shoemaking better i dont know yet but i think i shall i like almost anything better than farming and i like almost anything better than pegging i began when i was only twelve years old and im sick of it what kind of store is it you are going into dry goods my uncle benjamin streeter mothers brother keeps a dry goods store on washington street itll be jolly living in the city i dont know said harry thoughtfully i think i like a village just as well what sort of a place is granton where you come from its a farming town there isnt any village at all there isnt much going on here therell be more than in granton theres nothing to do there but to work on a farm i shouldnt like that myself but the citys the best of all can you make more money in a store than working in a shoe shop not so much at first but after youve got learned theres better chances theres a clerk that went from here ten years ago that gets fifty dollars a week does he asked harry to whose rustic inexperience this seemed like an immense salary i didnt think any clerk ever got so much they get it often if they are smart said robert here he was wrong however such cases are exceptional and a city fry goods clerk considering his higher rate of expense is no better off than many country mechanics but country boys are apt to form wrong ideas on this subject and are in too great haste to forsake good country homes for long hours of toil behind a city counter and a poor home in a dingy thirdclass city boarding house it is only in the wholesale houses for the most part that high salaries are paid and then of course only to those who have shown superior energy and capacity of course some do achieve success and become rich but of the tens of thousand who come from the country to seek clerkships but a very small proportion rise above a small income i shall have a start robert proceeded for i go into my uncles store i am to board at his house and get three dollars a week thats what your father offers me said harry yes youll earn more after a while and i can now but id rather live in the city theres lots to see in the city theaters circuses and all kinds of amusements you wont have much money to spend on theaters said harry prudently not at first but ill get raised soon i think i should try to save as much as i could out of three dollars a week yes what can you save out of that i expect to save half of it perhaps more i couldnt do that i want a little fun you see my fathers poor i want to help him all i can thats good advice for you bob said mr leavitt save up money and help me robert laughed youll have to wait till i get bigger pay he said your fathers better off than mine said harry of course if he dont need it that makes a difference here the sound of a bell was heard proceeding from the house robert said his father go in and tell your mother to put an extra seat at the table she doesnt know that weve got a new boarder he took off his apron and washed his hands tom gavitt followed his example but didnt go into the house of his employer he lived in a house of his own about five minutes walk distant but left the shop at the same time in a country village the general dinner hour is twelve oclock a very unfashionably early hour but i presume any of my readers who had been at work from seven oclock would have no difficulty in getting up a good appetite at noon robert went in and informed his mother of the new boarder it made no difference for the table was always well supplied this is harry walton mother said mr leavitt our new apprentice he will take bobs place when he goes i am glad to see you said mrs leavitt hospitably you may sit here next to robert what have you got for us today mother asked her husband a pickedup dinner theres some cold beef left over from yesterday and ive made an apple pudding thats good we dont want anything better so harry thought accustomed to the painful frugality of the table at home he regarded this as a splendid dinner and did full justice to it in the afternoon he resumed work in the shop under roberts guidance he was in excellent spirits he felt that he was very fortunate to have gained a place so soon and determined to write home that same evening chapter xiii an invitation declined the summer passed quickly and the time arrived for robert leavitt to go to the city by this time harry was well qualified to take his place it had not been difficult for he had only been required to peg and that is learned in a short time harry however proved to be a quick workman quicker if anything than robert though the latter had been accustomed to the work for several years mr leavitt was well satisfied with his new apprentice and quite content to pay him the three dollars a week agreed upon in fact it diminished the amount of cash he was called upon to pay goodby harry said robert as he saw the coach coming up the road to take him to the railroad station goodby and good luck said harry when you come to the city come and see me i dont think i shall be going very soon i cant afford it you must save up your wages and youll have enough soon ive got another use for my wages bob to buy cigars harry shook his head i shall save it up to carry home well you must try to make my place good in the shop he can do that said mr leavitt slyly but theres one place where he cant equal you where is that at the dinner table youve got me there father said bob goodnaturedly well goodby all heres the stage in a minute more he was gone harry felt rather lonely for he had grown used to working beside him but his spirits rose as he reflected that the time had now come when he should be in receipt of an income three dollars a week made him feel rich in anticipation he looked forward already with satisfaction to the time when he might go home with money enough to pay off his fathers debt to squire green but he was not permitted to carry out his economical purpose without a struggle on saturday evening after he had received his weeks pay luke harrison who worked in a shop near by met him at the post office come along harry he said let us play a game of billiards you must excuse me said harry oh come along said luke taking him by the arm its only twentyfive cents i cant afford it cant afford it now thats nonsense you just changed a twodollar note for those postage stamps i know that but i must save that money for another purpose whats the use of being stingy harry try one game you can get somebody else to play with you luke oh hang it if you care so much for a quarter ill pay for the game myself only come and play harry shook his head i dont want to amuse myself at your expense you are a miser said luke angrily you can call me so if you like said harry firmly but that wont make it so i dont see how you can call yourself anything else if you are so afraid to spend your money i have good reasons what are they i told you once that i had another use for the money to hoard away in an old stocking said luke sneering you may say so if you like said harry turning away he knew he was right but it was disagreeable to be called a miser he was too proud to justify himself to luke who spent all his money foolishly though earning considerably larger wages than he there was one thing that harry had not yet been able to do to any great extent though it was something he had at heart he had not forgotten his motto live and learn and now that he was in a fair way to make a living he felt that he had made no advance in learning during the few weeks since he arrived in glenville the day previous he had heard for the first time that there was a public library in another part of the town which was open evenings though it was two miles distant and he had been at work all day he determined to walk up there and get a book he felt that he was very ignorant and that his advance in the world depended upon his improving all opportunities that might present themselves for extending his limited knowledge this was evidently one after his unsatisfactory interview with luke he set out for the upper village as it was called forty minutes walk brought him to the building in which the library was kept an elderly man had charge of it a mr parmenter can i take out a book asked harry do you live in town yes sir i dont remember seeing you before you dont live in this village do you no sir i live in the lower village what is your name harry walton i dont remember any walton family my father lives in granton i am working for mr james leavitt i have no doubt this is quite correct but i shall have to have mr leavitts certificate to that effect before i can put your name down and trust you with books then cant i take any book tonight asked harry disappointed i am afraid not so it seemed his twomile walk was for nothing he must retrace his steps and come again monday night he was turning away disappointed when dr townley of the lower village who lived near mr leavitt entered the library my wife wants a book in exchange for this mr parmenter he said have you got anything new in ah harry walton how came you here do you take books out of the library thats is what i came up for but the librarian says i must bring a line from mr leavitt telling who i am if dr townley knows you that is sufficient said the librarian he is all right mr parmenter he is a young neighbor of mine that is enough he can select a book harry was quite relieved at this fortunate meeting and after a little reflection selected the first volume of rollins universal history a book better known to our fathers than the present generation thats a good solid book harry said the doctor most of our young people select stories i like stories very much said harry but i have only a little time to read and i must try to learn something you are a sensible boy said the doctor emphatically im afraid there are few of our young people who take such wise views of what is best for them most care only for present enjoyment i have got my own way to make said harry and i suppose that is what influences me my father is poor and cannot help me and i want to rise in the world you are going the right way to work do you intend to take out books often from the library yes sir it will be a long walk from the lower village i would walk farther rather than do without the books i can save you at any rate from walking back my chaise is outside and if you will jump in i will carry you home thank you doctor i shall be very glad to ride on the way dr townley said i have a few miscellaneous book in my medical library which i will lend to you with pleasure if you will come in it may save you an occasional walk to the library harry thanked him and not long afterwards availed himself of the considerate proposal dr townley was liberally educated and as far as his professional engagements would permit kept up with general literature he gave harry some valuable directions as to the books which it would benefit him to read and more than once took him up on the road to the library once a week regularly harry wrote home he knew that his letters would give pleasure to the family and he never allowed anything to interfere with his duty his father wrote we are getting on about as usual the cow does tolerably well but is not as good as the one i lost i have not yet succeeded in laying up anything toward paying for her somehow whenever i have a few dollars laid aside tom wants shoes or your sister wants a dress or some other expense swallows it up harry wrote in reply dont trouble yourself father about your debt to squire green if i have steady work and keep my health i shall have enough to pay it by the time it comes due chapter xiv the tailors customer at the end of six weeks from the date of roberts departure harry had been paid eighteen dollars of this sum he had spent but one dollar and kept the balance in his pocketbook he did not care to send it home until he had enough to meet squire greens demand knowing that his father would be able to meet his ordinary expenses chiefly through the reports of luke harrison he was acquiring the reputation of meanness though as we know he was far from deserving it see how the fellow dresses said luke contemptuously to two of his companions one evening his clothes are shabby enough and he hasnt got an overcoat at all he hoards his money and is too stingy to buy one see there he comes buttoned to the chin to keep warm and i suppose he has more money in his pocketbook than the whole of us together i wouldnt be as mean as he is for a hundred dollars youd rather get trusted for your clothes than do without them said frank heath slyly for he happened to know that luke had run up a bill with the tailor about which the latter was getting anxious what if i do said luke sharply as long as i am going to pay for them oh nothing said frank i didnt say anything against it did i i suppose you are as able to owe the tailor as anyone by this time harry had come up where are you going walton asked luke you look cold yes its a cold day left your overcoat at home didnt you harry colored the fact was he felt the need of an overcoat but didnt know how to manage getting one at the lowest calculation it would cost all the money he had saved up for one and the purchase would defeat all his plans the one he had worn at home during the previous winter was too small for him and had been given to his brother if i only could get through the winter without one he thought i should be all right but a new england winter is not to be braved with impunity useless protected by adequate clothing lukes sneer was therefore not without effect but he answered quietly i did not leave it at home for i have none to leave i suppose you are bound to the tailors to order one what makes you think so asked harry you are not such a fool as to go without one when you have money in your pocket are you you seem very curious about my private affairs said harry rather provoked hes only drumming up customers for the tailor said frank heath he gets a commission on all he brings thats the way he pays his bill said sam anderson quit fooling boys said luke irritated i aint a drummer i pay my bills like a gentleman by keeping the tailor waiting said frank quit that so attention was diverted from harry by this opportune attack upon luke much to our heros relief nevertheless he saw that in order to preserve his health he must have some outer garment and in order the better to decide what to do he concluded to step into the tailors and inquire his prices the tailor merrill by name had a shop over the dry goods store and thither harry directed his steps there was one other person in the shop a young fellow but little larger than harry though two years older who was on a visit to an aunt in the neighborhood but lived in boston he belonged to a rich family and had command of considerable money his name was maurice tudor he had gone into the shop to leave a coat to be repaired how are you walton he said for he knew our hero slightly pretty well thank you its pretty cold for october yes unusually so mr merrill said harry i should like to inquire the price of an overcoat i may want to order one by and by what sort of one do you want pretty nice no i cant afford anything nice something as cheap as possible this is the cheapest goods i have said the tailor pointing to some coarse cloth near by i can make you up a coat from that for eighteen dollars eighteen dollars exclaimed harry in dismay is that the cheapest you have the very cheapest after a minutes pause he added i might take off a dollar for cash ive got enough of running up bills theres luke harrison owes me over thirty dollars and i dont believe he means to pay it al all if i buy i shall pay cash said harry quietly you cant get anything cheaper than this said the tailor very likely not said harry soberly ill think about it and let you know if i decide to take it maurice tudor was a silent listener to this dialogue he saw harrys sober expression and he noticed the tone in which he repeated eighteen dollars and he guessed the truth he lingered after harry went out and said thats a good fellow harry walton repeated the tailor yes hes worth a dozen luke harrisons has he been in the village long no not more than two or three months he works for mr leavitt he is rather poor i suppose yes the boys call him mean but leavitt tells me he is saving up every cent to send to his father who is a poor farmer thats a good thing in him yes i wish i could afford to give him and overcoat he needs one but i suppose seventeen dollars will come rather hard on him to pay if it was luke harrison it wouldnt trouble him much you mean he would get it on tick yes if he found anybody fool enough to trust him ive done it as long as im going to he wont get a dollar more credit out of me till he pays his bill youre perfectly right there so i think he earns a good deal more than walton but spends what he earns on billiards drinks and cigars there he comes up the stairs now in fact luke with his two companions directly afterwards entered the shop merrill said he have you got in any new goods i must have a new pair of pants yes ive got some new goods theres a piece open before you its a pretty thing merrill said luke struck by it whats your price for a pair off of it ten dollars isnt that rather steep no the cloth is superior quality well darn the expense i like it and must have it just measure me will you are you ready to pay the account i have against you how much is it the tailor referred to his books thirtytwo dollars and fifty cents he answered all right merrill wait till the pants are done and ill pay the whole at once aint my credit good blustered luke you can make it good said the tailor significantly i didnt think youd make such a fuss about a small bill i didnt think youd find is so difficult to pay a small bill returned the tailor luke looked discomfited he was silent a moment and then changed his tactics come merrill he said persuasively dont be alarmed im good for it i guess i havent got the money convenient today i lent fifty dollars i shall have it back next week and then i will pay you i am glad to hear it said merrill so just measure me and hurry up the pants im sorry but i cant till you settle the bill look here has walton been talking against me no what makes you think so he dont like me because i twitted him with his meanness i dont consider him mean has he ever bought anything of you no i knew it he prefers to go ragged and save his money hes too honorable to run up a bill without paying it do you mean me demanded luke angrily i hope not i presume you intend to pay your bills luke harrison left the shop he saw that he exhausted his credit with merrill as to paying the bill there was not much chance of that at present as he had but one dollar and a half in his pocket chapter xv by express theres a model for you said the tailor to maurice tudor he wont pay his bills how did you come to trust him in the first place i didnt know him then as well as i do now i make it a practice to accommodate my customers by trusting them for a month or two if they want it but luke harrison isnt one to be trusted i should say not if young walton wants to get an overcoat on credit i shant object i judge something by looks and i am sure he is honest well good night mr merrill youll have my coat done soon yes mr tudor it shall be ready for you tomorrow maurice tudor left the tailors shop revolving a new idea which had just entered his mind now he remembered that he had at home and excellent overcoat which he had worn the previous winter but which was now too small for him he had no younger brother to wear it nor in his circumstances was such economy necessary as well as he could judge by observing harrys figure it would be an excellent fit for him why should he not give it to him the opportunity came on his way home he overtook our hero plunged in thought in fact he was still occupied with the problem of the needed overcoat good evening harry said young tudor good evening mr tudor answered harry are you going back to the city soon in the course of a week or two mr leavitts son is in a store in boston is he not yes i have taken his place in the shop by the way i saw you in merrills this evening yes i was pricing an overcoat i bought this one in boston just before i came away i have a very good one left from last winter but it is too small for me it is of no use to me if i thought you would accept it i would offer it to you harrys heart gave a joyful bound accept it he repeated indeed i will and thank you for your great kindness then i will write home at once to have it sent to me i also have a suit which i have outgrown if you wouldnt be too proud to take it i am not so foolish it will be a great favor i thought you would take it right said maurice well pleased i will also send for the suit i will get my mother to forward them by express they will be as good as money to me said harry and that is not very plenty with me will you tell me something of your circumstances perhaps i may have it in my power to help you harry assured of his friendly interest did not hesitate to give him a full account of his plans in life and especially of his desire to relieve his father of the burden of poverty his straightforward narrative made a very favorable impression upon maurice who could not help reflecting how far superior this boy is to luke harrison and his tribe thank you for telling me all this he said it was not from mere curiosity that i asked i am sure of that said harry thanks to your generosity i shall present a much more respectable appearance besides being made more comfortable three days later a large bundle was brought by the village expressman to mr leavitts door a bundle for you walton said the expressman seeing harry in the yard what is there to pay he asked nothing it was prepaid in the city harry took it up to his room and opened it eagerly first came the promised overcoat it was of very handsome french cloth with a velvet collar and rich silk facings far higher in cost than any mr merrill would have made for him it fitted as if it had been made for him next came not one but two complete suits embracing coat vest and pants one of pepperandsalt cloth the other a dark blue these also so similar was he in figure to maurice fitted him equally well the clothes which he brought with from form granton were not only of coarse material but were far from stylish in cut whereas these garments had been made by a fashionable boston tailor and set off his figure to much greater advantage i wonder what luke harrison will say said our hero to himself smiling as he thought of the surprise of luke at witnessing his transformation ive a great mind to keep these on tonight he said perhaps i shall meet luke he wont have anything more to say about my going without an overcoat after supper harry arrayed in his best suit and wearing the overcoat walked down tot he center of the village luke was standing on the piazza of the tavern luke see how walton is dressed up exclaimed frank heath who was the first to see our hero dressed up repeated luke who was rather shortsighted that would be a good joke hes got a splendid overcoat continued frank whered he get it merrill hasnt been making him one its none of merrills work its too stylish for him by this time harry had come within lukes range of vision the latter surveyed him with astonishment and it must be confessed with disappointment for he had been fond of sneering at harrys clothes and now the latter was far better dressed than himself where did you get that coat walton asked luke the instant harry came up honestly said harry shortly have you got anything else new harry opened his coat and displayed the suit well you are coming out walton thats a fact said frank heath thats a splendid suit i thought you couldnt afford to buy a coat said luke you see ive got one answered harry how much did it cost thats a secret here he left luke and frank well luke what do you say to that said frank heath luke said nothing he was astonished and unhappy he had a fondness for dress and spent a good share of his earnings upon it paying where he must and getting credit besides where he could but he had never had so stylish a suit as this and it depressed him chapter xvi asking a favor there was one other tailor in the village james hayden and to him luke harrison determined to transfer his custom hoping to be allowed to run up a bill with him he did not like his style of cut as well as merrills but from the latter he was cut off unless he would pay the old bill and this would be inconvenient he strolled into james haydens shop and asked to look at some cloth for pants hayden was a shrewd man and knowing that luke was a customer of his neighbor suspected the reason of his transfer however he showed the cloth and a selection having been made measured him when will you have them done asked luke in three days i want them by that time sure of course you pay cash why said luke hesitating i suppose you wont mind giving me a months credit mr hayden shook his head i couldnt do it my goods are already paid for and i have to pay for the work i must have cash merrill always trusted me pleaded luke then why did you leave him why said luke a little taken aback he didnt cut the last clothes exactly to suit me didnt suit you i thought you young people preferred his cut to mine i am oldfashioned hadnt you better go back to merrill ive got tired of him said luke ill get a pair of pants of you and see how i like them ill make them but i cant trust all right ill bring the money said luke who yet thought that he might get off by paying part down when he took the pants the old fellows deuced disobliging said he o frank heath when they got into the street i dont know as i blame him said frank i wish merrill wasnt so stiff about it hes terribly afraid of losing his bill thats where hes right said frank laughing id be the same if i were in his place do you always pay your bills right off said luke yes i do i dont pretend to be a model boy im afraid i keep bad company he continued but i dont owe a cent to anybody except for board and that i pay up at the end of every week luke dropped the subject not finding it to his taste on saturday night he went round to the tailors have you got my pants done mr hayden yes here they are let me see he said how much are they nine dollars ill pay you three dollars tonight and the rest at the end of next week he said very well then you may have them at the end of next week why not now they are done aint they yes said mr hayden but not paid for didnt i tell you id pay three dollars now our terms are cash down you aint afraid of me are you blustered luke you understood when you ordered the pants that they were to be paid for when they were taken i hate to see people so afraid of losing their money do you was that why you left merrill luke colored he suspected that the fact of his unpaid bill at the other tailors was known to mr hayden ive a great mind to leave them on your hands i prefer to keep them on my hands rather than to let them go out of the shop without being paid for frank said luke turning to his companion lend me five dollars cant you im the wrong fellow to ask said he ive got to pay my board and another bill tonight oh let your bills wait and lend you the money thank you i aint so green when should i get the money again next week in a horn no i want to wear the pants tomorrow im going out to ride i dont see unless you fork over the spondulies i cant i havent got enough money see harry walton i dont believe he has got any he bought a lot of clothes last week they must have cost a pile cant help it i saw him open his pocketbook last night and in it was a roll of bills turning to the tailor luke said just lay aside the pants and ill come back for them pretty soon mr hayden smiled to himself theres nothing like fetching up these fellows with a round turn he said no money no clothes thats my motto merrill told me all about that little bill that sent luke harrison over here he dont run up any bill with me if i know myself luke went round to the village store harry walton usually spent a part of every evening in instructive reading and study but after a hard days work he felt it necessary to pass an hour or so in the open air so he came down to the center of center of the village hello walton said luke accosting him with unusual cordiality you are just the fellow i want to see am i inquired harry in surprise for there was no particular friendship or intimacy between them yes im going to ask a little favor of you a mere trifle lend me five or ten dollars for a week five will do it you cant spare more harry shook his head i cant do that luke why not havent you got as much yes ive got it then why wont you lend it to me i have little money and i cant run any risk do you think i wont pay you back why do you need to borrow of me you get much higher wages than i do i want to pay a bill tonight i didnt think youd be so unaccommodating i shouldnt be willing to lend to anyone said harry the money isnt mine i am going to send it home a great sight you are sneered luke i wanted to see just how mean you were youve got the money in your pocket but you wont lend it this taunt did not particularly disturb harry there is a large class like luke who offended at being refused a loan though quite aware that they are never likely to repay it my young readers will be sure to meet specimens of this class against whom the only protection is a very firm and decided no chapter xvii the night scholars immediately after thanksgiving day the winter schools commenced that in the center district was kept by a student of dartmouth college who had leave of absence from the college authorities for twelve weeks in order by teaching to earn something to help defray his college expenses leonard morgan now a junior was a tall strongly made young man of twentytwo whose stalwart frame had not been reduced by his diligent study there were several shoe shops in the village each employing from one to three boys varying in age from fifteen to nineteen why could he not form a private class to meet in the evening to be instructed in advanced arithmetic or if desired in latin and greek he broached the idea to stephen bates the prudential committeeman i dont know said mr bates what our boys will think of it ive got a boy that ill send but whether youll get enough to make it pay i dont know i suppose i can have the schoolhouse mr bates yes there wont be no objection wont it be too much for you after teachin in the daytime it would take a good deal to break me down then youd better draw up a notice and put it up in the store and tavern suggested the committeeman in accordance with this advice the young teacher posted up in the two places the following notice evening school i propose to start an evening school for those who are occupied during the day and unable to attend the district school instruction will be given in such english branches as may be desired and also in latin and greek if any are desirous of pursuing a classical course the school will commence next monday evening at the schoolhouse beginning at seven oclock terms seventy cents a week or five dollars for the term of ten weeks leonard morgan are you going to join the class walton asked frank heath yes said harry promptly wherell you get the money asked luke harrison in a jeering tone i shant have to go far for it i dont see how you can spend so much money i am willing to spend money when i can get my moneys worth said our hero are you going to school no i guess not ive got through my schooling you dont know enough to hurt you do you luke inquired frank heath slyly nor i dont want to i know enough to get along i dont and never expect to said harry do you mean to go to school when youre a grayheaded old veteran asked frank jocosely i may not go to school then but i shant give up learning then said harry smiling one can learn without going to school but while im young i mean to go to school as much as i can i guess youre right said frank id go myself only im too lazy its hard on a feller to worry his brain with study after hes been at work all day i dont believe i was cut out for a great scholar i dont believe you were frank said joe bates you always used to stand pretty well down toward the foot of the class when you went to school a feller cant be smart as well as handsome as long as im goodlooking i wont complain because i wasnt born with the genius of a bates thank you for the compliment frank though i suppose it means that i am homely i havent got any genius or education to spare when monday evening arrived ten pupils presented themselves of whom six were boys or young men and four were girls leonard morgan felt encouraged a class of ten though paying but five dollars each would give him fifty dollars which would be quite an acceptable addition to his scanty means i am glad to see so many he said i think our evening class will be a success i will take your names and ascertain what studies you wish to pursue when he came to harry he asked what do you propose to study i should like to take up algebra and latin if you are willing answered our hero have you studied either at all no sir i have not had an opportunity how far have you been in arithmetic through the square and cube root if you have been so far you will have no difficulty with algebra as to latin one of the girls wishes to take up that and i will put you in the class with her it will be seen that harry was growing ambitious he didnt expect to go to college though nothing would have pleased him better but he felt that some knowledge of a foreign language could do him no harm franklin whom he had taken as his great exemplar didnt go to college yet he made himself one of the foremost scientific men of the age and acquired enduring reputation not only as a statesman and a patriot but chiefly as a philosopher a little later leonard morgan came round to the desk at which harry was sitting i brought a latin grammar with me he said thinking it probable some one might like to begin that language you can use it until yours comes thank you said harry and he eagerly took the book and asked to have a lesson set which was done i can get more than that he said how much more twice as much still later he recited the double lesson and so correctly that the teachers attention was drawn to him thats a smart boy he said i mean to take pains with him what a pity he cant go to college chapter xviii lost or stolen harry learned rapidly at the end of four weeks he had completed the latin grammar or that part of it which his teacher thought necessary for a beginner to be familiar with and commenced translating the easy sentences in andrews latin reader you are getting on famously harry said his teacher i never had a scholar who advanced so i wish i knew as much as you dont give me too much credit when i compare myself with our professors i feel dissatisfied but you know so much more than i do said harry i ought to i am seven years older what are you going to study mr morgan i intend to study law i should like to be an editor said harry but i dont see much prospect of it why not an editor must know a good deal there are some who dont said leonard morgan with a smile however you would like to do credit to the profession and it is certainly in these modern days a very important profession how can i prepare myself by doing your best to acquire a good education not only by study but by reading extensively an editor should be a man of large information have you ever practiced writing compositions a little not much if you get time to write anything and will submit it to me i will point out such faults as i may notice i should like to do that said harry promptly what subject shall i take you may choose your own subject dont be too ambitious but select something upon which you have some ideas of your own suppose i take my motto live and learn do so by all means that is a subject upon which you may fairly be said to have some ideas of your own in due time harry presented a composition on this subject the thoughts were good but as might be expected the expression was somewhat crude and of course the teacher found errors to correct and suggestions to make these harry eagerly welcomed and voluntarily proposed to rewrite the composition the result was a very much improved draft he sent a copy home and received in reply a letter from his father expressing surprise and gratification at the excellence of his essay i am glad harry the letter concluded that you have formed just views of the importance of learning i have never ceased to regret that my own opportunities for education were so limited and that my time has been so much absorbed by the effort to make a living that i have been able to do so little toward supplying my deficiencies even in a pecuniary way an education will open to you a more prosperous career and lead i hope to competence instead of the narrow poverty which has been my lot i will not complain of my own want of success if i can see my children prosper but while intent upon cultivating his mind harry had not lost sight of the great object which had sent him from home to seek employment among strangers he had undertaken to meet the note which his father had given squire green in payment for the cow by the first of december he had saved up thirtythree dollars toward this object by the middle of january the note would come due of course he had not saved so much without the strictest economy and by denying himself pleasures which were entirely proper for instance he was waited upon by luke harrison on the first day of december and asked to join in a grand sleighing excursion to a town ten miles distant where it was proposed to take supper and after a social time return late in the evening i would like to go said harry who was strongly tempted for he was by no means averse to pleasure but i am afraid i cannot how much will it cost three dollars apiece that pays for the supper too harry shook his head it was for rum a weeks wages if he were not trying to save money for his father he might have ventured to incur this expense but he felt that under present circumstances it would not be best i cant go said harry oh come along urged luke dont make such a mope of yourself youll be sure to enjoy it i know i should but i cant afford it i never knew a feller that thought so much of money as you sneered luke i suppose it looks so said harry but it isnt true everybody says you are a miser i have good reasons for not going if you would come it would make the expense lighter for the rest of us and you would have a jolly time this conversation took place as they were walking home from the store in the evening harry pulled out his handkerchief suddenly from his pocket and with it came his pocketbook containing all his savings he didnt hear if fall but luke did and the latter moreover suspected what it was he did not call harrys attention to it but falling back said ive got to go back to the store i forgot something good night good night said harry unsuspiciously luke stooped swiftly while our heros back was turned and picked up the pocketbook he slipped it into his own pocket and instead of going back to the store went to his own room locked the door and then eagerly pulled out the pocketbook and counted the contents thirtythree dollars what a miser that fellow is it serves him right to lose his money chapter xix an unwelcome visitor luke harrison had picked up harrys pocketbook and though knowing it to be his concealed the discovery upon the impulse of the moment what i find is mine he said to himself of course it is harry walton deserves to lose his money it will be seen that he had already decided to keep the money it looked so tempting to him as his eyes rested on the thick roll of bills for though insignificant in amount the bills were ones and twos and twenty in number that he could not make up his mind to return it luke was fond of new clothes he wanted to reestablish his credit with merrill for he was in want of a new coat and knew that it would be useless to order one unless he had some money to pay on account he decided to use a part of harrys money for this purpose it would be better however he thought to wait a day or two as the news of the loss would undoubtedly spread abroad and his order might excite suspicion particularly as he had been in harrys company at the time the money disappeared he therefore put the pocketbook into his trunk and carefully locked it then he went to bed meanwhile harry reached mr leavitts unconscious of the serious misfortune which had befallen him he went into the sitting room and talked a while with mr leavitt and at ten oclock took his lamp and went up to bed while he was undressing he felt in his pocket for his money intending to lock it up in his trunk as usual his dismay may be conceived when he could not find it poor harry sank into a chair with that sudden sinking of the heart which unlookedfor misfortune brings and tried to think where he could have left the pocketbook that evening he found himself under the necessity of buying a necktie at the store and so had taken it from his trunk could he have left it on the counter no he distinctly remembered replacing it in his pocket he felt the need of consulting with somebody and with his lamp in his hand went downstairs again you havent concluded to sit up all night have you asked mr leavitt surprised at his reappearance are you sick harry asked mrs leavitt youre looking dreadfully pale ive lost my pocketbook said harry how much was there in it asked his employer thirtythree dollars answered harry whew thats a good deal of money to lose i shouldnt want to lose so much myself when did you have it last harry told his story mr leavitt listening attentively and you came right home yes alone no luke harrison came with me are you two thick together not at all he doesnt like me and i dont fancy him what was he talking about he wanted me to join a sleighing party what did you say i said i couldnt afford it then he charged me with being a miser as he often does did he come all the way home with you no he left me at deacon brewsters he said he must go back to the store there is something queer about this said mr leavitt shrewdly do you want my advice yes i wish you would advise me for i dont know what to do then go to the store at once ask but without attracting any attention if luke came back there after leaving you then ask mr meade the storekeeper whether he noticed you put back your pocketbook but i know i did then it will be well to say nothing about it at least publicly if you find that lukes excuse was false and that he did not go back go at once to his boarding place and ask him whether he saw you drop the pocketbook you might have dropped it and he picked it up suppose he says no then we must watch whether he seems flush of money for the next few days this seemed to harry good advice he retraced his steps to the store carefully looking for the lost pocketbook but of course it was not to be seen and he entered the store troubled and out of spirits i thought you went home harry said frank heath you see i am here again said our hero time to shut up shop said mr meade the storekeeper you boys will have to adjourn till tomorrow wheres luke harrison asked frank heath didnt he go out with you yes but he left me some time ago he came back here didnt he no he hasnt been here since he spoke of coming said harry he wanted me to join that sleighing party good night boys said the storekeeper significantly they took the hint and went out their way lay in different directions and they parted company now i must call on luke said harry to himself i hope he found the pocketbook he wouldnt be wicked enough to keep it but he was not quite so sure of this as he would like to have been he felt almost sick as he thought of the possibility that he might never recover the money which he had saved so gladly though with such painful economy it represented the entire cash earnings of eleven weeks luke harrison boarded with a mr glenham a carpenter and it was at his door that harry knocked is luke harrison at home he inquired of mrs glenham who opened the door at home and abed i reckon she replied i know its late mrs glenham but it is about a matter of importance that i wish to see luke i reckon its about the sleighing party no it is quite another thing i wont stay but minute well i suppose you can go up harry went upstairs and knocked ordinarily luke would have been asleep for generally he sank to sleep five minutes after his head touched the pillow but tonight the excitement of his dishonest intention kept him awake and he started uneasily when he heard the knock whos there he called out from the bed its i harry walton hes come about that pocketbook thought luke im in bed he answered i want to see you a minute on a matter of importance come tomorrow morning i must see you now oh well come in if you must said luke chapter xx you seem to be in an awful hurry to see me said luke grumbling i was just getting to sleep ive lost my pocketbook have you seen it have i seen it thats a strange question how should i have seen it i lost it on the way from the store to the house do you mean to charge me with taking it i havent said anything of the sort said harry but you were with me and i thought you might have seen it drop out of my pocket did you drop it out of your pocket i cant think of any other way i could lose it of course i havent seen it was that all you woke me up about is that all you talk as if it was a little thing losing thirtythree dollars thirtythree dollars repeated luke pretending to be surprised you dont mean to say youve lost all that yes i do well said luke yawning i wish i could help you but i cant good night good night said harry turning away disappointed what success harry inquired mr leavitt who had deferred going to bed in order to hear his report none at all answered harry is there anything by which you can identify any of the bills yes answered harry with sudden recollection i dropped a penful of ink on one of the bills a twodollar note just in the center i had been writing a letter and the bill lay on the table near by good said mr leavitt now supposing luke has taken this money how is he likely to spend it at the tailors most likely he is always talking about new clothes but lately he hasnt had any because merrill shut down on him on account of an unpaid bill then you had better see merrill and ask him to take particular notice of any bills that luke pays him innocence must often be suspected or guilt would never be detected it is the only way to get on the track of the missing bills harry saw that this was reasonable and decided to call on merrill the next day do you think luke took it asked the tailor i dont know i dont like to suspect him i havent much opinion of luke he owes me a considerable bill he prefers your clothes to haydens and if he has the money he will probably come here and spend some of it suppose he does what do you want me to do to examine the bills he pays you and if you find an ink spot on the center of one let me know i understand i think i can manage it my money was mostly in ones and twos that may help you i will bear it in mind two days afterwards luke harrison met harry have you found your money walton he asked no and i am afraid i never shall said our hero what do you think has become of it thats just what i would like to find out said harry the only thing you can do is to grin and bear it and be more careful next time of course hes given it up said luke to himself i think i can venture to use some of it now ill go round to merrills and see what hes got in the way of pants accordingly he strolled into merrills that evening got any new cloths in merrill asked luke ive got some new cloths for pants thats just what i want youre owing me a bill how much is it some over thirty dollars i cant pay it all but ill tell you what ill do ill pay you fifteen dollars on account and you can make me a new pair of pants will that answer all right of course id rather youd pay the whole bill still i want to be accommodating let me look at your cloths the tailor displayed a variety of cloths one of which suited lukes fancy heres fifteen dollars he said just credit me with that on the bill will you all right said merrill he proceeded to count the money which consisted of consisted of ones and twos and instantly came to the conclusion that it was from harrys missing pocketbook particularly as he came upon the identical note with the blot in the center unaware of the manner in which he had betrayed himself luke felt quite complacent over his reestablished credit and that without any expense to himself have you got any new cloth for coats he asked i shall have some new cloths in next week all right when will you have the pants done you may call round in two or three days just make em in style merrill and ill send all my friends here very well i hope youll soon be able to pay me the balance of my bill oh yes to be sure you wont have to wait long he swaggered out of the shop lighting a cigar my young friend soliloquized the tailor watching his exit you have walked into my trap neatly colman turning to a young man present at the time did you see luke harrison pay me this money yes to be sure do you see this blot on one of the bills a two yes what of it nothing i only called your attention to it i dont see what there is strange about that anybody might get ink on a bill mightnt he of course colman was puzzled he could not understand why he should have been called upon to notice such a trifle but the tailor had his reasons he wanted to be able to prove by colmans testimony that the blotted bill was actually put into his hands by luke harrison chapter xxi in the tailors power is that the bill you spoke of walton asked the tailor on harrys next visit to the shop yes said harry eagerly where did you get it you can guess from luke harrison yes he paid me last evening fifteen dollars on account this note was among those he paid me it is mine i can swear to it the rest of the money was yours no doubt what shall i do mr merrill the money is yours and i will restore it to you after seeing luke i will send for him to be here at seven oclock this evening as luke was at work in his shop that day the tailors boy came in with a note luke opened it and read as follows will you call at my shop at seven this evening about the pants you ordered henry merrill tell your father ill come said luke at seven oclock he entered the tailors shop once more well merrill what do you want to see me about he asked have you cut the pants no you havent i wanted you to go to work on them at once i know but it was necessary to see you first why didnt you take the measure right luke said mr merrill looking him steadily in the eye where did you get that money you paid me where did i get the money repeated luke flushing up what makes you ask me that question isnt it good money tisnt counterfeit is it i asked you where you got it from from the man i work for to be sure said luke will you swear to that i dont see the use cant you take my word i may as well tell you that harry walton recognizes one of the bills as a part of the money he lost he does does he said luke boldly thats all nonsense bills all look alike this one has a drop of ink just in the center he remembered having dropped a blot upon it what have i to do with that it is hardly necessary to explain the evening he lost the money you were with him two days after you pay me one of the bills which he lost said the tailor do you mean to say i stole em demanded luke it looks like it unless you can explain how you came by the blotted bill i dont believe i paid you the bill very likely it was some one else i thought you would say that so i called colmans attention to it however if your employer admits paying you the bills of course you are all right luke remembered very well that he was paid in fives and that such an appeal would do him no good does walton know this he asked sinking into a chair and wiping the perspiration from his brow yes he suspected you id like to choke him said luke fiercely the miserly scoundrel it seems to me he is justified in trying to recover his money what have you done with the rest of it tell me what will be done to me said luke sullenly i didnt steal it i only picked it up when he dropped it he deserves to lose it for being so careless why didnt you tell him you had found it i meant to give it to him after a while i only wanted to keep it long enough to frighten him that was dangerous particularly as you used it i meant to give him back other money i dont think that excuse will avail you in court court of justice repeated luke turning pale he wont have me taken up will he he will unless you arrange to restore all the money ive paid you part of it that i shall hand over to him have you the rest ive spent a few dollars ive got eight dollars left you had better give it to me reluctantly luke drew out his pocketbook and passed the eight dollars to mr merrill now when will you pay the rest in a few weeks said luke that wont do how much do you earn a week fifteen dollars how much do you pay for board four dollars then you will be able to pay eleven dollars at the end of this week i cant get along without money said luke you will have to till you pay back the money unless you prefer appearing before a court of justice luke was just going out when the tailor called him back i believe you owe me thirty dollars when are you going to pay it i cant pay it yet a while said luke i think you had better said the tailor quietly ill pay you as soon as i can you make eleven dollars a week over and above your board and spend it on drink billiards and fast horses you are fully able to pay for your clothes promptly and i advise you to do it ill pay you as soon as i can if you neglect to do it i may as well tell you that i shall let it be known that you stole waltons pocketbook an expression of alarm overspread lukes face and he hastily made the required promise but he added i didnt steal it i only found it the whole story would be told and people might think as they pleased but it is much better for you to avoid all this by paying your bills luke harrison left the tailors shop in a very unhappy and disgusted frame of mind if i had the sense to wait till it blew over he said to himself i should have escaped all this i didnt think merrill would act so mean now im in for paying his infernal bill besides its too bad just then he came upon frank heath who hailed him luke come and play a game of billiards if youll promise not to beat me i havent got a cent of money you havent what have you done with those bills you had this afternoon ive paid em over to merrill said luke hesitating he was in a deuced stew about his bill when are your pants going to be ready i dont know said luke with a pang of sorrow merrills making them isnt he he says he wont till i pay the whole bill seems to me your credit aint very good luke its good enough be hes hard up for money i guess hes going to fail if youll lend me a couple of dollars ill go around and have a game frank heath laughed youll have to go to some one else luke he said luke passed a disagreeable evening cut off by his want of money from his ordinary amusements and depressed by the thought that things would be no better till he had paid his bills he lounged about feeling that he was a victim of ill luck it did not occur to him that that ill luck was of his own bringing chapter xxii the coming of the magician the week passed and luke carefully avoided our hero going so far as to cross the street so as not to meet him on saturday evening according to his arrangement luke was to have paid the surplus of his wages after meeting his board bill to mr merrill for harry but he did not go near him on monday the tailor meeting him inquired why he had not kept his agreement the fact is said luke i have been unlucky how unlucky i had my wages loose in my pocket and managed to lose them somehow that is very singular said the tailor suspiciously why is it singular asked luke didnt harry walton lose his money you seem to have lost yours at a very convenient time its hard on me said luke owing so much i want to pay as quick as i can so as to have my wages to myself dont you see that where do you think you lost the money im sure i dont know said luke well said merrill dryly i hope you will take better care of your wages next saturday evening i mean to i cant afford to lose anymore i dont believe a word of what he says about losing his money said the tailor privately to harry i think its only a trick to get rid of paying you dont you think hell pay me asked harry he wont if he can help it was the answer hes a slippery customer i believe his money is in his pocket at this moment mr merrill was not quite right but it was only as to the whereabouts of the money it was in lukes trunk he intended to run away leaving all his creditors in the lurch this was the new way to pay old debts which occurred to luke as much the easiest the next saturday evening mr merrill waited in vain for a call from his debtor what excuse will he have now he thought on monday morning he learned that luke had left town without acquainting anyone with his destination it transpired also that he was owing at his boarding house for two weeks board he was thus enabled to depart with nearly thirty dollars for parts unknown hes a hard case said mr merrill to harry i am afraid he means to owe us for a long time to come where do you think he is gone asked harry i have no idea he has evidently been saving up money to help him out of town sometime we may get upon his track and compel him to pay up that wont do me much good said harry despondently and then he told the tailor why he wanted the money now he concluded i shant be able to have the money ready in time youll have most of it ready wont you i think i will i would lend you the money myself said the tailor but ive got a heavy payment to meet and some of my customers are slow pay though i have not many as bad as luke harrison thank you mr merrill said harry i am as much obliged to you as if you could lend the money but it is said that misfortunes never come singly the very next day mr leavitt received a message from the wholesale dealer to whom he sold his shoes that the market was glutted and sales slow i shall not want any more goods for a month or two the letter concluded i will let you know when i more mr leavitt read this letter aloud in the shop so it seems we are to have a vacation he said thats the worst of the shoe trade it isnt steady when its good everybody rushes into it and the market soon gets overstocked then theres no work for weeks this was a catastrophe for which harry was no prepared he heard the announcement with a grave face for to him it was a serious calamity twentythree dollars were all that he had saved from the money lost and this would be increased by a dollar or two only when he had settled up with mr leavitt if he stayed here did not obtain work he must pay his board and that would soon swallow up his money could he get work in any other shop that was an important question do you think i can get into any other shop in town he inquired anxiously of mr leavitt you can try harry but i guess youll find others no better off than i this was not very encouraging but harry determined not to give up without an effort he devoted the next day to going around among the shoe shops but everywhere he met with unfavorable answers some had ready suspended others were about to do so it seems as if all my money must go thought harry looking despondently at his little hoard first the ten dollars luke harrison stole then work stopped i dont know but it would be better for me to go home but the more harry thought of this the less he liked it it would be an inglorious ending to his campaign probably now he would not be able to carry out his plan of paying for the cow but if his father should lose it he might be able if he found work to buy him another squire greens cow was not the only cow in the world and all would not be lost if he could not buy her i wont give up yet said harry pluckily i must expect to meet with some bad luck i suppose everybody does somethingll turn up for me if i try to make it this was good philosophy waiting passively for something to turn up is bad policy and likely to lead to disappointment but waiting actively ready to seize any chance that may offer is quite different the world is full of chances and from such chances so seized has been based many a prosperous career during his first idle day harrys attention was drawn to a handbill which had been posted up in the store the post office the tavern and other public places in the village it was to this effect professor henderson the celebrated magician will exhibit his wonderful feats of magic and sleight of hand in the town hall this evening commencing at oclock in the course of the entertainment he will amuse the audience by his wonderful exhibition of ventriloquism in which he is unsurpassed tickets cents children under twelve cents in a country village where amusements are few such entertainments occupy a far more important place than in a city where amusements abound are you going to the exhibition walton asked frank heath i dont know said harry better come itll be worth seeing in spite of his economy our hero wanted to go the professors stopping at the tavern come over and we may see him said frank chapter xxiii the ventriloquist the boys went into the public room of the tavern in the center was a stove around which were gathered a miscellaneous crowd who had assembled as usual to hear and talk over the news of the day at the farther end of the room was a bar where liquor and cigars were sold the walls of the room which was rather lowstudded were ornamented by sundry notices and posters of different colors with here and there an engraving of no great artistic excellence one representing a horse race another a steamer of the cunard line and still another the presidents of the united states grouped together with washington as the central figure have a cigar walton asked frank heath no thank you frank you havent got so far along hey i dont think it would do me any good said harry maybe not but jolly comfortable on a cold night the worst of it is its mighty expensive frank walked up to the bar and bought a tencent cigar he returned and sat down on a settee the magician isnt here said harry hush he is here said frank in a low voice as the door opened and a tall portly man entered the room professor henderson for it was he walked up the bar and followed frank heaths example in the purchase of a cigar then he glanced leisurely round the apartment apparently his attention was fixed by our hero for he walked up to him and said young man i would like to speak to you all right sir said harry in surprise if you are not otherwise occupied will you accompany me to my room certainly sir returned harry in fresh wonder perhaps hes going to take in walton as partner frank heath suggested to tom frisbie i wonder what he want anyway said frisbie why didnt he take you because im too sharp said frank i should see through his tricks meanwhile harry had entered the professors chamber sit down said the magician ill tell you what i want of you i want you to take tickets at the door of hall tonight can you do it yes sir said harry promptly it seems easy enough said the professor but not everyone can do it rapidly without making mistakes are you quick at figures i am usually considered so said our hero i wont ask whether you are honest for you would so of course i hope commenced harry i know what you are going to say but there is no need of saying it interrupted the magician i judge from your face which is an honest one i have traveled about a good deal and i am a good judge of faces you shall not be disappointed sir i know that in advance now tell me if you are at work or do you attend school i have been at work in a shoe shop in this village sir not now no sir business is dull and work has given out what are you going to do next anything by which i can earn an honest living thats the way to talk ill take you into my employ if you have no objection to travel objection to travel who ever heard of a boy of fifteen who had an objection to travel but will your parents consent that is the next question i dont want to entice any boys away from home against their parents consent my parents do not live here they live farther north in the town of granton granton i never was there is it a large place no sir it is a very small place my father consented to have me leave home and he will have no objection to my earning my living in any honest way well my young friend i can assure you that my way is an honest one though i frankly confess i do my best to deceive the people who come to my entertainments what is it you want me to do sir partly what you are going to do tonight take tickets at the door but that is not all i have to carry about considerable apparatus and i need help about arranging it sometimes also i need help in my experiments i had a young man with me but he is taken down with a fever and obliged to go home it is not likely as his health is delicate that he will care to resume his position i must have somebody in his place i have no doubt you will answer my purpose how much pay do you give sir a practical question said the professor smiling to begin with of course i pay traveling expenses and i can offer you five dollars a week besides will that be satisfactory yes sir said harry his heart giving a great throb of exultation as he realized that his new business would give him two dollars week more than his work in the shop besides being a good deal more agreeable since it would give him a chance to see a little of the world can you start with me tomorrow morning yes sir then it is settled but it is time you were at the hall i will give you a supply of small bills and change as you may have to change some bills he drew from his side pocket a wallet which he placed in the hands of our hero this wallet contains twenty dollars he said of course you will bring me back that amount in addition to what you take at the door this evening very well sir you can wait for me at the close of the evening and hand me all together now go over to the hall as the doors are to be open at half past seven oclock when frank heath and his companion went over to the town hall they found harry making change hello walton said frank are you the treasurer of this concern it seems so said harry youll let in your friends for nothing wont you not much i charge them double price well heres our money i say tom i wonder the old fellow didnt take me instead of walton thats easily told you dont look honest enough oh if it comes to that he passed over you too tom he wouldnt insult a gentleman of my dignity come on theres room on the front seat harry was kept busy till ten minutes after eight by that time about all who intended to be present were in the hall and the magician was gratified by seeing that it was crowded he was already well known in the village having been in the habit of visiting it every for years and his reputation for dexterity and especially for ventriloquism had called out this large audience the professors tricks excited great wonder in the younger spectators i will only dwell slightly on his ventriloquism when he came to this part of the entertainment he said will any young gentleman assist me frank heath immediately left his seat and took up his position beside the professor now sir said the professor i want to ask you a question or two will you answer me truly a gruff voice appeared to proceed from franks mouth saying yes sir are you married sir again the same gruff voice answered yes sir i wish i wasnt to the great delight of the small boys indeed sir i hope your wife doesnt make it uncomfortable for you she licks me frank appeared to answer i am sorry what does she lick you with with a broomstick frank looked foolish and there was a general laugh i hope she doesnt treat you so badly very often sir yes she does every day was the answer if she knowed i was up here telling you shed beat me awful in that case sir i wont be cruel enough to keep you here any longer take my advice sir and get a divorce so i will by hokey and frank amid hearty laughter resumed his seat not having uttered a word the professor being responsible for the whole conversation chapter xxiv harrys letter during harrys absence the little household at granton had got along about as usual they lived from hand to mouth it required sharp financiering to provide food and clothes for the little family there was one neighbor who watched their progress sharply and this was squire green it will be remembered that he had bound mr walton to forfeit ten dollars if at the end of six months he was not prepared to pay the forty dollars and interest which he had agreed to pay for the cow it is a proof of the mans intense meanness that though rich while his neighbor was poor he was strongly in hopes that the latter would incur the forfeit and be compelled to pay it one morning squire green accosted mr walton the squire being at work in his own front yard good morning neighbor walton he said good morning squire how is that cow adoin pretty well shes a good cow not so good as the one i lost youre jokin now neighbor it was my best cow i wouldnt have sold her except to obleege she doesnt give as much milk as my old one sho i guess you dont feed her as well as i did she fares just as well as the other one did of course i dont know how you fed her she allers had her fill when she was with me le me see how long is it since i sold her to ye though the squire apparently asked for information he knew the time to a day and was not likely to forget its between four and five months i believe jusso you was to be ready to pay up at the end of six months that was the agreement youd better be asavin up for it there isnt much chance of my saving its all i can do to make both ends meet you dont say so said the squire secretly pleased my farm is small and poor and doesnt yield much but you work out dont you when i get a chance you dont want any help do you squire i might work off part of the debt that way mebbe next spring id like some help that will be too late to meet my note unless youll renew ill see about it said the squire evasively what do you hear from that boy of yours is he doin well hes at work in a shoe shop does it pay well he doesnt get much just at first then he wont be able to pay for the cow thought the squire thats what i wanted to know hed better have gone to work for me he said no i think he will do better away from home he will get a good trade that he can fall back upon hereafter even if he follows some other business wal i never learned no trade but ive got along middlin well said the squire in a complacent tone farmins good enough for me i would say the same if i had your farm squire you wouldnt exchange would you thats a good joke neighbor walton when i make up my mind to do it ill let you know what a mean old curmudgeon he is thought hiram walton as he kept on his way to the village store he evidently intends to keep me to my agreement and will exact the ten dollars in case i cant pay for the cow at the appointed time it will be nothing but a robbery this was not the day for a letter from harry but it occurred to mr walton to call at the post office contrary to his anticipations a letter was handed him i wont open it till i get home he said to himself ive got a letter from harry he said as he entered the house a letter from harry it isnt his day for writing said mrs walton what does he say i havent opened the letter yet here tom open and read it aloud tom opened the letter and read as follows dear father i must tell you to begin with that i have been compelled to stop work in the shoe shop the market is overstocked and trade has become very dull of course i felt quite bad when mr leavitt told me this for i feared it would prevent my helping you pay for the cow as i want so much to do i went round to several other shops hoping to get in but i found it impossible still i have succeeded in getting something to do that will pay me better than work in the shop if you were to guess all day i dont believe you would guess what business it is so to relieve your suspense i will tell you that i have engaged as assistant to professor henderson the famous magician and ventriloquist and am to start tomorrow on a tour with him assistant to a magician exclaimed mrs walton what does the boy know about magic its a bully business said tom enthusiastically i only wish i was in harrys shoes id like to travel round with a magician firstrate youre too thickheaded tom said marry shut up said tom i guess im as smart as you any day be quiet both of you said mr walton now tom go on with your brothers letter tom proceeded i am to take money at the door we are going about in the southern part of the state and shall visit some towns in massachusetts the professor says you know ive never been round any and i shall like traveling and seeing new places professor henderson is very kind and i think i shall like him he pays my traveling expenses and five dollars a week which is nearly twice as much money as i got from mr leavitt i cant help thinking i am lucky in getting so good a chance only a day after i lost my place in the shoe shop i hope yet to be able to pay for the cow when the money comes due love to all at home harry harrys lucky said mary he can get along he is fortunate to find employment at once said his father though something which he can follow steadily is better but the pay is good and i am glad he has it how long it seems since harry was at home said his mother i wish i could see him yes it would be pleasant said mr walton but the boy has his own way to make so we will be thankful that he is succeeding so well chapter xxv a strange companion at ten oclock the next day harry presented himself at the hotel he carried in his hand a carpetbag lent him by mr leavitt which contained his small stock of underclothing his outside suits he left at mr leavitts not wishing to be encumbered with them while traveling i see you are on time said the professor yes sir i always mean to be thats well now if youll jump into my buggy with me we will ride round to the town hall and take in my apparatus i have to keep a carriage said the magician as they rode along it saves me a great deal of trouble by making me independent of cars and stages the apparatus was transferred to a trunk in the back part of the buggy and securely locked now we are all ready said professor henderson would you like to drive yes sir answered harry with alacrity i am going to give an entertainment in holston this evening said his new employer were you ever there no sir it is a smart little place and although the population is not large i always draw a full house how far is it sir about six miles harry was sorry it was not farther as he enjoyed driving his companion leaned back at his ease and talked on various subjects he paused a moment and harry was startled by hearing a stifled childs voice just behind him oh let me out dont keep me locked up here the reins nearly fell from his hands he turned and heard the voice apparently proceeding from the trunk whats the matter asked professor henderson i thought i heard a childs voice so you did said the voice again the truth flashed upon harry his companion was exerting some of his powers as a ventriloquist oh it is you sir he said smiling his companion smiled you are right he said i dont see how you can do it said harry practice my boy but practice wouldnt make everybody a ventriloquist would it most persons might become ventriloquists though in an unequal degree i often amuse myself by making use of it for playing practical jokes upon people do you see that old lady ahead yes sir ill offer her a ride if she accepts youll see sport i shall make you talk but you must be careful to say nothing yourself a few rods farther on they overtook an old woman good morning maam said the professor wont you get in and ride its easier riding than walking the old women scanned his countenance and answered thank you sir im obleeged to ye i dont mind if i do she was assisted into the carriage and sat at one end of the seat harry being in the middle i was going to see my darter nancy said the old women mrs nehemiah babcock her name is mebbe you know her husband i dont think i do said the professor hes got a brother in boston in the dry goods business mebbe youve been at his store mebbe i have i ginerally call to see my darter her name is nancy once a week but its rather hard for me to walk now im getting on in years youre most eighty aint you appeared to proceed from harrys mouth our heros face twitched and he had hard work to keep from laughing indeed im not said the old lady indignantly im only sixtyseven and folks say i dont look moren sixty and the old lady looked angrily at harry you must excuse him maam said the professor soothingly he is no judge of a ladys age i should think not indeed indeed madam you are very young looking the old lady was pacified by this compliment but looked askance at harry is he your son no maam the old lady sniffed as if to say so much the better for you are you travelin far asked the old lady what do you want to know for harry appeared to ask youre a sassy boy exclaimed the old woman harry said professor henderson gravely how often have i told you not to be so unmannerly he orter be whipped said the old lady ef i had a boy that was so sassy id larn him manners im glad i aint your boy harry appeared to reply i declare i wont ride another step if you let him insult me so said the old woman glaring at our hero professor henderson caught her eye and significantly touched his forehead giving her to understand that harry was only halfwitted you dont say so she ejaculated taking the hint at once how longs he been so ever since he was born aint you afraid to have him drive oh not at all he understands horses as well as i do whats his name before the professors answer could be heard harry appeared to rattle off the extraordinary name george washington harry jefferson ebenezer popkins my gracious has he got all them names why not what have you got to say about it old women said the same voice oh i aint got no objection said the old woman you may have fiftyleven names ef you want to i dont interfere with his names said the professor if he chooses to call himself george washington harry jefferson ebenezer popkins repeated the voice with great volubility if he chooses to call himself by all those names im sure i dont care how far do you go maam about quarter of a mile farther the professor saw that he must proceed to his final joke let me out dont keep me locked up here said the childs voice from behind in a pleading tone whats that asked the startled old lady whats what asked the professor innocently that child that wants to get out you must have dreamed it my good lady no there tis agin said the old lady excited its in the trunk behind you said the assumed voice appearing to proceed from our hero so tis said the old lady turning halfway round oh i shall die let me out let me out hes locked up his little girl in the trunk harry seemed to say you wicked man let her out this minute said the old lady very much excited dont you know no better than to lock up a child where she cant get no air there is no child in the trunk i assure you said professor henderson politely dont you believe him said harrys voice do let me out father implored the childs voice if you dont open the trunk ill have you took up for murder said the old lady i will open it to show you are mistaken the professor got over the seat and opening the trunk displayed its contents to the astonished old lady i told you that there was no child there he said but you would not believe me le me out gasped the old woman id rather walk i never heerd of such strange goins on afore if you insist upon it madam but im sorry to lose your company take this with you and read it he handed her one of his bills which she put in her pocket saying she couldnt see to read it when they were far enough off to make it safe harry gave vent to his mirth which he had restrained till this at difficulty and laughed long and loud chapter xxvi pages from the past what will the old lady think of you said harry she will have a very bad opinion till she puts on her specs and read the bill that will explain all i shouldnt be surprised to see her at my entertainment i wonder if shell recognize me said harry no doubt as soon as she learns with whom she rode shell be very curious to come and see me perform how old were you when you began to be a ventriloquist i was eighteen i accidentally made the discovery and devoted considerable time to perfecting myself in it before acquainting anyone with it that idea came later you see when i was twentyone with a little property which i inherited from my uncle i went into business for myself but i was young and inexperienced in management and the consequence was that in about two years i failed i found it difficult to get employment as a clerk business being very dull at the time while uncertain what to do one of my friends to whom i had communicated my power induced me to give me a public entertainment combining with it a few tricks of magic which i had been able to pick up from books i succeeded so well my vocation in life became professor henderson it must be great fun to be a ventriloquist so i regarded it at first it may not be a very high vocation but i make the people laugh and so i regard myself as a public benefactor indeed i once did an essential service to a young man by means of my ventriloquism i should like very much to hear the story i will tell you one day a young man a stranger came to me and introduced himself under the name of paul dabney he said that i might if i would do him a great service his father had died the year previous leaving a farm and other property to the value of fifteen thousand dollars of course being as only son he expected that this would be left to himself or at least the greater part of it conceive his surprise therefore when the will came to be read to find that the entire property was left to his uncle jonas his father brother who for three years past had been a member of the family jonas had never prospered in life and his brother out of pity had offered him an asylum on his farm he had formerly been a bookkeeper and was an accomplished penman the will was so extraordinary since paul and his father had always been on perfectly good terms that the young man was thunderstruck his uncle expressed hypocritical surprise at the nature of the will i dont believe my father made that will exclaimed paul angrily what do you mean by that demanded the uncle his anger made paul think that he had hit upon the truth particularly as his uncle was an adroit penman he carefully examined the will but the writing so closely resembled his fathers that he could see no difference the witnesses were his uncle jonas and a hired man who shortly after witnessing the signature had been discharged and had disappeared from the neighborhood all this excited pauls suspicions his uncle offered him a home on the farm but positively refused to give him any portion of the property i sympathize with you i said at the conclusion of pauls story but how can i help you i will tell you sir he replied you must know that my uncle jonas is very superstitious i mean through your help to play upon his fears and thus induce him to give up the property to me with this he unfolded his plan and i agreed to help him his uncle lived ten miles distant i procured a laborers disguise and the morning after paul having previously gone back i entered the yard of the farmhouse the old man was standing outside smoking a pipe can you give me work i asked what kind of work inquired jonas farm work i answered how much do you want eight dollars a month ill give you six he said thats too little its the most ill give you then ill take i replied and was at once engaged delighted to get me so cheap the sordid old man asked me no troublesome questions i knew enough of farm work to get along pretty well and not betray myself that night i concealed myself in the old mans apartment without arousing his suspicions paul helping me after he had been in bed about twenty minutes i thought it time to begin accordingly i uttered a hollow groan eh whats that cried the old man rising in bed i am the spirit of your dead brother i answered throwing my voice near the bed what do you want he asked his teeth chattering you have cheated paul out of his property forgive me he cried terrorstricken then give him back the property the whole he groaned yes the whole are are you really my brother i will give you this proof unless you do as i order you in three days you will be with me what dead he said shuddering yes i answered in sepulchral a tone as possible are are you sure of it if you doubt it disobey me ill do it but dont come again be sure you do it then i ceased to speak being tired and escaped as soon as i could but the battle was not yet over the next day gave jonas courage afternoon came and he had done nothing he was with me in the field when i threw a hollow voice which seemed to be close to his ear i said obey or in three days you die he turned pale as a sheet and asked me if i heard anything i expressed surprise and this confirmed him in his belief of the ghostly visitation he went to the house sent for a lawyer and transferred the entire property to his nephew the latter made him a present of a thousand dollars and so the affair ended happily paul paid me handsomely for my share in the trick and the next day i made an excuse for leaving the farm did the old man ever discover your agency in the affair professor henderson never he is dead now and my friend paul is happily married and has a fine family his oldest boy is named after me but here we are in holston chapter xxvii a mystifying performance the people of holston turned out in large numbers among the first to appear was the old lady whom the professor had taken up on his way over youre the boy that was so sassy to me this mormin she said peering at harry through her spectacles i didnt say a word to you said harry im afraid youre tellin fibs i heerd you it was the professor he put the words in my mouth well come to think ont the voice was different from yours then there want nobody in the trunk no maam said harry smiling its wonderful i declare fort this is my darter mrs nehemiah babcock continued the old lady nancy this is the ventriloquers boy i thought he was sassy to me this mornin but he says he didnt speak a word how much is to pay said the old lady i wont charge you anything said harry professor henderson told me if you came to let you in free and any of your family really now thats very perlite of the professor said the old lady hes a gentleman if ever there was one do you hear nancy we can go in without payin a cent thats all on account of your marms being acquainted with the professor im glad i come the old lady and her party entered the hall and being early secured good seats tom her grandson was glad to be so near as he was ambitious to assist the professor in case volunteers were called for will any young gentleman come forward and assist me in the next trick asked the professor after a while tom started from his seat his grandmother tried to seize him by the coat but he was too quick for her oh let him go said his mother he wont come to any harm is this your first appearance as a magician asked the professor yes sir answered tom with a grin very good i will get you to help me but you mustnt tell anybody how the tricks are done no sir i wont as i am going trust you with a little money i want to ask you whether you are strictly honest yes sir i am glad to hear it do you see this piece of gold yes sir what is its value ten dollars answered tom inspecting it very good i want you hold it for me i give you warning that i mean to make it pass out of you hand i dont think you can do it sir well perhaps not you look like a pretty sharp customer it wont be easy to fool you you bet nancy whispered the old lady to her daughter i hope you dont allow tom to talk so look mother see want hes going to do what i propose to do said the professor is to make that coin pass into the box on the table i may not be able to do it as the young gentleman is on his guard however i will try presto change it didnt go said tom ive got it here have you suppose you open your hand tom opened his hand well what have you got is it the gold piece no sir said tom astonished its a cent then sir all i can say is you have treated me badly in order to prevent my getting the gold piece into the box you changed it into a cent no i didnt said tom then perhaps i have succeeded after all the fact is i took out the gold piece and put a penny in its place so that you might not know the difference now here is the key of that box will you unlock it tom unlocked it only to find another box inside in fact it was a perfect nest of boxes in the very last of all was found the gold coin its very strange you didnt feel it go out of your hand said the professor i am afraid you are not quick enough to make a magician can you fire a pistol yes sir said tom will any lady lend me a ring asked the professor one was soon found i will load the pistol said the professor and put the ring in with the rest of the charge it appears to be rather too large i shall have to hammer it down he brought down a hammer heavily upon the ring and soon bent it sufficiently to get it into the pistol now sir he said take the pistol and stand off there all right sir when i give the word i want you to fire one two three tom fired his grandmother uttering a half suppressed shriek at the report when the smoke cleared away the professor was holding the ring between his thumb and finger quite uninjured professor hendersons attention had been drawn to his companion of the morning he observed that she had taken off her bonnet he went up to her and said politely madam will you kindly lend me your bonnet massy sakes what do you want of it i wont injure it i assure you you may take it ef you want to said the old lady but be keerful and dont bend it i will be very careful but madam he said in seeming surprise what have you got in it nothing sir you are mistaken see there and there and there and he rapidly drew out three onions four turnips and a couple of potatoes really you must have thought you were going to market they aint mine gasped the old lady then its very strange how they got into your bonnet and let me see heres an egg too i never see sich doins granny i guess a hen made her nest in your bonnet whispered tom the old lady shook her head in helpless amazement chapter xxvii an unexpected payment a week later harry reached a brisk manufacturing place which i will call centreville he assisted the professor during the afternoon to get ready the hall for his evening performance and at half past five took his seat at the supper table in the village hotel just as harry began to eat he lifted his eyes and started in surprise as he recognized in his opposite neighbor luke harrison whose abrupt departure without paying his debts the reader will remember under the circumstances it will not be wondered at that our heros look was not exactly cordial as for luke he was disagreeably startled at harrys sudden appearance not knowing his connection with professor henderson he fancied that our hero was in quest of him and not being skilled in the law felt a little apprehension as to what course he might take it was best he concluded to conciliate him how are you walton he said i am well said harry coldly how do you happen to be in this neighborhood on business said harry briefly luke jumped to the conclusion that the business related to him and conscious of wrongdoing felt disturbed im glad to see you he said it seems pleasant to see an old acquaintance he intended to say friend you left us rather suddenly said harry why yes said luke hesitating i had reasons ill tell you about it after supper as harry rose from the table luke joined him come upstairs to my room walton he said and have a cigar ill go upstairs with you but i dont smoke youd better learn its a great comfort do you board here yes i found i shouldnt have to pay any more than at a boarding house and the grubs better heres my room walk in he led the way into a small apartment on the top floor this is my den he said there isnt but one chair but ill sit on the bed when did you reach town about noon are you going to stop long asked luke i shall stay here till i get through with my errand answered harry shrewdly for he saw what luke thought and it occurred to him that he might turn it to advantage luke looked a little uneasy by the way walton he said i believe i owe you a little money yes i believe so im sorry i cant pay you the whole of it it costs considerable to live you know but ill pay part here are five dollars he said ill pay you the rest as soon as i can in a week or two harry took the bank note with secret selfcongratulation for he had given up the debt as bad and never expected to realize a cent of it i am glad to get it he said i have a use for all my money are you working in this town yes the shoe business is carried on here considerably are you still working for mr leavitt no ive left him what are you doing then im traveling with professor henderson what the magician yes and is that what brought you to centreville yes luke whistled i thought he began what did you think i thought answered luke evasively that you might be looking for work in some of the shoe shops here is there any chance do you think no i dont think there is said luke for he was by no means anxious to have harry in the same town then i shall probably stay with the professor what do you do take tickets at the door and help him beforehand with his apparatus youll let me in free tonight wont you that isnt for me to decide i should think the professor would let your friends go in free ill make you an offer luke said he what is it just pay me the rest of that money tonight and ill let you in free at my own expense i cant do it i havent got the money if youll give it back ill call it a dollar more and pay you the whole at the end of next week im afraid your calling it a dollar more wouldnt do much good said harry shrewdly do you doubt my word blustered luke who had regained courage now that he had ascertained the real object of harrys visit and that it had no connection with him i wont express any opinion on that subject answered harry but theres an old saying that a bird in the hands worth two in the bush i hate old sayings some of them contain a great deal of truth what a fool i was to pay him that five dollars thought luke regretfully if i hadnt been such a simpleton i should have found out what brought him here before throwing away nearly all i had this was the view luke took of paying his debts he regarded it as money thrown away apparently a good many young men are of a similar opinion this was not however according to harrys code and was never likely to be he believed in honesty and integrity if he hadnt i should feel far less confidence in his ultimate success i think i must leave you said harry rising the professor may need me do you like him have you got a good place yes i like him he is a very pleasant man how does it pay pretty well i wouldnt mind trying it myself do you handle all the money i take the money at the door i suppose you might keep back a dollar or so every night and hed never know the difference i dont know i never thought about that said harry dryly oh i remember youre one of the pious boys im too pious to take money that doesnt belong to me if thats what you mean said harry this was a very innocent remark but luke remembering how he had kept harrys pocketbook chose to interpret it as a fling to himself do you mean that for me he demanded angrily mean what for you that about keeping other peoples money i wasnt talking about you at all i was talking about myself youd better not insult me said luke still suspicious im not in the habit of insulting anybody i dont believe in people that set themselves up to be so much better than everybody else do you mean that for me asked harry smiling yes i do what are you going to do about it nothing except to deny that i make any such claims shall you come round to the hall tonight perhaps so then i shall see you i must be going now he went out leaving luke vainly deploring the loss of the five dollars which he had so foolishly squandered in paying his debt chapter xxix in the printing office harry said the professor after breakfast the next morning i find we must get some more bills printed you may go round to the office of the centreville gazette and ask them how soon they can print me a hundred large bills and a thousand small ones all right sir suppose they cant have them done by the ready to start they can send them to me by express harry had never been in a printing office but he had a great curiosity to see one ever since he had read the life of benjamin franklin if there was anyone in whose steps he thought he should like to follow it was franklin and franklin was a printer he had no difficulty in finding the office it was in the second story of a building just at the junction of two roads near the center of the town the post office being just underneath he ascended a staircase and saw on the door at the head of the stairs centreville gazette he opened the door and entered he saw a large room containing a press at the end while two young men with paper caps on their heads were standing in their shirt sleeves at upright cases setting type on one side there was a very small office partitioned off within a man was seen seated at a desk with a pile of exchange papers on the floor writing busily this was mr jotham anderson publisher and editor of the gazette i want to get some printing done said harry looking toward the journeymen go to mr anderson said one pointing to the office harry went in the editor looked up as he entered what can i do for you he asked i want to get some printing done for yourself no for professor henderson ive done jobs for him before what does he want our hero explained very well we will do it can you have it done before two oclock impossible i am just bringing out my paper when can you have the job finished tomorrow noon i suppose that will do we perform tomorrow at berlin and they can be sent over to the hotel there you say we answered harry amused i take tickets and assist him generally how do you like the business very well but i should like your business better what makes you think so i have been reading the life of benjamin franklin he was a printer thats true but im sorry to say franklins are scarce in our printing offices i never met one yet i shouldnt expect to turn out a franklins but i think one couldnt help being improved by the business true again though of course it depends on the wish to improve how long have you been working for professor henderson not long only two or three weeks what did you do before i was pegger in a shoe shop didnt you like it well enough for i needed to earn money and it paid me but i dont think i should like to be a shoemaker all my life it doesnt give any chance to learn then you like learning yes live and learn that is my motto it is a good one do you mean to be a printer if i get a chance you may come into my office on the first of april if you like one of my men will leave me by the first of may if you are a smart boy and really wish to learn the business you can break in so as to be useful in four weeks i should like it said harry but he added with hesitation i am poor and could not afford to work for nothing while i was learning ill tell you what ill do then said the editor ill give you your board for the first month on condition that youll work for six months afterwards for two dollars a week and board thats a fair offer i wouldnt make it if i didnt feel assured that you were smart and would in time be valuable to me ill come if my father does not object quite tight i should not like to have you act contrary to his wishes i suppose for the present you will remain with professor henderson yes sir very well let me hear from you when you have communicated with your father harry left the office plunged in thought it came upon him with surprise that he had engaged himself to learn a new business and that the one which he had longed to follow ever since he had become acquainted with franklins early life he realized that he was probably making immediate sacrifice he could undoubtedly make more money in the shoe shop than in the printing office for the present at least by the first of april the shoe business obtain employment but then he was sure he should like printing better and if he was ever going to change why the sooner he made the change the better when he returned to the hotel he told the professor what he had done i am glad you are not going at once said his employer for i should be sorry to lose you i generally give up traveling for the season about the first of april so that i shall be ready to release you i commend your choice of a trade many of our best editors have been practical printers in their youth i should like to be an editor but i dont know enough not at present but you can qualify yourself to become one that is if you devote you spare time to reading and studying i mean to do that then you will fair chance of becoming what you desire to a certain extent a boy or young man holds the future in his own hands harry wrote to father at once in regard to the plan which he had in view the answer did not reach him for nearly a week but we will so far anticipate matters as to insert that part which related to it if you desire to be a printer harry i shall not object it is a good trade and you can make yourself through it useful to the community i do not suppose it will ever make you rich still i should think it might in time give you a comfortable living better i hope than i have been able to earn as a farmer if you determine to win success you probably will if you should leave your present place before the first of april we shall be very glad to have you come home if only for a day or two we all miss you very much your mother particularly tom doesnt say much about it but i know he will be as glad to see you as the rest of us harry read this letter with great pleasure partly because it brought him permission to do as he desired and partly because it was gratifying to him to feel that he was missed at home he determined if it was a possible thing to leave the professor a week before his new engagement and spend that time in granton chapter xxx the young treasurer on the morning after receiving the letter from his father harry came down to breakfast but looked in vain for the professor supposing he would be down directly he sat down to the breakfast table when he had nearly finished eating a boy employed about the hotel came to his side that gentleman youre with is sick he wants you to come to his room as soon as you are through breakfast harry did not wait to finish but got up from the table at once and went up to his employers room are you sick sir he inquired anxiously the professors face was flushed and he was tossing about in bed yes he answered i am afraid i am threatened with a fever i hope not sir i am subject to fevers but i hope i might not have another for some time to come i must have caught cold yesterday and the result is that i am sick this morning what can i do for you sir i should like to have you go for the doctor inquire of the landlord who is the best in the village i will go at once on inquiry our hero was informed that dr parker was the most trusted physician in the neighborhood and he proceeded to his house at once the doctor was fortunately still at home and answered the summons immediately he felt the sick mans pulse asked him a variety of questions and finally announced his opinion you are about to have a fever he said if indeed the fever has not already set in a serious fever doctor asked the sick man anxiously i cannot yet determine do you think i shall be long sick that also is uncertain i suppose you will be likely to be detained here a fortnight at least i wish i could go home it would not be safe for you to travel under present circumstances if i were at home i could be under my wifes care cant she come here she has three young children it would be difficult for her to leave them who is the boy that called at my house harry walton he is my assistant takes money at the door and helps me other ways is he trustworthy i have always found him so why cant he attend upon you i mean to retain him with me that is if he will stay it will be dull work for a boy of his age you can obtain a nurse besides if needful you had better engage one for me as i cannot confine him here all the time i will do so i know of one skillful and experienced who is just now at leisure i will send her round here this morning what is her name not a very romantic one betsy chase i suppose that doesnt prevent her being a good nurse said the professor smiling not at all here harry entered the room harry said the professor the doctor tells me i am going to be sick i am very sorry sir said our hero with an air of concern i shall probably be detained here at least a fortnight are you willing to remain with me certainly sir i should not think of leaving you sick and alone if you desired me to stay i hope i can make myself useful to you you can i shall need you to do errands for me and to sit with me a part of the time i shall be very willing to do so sir you will probably find it dull not so dull as you will find it sir the time must seem very long to you lying on that bed i suppose it will but that cant be helped a nurse will be here this afternoon said the doctor until she comes you will be in attendance here yes sir i will direct you what to do and how often to administer the medicines can remember yes sir i shall not forget dr parker here gave harry minute instructions which need not be repeated since they were altogether of a professional nature after the doctor was gone professor henderson said as soon as the nurse comes i shall want you to ride over to the next town carmansville and countermand the notices for an exhibition tonight i shall not be able to give entertainments for some time to come indeed i am not sure but i must wait till next season how shall i go over asked harry you may get a horse and buggy at the stable and drive over there if i remember rightly it is between little seven and eight miles the road is a little winding but i think you wont lose your way oh ill find it said harry confidently it was not till three oclock that the nurse made her appearance and it was past three before harry started on his way you need not hurry home said the professor in fact you had better take supper at the hotel in carmansville as you probably could not very well get back here till eight oclock very well sir said harry but shant you need me no miss chase will attend to me mrs chase if you please said the nurse ive been a widder for twenty years i beg your pardon mrs chase said the sick man smiling when my husband was alive i never expected to go out nursin but ive had come to it the doctor says you are a very skillful and experienced nurse id ought to be ive nussed people in almost all sorts of diseases from measles to smallpox you neednt be frightened sir i havent had any smallpox case lately isnt it most time to take your medicine harry left the room and was soon on his way to carmansville once he got off the road which was rather a perplexing one but he soon found it again however it was half past five before he reached the village and nearly an hour later before he had done the errand which brought him over finally he came back to the tavern and being by this time hungry went in at once to the tavern and being by this time hungry went in at once to supper he did full justice to the meal which was set before him the day was cold and his ride had stimulated his appetite when he sat down to the table he was alone but a minute afterward a small darkcomplexioned man with heavy black whiskers came in and sat down beside him he had a heavy look and a forbidding expression but our hero was too busy to take particular notice of him till the latter commenced a conversation its a pretty cold day he remarked very cold said harry i am dreading my ride back to pentland are you going to pentland tonight asked the stranger with interest yes sir do you live over there no i am there for a short time only harry replied business yes you seem rather young to be in business said the stranger oh said harry smiling i am in the employ of professor henderson the ventriloquist i suppose it is hardly proper to say that i am in business professor henderson why he is going to give an entertainment here tonight isnt he he was but i have come over to countermand the notice what is that for he is taken sick at pentland and wont be able to come oh thats it well im sorry for i should like to have gone to hear him so you are his assistant are you yes sir can you perform tricks too i dont assist him in that way i take money at the door and help him with his apparatus have you been with him long only a few weeks so you are his treasurer are you asked the stranger smiling ye es said harry slowly for it brought to his mind that he had one hundred and fifty dollars of the professors money in his pocket besides the pocketbook containing his own he intended to have left it with his employer but in the hurry of leaving he had forgotten to do so now he was about to take a long ride in the evening with this large sum of money about him however he said reassuring himself there is nothing to be afraid of country people are not robbers burglars stay in the cities i have nothing to fear still he prudently resolved if compelled to be out late again to leave his money at home he rose from table followed by the stranger well said the latter i must be going how soon do you start in a few minutes well good night good night he seems inclined to be social thought harry but i dont fancy him much chapter xxxi harry was soon on his way home it was already getting dark and he felt a little anxious lest he should lose his way he was rather sorry that he had not started earlier though he had lost no time he had gone about two miles when he came to a place where two roads met there was no guideboard and he could not remember by which road he had come luckily as he thought he described a man a little ahead he stopped the horse and hailed him can you tell me which road to take to pentland he asked the man addressed turned his head and to his surprise our hero recognized his table companion at the inn oh its you my young friend he said yes sir can you tell me the right road to pentland i have never been this way before today and i have forgotten how i came i am thinking of going to pentland myself said the other my sister lives there if you dont mind giving me a lift i will jump in with you and guide you now though harry did not fancy the mans appearance he had no reason to doubt him nor any ground for refusing his request jump in sir he said there is plenty of room the stranger was speedily seated at his side take the lefthand road he said harry turned to his left its rather a blind road observed the stranger i think i could remember in the daytime said harry but it is so dark now that i am in doubt so i suppose the road on which they had entered was very lonely scarcely a house was passed and the neighborhood seemed quite uninhabited i dont remember this road said harry anxiously are you sure we are right yes yes we are right dont trouble yourself its a lonely road so it is i dont suppose theres anybody lives within half a mile the road didnt seem so lonely when i came over it this afternoon oh thats the effect of sunshine nothing seems lonely in the daytime turn down that lane what for asked harry in surprise that cant be the road to pentland never mind that turn i tell you his companion spoke fiercely and harrys mind began to conceive alarming suspicions as to his character but he was brave and not easily daunted the horse and carriage are mine or at least are under my direction he said firmly and you have no control over them i shall not turn wont you retorted the stranger with an oath and drew from his pocket a pistol wont you what do you mean who are you demanded harry you will find out before i get through with you now turn into the lane i will not said harry pale but determined then i will save you the trouble and his companion snatched the reins from him and turned the horse himself resistance was of course useless and our hero was compelled to submit there that suits me better now to business to business produce your pocketbook would you rob me asked harry who was in a measure prepared for the demand oh of course not said the other gentlemen never do such things i want to burrow your money that is all i dont want to lend i dare say not sneered the other but i shant be able to respect your wishes the sooner you give me the money the better harry had two pocketbooks the one contained his own money about forty dollars the other the money of his employer the first was in the side pocket of his coat the second in the pocket of his pants the latter as was stated in the preceding chapter contained one hundred and fifty dollars harry heartily repented not having left it behind but it was to late for repentance he could only hope that the robber would be satisfied with one pocketbook and not suspect the existence of the other there seemed but little hope of saving his own money however he determined to do it if possible hurry up said the stranger impatiently you neednt pretend you have no money i know better than that i saw you pay the landlord then he saw the professors pocketbook thought harry uneasily mine is of different appearance i hope he wont detect the difference i hope you will leave me some of the money said harry producing the pocketbook it is all i have how much is there about forty dollars humph that isnt much it is all i have in the world pooh you are young and can soon earn some more i must have the whole of it cant you leave me five dollars no i cant forty dollars are little enough to serve my turn so saying he coolly deposited the pocketbook in the pocket of his pants so far so good its well youngster you didnt make any more fuss or i might have had to use my little persuader and he displayed the pistol will you let me go now sir i have not got through my business yet thats a nice overcoat of yours harry looked at him in doubt as to his meaning but he was soon enlightened i am a small person proceeded the man with black whiskers scarcely any larger than you i think itll be a good fit must i lose my overcoat too thought harry in trouble youve got an overcoat of your own sir he said you dont need mine oh i wouldnt rob you of yours on any account a fair exchange is no robbery i am going to give you mine in exchange for yours the strangers coat was rough and well worn and at its best had been inferior to harrys coat our hero felt disturbed at the prospect of losing it for he could not tell when he could afford to get another i should think you might be satisfied with the pocketbook he said i hope you will leave me my coat off with the coat youngster was the sole reply first get out of the buggy we can make the exchange better outside as opposition would be unavailing harry obeyed the robber took from him the handsome overcoat the possession of which had afforded him so much satisfaction and handed him his own in great disgust and dissatisfaction our hero invested himself in it fits you as if it was made for you said the stranger with a short laugh yours is a trifle slow for me but i can make it go no dont be in such a hurry he seized harry by the arm as he was about to jump into the carriage i must go said harry you have already detained me some time i intend to detain you some time longer have you got any more business with me yes i have youve hit it exactly youll soon know what it is he produced a ball of cord from a pocket of his inside coat and with a knife severed a portion do you know what this is for he asked jeeringly no say no sir its more respectful well ill gratify your laudable curiosity its to tie your hands and feet i wont submit to it said harry angrily wont you asked the other coolly this is a very pretty pistol isnt it i hope i shant have to use it what do you want to tie my hands for asked harry for obvious reasons my young friend i cant drive if my hands are tied correct my son i dont intend you to drive tonight give me your hands harry considered whether it would be advisable to resist the stranger was not much larger than himself he was a man however and naturally stronger besides he had a pistol he seceded that it was necessary to submit after all he had saved his employers money even if he had lost his own and this was something he allowed himself to be bound now said the stranger setting him up against the stone wall which bordered the lane i will bid you good night i might take your horse but on the whole i dont want him i will fasten him to this tree where he will be all ready for you in the morning thats considerate in me good night i hope you are comfortable he disappeared in the darkness and harry was left alone chapter xxxii the good samaritan harrys reflections as he sat on the ground were not the most cheerful he was sitting in a constrained posture his hands and feet being tied and moreover the cold air chilled him the cold was not intense but as he was unable to move his limbs he of course felt it the more i suppose it will get colder thought harry uncomfortably i wonder if there is any danger of freezing the horse evidently began to feel impatient for he turned round and looked at our hero why dont you keep on i wish somebody would come this way thought harry and he looked up and down the lane as well as he could but could see no one if i could only get at my knife said harry to himself i could cut theses cords let me try he tried to get his hands into his pockets but it was of no avail the pocket was too deep and though he worked his body round he finally gave it up it seemed likely that he must stay here all night the next day probably some one would come by as they were so near a public road upon whom he could call to release him the night will seem about a week long poor harry considered i shant dare to go to sleep for fear i may freeze to death the horse whinnied again and again looked inquiringly at his young driver but the latter was not master of the situation and was obliged to disregard the mute appeal i wonder the robber didnt carry off the horse thought harry i suppose he had his reasons it isnt likely he left him out of his regard for me two hours passed and harry still found himself a prisoner his constrained position became still more uncomfortable he longed for the power of jumping up and stretching his legs now numb and chilled but the cord was strong and defied his efforts no person had passed not had he heard any sound as he lay there except the occasional whinny of the horse which was tied as well as himself and did not appear to enjoy his confinement any better it was at this moment that harrys heart leaped with sudden hope as he heard in the distance the sound of a whistle it might be a boy or it might be a man but as he listened intently he perceived that it was coming nearer i hope i can make him hear thought harry earnestly it was a boy of about his own age who was advancing along the road from which he had turned into the lane the boy was not alone as it appeared for a large dog ran before him the dog first noticed the horse and buggy and next our hero lying on the ground and concluding that something was wrong began to bark violently circling uncomfortably near harry against whom he seemed to cherish hostile designs whats the matter caesar shouted his young master good dog said harry soothingly in momentary fear that the brute would bite him but caesar was not to be cajoled by flattery bow wow wow he answered opening his large mouth and displaying a formidable set of teeth good dog id like to choke him added harry in an undertone to himself there was another volley of barks which seemed likely to be followed by an attack just at this moment however luckily for our hero the dogs master came up why caesar he called what is the matter with you please take your dog away said harry i am afraid he will bite me who are you inquired the boy in surprise come and untie these cords and i will tell you what are you tied yes hand and foot who did it asked the boy in increasing surprise i dont know his name but he robbed me of my pocketbook before doing it what a robber around here exclaimed the boy incredulous yes i met him first over in carmansville thank you now my feet if you please it seems good to be free again and harry swung his arms and jumped up and down to bring back the sense of warmth to his chilled limbs is this horse yours asked the boy yes i took up the man and he promised to show me the road to pentland this isnt the road to pentland i suppose not he took me wrong on purpose how much money did he take from you forty dollars thats a good deal said the country boy was it yours yes i never had so much money in my life it has taken me almost six months to earn it but i had more money with me only he didnt know it how much a hundred and fifty dollars was it yours asked the boy surprised no it belonged to my employer who is he professor henderson the ventriloquist where is he stopping over at pentland he is sick at the hotel there its lucky for you i was out tonight i aint often out so late but i went to see a friend of mine and stayed later than i meant to do you live near here i live about a quarter of a mile up this lane do you know what time it is i dont know but i think it is past ten i wonder whether i can get anybody to go with me to pentland i cant find my way in the dark i will go with you tomorrow morning but what shall i do tonight ill tell you come home with me the folks will take you in and the horse can be put up in the barn harry hesitated i suppose they will feel anxious about me over at pentland they wont know what has become of me you can start early in the morning as early as you like perhaps it will be better said harry after a pause it wont trouble your family too much will it not a bit answered the boy heartily very likely they wont know till morning he added laughing they go to bed early and i told them they neednt wait up for me i am very much obliged to you said harry i will accept your kind invitation as ive got a horse we may as well ride ill untie him and you jump into the buggy all right said the boy well pleased you may drive for you know the way better than i where did this horse come from from the stable in pentland perhaps they will think you have run away with it i hope not what is your name harry walton what is yours jefferson selden the boys usually call me jeff is that your dog yes hes a fine fellow i didnt think so when he was threatening to bite me said harry laughing i used to be afraid of dogs said jeff but i got cured of it after a while when i go out at night i generally take caesar with me if you had had him you would have been a match for the robber he had a pistol caesar would have had him down before he could use it i wish he had been with me then they had by this time come in sight of jeffs house it was a square farmhouse with a barn in the rear well go right out to the barn said jeff and put up the horse then well come back to the house and go to bed there was a little difficulty in unharnessing the horse on account of the absence of light but at last by a combined effort it was done and the buggy was drawn into the barn and the doors shut there all will be safe till tomorrow morning said jeff now well go into the house he entered by the back shed door and harry followed him they went into the broad low kitchen with its ample fireplace in which a few embers were glowing by these jeff lighted a candle and asked harry if he would have anything to eat no thank you said harry i ate a hearty supper at carmansville then well go upstairs to bed i sleep in a small room over the shed you wont mind sleeping with me i should like your company said harry who was attracted to his goodnatured companion then come up i guess well find the bed wide enough he led the way up a narrow staircase into a room low studded and very plainly but comfortably furnished the folks will be surprised to see you here in the morning said jeff i may be gone before they are up i guess not fatherll be up by five oclock and i think thatll be as early as youll want to be stirring chapter xxxiii the reward of fidelity where am i asked harry the next morning as he sat up in bed and stared around him dont you remember asked jeff smiling jeff was standing by the bedside already dressed yes i remember now said harry slowly what time is it seven oclock seven oclock i meant to be dressed at six that is the time i got up said jeff why didnt you wake me up you looked so comfortable that i thought it was a pity to wake you you must have felt tired i think it was the cold that made me sleepy i got chilled through when i lay on the ground there tied hand and foot but i must get up in hurry now he jumped out of bed and hurried on his clothes now said jeff come down into the kitchen and motherll give you some breakfast i am giving you a great deal of trouble i am afraid said harry no youre not its no trouble at all the rest of the family have eaten breakfast but i waited for you ive been up an hour and feel as hungry as a wolf so come down and well see wholl eat the most i can do my part said harry ive got a good appetite though ive been up a food deal less than an hour take your overcoat alone said jeff or will you come up and get after breakfast ill take it down with me it isnt my coat you know mine was a much better one i wish i had it back jeff meanwhile had taken up the coat theres something in the pocket he said what is it i didnt put anything in harry thrust his hand into the side pocket for the first time and drew out a shabby leather wallet perhaps theres money in it jeff suggested the same thought had occurred to harry he hastily opened it and his eyes opened wide with astonishment as he drew out a thick roll of bills by hokey said jeff youre in luck the robber took your pocketbook and left his own maybe theres as much as you lost count it this harry eagerly proceeded to do three eight eleven thirteen twenty he repeated aloud he continued his count which resulted in showing that the wallet contained ninetyseven dollars ninetyseven dollars exclaimed jeff how much did you lose forty dollars then youve made just fiftyseven dollars bully for you but ive exchanged a good overcoat for a poor one there cant be more than seventeen dollars difference not so much then youre forty dollars better off at any rate but i dont know as i can claim this money said harry doubtfully it isnt mine he wont be likely to call for it when he does and returns you the money and the coat it will be time to think about it i will ask professor henderson about that at any rate ive got my money back thats one good thing this timely discovery made harry decidedly cheerful and if anything sharpened his appetite for breakfast now mr selden had gone out to oversee some farm work but mrs selden received out hero very kindly and made him feel that he was heartily welcome to that she could offer she had many questions to ask about the bold robber who had waylaid him and expressed the hope that he had left the neighborhood perhaps hell come back for his wallet harry said jeff youd better look out for him i shall take care how i carry much money about with me after this said harry that was what got me into a scrape yesterday he wouldnt make out much if he tried to rob me said jeff i havent got money enough about me to pay the board of a fullgrown fly for twentyfour hours you dont look as if your poverty troubled you much said his mother i dont have any board bills to pay said jeff so i can get along i should think you would feel nervous about riding to pentland alone said mrs selden for fear of meeting the man who robbed you yesterday i do dread it a little said harry having so much money about me besides this ninetyseven dollars ive got a hundred and fifty dollars belonging to my employer suppose i go with you to protect you said jeff i wish you would i dont think jefferson would make a very efficient protector said his mother you dont know how brave i am mother said jeff in the tone of an injured hero no i dont said his mother smiling i believe there was a time when you were not very heroic in the company of dogs thats long ago mother ive got over it now if you would like to ride over with your friend you may do so but how will you get back major pinkham will be up there this afternoon i can wait and ride home with him very well i have no objection the two boys rode off together harry was glad to have a companion who knew the road well for he did not care to be lost again till he had delivered up the money which he had in charge there was no opportunity to test jeffs courage for the highwayman did not make his appearance indeed it was not till the next morning that he discovered the serious blunder he had made in leaving his own wallet behind and though he was angry and disgusted prudential considerations prevented his going back he was forced to the unpleasant conviction that he had overreached himself and that his intended victim had come out best in the exchange which was no robbery i may as well add here that though he deserved to be caught he was not and harry has never to this day set eyes either upon him or upon the coat when harry arrived at pentland he found that no little anxiety had been felt about him has harry come yet asked the sick man at ten oclock the evening previous no he hasnt answered the nurse its strange what keeps him did he have any money of yours with him yes i believe he had oh ejaculated mrs chase significantly what do you mean by that i didnt say anything did i i am afraid he may have been attacked and robbed on the road mrs chase coughed dont you think so ill tell you what i think professor said the nurse proceeding to speak plainly i dont think youll ever see anything of that boy agin why not it aint safe to trust boys with money she answered sententiously oh im not afraid of his honesty you dont say maybe you havent seen as much of boys as i have i was once a boy myself said the professor smiling oh you thats different why is it different i wasnt any better than boys generally i dont know anything about that but you mark my words as like as not hes run away with your money how much did he have i cant say exactly over a hundred dollars i believe then he wont come back said mrs chase decidedly here the conference closed as it was necessary for mr henderson to take medicine has the boy returned asked the professor the next morning you dont expect him do you certainly i expect him well he aint come and i guess he wont come i am sure that boy is honest said professor henderson to himself if he isnt ill never trust a boy again mrs chase was going downstairs with her patients breakfast dishes when she was nearly run into by our hero who had just returned and was eager to report to his employer do be keerful she expostulated when to her surprise she recognized harry so he had come back after all and falsified her prediction such is human nature that for an instant she was disappointed heres pretty work she said stayin out all night and worryin the professor out of his wits i couldnt help it mrs chase why couldnt you help it id like to know ill tell you afterwards i must go up now and see the professor mrs chase was so curious that she returned with the dishes to hear harrys statement good morning said harry entering the chamber im sorry to have been so long away but i couldnt help it i hope you havent worried much about my absence i knew you would come back but mrs chase had her doubts said professor henderson pleasantly now tell me what it was that detained you a highwayman said harry a highwayman exclaimed both in concert yes ill tell you all about it but first ill say that he stole only my money and didnt suspect that i had a hundred and fifty dollars of yours with me thats all safe here it is i think you had better take care of that yourself sir hereafter the professor glanced significantly at mr chase as much as to say you see how unjust your suspicions were i am right after all tell us all about it harry our hero obeyed instructions but it is not necessary to repeat a familiar tale massy sakes ejaculated betsy chase who ever heerd the like i congratulate you harry on coming off with such flying colors i will at my own expense provide you with a new overcoat as a reward for bringing home my money safe you shall not lose anything by your fidelity chapter xxxiv in difficulty we must now transfer the scene to the walton homestead it looks very much the same as on the day when the reader was first introduced to it there is not a single article of new furniture nor is any of the family any better dressed poverty reigns with undisputed sway mr walton is reading a borrowed newspaper by the light of a candle for it is evening while mrs walton is engaged in her neverending task of mending old clothes in the vain endeavor to make them look as well as new it is so seldom that anyone of the family has new clothes that the occasion is one long remembered and dated from it seems strange we dont hear from harry said mrs walton looking up from her work when was the last letter received asked mr walton laying down the paper over a week ago he wrote that the professor was sick and he was stopping at the hotel to take care of him i remember what was the name of the place pentland perhaps his employer is recovered and he is going about with him perhaps so but i should think he would write i am afraid he is sick himself he may have caught the same fever it is possible but i think harry would let us know in some way at any rate it isnt best to worry ourselves about uncertainties i wonder if harrys grown said tom of course hes grown said mary i wonder if hes grown as much as i have said tom complacently i dont believe youve grown a bit yes i have if you dont believe it see how short my pants are tom did indeed seem to be growing out of his pants which were undeniably too short for him you ought to have some new pants said his mother sighing but i dont see where the money is to come from nor i said mr walton soberly somehow i dont seem to get ahead at all tomorrow my note for the cow comes due and i havent but two dollars to meet it how large it the note with six months interest it amounts to fortyone dollars and twenty cents the cow isnt worth that she doesnt give as much milk as the one we lost thats true it was a hard bargain but i could do no better you say you wont be able to meet the payment what will be the consequence i suppose squire green will take back the cow perhaps you can get another somewhere else on better terms i am afraid my credit wont be very good i agreed to forfeit ten dollars to squire green if i couldnt pay at the end of six months will he insist on that condition i am afraid he will he is a hard man then said mrs walton indignantly he wont deserve to prosper worldly prosperity doesnt always go by merit plenty of mean men prosper before mrs walton had time to reply a knock was heard at the door go to the door tom said his father tom obeyed and shortly reappeared followed by a small man with a thin figure and wrinkled face whose deepset crafty eyes peered about him curiously as he entered the room good evening squire green said mr walton politely guessing his errand good evenin mrs walton the airs kinder frosty i aint so young as i was once and it chills my blood come up to the fire squire green said mrs walton who wanted the old man to be comfortable though she neither liked nor respected him the old man sat down and spread his hands before the fire anything new stirring squire asked hiram walton nothin that i know on i was lookin over my papers tonight neighbor and i come across that note you give for the cow forty dollars with interest which makes the whole come to fortyone dollars and twenty cents tomorrows the day for payin i suppose youll be ready and the old man peered at hiram walton with his little keen eyes now for it thought hiram im sorry to say squire green he answered that i cant pay the note times have been hard and my family expenses have taken all i could earn the squire was not much disappointed for now he was entitled to exact the forfeit of ten dollars the contrack provides that if you cant meet the note you shall pay ten dollars he said i spose you can do that squire green i havent got but two dollars laid by two dollars repeated the squire frowning that aint honest you knew the note was comin due and youd oughter have provided ten dollars at least ive done as much as i could ive wanted to meet the note but i couldnt make money and i earned all i could you haint been equinomical said the squire testily folks cant expect to lay up money ef they spend it fast as it comes in and he thumped on the floor with his cane i should like to have you tell us how we can economize any more than we have said mrs walton with spirit just look around you and see if you think we have been extravagant in buying clothes i am sure i have to darn and mend till i am actually ashamed theres other ways of wastin money said the squire if you think we live extravagantly come in any day to dinner and we will convince you to the contrary said mrs walton warmly taint none of my business as long as you pay me what you owe me said the squire all i want is my money and id orter have it it doesnt seem right that my husband should forfeit ten dollars and lose the cow that was the contrack mrs walton your husband greed to it and that doesnt make it just taint no moren a fair price for the use of the cow six months ef youll pay the ten dollars tomorrow ill let you have the cow six months longer on the same contrack i dont see any possibility of my paying you the money squire green i havent got it why dont you borrer somewhere i might as well owe you as another man besides i dont know anybody that would lend me the money you havent tried have you no then youd better i thought i might as well come round and remind you of the note as you might forget it not much danger said hiram walton ive had it on my mind ever since i gave it well ill come round tomorrow night and i hope youll be ready good night no very cordial good night followed squire green as he hobbled out of the cottage for he was lame not i am sure the reader will agree with me did he deserve any he was a mean miserly grasping man who had no regard for the feelings or comfort of anyone else whose master passion was a selfish love of accumulating money his money did him little good however for he was as mean with himself as with others and grudged himself even the necessaries of life because if purchased it must be at the expense of his hoards the time would come when he and his money must part but he did not think of that chapter xxxv settled there was a general silence after squire greens departure hiram walton looked gloomy and the rest of the family also what an awful mean man the squire is tom broke out indignantly youre right for once said mary in general such remarks were rebuked by the father or mother but the truth of toms observation was so clear that for once he was not reproved squire greens money does him very little good said hiram walton he spends very little of it on himself and it certainly doesnt obtain him respect in the village rich as he is and poor as i am i would rather stand in my shoes than his i should think so said his wife money isnt everything no but it is a good deal i have suffered too much from the want of it to despise it well hiram said mrs walton who felt that it would not do to look too persistently upon the dark side you know that the song says theres a good time coming ive waited for it a long time wife said the farmer soberly wait a little longer said mrs walton quoting the refrain of the song he smiled faintly very well ill wait a little longer but if i have to wait too long i shall get discouraged children its time to go to bed said mrs walton maynt i sit up a little longer pleaded mary wait a little longer mother said tom laughing as he quoted his mothers words against her ten minutes only then before the ten minutes were over there was great and unexpected joy in the little house suddenly the outer door opened and without the slightest warning to anyone harry walked in he was immediately surrounded by the delighted family and in less time than i am taking to describe it he had shaken hands with his father kissed his mother and sister and given tom a bearlike hug which nearly suffocated him where did you come from harry asked mary dropped down from the sky said harry laughing has the professor been giving exhibitions up there asked tom ive discharge the professor said harry gayly im my own man now and youve come home to stay i hope said his mother not long mother said harry i can only stay a few days what a bully overcoat youve got on said tom the professor gave it to me hasnt he got one for me too harry took off his overcoat and tom was struck with fresh admiration as he surveyed his brothers inside suit i guess you spent all you money on clothes he said i hope not said mr walton whom experience had made prudent not quite all said harry cheerfully how much money do you think i have brought home ten dollars said tom more fifteen more twenty said mary more twentyfive i wont keep you guessing all night what do you say to fifty dollars oh what a lot of money said mary you have done well my son said mr walton you must have been very economical i tried to be father but i didnt say fifty dollars was all i had you havent got more said his mother incredulously ive got a hundred dollars mother said harry here are fifty dollars for you father itll pay your note to squire green and a little over here are thirty dollars mother of which you must use for ten for yourself ten for mary and ten for tom i want you all to have some new clothes to remember me by but harry you will have nothing left for yourself yes i shall i have kept twenty dollars which will be enough till i can earn some more i dont see how you could save so much money harry said his father it was partly luck father and partly hard work ill tell you all about it he sat down before the fire and they listened to his narrative well harry said mr walton i am very glad to find that you are more fortunate than your father i have had a hard struggle but i will not complain if my children can prosper the cloud that squire green had brought with him had vanished and all was sunshine and happiness it was agreed that no hint should be given to squire green that his note was to be paid he did not even hear of harrys arrival and was quite unconscious of any change in the circumstances of the family when he entered the cottage the next evening well neighbor he said ive brought along that ere note i hope youve raised the money to pay it where do you think i could raise money squire asked hiram walton i thought mebbe some of the neighbors would lent it to you money isnt very plenty with any of them squire except with you i calclate better than they hev you got the ten dollars that you agreed to pay ef you couldnt meet the note yes said hiram i raised the ten dollars all right said the squire briskly i thought you could as long as you pay that you can keep the cow six months more one a new contrack dont you think squire its rather hard on a poor man to make him forfeit ten dollars because he cant meet his note a contracks a contrack said the squire its the only way to do business i think you are taking advantage of me squire no i aint you neednt hev come to me ef you didnt want to i didnt ask you to buy the cow ill trouble you for that ten dollars neighbor as im in a hurry on the whole squire i think ill settle up the note thatll be cheaper than paying the forfeit what pay fortyone dollars and twenty cents ejaculated the squire incredulously yes its more than the cows worth but as i agreed to pay it i suppose i must i thought you didnt hev the money said the squire his lower jaw falling for he would have preferred the ten dollars forfeit and a renewal of the usurious contract i didnt have it when you were in last night but ive raised it since you said you couldnt borrow it i didnt borrow it then where did it come from my son harry has got home squire he has supplied me with the money you dont say where is he been adoin well has he harry harry entered the room and nodded rather coldly to the squire who was disposed to patronize him now that he was well dressed and appeared to be doing well im glad to see ye harry so youve made money have ye a little hev you come home to stay no sir i shall only stay a few days what hev ye been doin i am going to be a printer you dont say is it a good business i think it will be said harry i can tell better by and by well im glad youre doin so well neighbor walton when you want another cow ill do as well by you as anybody ill give you credit for another on the same terms if i conclude to buy any squire i may come round well good night all harry you must come round and see me before you go back harry thanked him but did not propose to accept the invitation he felt that the squire was no true friend either to himself or to his family and he should feel no pleasure in his society it was not in his nature to be hypocritical and he expressed no pleasure at the squires affability and politeness i have thus detailed a few of harrys early experiences but i am quite aware that i have hardly fulfilled the promise of the title he has neither lived long nor learned much as yet nor has he risen very high in the world in fact he is still at the bottom of the ladder i propose therefore to devote another volume to his later fortunes and hope in the end to satisfy the reader the most that can be said thus far is that he has made a fair beginning and i must refer the reader who is interested to know what success he met with as a printer to the next volume which will be entitled risen from the ranks or harry waltons success the end
