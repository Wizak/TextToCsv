snow glass apples copyright neil gaiman i do not know what manner of thing she is none of us do she killed her mother in the birthing but thats never enough to account for it they call me wise but i am far from wise for all that i foresaw fragments of it frozen moments caught in pools of water or in the cold glass of my mirror if i were wise i would not have tried to change what i saw if i were wise i would have killed myself before ever i encountered her before ever i caught him wise and a witch or so they said and id seen his face in my dreams and in reflections for all my life sixteen years of dreaming of him before he reined his horse by the bridge that morning and asked my name he helped me onto his high horse and we rode together to my little cottage my face buried in the gold of his hair he asked for the best of what i had a kings right it was his beard was redbronze in the morning light and i knew him not as a king for i knew nothing of kings then but as my love he took all he wanted from me the right of kings but he returned to me on the following day and on the night after that his beard so red his hair so gold his eyes the blue of a summer sky his skin tanned the gentle brown of ripe wheat his daughter was only a child no more than five years of age when i came to the palace a portrait of her dead mother hung in the princesss tower room a tall woman hair the colour of dark wood eyes nutbrown she was of a different blood to her pale daughter the girl would not eat with us i do not know where in the palace she ate i had my own chambers my husband the king he had his own rooms also when he wanted me he would send for me and i would go to him and pleasure him and take my pleasure with him one night several months after i was brought to the palace she came to my rooms she was six i was embroidering by lamplight squinting my eyes against the lamps smoke and fitful illumination when i looked up she was there princess she said nothing her eyes were black as coal black as her hair her lips were redder than blood she looked up at me and smiled her teeth seemed sharp even then in the lamplight what are you doing away from your room im hungry she said like any child it was winter when fresh food is a dream of warmth and sunlight but i had strings of whole apples cored and dried hanging from the beams of my chamber and i pulled an apple down for her here autumn is the time of drying of preserving a time of picking apples of rendering the goose fat winter is the time of hunger of snow and of death and it is the time of the midwinter feast when we rub the goosefat into the skin of a whole pig stuffed with that autumns apples then we roast it or spit it and we prepare to feast upon the crackling she took the dried apple from me and began to chew it with her sharp yellow teeth is it good she nodded i had always been scared of the little princess but at that moment i warmed to her and with my fingers gently i stroked her cheek she looked at me and smiled she smiled but rarely then she sank her teeth into the base of my thumb the mound of venus and she drew blood i began to shriek from pain and from surprise but she looked at me and i fell silent the little princess fastened her mouth to my hand and licked and sucked and drank when she was finished she left my chamber beneath my gaze the cut that she had made began to close to scab and to heal the next day it was an old scar i might have cut my hand with a pocketknife in my childhood i had been frozen by her owned and dominated that scared me more than the blood she had fed on after that night i locked my chamber door at dusk barring it with an oaken pole and i had the smith forge iron bars which he placed across my windows my husband my love my king sent for me less and less and when i came to him he was dizzy listless confused he could no longer make love as a man makes love and he would not permit me to pleasure him with my mouth the one time i tried he started violently and began to weep i pulled my mouth away and held him tightly until the sobbing had stopped and he slept like a child i ran my fingers across his skin as he slept it was covered in a multitude of ancient scars but i could recall no scars from the days of our courtship save one on his side where a boar had gored him when he was a youth soon he was a shadow of the man i had met and loved by the bridge his bones showed blue and white beneath his skin i was with him at the last his hands were cold as stone his eyes milkyblue his hair and beard faded and lustreless and limp he died unshriven his skin nipped and pocked from head to toe with tiny old scars he weighed near to nothing the ground was frozen hard and we could dig no grave for him so we made a cairn of rocks and stones above his body as a memorial only for there was little enough of him left to protect from the hunger of the beasts and the birds so i was queen and i was foolish and young eighteen summers had come and gone since first i saw daylight and i did not do what i would do now if it were today i would have her heart cut out true but then i would have her head and arms and legs cut off i would have them disembowel her and then i would watch in the town square as the hangman heated the fire to whiteheat with bellows watch unblinking as he consigned each part of her to the fire i would have archers around the square who would shoot any bird or animal who came close to the flames any raven or dog or hawk or rat and i would not close my eyes until the princess was ash and a gentle wind could scatter her like snow i did not do this thing and we pay for our mistakes they say i was fooled that it was not her heart that it was the heart of an animal a stag perhaps or a boar they say that and they are wrong and some say that i was given the heart and that i ate it lies and halftruths fall like snow covering the things that i remember the things i saw a landscape unrecognisable after a snowfall that is what she has made of my life there were scars on my love her fathers thighs and on his ballockpouch and on his male member when he died i did not go with them they took her in the day while she slept and was at her weakest they took her to the heart of the forest and there they opened her blouse and they cut out her heart and they left her dead in a gully for the forest to swallow the forest is a dark place the border to many kingdoms noone would be foolish enough to claim jurisdiction over it outlaws live in the forest robbers live in the forest and so do wolves you can ride through the forest for a dozen days and never see a soul but there are eyes upon you the entire time they brought me her heart i know it was hers no sows heart or does would have continued to beat and pulse after it had been cut out as that one did i took it to my chamber i did not eat it i hung it from the beams above my bed placed it on a length of twine that i strung with rowanberries orangered as a robins breast and with bulbs of garlic outside the snow fell covering the footprints of my huntsmen covering her tiny body in the forest where it lay i had the smith remove the iron bars from my windows and i would spend some time in my room each afternoon through the short winter days gazing out over the forest until darkness fell there were as i have already stated people in the forest they would come out some of them for the spring fair a greedy feral dangerous people some were stunted dwarfs and midgets and hunchbacks others had the huge teeth and vacant gazes of idiots some had fingers like flippers or crabclaws they would creep out of the forest each year for the spring fair held when the snows had melted as a young lass i had worked at the fair and they had scared me then the forest folk i told fortunes for the fairgoers scrying in a pool of still water and later when i was older in a disc of polished glass its back all silvered a gift from a merchant whose straying horse i had seen in a pool of ink the stallholders at the fair were afraid of the forest folk they would nail their wares to the bare boards of their stalls slabs of gingerbread or leather belts were nailed with great iron nails to the wood if their wares were not nailed they said the forest folk would take them and run away chewing on the stolen gingerbread flailing about them with the belts the forest folk had money though a coin here another there sometimes stained green by time or the earth the face on the coin unknown to even the oldest of us also they had things to trade and thus the fair continued serving the outcasts and the dwarfs serving the robbers who preyed on the rare travellers from lands beyond the forest or on gypsies or on the deer this was robbery in the eyes of the law the deer were the queens the years passed by slowly and my people claimed that i ruled them with wisdom the heart still hung above by bed pulsing gently in the night if there were any who mourned the child i saw no evidence she was a thing of terror back then and they believed themselves well rid of her spring fair followed spring fair five of them each sadder poorer shoddier than the one before fewer of the forest folk came out of the forest to buy those who did seemed subdued and listless the stallholders stopped nailing their wares to the boards of their stalls and by the fifth year but a handful of folk came from the forest a fearful huddle of little hairy men and noone else the lord of the fair and his page came to me when the fair was done i had known him slightly before i was queen i do not come to you as my queen he said i said nothing i listened i come to you because you are wise he continued when you were a child you found a strayed foal by staring into a pool of ink when you were a maiden you found a lost infant who had wandered far from her mother by staring into that mirror of yours you know secrets and you can seek out things hidden my queen he asked what is taking the forest folk next year there will be no spring fair the travellers from other kingdoms have grown scarce and few the folk of the forest are almost gone another year like the last and we shall all starve i commanded my maidservant to bring me my lookingglass it was a simple thing a silverbacked glass disk which i kept wrapped in a doeskin in a chest in my chamber they brought it to me then and i gazed into it she was twelve and she was no longer a little child her skin was still pale her eyes and hair coalblack her lips as red as blood she wore the clothes she had worn when she left the castle for the last time the blouse the skirt although they were much letout much mended over them she wore a leather cloak and instead of boots she had leather bags tied with thongs over her tiny feet she was standing in the forest beside a tree as i watched in the eye of my mind i saw her edge and step and flitter and pad from tree to tree like an animal a bat or a wolf she was following someone he was a monk he wore sackcloth and his feet were bare and scabbed and hard his beard and tonsure were of a length overgrown unshaven she watched him from behind the trees eventually he paused for the night and began to make a fire laying twigs down breaking up a robins nest as kindling he had a tinderbox in his robe and he knocked the flint against the steel until the sparks caught the tinder and the fire flamed there had been two eggs in the nest he had found and these he ate raw they cannot have been much of a meal for so big a man he sat there in the firelight and she came out from her hiding place she crouched down on the other side of the fire and stared at him he grinned as if it were a long time since he had seen another human and beckoned her over to him she stood up and walked around the fire and waited an armslength away he pulled in his robe until he found a coin a tiny copper penny and tossed it to her she caught it and nodded and went to him he pulled at the rope around his waist and his robe swung open his body was as hairy as a bears she pushed him back onto the moss one hand crept spiderlike through the tangle of hair until it closed on his manhood the other hand traced a circle on his left nipple he closed his eyes and fumbled one huge hand under her skirt she lowered her mouth to the nipple she had been teasing her smooth skin white on the furry brown body of him she sank her teeth deep into his breast his eyes opened then they closed again and she drank she straddled him and she fed as she did so a thin blackish liquid began to dribble from between her legs do you know what is keeping the travellers from our town what is happening to the forest people asked the head of the fair i covered the mirror in doeskin and told him that i would personally take it upon myself to make the forest safe once more i had to although she terrified me i was the queen a foolish woman would have gone then into the forest and tried to capture the creature but i had been foolish once and had no wish to be so a second time i spent time with old books for i could read a little i spent time with the gypsy women who passed through our country across the mountains to the south rather than cross the forest to the north and the west i prepared myself and obtained those things i would need and when the first snows began to fall then i was ready naked i was and alone in the highest tower of the palace a place open to the sky the winds chilled my body goosepimples crept across my arms and thighs and breasts i carried a silver basin and a basket in which i had placed a silver knife a silver pin some tongs a grey robe and three green apples i put them down and stood there unclothed on the tower humble before the night sky and the wind had any man seen me standing there i would have had his eyes but there was noone to spy clouds scudded across the sky hiding and uncovering the waning moon i took the silver knife and slashed my left arm once twice three times the blood dripped into the basin scarlet seeming black in the moonlight i added the powder from the vial that hung around my neck it was a brown dust made of dried herbs and the skin of a particular toad and from certain other things it thickened the blood while preventing it from clotting i took the three apples one by one and pricked their skins gently with my silver pin then i placed the apples in the silver bowl and let them sit there while the first tiny flakes of snow of the year fell slowly onto my skin and onto the apples and onto the blood when dawn began to brighten the sky i covered myself with the grey cloak and took the red apples from the silver bowl one by one lifting each into my basket with silver tongs taking care not to touch it there was nothing left of my blood or of the brown powder in the silver bowl save nothing save a black residue like a verdigris on the inside i buried the bowl in the earth then i cast a glamour on the apples as once years before by a bridge i had cast a glamour on myself that they were beyond any doubt the most wonderful apples in the world and the crimson blush of their skins was the warm colour of fresh blood i pulled the hood of my cloak low over my face and i took ribbons and pretty hair ornaments with me placed them above the apples in the reed basket and i walked alone into the forest until i came to her dwelling a high sandstone cliff laced with deep caves going back a way into the rock wall there were trees and boulders around the cliffface and i walked quietly and gently from tree to tree without disturbing a twig or a fallen leaf eventually i found my place to hide and i waited and i watched after some hours a clutch of dwarfs crawled out of the cavefront ugly misshapen hairy little men the old inhabitants of this country you saw them seldom now they vanished into the wood and none of them spied me though one of them stopped to piss against the rock i hid behind i waited no more came out i went to the cave entrance and hallooed into it in a cracked old voice the scar on my mound of venus throbbed and pulsed as she came towards me out of the darkness naked and alone she was thirteen years of age my stepdaughter and nothing marred the perfect whiteness of her skin save for the livid scar on her left breast where her heart had been cut from her long since the insides of her thighs were stained with wet black filth she peered at me hidden as i was in my cloak she looked at me hungrily ribbons goodwife i croaked pretty ribbons for your hair she smiled and beckoned to me a tug the scar on my hand was pulling me towards her i did what i had planned to do but i did it more readily than i had planned i dropped my basket and screeched like the bloodless old pedlar woman i was pretending to be and i ran my grey cloak was the colour of the forest and i was fast she did not catch me i made my way back to the palace i did not see it let us imagine though the girl returning frustrated and hungry to her cave and finding my fallen basket on the ground what did she do i like to think she played first with the ribbons twined them into her raven hair looped them around her pale neck or her tiny waist and then curious she moved the cloth to see what else was in the basket and she saw the red red apples they smelled like fresh apples of course and they also smelled of blood and she was hungry i imagine her picking up an apple pressing it against her cheek feeling the cold smoothness of it against her skin and she opened her mouth and bit deep into it by the time i reached my chambers the heart that hung from the roofbeam with the apples and hams and the dried sausages had ceased to beat it hung there quietly without motion or life and i felt safe once more that winter the snows were high and deep and were late melting we were all hungry come the spring the spring fair was slightly improved that year the forest folk were few but they were there and there were travellers from the lands beyond the forest i saw the little hairy men of the forestcave buying and bargaining for pieces of glass and lumps of crystal and of quartzrock they paid for the glass with silver coins the spoils of my stepdaughters depredations i had no doubt when it got about what they were buying townsfolk rushed back to their homes came back with their lucky crystals and in a few cases with whole sheets of glass i thought briefly about having them killed but i did not as long as the heart hung silent and immobile and cold from the beam of my chamber i was safe and so were the folk of the forest and thus eventually the folk of the town my twentyfifth year came and my stepdaughter had eaten the poisoned fruit two winters back when the prince came to my palace he was tall very tall with cold green eyes and the swarthy skin of those from beyond the mountains he rode with a small retinue large enough to defend him small enough that another monarch myself for instance would not view him as a potential threat i was practical i thought of the alliance of our lands thought of the kingdom running from the forests all the way south to the sea i thought of my goldenhaired bearded love dead these eight years and in the night i went to the princes room i am no innocent although my late husband who was once my king was truly my first lover no matter what they say at first the prince seemed excited he bade me remove my shift and made me stand in front of the opened window far from the fire until my skin was chilled stonecold then he asked me to lie upon my back with my hands folded across my breasts my eyes wide open but staring only at the beams above he told me not to move and to breathe as little as possible he implored me to say nothing he spread my legs apart it was then that he entered me as he began to thrust inside me i felt my hips raise felt myself begin to match him grind for grind push for push i moaned i could not help myself his manhood slid out of me i reached out and touched it a tiny slippery thing please he said softly you must neither move nor speak just lie there on the stones so cold and so fair i tried but he had lost whatever force it was that had made him virile and some short while later i left the princes room his curses and tears still resounding in my ears he left early the next morning with all his men and they rode off into the forest i imagine his loins now as he rode a knot of frustration at the base of his manhood i imagine his pale lips pressed so tightly together then i imagine his little troupe riding through the forest finally coming upon the glassandcrystal cairn of my stepdaughter so pale so cold naked beneath the glass and little more than a girl and dead in my fancy i can almost feel the sudden hardness of his manhood inside his britches envision the lust that took him then the prayers he muttered beneath his breath in thanks for his good fortune i imagine him negotiating with the little hairy men offering them gold and spices for the lovely corpse under the crystal mound did they take his gold willingly or did they look up to see his men on their horses with their sharp swords and their spears and realize they had no alternative i do not know i was not there i was not scrying i can only imagine hands pulling off the lumps of glass and quartz from her cold body hands gently caressing her cold cheek moving her cold arm rejoicing to find the corpse still fresh and pliable did he take her there in front of them all or did he have her carried to a secluded nook before he mounted her i cannot say did he shake the apple from her throat or did her eyes slowly open as he pounded into her cold body did her mouth open those red lips part those sharp yellow teeth close on his swarthy neck as the blood which is the life trickled down her throat washing down and away the lump of apple my own my poison i imagine i do not know this i do know i was woken in the night by her heart pulsing and beating once more salt blood dripped onto my face from above i sat up my hand burned and pounded as if i had hit the base of my thumb with a rock there was a hammering on the door i felt afraid but i am a queen and i would not show fear i opened the door first his men walked in to my chamber and stood around me with their sharp swords and their long spears then he came in and he spat in my face finally she walked into my chamber as she had when i was first a queen and she was a child of six she had not changed not really she pulled down the twine on which her heart was hanging she pulled off the dried rowan berries one by one pulled off the garlic bulb now a dried thing after all these years then she took up her own her pumping heart a small thing no larger than that of a nannygoat or a shebear as it brimmed and pumped its blood into her hand her fingernails must have been as sharp as glass she opened her breast with them running them over the purple scar her chest gaped suddenly open and bloodless she licked her heart once as the blood ran over her hands and she pushed the heart deep into her breast i saw her do it i saw her close the flesh of her breast once more i saw the purple scar begin to fade her prince looked briefly concerned but he put his arm around her nonetheless and they stood side by side and they waited and she stayed cold and the bloom of death remained on her lips and his lust was not diminished in any way they told me they would marry and the kingdoms would indeed be joined they told me that i would be with them on their wedding day it is starting to get hot in here they have told the people bad things about me a little truth to add savour to the dish but mixed with many lies i was bound and kept in a tiny stone cell beneath the palace and i remained there through the autumn today they fetched me out of the cell they stripped the rags from me and washed the filth from me and then they shaved my head and my loins and they rubbed my skin with goose grease the snow was falling as they carried me two men at each hand two men at each leg utterly exposed and spreadeagled and cold through the midwinter crowds and brought me to this kiln my stepdaughter stood there with her prince she watched me in my indignity but she said nothing as they thrust me inside jeering and chaffing as they did so i saw one snowflake land upon her white cheek and remain there without melting they closed the kilndoor behind me it is getting hotter in here and outside they are singing and cheering and banging on the sides of the kiln she was not laughing or jeering or talking she did not sneer at me or turn away she looked at me though and for a moment i saw myself reflected in her eyes i will not scream i will not give them that satisfaction they will have my body but my soul and my story are my own and will die with me the goosegrease begins to melt and glisten upon my skin i shall make no sound at all i shall think no more on this i shall think instead of the snowflake on her cheek i think of her hair as black as coal her lips as red as blood her skin snowwhite end
