returning from an early lunch at an indian restaurant just a fiveminute walk away from ebranch hq in the heart of london ben trask sweated inside and out inside from the curry which was still searing his mouth and throat outside from the unusually warm may weather the noonday sun blazed down on him from a sky as vast and blue as the ionian which he hoped his visitor from another world was enjoying because trask sure as hell was not in fact ever since zek foener and nathan kiklu had gone off to the greek islands a few days ago trask had been right out of sorts with himself and with everyone else in his topsecret espionage organization he thought about the two worried about them equally but for different reasons about nathan because he was probably the most valuable and certainly the most what unique man in the world even in two worlds and about zek because he loved her at his age finally to have fallen in love not that he was ancient and he certainly wasnt past it but it compjicated matters and with zek in the greek islands things seemed even more complicated that silly old saw which has it out of sight out of mind had it backwards as far as trask was concerned she was out of sight all right but shed never been more in his mind than right now and even as he thought it the thought itself was like an invocation deep water the salt sea weeds and sediment obscuring trasks vision no zeks vision and the pain in hisher chest heart hammering vision bjurring lungs screaming for air sweet jesus she was drowning and she was jetting him know about it in the onjy way she could for zek was one of the worlds finest telepaths ben the word exploded into his mind like a bomb try not to feel too bad about it zek he yelled out loud and could actually taste the water flooding into hisher mouth good bye ben trask staggered whirled fell and felt his knees slam down hard on the dusty pavement but it didnt hurt nothing hurt except the fact that zeks telepathic voice was dead in his mind and that zek herself across the road people were staring a cars horn blared and its astonished driver gazed down at trask where he kneeled halfon halfoff the road then the car swept on by and people came running questioning someone asked if trask had been hit he shook his head got to his feet and staggered again a young couple grabbed him held him upright and the girl asked are you all right numb he nodded he was all right yes but zek it was midmay and under the hot sun trask was cold sweat rivered his face and stuck his shirt to his back yet he was cold cold in his mind from the feel and the taste of the deep salt water but far colder from the memory of zeks telepathic voice crying there and dying there in his mind cold from the sudden emptiness of everything zek he shook the young couple off shouldered people aside started to walk along the pavement and ended up running and ran sweating and shivering down the sidestreet to the back of the hotel whose top floor housed ebranch hq he found the private door after the sunlight it was like night in there there was only the darkness until he used his passcard to enter the elevator with its electric ceiling light and even then it was dark but that was in his mind and he knew that the darkness was only the absence of zek in which case it might last forever then the elevator shuddered to a halt the doors hissed open and trask stumbled out into the main corridor which was flooded an inch of water went sluicing into the elevator now what the hojy there were espers in the corridor trask recognized faces without considering the amazement the relief the what triumph jubilation written on every one of them there was a smell of ocean seaweed salt the smell matched the taste of zek in trasks mind so that once again he asked himself now what the holy the tall cadaverous usually melancholy figure of the precog lan goodly loomed into view but now his eyes were alight with elation he grabbed trasks arm husked ben hes done it nathans done it done it trask found it hard to gather his thoughts concentrate his mind goodly was wet splotched he smelled of seawater just like the entire corridor smelled of it his trousers were drenched from the knees down and clung to his thin calves and now david chung branch locator had arrived on the scene he too was soaked from head to toe and grinning like an oriental lunatic done what trask demanded looking from one to the other what has nathan done and anyway hes somewhere in the ionian with with zek and finally losing it why doesnt someone tell me what the fuck is going on here they were in the greek islands ben goodly suddenly saw how close trask was to shock but he also knew how difficult it would be to shock a man who always knew the truth a human liedetector like the current head of ebranch and looking at him goodly thought to himself hes improved hardened with age and time oh ben has soft human edges too but the man inside the mind soul and personality the id is diamondhard trask was about fiveten just a pound or two overweight mouseyhaired and greeneyed his broad shoulders sloped just a little his arms dangled somewhat and his expression was what lugubrious or maybe that was a direct result of his talent for in a world where the simple truth was increasingly hard to come by it was no easy thing to possess a mind which could not accept a lie this was an election year and trasks current gripe was with politicians watching partypolitical broadcasts he would frequently burst out the trouble with these people is that they never lie but they never tell the truth either and now he was staring hard at goodly asking what was that you said they were in the ionian what the hell do you mean goodly knew there was only one way to tell it and so answered they were there yes ben but just a few minutes ago nathan brought them back trasks jaw fell open not without an effort he closed it and said he brought them brought them back here yes goodly nodded through the mobius continuum and now trasks jaw dropped open all the way so that once again he must close it before gasping the continuum at which the truth finally dawned on him if not in regard to nathan certainly in respect of zek the fact that she was alive hed known it was the truth of course even as goodly said the words but it seemed so far beyond his wildest hopes and dreams that even trask had held back from letting it register just a moment ago hed known that zek foener was dead he had literally heard and felt her die and yet now as trasks feet touched earth again he snapped out of it and demanded to know where are they are they okay and zek is she okay david chung answered him theyre sedated weve fixed up a couple of beds in the ops room but it was a close thing they were in the sea and when they came through i thought half of the mediterranean was coming through with them trask grabbed him said but how did it happen dont we know anything about it christ i take an hour off for lunch everything goes mad nathan said a few words before we put him under chung answered but we had to put them out of it for a while they were exhausted and in shock especially zek and it might easily have developed into something worse so what exactly did nathan say trask headed for the ops room with the others in tow it seems it was a party of tzonovs thugs goodly took up the story nathans special branch minders were taken by surprise and murdered nathan and zek ran for it into the sea more of tzonovs people were waiting for them they had wetsuits and spearguns and were already in the water for all we know at this stage the entire operation was launched from the sea but when the chips were down and there was no other way out nathan did his thing except there was probably a lot more to it than that oh trask glanced at him and pressed on into the ops room where a small knot of espers was gathered around a pair of sixfoot tables goodly followed on behind nodding there had been some pretty weird stuff going on here stuff that told us these two were in trouble he gave a shrug so we did what we could for them goodly was wont to understate things his british phlegmatism but the precogs pretty weird stuff statement told trask a lot namely that there was still a lot he hadnt been told all of this in an hour he said as the espers around the tables moved aside to make room for their head of branch and trask came to a halt between a pair of prone figures apparently asleep in hastily madeup beds in a lot less than an hour david chung put in let me tell you about it myself lan geoff smart we all got the message at the same time that something was wrong with me it was nathans earring the thing came alive in my hand i cant say what it was for smart but hes an empath and hes done a lot of work with nathan maybe he sensed the trouble they were in even at that range and of course lan reads the future and apparently hed seen me plugging in the computer in harrys room so we went there and i plugged it in then it was the same as before the numbers equations whatever im no mathematician so you tell me but it was all on the screen except it wasnt quite the same this time the numbers came together fused formed into something else something that was i dont know solid well almost solid trask had taken zeks wrist feeling the steady pulse he issued a sigh of relief zejc you spoke to me when you thought it was ajj over i was the one you spoke to it meant an awful lot to him then as if it were his first breath in a week he filled his lungs to bursting finally frowning he looked at chung something solid you say on the computer screen goodly took up the story again do you remember those golden darts ben i mean when harry died of course i remember them and the one we saw entering into the computer in fact the computer showed it to us right trask nodded stepped away from the tables and beckoned the others back let them breathe for christs sake and to goodly what about it the way i see it goodly answered that dart or whatever it was its been waiting in there before the computer seemed to be running off its own power youll remember it wasnt plugged in well whatever it was that powered the display that time call it a ghost if you like or an echo of harry keogh it must have just about burned itself out but this time it was tapping a legitimate power source which boosted what was left of it so this is what we saw the numbers stopped dead on the screen and like david said formed into something solid a golden dart oh it was faint as a wisp of yellow smoke pretty insubstantial stuff but it was real and then it left the screen it what trasks frown knotted his forehead it left the screen goodly repeated and it passed out through the wall of the room and was gone gone gone where geoff smart the empath had arrived from somewhere having heard what had been said he now put in i think thats something youll have to ask nathan when he comes out of it trask glanced at the speaker smart was something less than six feet tall sturdily built redhaired crewcut he looked like a boxer aggressive but was in fact mildmannered what he lacked in looks found compensation in what trask called his withness his intense ability to relate his talent was empathy in which capacity he had worked very closely with nathan it was oddson that smart would be correct in his as yet unspoken estimate of what had occurred but unspoken or not trask read the truth in it anyway youre telling me that this dart went looking for him smart nodded and found him thats my bet i think its been in there in the computer just waiting for him which is why none of you ever messed with harrys room all this time because you could sense it in there why not youre all espers after all but when nathan got here the thing revealed itself and given a power source at last when chung plugged it in the dart went home trask finished it for him went home to nathan again smart nodded thats how i see it yes it finished the job that we had started on him trask continued almost to himself staring in something approaching awe at the young man on the second bed it gave him the mobius continuum and made him complete but this was his first time ever and still he was able to find his way back here and bring zek with him david chung spoke up he wasnt entirely on his own i mean i think maybe i had something to do with it or rather that this had something to do with it he held up nathans golden earring in the warped shape of a mobius loop a vampire lord called maglore gave this to nathan before he escaped from turgosheim i think maglore was using it to spy on him but as a locating device the earring works both ways nathan must have homed in on it and thats how he found his way back here trask looked at them all standing around him looked from face to face and then at zek foener and the necroscope nathan keogh lying tranquillized in their makeshift beds finally he grinned and shook his head in wonder and to smart goodly and chung he said so all three of you had a hand in it right god what would we do without you what would any of us anywhere do without you his steady gaze spread to encompass the rest of his espers and i do mean all of you it was the finest compliment he had ever paid them the plan was simple nathan had revisited sir keenan gormleys resting place to fix its coordinates in his mind and also to tell the exhead of branch that he was experimenting with the mobius continuum now having returned to ebranch hq he would attempt a mobius jump to gormleys garden of repose in the event that something went wrong david chung would be ready with nathans sigil earring to guide him home and so that it would be more in keeping as a genuine scientific experiment other branch members would be in situ at gormleys memorial to time any lapse between nathans jump from hq and his arrival in the kensington cemetery all was now in place it was am and the midcity temperature was already climbing nathan trask and a majority of ebranch agents were in the ops room every single man of them with a film of sweat on his brow although the airconditioning was up full finally trask said well son and now its all yours nathan smiled nervously looked at them each in his turn and last but not least at zek she smiled reassuringly reminding him youve done it once he nodded when i had to yes trask was anxious and said look if you want to postpone this no nathan cut him off let it be now theres no time left if i can do it it will give me the edge ill need back on sunside david chung stepped forward grinned selfconsciously and said nathan i and stuck out his hand they clasped forearms in the szgany fashion and chung stepped back again then as if at a signal the espers backed away from nathan where he stood in the centre of the room and it was time utter silence fell and the expressions on all faces grew tense expectant nathan felt the force of their minds concentrated upon him from where they stood in a circle but at a safe distance and feeling their eyes their minds on him like that and concerned that they might in some way interfere with the process he closed his own eyes to shut them out but he couldnt close his mind indeed he must open his mind open it and conjure the numbers vortex and at once instantaneously so rapidly that the effect almost unnerved him mobius equations commenced to mutate on the screen of his metaphysical mind it was the vortex and yet it was not the vortex the numbers characters and symbols were the same but the pattern was not there was no actual whirlpool of numbers as such but an ordered march of evolving calculi and everchanging equations like the emerging answer to a question of immense complexity unravelling onto the screen of some gigantic computer but the big difference was this nathan was no longer ignorant no longer innumerate he now knew what he was looking for and how to control and use it and suddenly it was there and he froze it the big equation framed on the screen of his mind like a page of printout frozen there yes for a single moment before it dissolved and warped and formed a door a mobius door and nathan sensed that it was here that it was real his eyes snapped open and he saw it there in the room with him a single pace away and he knew he was the only one the only man in the world who could see it the next scene would be remembered forever by everyone who witnessed it they were intent upon nathan they drank in every aspect of him his looks dress stance even something of his feelings perhaps until the picture of the man entire was etched into their extra mundane minds standing erect head high staring a little to one side and with his bottom jaw falling open a fraction as he became aware of something far beyond the sensory range of the rest nathan keogh was an imposing young man of twenty or twentyone years his simple clothes of this world were nothing special but the man inside them was he was the necroscope who talked to dead men in their graves and so had access to all the secrets of the past perhaps even of the future and yet had no real time to explore or use such knowledge to his own best advantage not yet anyway nathan was something more than six feet tall he had an athletes body broad shoulders narrow waist powerful arms and legs his eyes might be very slightly slanted or perhaps it was only his frown the look of rapt attention on his face as he gazed at the mainly unknown which to the rest with the exception of zek was completely unknown his nose was straight and seemed small under a broad forehead flanked by high cheekbones and over a square chin which jutted a little his mouth was full and tended to slant downwards a fraction to the left in others this might suggest cynicism but not in him rather the opposite for looking at nathan ben trask knew the truth of him which had to be revenant of his father harry keogh a natural innocence and compassion the soulfulness of the mind behind the face so that without being keoghs spitting image still the visitor felt like him these had been trasks thoughts the first time hed laid eyes on nathan and nothing had occurred to change them as for what was happening here that could only confirm these thoughts beyond any further doubt nathan viewed the mobius door and stepped forward the act was almost robotic automatic instinctive as if he were drawn to the door as if the place beyond it lured him irresistibly which of course it did then glancing just once at trask and the others he took a final unsteady but resolute pace right out of this world he was there and he was gone they saw his right foot calf thigh half of his body and face disappear and the rest of him follow into nothingness the necroscope nathan keogh was no longer in the room just motes of dust drifting in the sunlight through the window blinds flowing into the vacuum where he had been easily stated but astonishing to the witnesses an agent on the briefing podium almost forgot to say his magic word into his handset and only just remembered in time now and the answer came back at once from the kensington crematorium now the man on the podium frowned at his handset yes now for christs sake why are you repeating me hes just done it hes just gone in and again the answer in a brief burst of static whos repeating you im telling you hes just come out hes here now no timelapse at all not to them but to nathan he stepped in through the metaphysical mobius door and entered a place beyond all places beyond all times yet encompassed by and encompassing spacetime itself it was not the same as could not be likened to any experience hed ever known before even the first time hed been here with zek less than twentyfour hours ago it had been different at the very least there had been water then a great spout of ionian seawater which had entered the continuum under its own pressure dispersing to wherever now there wasnt even that there was nothing it was a place of utter darkness perhaps even the primal darkness itself which existed before this universe or any parallel universe such as nathans began except there wasnt only an absence of light but an absence of everything nathan might well be at the entirely conjectural core of a black hole except a black hole has enormous gravity and this place had none no gravity no time no light not a place obeying one single law of nature or science and therefore a place outside the universe we know and yet existing within the universe we know for it had twice been conjured by a common or an uncommon human being by the necroscope nathan keogh as for nathans father harry had been an habitual user almost an inhabitant of the place both central and external the mobius continuum was nowhere and it was everywhere from such a starting point one might go anywhere or go nowhere forever and it would be for ever for in this timeless environment nothing would ever age or change except by force of will which was a fact that nathan knew without knowing how he knew it but then how does a moorhen chick know how to swim it was in his mind his blood his genes a place then this mobius continuum which might well be its best indeed its only description but nathans tutors had also touched upon theology especially that of the christian religion and nathan sensed that in some way this might even be a holy place if so then little wonder hed been put to such pains to discover it for it must be a very private holy place in which no god as yet had uttered those wonderful words of evocation let there be light or if such words had been spoken then this was the source of everything the initial singularity from which the all had shone out in a great and glorious beginning and as that thought dawned at a stroke so nathan hit upon the greatest secret of all which had taken his father a veritable lifetime to discover but it was only a thought which he hadnt recognized as the truth what he did recognize was this that empty as this place was and as far removed from mans laws as could be still it had laws and forces of its own for even now he could feel one such force working on him trying to move remove or dislodge him from this unreal place back into the real but nathan had a will of his own and wasnt about to be moved except in the direction he desired behind nathan if mundane directions had any meaning in such a place the mobius door closed and remembering his purpose here he pictured the garden of repose in kensington which was his target destination it had been his plan to picture sir keenan gormleys memorial marker to focus upon the plaque and use it as a different kind of marker but he now saw that this wasnt necessary for no sooner had the crematorium in kensington entered his thoughts than he found himself in motion and knew that he was headed in that direction it was as if he were drawn along a route though whether in a straight line a curve up or down it was impossible to say or even guess but definitely he felt the first tentative tugging of some force other than the mobius continuums rejection forces not even a tugging as such but more a gentle pressure that seemed to want to guide him hed known something like it before when tracking the mobius loop symbol from zakynthos in the aegean back to ebranch hq then it had been his lifeline zeks too and remembering that he felt in no way threatened he simply went with the motion the feeling following it to its source the coordinates of keenan gormleys garden of repose in kensington and like seeing a light at the end of a tunnel so nathan sensed the way ahead and accelerated his metaphysical motion by willing himself that way towards it and as if hed been walking and had suddenly broken into a run he sensed that he was moving that much faster so incredibly fast indeed that he was there and going from the incalculable velocity of thought to stationary in less than a second yet feeling no discomfort whatsoever nathan conjured another mobius door and stepped across the threshold light such brilliant light that he gasped and screwed his eyes tight shut and gravity nathan staggered a moment as his feet touched solid earth and his legs trembled where they took his weight then someone said now and eager hands reached out to steady him and despite that time had seemed to pass during nathans trip from ebranch hq to kensington this was that same moment when the voice of the esper on the podium made his allimportant mistake and asked his allimportant question yes now for christs sake why are you repeating me which sounded now from a handset in the kensington crematorium where nathan stood important for this reason it was the first proof positive that time in the mobius continuum is nonexistent well done nathan someone gasped his amazement his congratulations while in the necroscopes deadspeak mind well done son sir keenan gormley applauded his efforts and now more than ever you feel like your father in answer to which nathan was quick to inquire as he was in the beginning or at the end for a moment the other was silent but nathan sensed his shudder then its true harry made mistakes sir keenan gave a deadspeak nod but dont forget mistakes are what make us human and almost as if his experience in the mobius continuum had soured his mind making it caustic and cynical again nathans rapid riposte oh but surely harrys mistake made him inhuman its what cost him his humanity but he knew that the other wasnt going to let him get away with that a clever man learns by his mistakes sir keenan answered in a little while by his own mistakes and by those of others in your case by your fathers you have a long way to go yet son but godspeed and take care along the way nathan take care along the way after that and during the next twentyfour hours which was all the time he had left nathan used the mobius continuum and the markers or coordinates which were his evergrowing coterie of dead friends constantly until the geography of this strange world was no longer just a series of contour lines trigonometrical points watercolour oceans or bland white icecaps in the pages of an atlas but a living breathing source of constant wonder astonishment even awe for the difference between this world and his own was like that between garlic and honey and not simply in the sense that one was sour and the other sweet but that in almost every other instance they were poles apart indeed they were parallel dimensions apart only in the mountainous regions was there any real similarity of flora and fauna if nothing else but even the mountains were different in a world where the sun shone on both sides of the range for this earth was one world a complete continuous system one system like a living creature in its own right while sunsidestarside as its name might suggest had often seemed like two sunside was a place of light warmth love and life while starside was cold and gloomy full of obscene black hatreds bitter feuds and loathsome undeath how could it possibly be otherwise the one housed the szgany nathans people while the other was home to the wamphyri but earth this parallel earth was wholly beautiful and that despite that certain of its people were not so nathan thought at first anyway before hed seen the industrial wastelands of eastern europe and those regions closed off to men forever because of their seething nuclear pollution harry keogh had had a great many friends among the dead and now they all wanted to speak to nathan in one way it was new to him the szgany dead of his home world had wanted nothing to do with him although he had often heard them whispering to each other in their graves but on the other hand it seemed very familiar for the ostensibly primitive thyre of sunsides furnace deserts had been eager to know him from the first when he had gone out into the sweltering desert to die only to find the will to live and a goal or worthwhile direction in which to aim his life the realization of his deadspeak had supplied the will to live while his goal had been the mobius continuum well and now that he had tamed the vortex the mobius continuum was his to explore at will so the two talents went hand in hand while nathans telepathy was a bonus which his father had not known or at least not until the last of his days but as for other esoteric talents harry keogh had not gone wanting indeed he had explored and practised one such art which in the light of what nathan had learned of earths religions might only be considered blasphemous for it was one thing that rotting cadavers should feel empowered to will themselves up from their graves for the love of others but another entirely that the long dead should be called back into life against their will and raised up out of their very salts dust and ashes by a sorcerer for his own dark purposes yes a monstrous talent this necromancy and yet without it in a town called bonnyrigg not far from edinburgh there had lived a small boy who lost his puppy under the wheels of a speeding car but for harry keoghs skill the pup would have stayed lost who could gauge the enduring pleasure that a mongrel dogs life had brought into the world of a boy a youth a man even a family for paddy was alive still the dog and his master both grown up now and nathan had been to visit them but while on the one hand paddy was only a mongrel dog harry keoghs first experiment with necromancy on the other hand there had been men too called back into life by his art even a pretty young girl called penny all of whom had known the hell of dying twice needlessly because of harry and yet not all of the people hed touched in this way had been victims in the zarundului mountains of romania nathan talked to a thracian warlord called bodrogk and to his wife sofia or rather to what remained of them for they were no more of the flesh but a few handfuls of dust blown away on the winds of the world but because theyd died here they remained here still to tell nathan of his fathers works and none of the dead that he had spoken to or would speak to had more praise for harry than bodrogk the thracian and his wife sofia in the dark of night in the ruins of an old castle under a waxing moon their deadspeak voices thin as air appraised him of harry keoghs works how the necroscope had gone up against the last of the fabled ferenczys here janos the bloodson of faethor and won and nathan knew the story must be true not only because the dead were telling it but because the very name ferenc was a curse in his own world too as were all the names of the wamphyri but when nathan learned of the things this janos had done of the men hed called up from their sacred dust to torture them for their secrets and of their longdead women which hed used for other purposes then finally his mind was decided on the subject necromancy was a talent he would not pursue in any case it was abhorred by the thyre and the dead of the szgany alike which was why the latter had avoided nathan because he was the son of the helllander harry keogh it was the last legacy of his father which in his own world at least nathan still must live down either live it down or prove that harrys reputation in this respect was unwarranted but in this world now that the great majority had finally befriended him nathan visited a graveyard outside of ploiesti in romania whose dead had risen up on his fathers behalf against securitatea thugs in the days of ceausescu they were still there and they still remembered and made him welcome his father was a legend to them and they swore that despite the timidity of the great majority in general they had never turned their backs on harry keogh what but harry had been responsible for the removal of a great cancer out of their earth the termination of faethor ferenczy himself and his expulsion into the infinite abyss of future time indeed into mobius time for within the mobius continuum harry had sent the incorporeal spirit of the master vampire faethor winging down future timestreams with only his mind intact and no possible hope of rescue such had been the necroscopes loathing of vampires and such was his sons loathing of them he visited a cemetery not far from newcastle in englands northeast to talk to a prostitute harry had known pamelas one regret was that she had never known his father that way but she had known and liked him enough to dig her way out of her grave for him when he was in trouble it had happened at a time shortly before harry had been driven out of this world for starside when the necroscope had been up against a monster in human guise by the name of johnny found with pamelas help and the help of others of the teeming dead pounds victims all harry had destroyed him right there in that graveyard so nathan learned of his fathers works from the living and the dead alike from his friends in ebranch and from the teeming dead in their graves across the world and so he spanned the world in his efforts to track down any who had known harry keogh in order to vindicate his father and reestablish his reputation in point of fact it wasnt an absolute requirement that nathan visit their last resting places in order to talk to the dead it would be far easier to reach out a deadspeak probe seek them out across all the miles and do it that way but that had not been his fathers way the first necroscope had never been the one to shout at the great majority when he had desired to speak to a dead man then he had gone to see him except in matters of extreme urgency it had seemed the polite thing to do and so it seemed to nathan in this respect too he must use extreme caution a good many of harry keoghs dead friends lay in graves or other resting places within perimeters which had enclosed the once ussr even with the mobius continuum to command nathan knew enough to restrict his visits to places such as these just as there were espers in the west so there were talented men in the east and most of them belonged to turkur tzonov but so many dead people to visit because this might be his last chance so many of them who he must talk to and all to be seen to in little more than twentyfour hours a day a night and a morning because that was all the time nathan had left in this world at least to most men his itinerary the amount of work he packed into those few short hours would have been exhausting without the mobius continuum it would have been impossible nathan was szgany however and accustomed to the seemingly interminable hours of day and nighttime on sunsidestarside where each daynight cycle was equivalent to a week in the parallel world of earth in this respect he could and did drive himself to an almost insomniac extent but when all or as much as possible was done and nathan returned to ebranch hq after one last trip to a graveyard in the northeast of england where hed talked awhile and said a fond farewell to a personal friend the revenant spirit of a small girl called cynthia dead before her time then even he was weary it showed in his face as he stepped out of the mobius continuum into harrys room where david chung was no longer required to act as a homing beacon for nathan had the coordinates now and it also showed when he reported to ben trask as he had been instructed to do after each mobius trip ii trouble at ebranch the mobius route the head of branch wasnt looking too good himself trasks voice was more than a little testy when he reminded its friday nathan and weve a plane to catch you me and a couple of minders therell be more of our people waiting in belgrade in case turkur tzonov is watching and has agents there in fact you can bet your life he has and while were on the subject of tzonov you may not know it but i worry when youre away from here on your own that you might stray too far into his territory that he might somehow trap and kill you so maybe youd like to tell me why youve kept me waiting i was beginning to think youd left it too late our plane leaves in just three hours time its a standard flight of around two and a half hours maybe you can catch up on some lost sleep in the air frankly you look like you could use it but nathan shook his head and said no i dont think so flying isnt for me i dont really care for airplanes it took the wind right out of trasks sails he frowned and said what the i wasnt much for riding on wamphyri flyers either nathans smile was wan despite the tan hed picked up in the ionian and in a way planes are just as bad perhaps worse it was exciting enough at first i suppose but lets face it nothing that heavy should jump that high so why dont you take david chung to belgrade and ill do my sleeping here and catch up later youll catch up later nathan repeated it my way as soon as youre in the refuge at radujevac after a moments silence your way trask said the way he breathed the words they were like a sigh and in that same instant of time both men realized how much the older envied the younger but then perhaps in an attempt to disguise the fact trask asked does it come that easy to you now its getting easier yes with harry it was like walking talking breathing but hed had practice and im getting it you you brought zek here that way i mean yesterday trask had had plenty of time to think about it the idea should be old hat to him but it wasnt and never could be you just well brought her here from zakynthos thats right i did nathan wasnt boasting in the main it was still a mystery to him too he was just stating an anything but simple fact and even without his telepathy somehow he knew what was on trasks mind what was coming next son do you think trask began and squirmed a little in his chair he hated to obfuscate and liked all things clearcut perhaps it was his talent working in reverse i mean in his time your father took quite a few people with him along the mobius route but its something strange to me an experience i can never know isnt it its still strange to me too nathan answered and yet attractive maybe even addictive do you want to try it i i dont know trask began to shake his head then stopped and nodded yes i want to try it this could well be my one and only chance and do you trust me this time there was no hesitation yes of course i do you know i do nathan shrugged and smiled again so be it he said and so it would be nathan slept but trask was too excited to do anything but sit at his desk shuffle paper and try to keep his mind off what was coming next in just a few hours time for to dwell upon it he knew hed get no work done at all trask had been in a good many strange places and had done a good many strange things the strangest but this was to venture into a place where only a handful of men had ever been one which shouldnt even exist except in the fevered dreams of theoretical physicists or abstruse mathematicians the mobius continuum only let him think of it off he would go again into crazy dreams and fancies of his own but only fancies because there was no imagining how it would really be in the end he pushed the paperwork aside and went to the ops room this was to be the steppingoff point for romania it was empty now but in about three more hours they would all be here ebranch in its entirety or with the sole exception of anna marie english ecopath who for some months now had been working with the kids in the romanian refuge and at the same time making the way ready for nathan even the minister responsible would be here because this was something hed never seen either but ben trask had seen it even before nathan that time at harry keoghs place not far from bonnyrigg his last refuge on earth when the necroscope had reached the end of his time in this world trask had seen harry in his wamphyri mode had witnessed something of a vampires weird metamorphosis and sometimes he nightmared about it still but as for the mobius continuum that was something you didnt see unless you were the one who conjured it but you could see it in use certainly remembering the way harry had looked that night when the branch burned his house trask shivered again jesus the wamphyri overlords of nathans world or of starside at least were like that he knew that they were of course indeed that they were worse than that for harry had fought the evil within himself all the way down the line and according to nathan even into starside itself but the wamphyri they gave free rein to their passions their lusts their evils they were evil incarnate as so often before one last picture of harry keogh came floating to the surface of trasks memory it was a scene from that same sad terrifying time when the necroscope had almost but not quite succumbed to his vampirism an esper called geoffrey paxton a treacherous telepathic dog who should never have been inducted into ebranch in the first place had tried to kill harry tried to shoot him with a crossbow failing he had fallen prey to harry and almost to the creature within him there in the garden of his burning house the vampire the wamphyri lord harry keogh had picked paxton up like a stuffed toy examining him eye to eye face to face one fragile human being albeit a piece of trash up against someone who had been the most human being and was now a monster paxton gapejawed and bulgeeyed his trembling coldsweating flesh only inches from the whitegleaming salivating gates of hell harrys face his mouth that crimson cavern of stalactite stalagmite teeth glistening and jagged as shards of broken glass what the gates of hell all of that and worse and trask had thought paxton is a piece of candy a sweetmeat a coconut flake hes something to munch on why harry could bite his face off if he wanted to following which the thought had occurred maybe he does want to maybe he will the memory persisted with trask shouting harry dont and the necroscope slowly closing those monstrous mantrap jaws looking up in the ruddy illumination of the burning house and glaring at trask across the misted garden then your world is safe ben harry had told him in his mind im not staying here and starside trask had wondered harrys mental shrug theres nowhere else at which he had released paxton and let him fall to the earth like the piece of rubbish he was and at the same time let trask know that the war was over but it hadnt been over for paxton snatching up his crossbow again the telepath had tried to shoot harry at which the necroscope had disappeared into the mobius continuum and that had been the first time trask had ever seen it close up in actual use with the deceptively sinuous grace of the wamphyri harry had stepped or flowed backwards away from paxton and into nothing and to trask and the ebranch agents in the garden it had seemed that he had simply ceased to be paxtons bolt had shot forward into the misty swirl of harrys vacuum and been eaten up by it leaving the telepath panting i got him im sure i got the bastard i couldnt miss but the mist where it had closed on the necroscope opened up again and a clotted gurgling apparently incorporeal voice had come out of it saying how sorry i am to have to disappoint you at that trask had snatched a breath of hot smoky air as a clawlike hand with nails like rusted fish hooks reached out of empty space closed over paxtons head and dragged him shrieking out of the garden and out of this world then harry might oh so easily have killed the telepath but he hadnt instead moments later hed delivered him back to the garden a man bereft of his telepathy which was the last favour that the necroscope had ever done for ebranch and the world in general following which a brief exchange of words an acknowledgement of the friendship they had known and harry had said look after yourself ben trask remembered it so well the way hed felt confusion pity shame and his last futile attempt to find another way harry wait but again the necroscope had used a mobius door to make his exit and for the last time trask had seen him step sideways into another place space time if thered been a rope it might well have been the indian rope trick if thered been a trick but there was no trick and the magic was all mathematical look after yourself ben again in the eye of memory trask saw harry standing there a monster yes but a man for all that followed by a replay of his eerie disappearance then dreams and memories gradually fading until suddenly even startlingly the head of branch was back in the empty ops room where now a hand fell on his shoulder trask gave a massive start halfturned saw the necroscope standing there but it was a newer younger necroscope himself startled by the older mans reaction to his presence and drawing back from him until trask regained control and took his arm nathan im sorry i was just thinking about your father and but here he paused as the look on the others face gave him away nathan already knew what trask had been thinking about your thoughts memories were so strong he shrugged by way of excusing himself but in no way negligently nathan knew better than to enter another mans mind unbidden i knew theyd be about me or about my father you should learn to guard your thoughts ben especially in your line of business better if youd kept that hypnotic guard on your mind which you had in perchorsk trask gave his head a rueful shake no i made mistakes in perchorsk a few anyway it seems that the act of blocking access to my mind took the edge off my talent tzonov and company couldnt see in too well but my vision was obscured too im only interested in the truth nathan halftruths arent good enough anyway this is ebranch there isnt a man here i wouldnt trust with my life let alone my thoughts your mind was very clear nathan told him so clear it was like i was there with you you were frightened when you saw my father and seeing him in your mind i knew why trask nodded he was wamphyri yes but he was strong too he never gave in to it not once thats what everyone keeps telling me nathan answered its as if you were saying if it should come to the worst remember that your father never gave in to it maybe we are saying that trask didnt deny it nathan even now you dont fully understand what a weapon you are and if you were wamphyri too if you should become wamphyri there was no way trask could know it but quite apart from tzonov and the opposition there were other men right there in london who had thought that selfsame thought the big difference between those men and trask was this that he was able to live with it with the exception of zek foener out in the city arranging a flight home to zante in the ionian the majority of ebranchs available agents were gathering in the ops room when lan goodly on the duty officers desk took the call from the minister responsible as soon as the callers identity was confirmed the precog asked him but arent you supposed to be here sir listen said the other urgently dont ask me if im supposed to be there tell me if they are still there they trask and nathan of course i mean have they gone into has nathan are they on their way to the refuge in another fifteen minutes yes theyre waiting for a call from chung to say hes arrived hes nathans beacon as you should know i do know now listen mr goodly isnt it we may be in for some trouble suddenly the precog knew what had been bothering him all day it was this and the minister responsible was on the point of telling him about it shit he said which wasnt like him at all what get on with it goodly snapped make it as fast as you can and dont worry ill follow what you tell me of course he would for he knew the gist of it already that trask and nathan certainly the latter were in great danger and so he would be attentive as never before the minister took the precog at his word speaking rapidly breathlessly he said goodly other people know about nathan they know about him and they have come to a decision but i dont agree with them it could cost me my job but i dont agree do you understand yes go on you dont know how relieved i was when trask spoke to me just a couple of hours ago and said that nathan was taking him along the mobius route because these people had fixed it that nathan wasnt going to make it out of the airport in belgrade that way they could blame it on the opposition goodly sucked in air so that it hissed between his teeth they were going to stop him going home but with prejudice extreme so when i heard that nathan would be what making his own travel arrangements it was a weight off my shoulders i imagine it would be goodly growled which wasnt like him either how come you havent mentioned this this belgrade reception before now what would it profit anyone i would have told trask of course i would if he hadnt brought these other arrangements to my attention but dont you know the risk im taking right now youre only risking your job not to have mentioned it would be to risk i know the minister cut him off but im doing it right give me credit for that at least so go on the flight had a tail wind and got into belgrade fifteen minutes early and of course trask and nathan werent on it so cmi smelled a rat cmi goodly frowned at the phone are we talking about combined military intelligence cmi was supposed to have shut down all of twelve years ago but among the other intelligence agencies it was common knowledge that they were as strong and devious as ever nathan is a big gun on the loose the minister answered nobody is in control of him hes not even of this world and his only interest is to get back to sunside at present but what weve always been worried about is this will that be the end of it will he stay there we had the same sort of problem with his father do you remember how many times has ben trask said what a weapon nathan would make and now hes just such a weapon of course cmi is interested they were going to make him an offer seduce or recruit him if you like away from ebranch but that was before he got the mobius continuum wait goodly cut in he only just got it so how come they got to know about it so quickly on the other end of the line he could almost hear the ministers groan which was as good an answer as any the minister responsible indeed then for christs sake goodly i have a job too you know i mean do you think im a law unto myself man theres always someone watching the watchers if anyone should know that you people should get to the point goodly snapped so trask and nathan werent on the plane whats next your place is next by now theyll know were trying to give them the slip just suppose you were looking for nathan where would you go next r my place you mean this place ebranch hq of course the belgrade party will have spoken to their london controller who will have seen to it that others are on their way to you even now whats more by now their orders will be quite specific christ what is it nothing said goodly slamming down the handset but in fact it was quite a lot for the precogs talent had been galvanized into action and in his minds eye the elevator doors bursting open a handful of muscular hardeyed greyuniformed paramilitaries spilling out into the corridor some of them carrying stubby automatics others with machinepistols or folded down submachineguns goodly running towards them being stopped and pinned up against a wall by two of them their voices clipped gritty as they aslted him your boss and the one called nathan where are they and him telling them in the ops room jesus the ops room before the precognitive vision had cleared from his mind goodly was out of his chair out from behind the duty officers desk and into the corridor the spinal corridor was a little less than fifty yards long thirty from the duty officers room to the ops room at one end racing that way goodlys eyes were drawn to the elevators indicator lights originally the elevator had been part of the hotel downstairs now there was only one stop the top floor ebranch hq but the floor indicator lights still worked as before and the cage had just started on its way up it could be of course that it was an ebranch agent a late arrival coming to see trask and nathan off except goodly didnt think so bursting through the swingdoors into the ops room he saw a circle of espers standing there shaking hands with nathan and the head of branch no one seemed in a hurry goodly was moving and thinking so fast that everyone else appeared to be stationary their heads turned in a weird sort of slowmotion to see what all the fuss was about the fuss was about him shouting ben nathan get the hell out of here i mean now the minister was on the blower cmi has men on their way here and theyre after nathan what trasks mouth yawned open in a gasp but he knew goodly like his own brother and his mind was quick to pick up the precogs warning he recognized the truth of what goodly had said and to nathan urgently son can we go now nathan closed his eyes frowned his concentration shook his head no its early and chung is still mobile also he was supposed to call us and we havent heard from him yet he could be in a car or something there could be people around we have to emerge somewhere safe in his minds eye goodly saw the elevator doors hissing open then go somewhere else he yelled as he rushed back out into the corridor til stall them and they were already there a handful of paramilitaries with weapons enough to start a small war but goodly knew how to handle it because hed already seen it careering down the corridor he flew straight into a pair of them grabbing him they pinned him to the wall and asked your boss and the one called nathan where are they in the in the ops room goodly gasped through a compressed windpipe where an arm was pressed to his throat where down there he flapped an arm towards the wrong end of the corridor but at that end cmi agents were already checking out the rooms while at the other end the ops room doors had been thrown open and a group of espers was emerging into the corridor goodly found himself thrust aside and followed on behind the paramilitaries as they ran crouching towards the ops room esper protests were ignored ben trasks mindspies r were pushed out of the way as the cmi men went through the swingdoors with goodly right behind them but in the room there was only a swirl of dustmotes spiralling in a stray beam of sunlight through the slatted windows you a cmi agent prodded goodly with his machinepistol you lied to us he was about fiveten blocky broadshouldered redhaired and crewcut a typical bullyboy he had to weigh about one hundred and eighty pounds his green eyes were set a little too close together and his lips were fleshy the bottom one slightly pendulous goodly scowled and brushed the gun aside other espers had come back into the room to stand watching silent with their arms folded on their chests now that trask and nathan were out of it things were different it was as the minister reponsible had said these men had specific orders did you hear what i said sputtering and suddenly red in the face the man with the machinepistol their platoon commander again turned his weapon towards goodly i heard goodly answered in his piping but in no way intimidated voice i always lie to people who break into private property and to thugs who threaten me so do all of the people here you and one of your men assaulted me in the corridor and youll pay for it youre cmi right well youll be dragged over some pretty hot coals for this the other cocked his weapon and his men followed suit and pressed forward but paul garvey a fullblown telepath had stepped up alongside goodly now garvey grinned and said hes wrongfooted doesnt like being accused cant do anything about it they came to do a job and came too late they have no more business here anything else would be right outside their jurisdiction and this one is already worried about your threats he cocked his gun to show you how big and brave he is but now hes worried that maybe well report him for that too because in fact hes chickenshit goodly knew that garvey was reading the cmi leaders mind but that one was staring no grimacing at the expression on garveys face for the telepath was still grinning and deliberately which was a sight to see or a sight not to see if you werent in the know you said the platoon commander prodding garvey with his weapon but carefully shut your ace he continued to stare at garveys what expression or what said garvey youll murder me and all the rest of us this is ebranch hq dont you know everything you say and do here is being recorded including the fact that you wrecked the elevators security system to get in not only you but the people who sent you youre all in the shit paul garvey was tall wellbuilt and still athletically trim despite the fact that he was fiftyone years old sixteen years ago he had been goodlooking too before going up against one of harry keoghs most dangerous adversaries a necromancer called johnny found and losing most of the left side of his face at the time and on a number of occasions since some of the best plastic surgeons in england had worked on him until he looked halfdecent again but a real face is made of more than just flesh scavenged from other parts garveys face had been rebuilt from living tissue true but the muscles on the left didnt pull the same as on the right and even after all this time the nerves still didnt connect up too well he could smile with the right side but not the left for which reason and even though the other espers were used to it garvey would normally avoid smiling altogether and avoid all other facial expressions too but when garvey stopped smiling and actually scowled like now the platoon commander gulped and made a visible attempt to pull himself together then he applied the safety catch on his weapon and backed off a step he blinked looked away from the telepath took out a plasticlaminated card from his shirt pocket and handed it to goodly and quoting parrotfashion he began this was a cmi operation you are required by law not to reveal out goodly cut him short you and your gorillas get your backsides out of here now the platoon commander grew yet more red in the face puffed himself up and let it all out in a grunt of frustration he turned to his men scowled and indicated with a jerk of his head that it was time to leave but goodly wasnt finished with them think about this he said you are required by a law that makes the official secrets act look like a joke from a christmas cracker to forget you were even here why you might even be persuaded to forget you were born because for all you know your boss or maybe his boss is fitting you all up for prefrontal lobotomies right now the cmi agents filed out of the room along the corridor into the lift it was goodlys first chance to count them a halfsection eight men the espers had had them outnumbered but paul garvey said we had them outeverythinged not much brainpower there and yet if nathan had been here they had orders to take him or if they couldnt do that to kill him you got that out of their minds yes garvey nodded but just nathan which meant i could afford to mouth off a bit no big deal for like i said their leader was chickenshit i have to report this goodlys face was grim heading for the duty officers room he looked even more cadaverous than usual but as he got there the phone started cheeping it was david chung at the refuge in romania and when he heard goodlys voice okay lan im home and dry there was a spot of trouble at the airport but finally im here nathan and trask can they can come on in goodly breathed a sigh of relief said yes they can except where the hell were nathan and trask from deep in his mind unbidden it was as if some inner voice answered with a query of its own and where will they be this time tomorrow for that matter where wijj you be goodly my boy it was his talent working he knew except even a precog cant see too far into the future and sometimes like now he was loath to even try nathan was used to it by now but not trask and after a single glance trasks first taste or feel of the mobius continuum he doubted if he ever would be used to it or if he would want to be what do you think nathan asked him for even thoughts had weight in the mobius continuum and trask heard them as sharp and clear as speech in the more mundane world quick to catch on he answered when im aaable to think then ill let you know nathans chuckle was his only answer but trask was too busy sensing the mobius continuum all around him absorbing or experiencing what he could of it to feel any real resentment and it was for him much as it had been for only a handful of human beings who had travelled here before him so that when he was capable of thinking he thought much the same thoughts as them even the same as nathan himself had thought i was in the ops room with nathan until we took a step out of there now were here on the other side of a mobius door except where the helj is here for here lay darkness the primal darkness itself as it had existed before the universe began it was a place of absolute negativity not even a parallel plane of existence because nothing existed here at least not under normal conditions if there was ever a place where darkness lay upon the face of the deep this was it and trask was struck by the thought perhaps this was where god was born beore he took his first step into the universe of light perhaps thats how the physical universe started when he split it off from this dark and metaphysical void for indeed the mobius continuum was without form and void to say that trask was astonished would be to belittle the range of emotions which swept over him indeed and apart from that same handful of fellow voyagers his was a new emotion designed to fit an entirely new experience even the necroscope harry keogh and his necroscope son nathan had never felt like this for they had understood at least something of the mobius continuum they had imagined and conjured it while trasks mind was of the world albeit a world in which truth was the guide and truth the gate and if anything that made it worse for he understood the truth of the mobius continuum that it was apart from the world of men and apart from all human existence and even conjecture except in the secret minds of longdead mathematicians and the magic of mystics and metaphysicians and yet he was here and he felt it there was no air but neither was there any time so that trask didnt need to breathe and in the absence of time space itself was absent these essential ingredients these prime constituents of any ordinary universe of matter had no existence here yet trask remained intact he didnt rupture disintegrate and fly apart because there was nowhere to fly to trask knew the truth of it that he was nowhere but that it was also the place where everywhere and when had had their beginning the birthplace of universes the womb of worlds the singularity before time began he might have shouted his alarm his shock his own version of eureka except trask was only one discoverer not the discoverer but he believed he knew now what men meant when they said theyd seen the light for he had seen the darkness and in that darkness suddenly he was afraid his grip was tight and growing tighter on nathans unseen arm unseen yes yet remembered on the photographic negative of his retinae like a slowly fading flash of light nathan his sole remaining link with sanity reality humanity trask couldnt actually see him but he could feel and sense him there he knew the truth of the other and for the moment that was all he knew in this awesome nospacetime exhausted of mundane thoughts trasks fear rapidly expanded into a kind of hysteria but one which lacked the frantic motion of commonplace panic he simply dared not move because he couldnt be sure where motion even the smallest motion would take him moving from here one might go anywhere if one knew the route or go nowhere forever which might well be trasks fate if nathan deserted him and to be lost here would mean lost forever for in this timeless spaceless nonenvironment nothing ever changed except it was willed and there was no will here unless it were brought here by someone who strayed into this place or someone who came here and knew how to manipulate it someone like nathan and at that a new thought occurred to trask or new to him at least nathan we shouldnt be here it isnt our place rather it isnt mine his mental whisper was frightened which nathan sensed at once easy his own thoughts were calm controlled take it easy werent you the one who wanted to do it well and now youre doing it but im not meant to be i shouldnt be here are you sure of that trask wondered about that was he sure of it but why wonder when he knew the truth of it at once yes im sure there are forces here it isnt such a what vacuum as youve painted it i feel currents and theyre beginning to move me trying to repulse or expel me trasks voice was tremulous with his everincreasing panic calm down nathan told him again i have you youre safe ive wondered about those forces you feel you know when youre waiting at a red light how you feel the energy in the throb of the cars engine just waiting to thrust you forward well i think this is the same thing its your own power you feel it must be because nothing happens here except by force of will it wasnt exactly the truth only a guess at best but trask was in no fit state to repudiate it being here his only desire was to be out of here like a small boy riding a rollercoaster where are we going in a little while perchorsk that pulled the older man together in a moment what but he sensed nathans shrug the last place anyone would expect us to turn up at the core but only for a moment in and out again let them see us then not see us nathans mental voice was cold grim now reminding trask very much of his father i want turkur tzonov to know who hes been dealing with after what hes done to siggi dam and what he would have done to me and zek i want him to worry but why you wont be here he doesnt know that anyway im szgany and i owe him but perchorsk in and out thats all nathan replied determined sufficient that they see us it cant do you any harm either turkur will think twice before he tries any more fast ones on you or ebranch do you know the the way there oh yes i was there remember but on the way theres something else i would like you to see trask was calmer now but found difficulty in not being able in not requiring to breathe really and what would that be the past nathan answered and the future for ive discovered harrys timedoors but i havent crossed a threshold yet and dont worry im not going to not yet i fust want to see it again and ben just think what lan would give to be your shoes right now not a lot trask answered sensing movement ion goodly doesnt much like the future its just something that happens to him come to think of it its something that happens to all of us its inevitable as dying maybe thats what he doesnt like about it hed much prefer to take his chances not knowing they moved rapidly towards a point of light that expanded in a moment into a shimmering door and nathan brought them to a halt close to the threshold light sprang forth from beyond the timedoor a pulsing blue light which was yet warm and in no way artificial the light of life trask would have known the truth of it of course without being told but standing or being at the threshold with nathan both of them silhouetted in the warm blue glow he asked anyway the future our future mans future and the blue threads after a short pause nathan answered and his whisper was no less awed than trasks the threads are men he said they are the lives of men and drawing trask closer to the threshold indeed onto the very threshold he added see thats you ben the blue thread of your future life beyond the futuretimedoor all was a chaos of millions of filaments of blue light and trask saw that one of them had its origin in his own being streaming out from him like some weird ectoplasmic extension and dwindling to a bright blue thread as it hurtled into the future his future another sped out from nathan out and away into the everwidening haze of tomorrow for some time they gazed upon the panoply of the future a minute or an aeon trask couldnt say but eventually even here time grows short nathan said at least i feel its so anyway i know well enough where my future is leading me back to sunsidestarside trask made no answer suddenly dumbstruck by the beauty of what he was seeing hed become aware of a sound an almost angelic chorus an orchestrated interminable ahhhhhhhh it could only be in his mind for he guessed that time must be as silent as the mobius continuum itself of course for if the sound of all the future were present that would be an unbearable tumult and all of those blue lifethreads weaving away into tomorrow and tomorrow sighing in trasks mind and some of the threads growing dim and blinking out as men died while others burst from nothing into brilliant neonblue life as their owners were born trask felt he could stand here watching for all time he was standing here for all time all future time at least but theres the past too nathan told him guiding him to a pasttimedoor except that beyond this new threshold instead of multiplying spreading out and away forever as the human race expanded the neon lifethreads narrowed down condensed fell back into a well of nebulous light at the dawn of mans ascendancy and now the mystical ahhhhhhhh sound seemed reversed fading into the history of humanity in a little while or maybe after a long time nathan said and now perchorsk before trask could protest he found himself mobile again and experienced what felt like a splitsecond of intense acceleration as his guide and companion simply went to perchorsk in the urals they were there in a moment coming to an instantaneous effortless halt nathan conjured a mobius door which warped and fluttered like the flame of a candle in a draft and suddenly trask remembered too close he shouted at the top of his voice a crushing deafening devastating avalanche of sound in the mobius continuum were too close to the gate numb from the vibratory effect nathan hugged trask close i know he said everything is wrong here even the flux of the numbers vortex but please ben dont shout dont even think i have to get the coordinates right thats all then letting the door collapse in upon itself he backed off a little and conjured another this one was less unstable but not entirely so volatile and slowly consuming itself it seemed to smoke drifting a little as nathan fought to hold it in place finally it firmed up nathan immediately stepped through and took trask with him into perchorsk into the complex under the urals into the mighty cavern sphere known as the core ill the gates perchorsk and radujevac trask and nathan had been here before and knew this nightmare place only too well this alien cavern eaten out of the solid rock of a mountain when the gate was formed in the awesome vacuum of a nuclear implosion this subterranean terminal or subway station to a parallel world called sunsidestarside it was like being in a cavern but that was where any similarity ended the rock had been hollowed into the shape of a perfect sphere a giant bubble well over a hundred and twenty feet in diameter the curving shinyblack wall all around was glasssmooth except for the gaping mouths of energy wormholes which riddled it everywhere even in the domed ceiling and at the centre of the core the perchorsk gate itself encased in a huge carbon steel shell some thirty feet in diameter whose three welded sections were supported on massive hydraulic rams those rams could apply terrific pressure to hold the fused sections together in one mass if that were ever necessary while within this protective shell of steel the gate supported itself floating there deadcentre right where it had been born in a melting pot ofalien energies at least that was the scene which the two mobius intruders had expected to see that was what they had seen the last time they were here but now around the spherical steel egg which contained the gate a suspended catwalk ten feet wide had been drawn back in sections to allow for the eggs hatching the catwalk was equipped with consoles computers viewscreens but was empty of people with the exception of a handful of whitesmocked redsplashed bodies where they lay grotesquely crumpled and lifeless close to the master console they had been scientists and were only recently dead a minute or two at most nathan knew this with the sure instinct of a necroscope he felt the confusion disbelief panic of people who had known that death was a thing that only happens to others which is what we all believe until it happens to us nathan and trask had emerged from the mobius door on the outermost rim of a saturnsring system of platforms where a perimeter catwalk encircled the core around its equator and as good fortune would have it theyd emerged behind a shielding plate of aluminium fixed to the walkways rail making it a vantage point where they were hidden from the view of the rest of the core the shield had smokedglass windows through which if ever the gate should be opened up it could be viewed without the customary dazzle but of course the gate wasnt likely to be opened up was it some ten feet higher and sixty feet away around the gradual curve of the glossyblack wall a landing fronted the perfectly circular mouth of a shaft running at fortyfive degrees upwards into the rock a railed stairway clung to the wall with wide steps descending from the landing to the catwalk reaching out from the perimeter a spidery gantry with an overhanging walkway formed a bridge to the inner catwalk with its consoles computers and corpses and its glaring white light light yes three giant catseye slits or wedges of light shining out like solid bars from the fourfoot gaps in the carbon steel shell where the mighty rams had drawn back and torn the welded sections apart leaving strips of weld hanging down like the rind of some strange metal fruit and the alien light came flooding from the gate of course exposed like the blind freefloating eye of a gigantic cyclops or the allseeing orb of some colossal shewstone or maybe the seething evil of pandoras box standing open but this was the static picture a first impression following the darkness of the mobius continuum as when a light is switched on and the contents of a room print themselves on the viewers eyeballs static motionless soundless until as nathan and trask realized they were actually here suddenly it erupted into life then a veritable chaos of sound motion and deadly action the men on the inner walkway were not the only dead bodies here and more were being made even now so that it was immediately apparent what was happening that premier gustav turchin had done with his softlysoftly approach and was going straight for the throat he was attempting to beard turkur tzonov in his den beard him he was trying to kill him christ trask yelped as automatic gunshots echoed and bullets ricocheted from the metal trim of the catwalk weve walked into a war and turchin not a word of warning from him as more bullets spattered he grabbed nathans arm god almighty lets get out of here but nathan crouching down said wait i have to see see what trask gasped but in fact he already knew what nathan wanted to see turkur tzonov what he was up to what was going on here the perchorsk gate connected with nathans world in a parallel universe and the gate stood open the russians intention had been to invade sunsidestarside with a crack infantry platoon loyal to himself to colonize the vampire world open it up as a vast new satellite of mother russia and sack it for its precious metals thus financing a resurgence of expansionism and oldstyle communism here on earth in what had become a politically ecologically and financially bankrupt ussr during the course of which premier turchin would be assassinated and replaced by a new democratically elected leader of that vast regions polyglot peoples tzonov himself of course that had been the state of play some four months ago but then when nathan had come through the perchorsk gate from sunsidestarside tzonovs plan had been discovered and passed on through diplomatic channels to the russian premier since when nothing much had appeared to be happening now it was becoming apparent that indeed things had been happening gustav turchin had been busy and this was to have been the culmination of the premiers efforts the realization of turchins goal to catch turkur tzonov and his people redhanded and round them up but it was equally obvious that tzonov the head of the opposition russias ebranch had seen it coming this firelight in perchorsk had to be the result of his contingency planning there were five uniformed heavily armed men on the gantry under fire from the railed landing above the perimeter walkway three of them strained to haul a trolley laden with an assortment of weapons and ammunition towards a gap in the steel shell in fact towards the gate while their two colleagues gave them covering fire now that trask and nathans eyes had grown accustomed to the sudden brightness the brilliant glare of the gate itself which was dazzling even through the smokedglass window they could see that these would not be the first of tzonovs men to cross the threshold others of his soldiers had already passed through the skin of the dazzling sphere its event horizon and were visible on the other side as glowing slowmotion silhouettes against a uniformly milky backdrop they were strung out a straggling line of burdened luminous figures dwindling into the alien white distance leaving only a handful of their colleagues in the foreground to beckon eerily with an agonizingly slow urgency to those still outside where they crossed the gantry a whitesmocked technician or scientist emerged from hiding behind the curve of the gate with his hands over his head to signify surrender spreadeagling his body against a section of the steel shell the frightened man inched his way into view one of the men on the gantry saw him turned the ugly bluedsteel snout of a machinepistol in his direction and let go with a burst of a dozen rounds it was murder pure and simple totally unnecessary obviously the soldier and his colleagues had been handpicked by tzonov the scientist jerked and shuddered as smokinghot lead stitched him across and back passed through him and fragmented against the carbon steel and then ricocheted from the metal back into his body his white smock turned scarlet in a moment and staggering forward crumpling as he went he fell to his knees at the rim of the platform then tilted forward and nosedived into sixty feet of thin air between the stanchions and rams and his querulous deadspeak voice was added to that of the others near the console nathan had no time to comfort them could only watch more men came at the run down the circular shaft onto the landing they joined those already there in firing at the soldiers on the gantry pouring lead at them one of the latter was hit in the chest went down kicking and screaming twitched and lay still but they had almost got the trolley to the gate a few more paces would do it sparks flew from the gantry where bullets splintered against the metalwork and the two covering soldiers returned fire as yet more men came through the entry shaft onto the landing so a group of eight broke off from the original party to go clattering down the stairs onto the perimeter walkway but when they were only halfway down that was when things really started to heat up nathan had been hoping to see turkur tzonov and that tzonov would see him he had wanted to remind the man just who it was hed treated so badly and who he might still have to deal with in the future also of the price to be paid for what he had done to siggi dam so far the necroscope had been disappointed but no longer the russian was here after all except now if nathan were to show himself it might easily work out that hed be the one who paid trask too of course because they were together beyond the stairway to the entry shaft on the far side of the gantry spanning the gaps in the saturns rings a twinmounted katushev cannon suddenly swung into action the weapon was situated against the wall on a supporting platform it sat there like an armoured blister of steel on a tripod of shockresistant legs quiescent until now its electric motor droned into life the greydomed hood cracked open and as the assembly telescoped back on itself so the operator in the heavily plated bucketseat came into view seeing who the gunner was none other than tzonov himself nathan and trask gave simultaneous gasps of shock this man would be menacing enough without deadly armaments but at the firing controls of a katushev turkur tzonov was partturk partmongol all man definitely an alpha male his was an outstanding mind housed in an athletes body his grey eyes were the sort that could look at and into a man literally they were the instruments of his telepathy the russians eyebrows were slim as pencilled lines silverblond against the tanned ridges of his brows he was bald but this was so in keeping with his other features as to make it appear that hair was never intended certainly it wasnt a sign of illhealth or aging he glowed with vitality and the only anomaly lay in the orbits of eyes whose hollows seemed bruised from long hours of study or implacable concentration the purple was a symptom of his talent tzonovs nose was sharply hooked probably broken in some accident or fight most likely the latter for the head of russias ebranch was devoted to the martial arts his mouth was wellfleshed if a little too wide above a strong square chin his small pointed ears lay flat against his head it was undeniable that tzonov was goodlooking but the overall picture was of a tooperfect symmetry even as the shock of seeing him receded so the katushevs motor whined as tzonov traversed the twin barrels of his weapon from its target at the cores centre until it lined up with the scaffolding supporting the railed landing under the entry shaft the men on the landing and those descending the stairs had seen the movement and were frantic to take whatever cover they could those still on the landing made to dive headlong into the shaft those on the stairs hurled themselves over the rail to land on the perimeter walkway and tzonov ignored the squad on the walkway aiming right through them at the spidery scaffolding nathan and trask saw the expression on the russians face as he applied pressure to the katushevs triggers and goodlooking or not it was a look of sheer malice his lips drew back from his perfect teeth in a deathshead grin and the cords of his neck stood out in ridges where they met his collarbone then the grin turned into an animal snarl and the katushev went whoof whoof whoof men were blown apart as exploding steel gutted them and used them to colour everything yellow scarlet grey brown their liquids splashed everywhere as the scaffolding was reduced to so much twisted smoking metal those on the landing who hadnt made it into the shaft went sliding from the slumping structure into the bowl of the core or hung on like grim death to the warped metal rails or the teetering skeleton of the platform tzonov laughed his scorn at them glanced at the gate and saw that his men were through its skin with their trolleyload of arms two of them waited on the far side beckoning to him in the gates weird slowmotion he would be the last of them to go through whatever else the russian was he wasnt a coward the savage grin slipped from his face as he elevated the snouts of the katushevs barrels and put two more rounds into the screaming mangled mess on the landing platform behind their fragile shield nathan and trask ducked down and covered their ears as shrapnel flew everywhere a sixfoot length of scaffolding pipe whipped end over end through the air and tore the top half of their aluminum cover away in a shriek of tortured metal the smokedglass window went with it now can we get out of here trask yelled surprised that he could hear himself over the ringing in his ears palefaced nathan nodded he stood up however shakily closed his eyes conjured a door trask also stood up and as their top halves came into view so tzonov saw them they saw his mouth fall open and a moment later the mad delight that lit in his eyes as his lips formed a single word you shit trask said as the russian traversed his weapon and lowered its smoking barrels nathan tried to hold the door but couldnt concentrate he could feel the russians eyes on him where they centred him in the katushevs crosshair gunsights also the proximity of the gate was interfering the door wouldnt form properly his grip on the thing was too shaky nathan trask breathed and again but much more urgently as tzonov squeezed the triggergrips nathaaan and the firingpins slammed forward on to empty chambers they knew it immediately from the look of instant fury on tzonovs face the katushevs magazine was empty it gave nathan the breather he needed as tzonov swung out of the bucketchair down on to the perimeter ring and made a run for the gantry so the necroscope collapsed the first door and conjured another also unstable against the solid rock wall of the core but in the smoke and turmoil with the agonized screams of the dying in his ears and the moans of the dead in his metaphysical mind nathans concentration was still lacking he hadnt yet mastered the msbius continuum couldnt afford to be distracted and as tzonov ran out midway on to the gantry paused to unsling an automatic rifle from his shoulder and balance its butt on his hip so nathans door slid sideways along the wall until it overlapped the mouth of a thirtyinch diameter energy wormhole a smoothbored shaft in the otherwise solid rock the doors outline at once shrank to a circle and seemed sucked into the narrow shaft where it immediately firmed up nathan had taken a step after the door looking into the r wormhole he could see that it was now stable having receded these few extra inches from the influence of the gate it was safe to use and ben he called out to the older man lets go trask came from behind his aluminum cover saw turkur tzonov crouched on the gantry aiming his rifle and shit he said again you first nathan told him as tzonov opened up on them first what trask howled as bullets buzzed all about and sponged from the wall nathan made no reply but thrust him headfirst into the wormhole and as trask disappeared yelping into mobius spacetime the necroscope took one step back and dived headlong after him on the gantry tzonovs eyes bugged and his jaw fell open for long moments almost absentmindedly he continued to hose a vicious stream of lead down the wormhole into which hed seen trask and nathan disappear then his jaws snapped shut and his face darkened twisting in fury he knew it simply wasnt possible for men to wriggle out of sight that fast they werent in the wormhole not any longer they were somewhere else and tzonov knew where or if not where he at least knew what obviously nathan had inherited his fathers talents or trask and british ebranch had helped him to rediscover them like harry keogh before him he too had learned the secret of teleportation he could move himself instantly at will from one place to another without physically covering the distance between or rather he knew shorter faster routes tzonovs finger came off the trigger and the guns obscene chattering died away leaving only its echoes and the moaning of wounded men but from the shaft behind the shattered smoking landingstage came a clatter of booted feet time was running out for tzonov and he had a journey of his own to make he lifted the muzzle of his gun fired a short burst into the shaft then fell into a crouch spun on his heel and hosed lead at the main console hot white sparks flew from metal and tzonov used them to trace a path across the shattering instrument panels he knew where to hit and when he found his target was rewarded with a display of arcing blue electrical fire corroborating his accuracy there came a squeal of straining metal and triple jets of steam blasted from the bases of the hydraulic rams and the three massive sections of carbon steel eggshell began to crank shut bullets fragmented into hot splashes of lead where they struck against the superstructure of the gantry close to the russians feet cursing he turned and fired a long burst into the entry shaft then raced for the narrowing glare of the gate where two of the sections were slowly coming together desultory sporadic fire followed him as he passed through the event horizon and seemed sucked into the unknown but as the huge metal sections ground closer together and the light was reduced to three flickering arcs or fans which were finally shut off so the firing died away then apart from a feeble glimmer of white light from gaps in the shell where torn welding had fallen away all was darkness and as the rams shut down and hissed into quiescence all was silence too except for the moans of the dying and the unanswered unanswerable queries of the recently dead moments earlier even within the mobius continuum still nathan could feel the disturbance of hot lead from tzonovs weapon until he collapsed the door behind him and then all he could feel was ben trask nananathan trasks query was a telepathic pant a halfsnatched breath a prayer issued into the alien darkness but in another moment it became a cry of panic nathaaaan the necroscope went after him grabbed him said its okay take it easy ben im with you and reaching out with his metaphysical mind and david chung is at the radujevac refuge we can go there now jesus trask gasped nathan thank god youre there i mean i was wondering what if tzonov hits him im sorry son but it wasnt you i was thinking of i was thinking of me stuck in this place forever id go crazy in an hour no jess than that id probably already be crazy even as he spoke they were in motion as nathan tracked his earring sigil to romania and in another moment they were there nathan conjured a door and stepped through it dragging a stumbling staggering trask after him the light was subdued nathans eyes accepted it without blinking david chung stepped forward and helped support trask whose face was drawn trouble chung was at once solicitous a bad trip you could say that said nathan grimly he and trask had emerged from the mobius continuum into a small square box of a room no more than three and a half metres across with dim fluorescent lighting in the low ceiling and no outside windows or furniture just four whitepainted walls and david chung and nathans golden mobius loop earring seeing it in chungs outstretched hand nathan took it back slipped it into place in the lobe of his ear trask was his own man again although his voice was still a little shaky put it this way he said i wont be volunteering for the mobius route again then seeing the look on nathans face but that was only one bad thing and theres much worse nathan took it up we had to get out of ebranch hq in a hurry i would have come here directly but you werent in situ there are a good many places i could have gone to but i wanted to see perchorsk again so we went there and we saw he looked at trask the older man cleared his throat turkur tzonov and oh i dont know maybe a full platoon of his men maybe more have gone through the perchorsk gate when we got there there was a small war going on premier turchin must have decided to pull the plug on tzonov but tzonov had wind of it being who he is the talents he employs that wouldnt be too hard so no more softly softly catchee monkey tzonov is on his way to sunsidestarside right now with enough men and firepower to blow hell out of just about anything that gets in his way nathan gave him a strange knowing look perhaps a look of derision certainly of denial but said nothing which means chung said that nathan will be wanting to get on his way too and as soon as possible and another voice female said maybe even sooner than that anna marie english an ecopath had entered the room silently looking at the two arrivals she said ben nathan then speaking directly to the former and with a deal of urgency in her voice have you talked to david do you know about the problem at the airport cmi trask looked at her and thought what hed thought so often before anna marie was a branch esper english by name and nationality but scarcely an english rose she was invariably what lacklustre well that would be putting it mildly enervated pallid dowdy even this current bout of urgency seemed a strain almost too much for her to handle it was her talent trask knew and felt sorry for her but on the other hand maybe he shouldnt at twentyfour the woman had looked fifty and now at forty she still looked fifty which had to be good news for mother earth ecologically aware anna maries premature aging had been held in abeyance by the planets partial recovery from the industrial and nuclear ravages of the last century as the earth shrugged off its illnesses so she caught up with her true age but in reverse she had been worn out as a teenager and was now an old forty but at the current rate of remission the day might yet dawn when she was a young sixty as for her talent as an empath feels for others so anna marie felt for the world she was as one with mother earth as antarctica was drained of its mineral wealth so she was drained of energy as the rain forests were raped for workable timber or even fuel she too felt violated burned up she knew a little of the agony of every dolphin still being killed illegally by the japanese and could count the number of kills in the liver spots or wrinkles on the dry desiccated skin of her spindly arms when a huge nuclearpowered cargo vessel sank in the pacific her bones ached to the slow seepage of radiation outwards across the ocean floor and as fresh holes gaped in the ozone layer so her ulcers ate their way through anna maries guts but working out here at the refuge in romania at least she was doing something good worthwhile and as well as helping these poor kids and young people she was also helping herself they were earths children after all and she was caring for them trask liked to think that maybe in its own way the earth was returning the favour cmi finally he answered her i know about them in london but have i missed something he looked questioningly at chung cmi were at the airport in belgrade too chung told him and they were obviously disappointed that id showed up without nathan very disappointed they questioned me for quite some time its why i was late getting here it could mean a lot of trouble still to come anna marie took it up and then of course theres turkur tzonov he has men in romania too so the way i see it we cant keep nathan here too long he wont be safe here not if cmi or the opposition or both are desperate enough trask grunted and said tzonov was pretty desperate the last time i saw him about what two minutes ago hes out of it by now though on his way to starside but i know what you mean his agents will be active as ever carrying out whatever policies he left behind as for cmi i expect lan goodly will be stirring it for them right now but in any case dont worry nathan wont be held up here not if all goes according to plan he looked at her questioningly and she nodded and leading the way out of the room into the refuges complex she answered its all in hand except wasnt nathan going to bring arms with him i still am nathan told her everything i need is back at ebranch hq until i go back for it but trask was quick to point out ah maybe it wont be as easy as that nathan not after whats happened and to anna marie the plan was that once nathan had the refuges coordinates hed be able to come and go he shrugged at will then he would ferry his arms in piece by piece along the mobius route thats all there was to it maybe hell still be able to do it it all depends on ebranch the situation back home as he finished speaking they arrived at the administrative office in time to catch the first chirrup of the telephone it was ebranch from london lan goodly asking for trask anna marie handed the telephone over ben here trask said and are we scrambled they were and goodly told him about the rest of the visit by cmi they were after nathan he finished off with orders to take him if they could or to kill him trask nodded absentmindedly and said someones afraid of him even as we were afraid of his father and glancing at nathan and just as mistakenly but how did they know we were getting ready to ship him home to sunsidestarside would you believe our minister responsible i have to admit though that he seemed genuinely upset and you have to remember it was the minister who warned me that cmi would be calling on ebranch in the first place thinking back on it i recall that he mumbled something about setting watchers to watch the watchers again trask nodded at the telephone right at ebranch were all big fish but when its something as important or as potentially dangerous as this then there are even bigger fish even sharks theyre called advisers to the inner cabinet toplevel stonecold thinkers specializing in finance world affairs and security internal and external lots of brain but not an ounce of heart in the whole bunch you can bet your life that somebody up there someone a lot bigger than our minister set this ball rolling well thats as may be but whoever he is hes obviously as prone to making mistakes as anyone else killing nathan would have been one hell of a big mistake and for a hell of a lot of reasons turkur tzonov was just such a reason of course but trask wasnt going to talk about him right now not even on a scrambled telephone so whats next goodly asked and is there anything we can do at this end nathans arms and ammo trask answered still safe and sound hidden away goodly said cmi didnt find them and if they had so what were ebranch were entitled and where are cmi now are they watching listening interfering not that we can discover right trask grunted this is what i want you to do temporarily immobilize the elevator and make ebranch secure put a man on the roof to watch for choppers and others on the street just watching also i want you personally on the telephone to me from start to finish continually so we can talk each other through all nathans comings and goings until hes got all of his stuff out of there i know its highly unlikely that cmi could get a team back in there before nathan could get out but im not going to take any chances the merest hint of danger at your end and we wait it out until he can start again nathan touched his elbow youll be wasting your time on the telephone he said quietly trask looked at him eh zek is still there in london nathan reminded him have her called in she can be my early warning system no need for the telephone phones can be put out of action trask thought yes and so can zek nathan read it not only in his mind but his eyes too and he was quick to agree youre right of course use the telephone on the other end of the line goodly had managed to catch a little of what was being discussed now he said zek walked in just a moment ago shes been in town making arrangements to fly home shes with me right now and says she wants in on this trask uttered a disgusted barely audible oh fuck and goodly said zek asks me to say and the same to you very well trask knew he wouldnt get the best of it with zek foener having fallen in love with her he didnt even want to so break down the weapons into easily handled batches the ops room will be perfect plenty of room for nathan to work in zek can give him the okay as each batch is made ready hell home in on her and well do his thing glancing at nathan he offered an apologetic shrug okay goodly answered give me time to secure this place and then zek will get back to you or rather to nathan say fifteen to twenty minutes right trask told him and put the phone down and turning to the others we have maybe twenty minutes he looked at anna marie is that time enough for us to see your end of the operation she nodded come on the refuge was a school a hospice a sprawling home in the woods for fifty romanian kids aged sixteen to twenty following the collapse of the disastrous ceausescu reign back in the late eighties as romania gradually opened herself up to western influences so ebranch had worried certain powersthatbe into building a place here on the wooded banks of the danube not far from radujevac the siting of the refuge had not been arbitrary it stood guard over the mouth of a resurgence where a subterranean river a tributary of the danube surfaced after its dark journey from a source somewhere in the foothills of the carpaii meridionai the transylvanian alps and the resurgence itself was the source of all earths vampire myths and legends indeed of all vampiric infestation of this planet for it was here some miles up the lightless borehole of the sump that a second gate opened into this world and this gate too connected with nathans parallel world of sunsidestarside thus the romanian refuge served two purposes it was a refuge for a handful of victims of ceausescus nightmarishly draconian policies whose traumas had been such that after all these years they still required help but more than that it was a barrier against further incursions of the yet more nightmarish wamphyri and all the horrors of starside in the bowels of the place beneath its foundations the rivers rush had been diverted channelled controlled there were monitors down there to register the presence of anything which might prove inimical to mankind and there was machinery which permitted the entry but not the exit of anything bigger than a minnow or small eel any man or creature not of this world coming from the underground gate and flushed down the river would find other than safe refuge here and alive dead or undead the thing would undergo something other than a metamorphic change electrocuted gutted boiled and ground down eventually he she or it would emerge as so much mush or paste to be dried out and incinerated in this matter as never before ebranch had been very specific above ground the refuge sprawled in three tiers like a modern halfburied ziggurat against the face of a cliff once carved by the danube but now standing well back from the rivers swirl the lower level was built on pylons sunk into the scree between the pylons reinforced concrete walls had been frescoed into autumnal patterns and shapes an outsider would probably think it unlikely that there was a cellar back there though certainly anyone approaching the wall too closely would hear a low whine of turbines when it rained or the cloud ceiling lay low on the foothills especially in the winter months when the resurgence powered the refuges heating and lighting systems outsiders however were kept well back behind gardens and a high perimeter fence right on the rim of the river the entire location was a sovereign base area a small british enclave on foreign soil having first run the gantlet of the refuges security or purification systems water from the subterranean sump now resurfaced below the eastfacing wall into a large lily pond from there it made its way to the danube via a deep concrete sluice forming a slow shallow stream in the dry season but running to something of a torrent when the rains came so the romanian refuge fulfilled its prime objective and its staff only halfjokingly referred to themselves as guardians of the gate but the kids in their care werent simply a cover they had always been wellcared for and as long as anna marie english was in charge the same level of care was guaranteed orphans cripples socially deprived kids they occupied the refuges two upper tiers their classrooms workshops and recreational facilities were in the lower tier along with the staff accommodation directly above the site of the original resurgence but the infrequent whine of turbines was lost in a massively reinforced and soundproofed concrete floor the room where trask and nathan had emerged from the mobius continuum was little more than a storage room off the inner corridor of the central tier anna marie had ordered it cleared out so that nathan would have ample room in which to work her admin office was on the same level with a huge window facing south looking out of that window chung trask and nathan had gazed across the sunlit river into bulgaria on the one hand and yugoslavia to the east but borders no longer mattered a great deal and so the scenery was simply country from the admin office they had gone down into the refuges lower level and in a gymnasium where an instructor worked out with some of the kids theyd looked east through patio windows across a wide balcony set with tables and chairs to where the gravel drive wound across gardens and into the trees right up to iron security gates set in the high fence the place would be generally secure at least but not from determined men and that was when trask had decided it all looks far too peaceful out there but it isnt it was his talent working telling him that this was all a lie were observed the refuge as a whole is under scrutiny probably tzonovs people or cmi and quoting anna marie or both youre right we have to get nathan out of here asap they didnt bother to visit the basement but left david chung back at the admin office to take calls and went up to the refuges top level there trask met some of the staff people who actually were what they appeared to be teachers nurses physioand psychotherapists people who cared what they were doing and for the kids they were doing it for but among these specialists were others ostensibly under instruction and these were trasks men seconded to ebranch from special forces securityvetted and sworn to secrecy they were exnavy men cavers spelaeologists experts in subterranean exploration and underwater equipment and trask had been rotating their duties here for as long as the refuge had existed these were the men who would handle the machinery down in the guts of the place if ever that should become necessary and they were also the men who would escort nathan to the gate in the lightless bowels of the foothills there were five of them three of whom had already visited the gate that had been two weeks ago when the waterlevel had gone down after a long dry spell but the good weather had continued and they now considered it safe to take both nathan and his weapons up the resurgence and into into another world into his own world of course or at least take him as far as the threshold of that world from where he would go on alone as nathan was introduced to them so a romanian youth came running with a message from chung ebranch was secure nathan could commence ferrying his weapons into the refuge the mobius jumps were no problem at all and each time nathan used the continuum so it got easier there was no longer any sensation of speeding to a place he simply went there and ebranch hq was where he went where lan goodly had seen to the readiness of what was to become his sunside arsenal nathan had picked up a case of fragmentation grenades compact flamethrowers normally used in ratinfested sewers nitesited infrared laserguided machinepistols three llmm slrs inchesaccurate to threequarters of a mile a pair of lightweight mm rocketlaunchers ammunition galore he had also developed a certain fondness for a new model allmetal crossbow used in quarrying forestry and the canadian logging camps the halfinch bolts were full of plastic highexplosive and could bring down a pine tree faster than any chainsaw fired into a trunk from a safe distance the core of the bolt would detonate seconds after impact on sunside crossbows were weapons nathan had always known and respected but this model was something else hed picked up six of them all in all the weight of these armaments came to around five hundred and eleven pounds but goodly had bagged them in lots of one hundred pounds five trips to and fro with espers loading nathans arms into his arms at the london end and trask and chung offloading them in the refuge if cmi or anyone else knew about it they werent making any noise and the job was done in less than five minutes iv the way home thats it said nathan breathlessly after the last trip but one thats the weapons part of it anyway whats that you say trask cocked his head on one side quizzically what else is there just someone who wants to say goodbye to you before she goes home for a while and shes asked me to take her there my way but she wants to stop off here first shes asked you to trask drew air in a gasp nathan wait but too late for the necroscope had disappeared into thin air a moment later he was back setting down zek on the floor as dainty as a dancer and she passed from his arms into trasks just as easily nathan was also carrying her suitcase zek doesnt seem to have your problem with it he told trask with the mbbius continuum i mean ben she smiled never giving trask a moment to regain his equilibrium im going home for a while back to zante i want a little time to think over what we talked about david chung coughed selfconsciously and slipped silently from the room but nathan stayed he knew what it was all about and felt no embarrassment what we trask looked at her in his arms and drank her in zekintha foener was beautiful she always had been and trask supposed she always would be at fivenine she was about an inch shorter than he himself but where looks were concerned he had been at the back of the queue while shed been right up front named by her greek mother after zakinthos the island where she had been born zek was slim leggy blonde and blueeyed it was obvious from her colouring that shed taken a lot more after her german father or maybe shed taken after her greek island birthplace itself for zakinthos was the isle of flowers she must be oh some fortynine or fifty years old now not that anyone would ever guess she could just as easily be thirtysix or seven zek had her faults but they had always been there and for trasks money they only served to enhance her it was these smallest of small flaws that made her perfect perfect in his eyes anyway her mouth for example with its soft naturally moist lips just a fraction too full which tended to tremble a little when she was angry and the uneven jut of her jaw also when she was upset which seemed slightly more prominent on the right abruptly she brought him right back down to earth dont tell me youve forgotten again her smile and trask at once reddened up no i havent forgotten but will you be safe back home nathan is the one everyone is out to get she answered her smile fading once hes gone theyll forget about me soon enough and probably about all of us two of the cavers came into the room to collect a bundle of arms and ammo one of them paused a moment looked at trask and nathan and at zek wonderingly and said anna marie says it has to be soon well we just want you to know well be ready any time you are give me a minute nathan told him youre that eager wouldnt you be im going home the other smiled however uncertainly but trask thought would you still smile if you knew what hes going home to and as the cavers left the room he released zek and told her be careful and stay in touch let me know when youre ready or not ready i mean i know im not that much of a catch but youre an awful lot of a catch she kissed him youre true thats not just a talent youve got there ben trask its a life style sometimes when you look at me i have to admit ive looked into your head once or twice and there was only one other person who ever thought of me like that well ive spoken to jazz and he doesnt want me to be alone trasks heart gave a leap youve made up your mind she nodded i think so now i need a break to just well to think about it the logistics of the thing you see i love my island too and i have to say a long slow goodbye to it nathan was getting impatient and trask knew it he returned zeks kiss and said but right now a fast goodbye right very fast and to nathan okay shes all yours so to speak and look after her nathan smiled his slow introspective smile and said you neednt worry ben i love her too but differently apart from her colours zek could be my mother an outsider hearing that would probably find it strange her colours were nathans and in that respect she could easily be his mother except he thought of himself as szgany and so her colours were alien to him moreover nana kiklu was darkeyed and ravenhaired a traveller a gypsy but speaking his mind was part of nathan so that the way hed said it zek knew his comment had nothing to do with her age everything to do with his feelings and she felt complimented im ready she said and again trask watched it happen the way the necroscopes eyes changed from a deep sapphire blue to the cloudy blue the nearmystical blue of english summer skies as he conjured a mobius door and he nodded just once at trask as he drew zek to him and guided her in a certain direction stepping to one side with her almost as if they were dancing but stepping into nothingness then there was a sudden rush of air into the spaces theyd occupied and apart from trask the room was empty david chung with a cordless telephone in his hand beat nathan back into the small room by maybe a second and a half its lan goodly he told trask for you urgent and a moment later goodly was piping in trasks ear ben something bad is on its way at ebranch trasks voice rasped his anxiety no out there at the refuge trask trusted the others talent to the limit he didnt question him further except to say when any time now who is it i cant see it too clearly just explosions shouting violence and ben i dont see you you and david chung youre not there but we are here not in the immediate future trask felt the short hairs at the back of his neck stand on end death god i dont know but before ive always known youd be there in my future i mean now youre not nathan saw the expression on trasks face said what is it get down to the basement the cellars whatever the hell they call that place down there the sump yes go now nathan and you too david and you chungs face was suddenly shiny with sweat he knew it must be bad im coming trask nodded but not without one of these he snatched up a machinepistol from the floor one of the few remaining items of weaponry in the room and slammed a full magazine into its housing now come on lets go the phone was dead in trasks hand he hooked it into his breast pocket and let it dangle nathan tucked a box of ammo under his arm and slung an slr over his shoulder chung grabbed up a pair of blackmetal crossbows still in their oiled wrapping and that was it only a small ammo box to go and a package of spare parts for the slrs an exnavy type checking to see that theyd got it all picked up these last few items but in the corridor as they headed for the sump they bumped into anna marie t equipped some of the instructors with walkietalkies sent them out into the woods and approach roads she said breathlessly mercifully there are damned few roads up here but im getting reports of furtive strangers in the neighbourhood and a couple of callsigns havent got back to me at all ben i dont like it on their way down to the basement he told her about his call from lan goodly none of us like it he said not you me or lan if this is turkur tzonov i mean if his people are involved then theyre taking one hell of a risk something that could blow up into an international incident and if its cmi i understand how nathan could frighten people a man with his powers coming from an alien world of vampires but how come theyre suddenly vindictive how come weve had no wind of it its why were in the intelligence game after all so we can know whats going down before anyone else but not this time its as if someone had been hiding watching waiting looking for the main chance but the main chance to do what anna marie hobbled on spindly hurting legs having difficulty with the concrete stairs down to the lowest level have we grown lax ben the branch possibly but once nathans out of here we have to tighten up again i have to tighten up if they give me the chance they the manipulators the puppeteers there was more than a little scorn in her voice we should have taken it all away from them long ago our world still needs saving ben and no one is making the effort not much of an effort anyway it makes nonsense of everything if we cant do anything for our own world isnt it a bit presumptuous of us to try and save someone elses but if we were the bosses who would there be to watch us who watches them there was logic in her bitterness but trask knew the truth of his argument absolute power and all that as for sunsidestarside he ignored her retort to examine the rest of her question you know as well as i do that if the vampire world is taken by the wamphyri ours could well be next its nathans world thats under threat now yes but tomorrow and tomorrow before she could make an answer if she would the phone hooked in trasks pocket chirruped insistently causing him to start by then they were down into the sump of the place where through the course of centuries the resurgence had eaten away the bedrock of the cliff into an overhanging echoing grotto now the mouth of the cave and the course of the gurgling shallow stream it emitted were roofed over and enclosed in an electrified wiremesh tunnel hung with powerful lamps and away from the roots of the cliff the watercourse had been diverted lined with reinforced concrete and channelled into a system of man or vampiretraps a door in the wiremesh stood open where warning lights showed a reassuring green the power was off men were waiting in the tunnel and some of them had pulled on the trouserbottoms of rubber wetsuits in preparation nathan trask and the others joined them and in the mouth of the cave trask paused to answer the phone he recognized the minister responsibles voice immediately and at once said thanks a lot his voice was bitter choked trask theres no time for recriminations the minister told him which served to corroborate what goodly had said it was coming soon now listen and listen good this is from the very top do you understand the very top youre not to go any further with your plan nathan isnt to use the gate you have to hand him over now without any fuss the minister paused a second as if to think something over and in the next moment the pitch of his voice went up several notches almost to an hysterical level trask cmi are out there at the refuge theyre listening in on this at your end and in london both im not party to it trask you have to believe me but if you dont cooperate they have orders to and the phone went dead trask understood it was supposed to have been an order but the minister had turned it into a warning following his pause his last words had been rushed almost shouted nearhysterical and at the end trask had heard a second voice perhaps military certainly authoritative angry as its owner snatched the phone from the ministers hand shit trask said under his breath but not so quietly that it went unheard its all coming to a head right david chungs face was shiny now with sweat lets see nathan off trask nodded then its our necks well have to worry about he was thinking about lan goodlys warning that he and chung had no immediate future but nathan had read his mind and i can take you out of here the necroscope said i have the coordinates of a dozen different places anywhere you want to go ebranch christ trask groaned the mobius continuum again but chung was all for it why not he asked eagerly i mean if you think were in danger here both of you said nathan as his eyes went through their weird metamorphosis and catching hold of their arms he drew them through a mobius door and out again into ebranch hq the ops room now an encampment of the enemy lan goodly was there his face a mask of shocked realization so was the minister responsible red and raging and half a dozen espers wearing as many expressions and a handful of cmi thugs their weapons to hand but mercifully not at the ready the minister had his back to the trio when they appeared out of thin air he was flailing his arms and shouting something unintelligible at a uniformed man with a cordless telephone in his hand but the precog lan goodly had known where they would come through and was looking directly at them yelling for gods sake go get out of here even as goodly shouted his warning the minister responsible turned and saw them still a few years from retirement he was small and grey sparse but sprightly redfaced one minute in the next he turned pale as he recognized trask chung and nathan and his single atypical comment was jesus out of here trask grated in nathans ear repeating goodlys expert advice but at the same time as the muzzles of cmi weapons swung in their direction he cocked his machinepistol which made a typical chching sound as the first round was picked up and rammed into the breach he couldnt fire the thing wouldnt not while there were espers in the room and whether for good or bad reasons the cmi men were only carrying out their duty after all but it was a warning if this was to be a firefight it would be a firefight the bullets would be flying in both directions and the warning was taken cmi agents scattered in all directions through the ops room espers hit the floor taking what cover they could the minister responsible and senior cmi officer present who were closest to trask and his party took staggering steps backwards and put up their fluttering hands it was all the distraction nathan had needed he conjured a mobius door grabbed trask and chungs elbows and swung them offbalance aiming them at the invisible metaphysical portal but cmi werent just playing a game they did have their orders and nathan was at the heart of it from beneath the podium an ominous answering chching sounded over all other sounds and just as nathan propelled his companions over the threshold of his door so a stream of deadly lead scythed across the room accompanied by the deafening snarled obscenities of rapidfire even as he entered the mobius continuum nathan was hit in the shoulder it spun him over and over in darkness lighting up his mind with flashes of red pain and trask and chung holding grimly to him likewise spinning and actually feeling it his lack of coordination the sickening whirl of nathans psyche until he was able to steady himself and ask where now that he had asked told its own story his shock disorientation the fact that hed been hit the pain was in his mind as surely as it would be in his words if theyd been spoken how badly trask was anxious for him for nathan this time not himself and this despite that if the necroscopes wound was fatal the head of ebranch might easily be stuck in the mobius continuum forever it was a measure of trasks friendship for his dedication to even his love of the son of harry keogh likewise of david chungs when the locator said nathan hang on dont go under and yet again the insane gonging the painful reverberation of spoken words in the elemental echoing nothingness of the mobius continuum i dont think its bad nathan told them but i need to know where to take you times running out i mean at the refuge what about zeks place on zante no trask cautioned him against it whatever this thing is with cmi shes not involved in it not yet and youre right were running out of time goodly foresaw trouble at both ends and no future for me and david at any end not in this world anyway with which his talent took over and showed him the whole picture the whole truth that while there was no future for them in this world earth wasnt their only choice what about sunsidestarside nathan read trasks thoughts but one didnt need to be a telepath to do that not in the mflbius continuum you want to to come through with me that has to be it trask answered its the only answer dont feel about ready to die but if theres no future for me in this world chung had understood all of this by which time the fact had also dawned that it wasnt a good idea to speak and certainly not to shout in this place so that now he thought couldnt lan be mistaken but trask said oh and can you remember the last time he was mistaken the mobius continuum was getting to chung plus the knowledge that nathan had been hurt and might well need attention and it was a fact that chung couldnt remember the last time goodly had been wrong for which reasons back to the refuge he groaned nathan had the coordinates and they were there as quickly as that he guided them through his freshformed door into chaos they emerged in the cavemouth at exactly the same spot where theyd been all of a minute earlier and they emerged in time to experience at firsthand lan goodlys explosions shouting violence but not for thirty seconds yet anna marie english and an exnavy type were waiting their expressions showing pure astonishment as nathan trask and chung appeared out of thin air the first stepping lightly while the others stumbled gasping their relief at being back two of the cavers had moved deeper into the sump the remaining pair were outside the wiremesh cage where they worked at the dials on an instrument panel setting them to automatic for the duration of the coming expedition that was how it was for a moment then trasks phone chirruped insistently it was one of anna maries men out in the grounds of the refuge he had had his walkietalkie patched through by someone in the administrative office anna marie his voice came over highpitched excited there are men out in the grounds i dont recognize them theyre doing something at the frescoed wall oh christ theyve planted charges and now theyre taking cover lan goodlys explosions sounded clear in trasks imagination but not only in his mind for a moment later the awesome blast that sounded then filled the hollow acoustical echochamber of the refuges basement and cavernhoused sump with hammerblows of concussed air and was accompanied by a fireball that blazed into blinding existence in the far frontfacing wall in the next splitsecond the wall burst inwards allowing the fireball to expand into a star of incandescent destruction while the force of the initial explosion hurled flaming debris chunks of concrete masonry and twisted metal deep into the basement pieces of hot smoking concrete cartwheeled between floor and ceiling and came crashing through the wiremesh to splash down in the shallow stream or land at the feet of trask and the others where they shrank from the shock of the blast the two exnavy types who had been working at the console which controlled the sluice and various unseen engines and devices had been picked up and tossed aside disappearing behind a mushrooming wall of fire and smoke perhaps they had screamed as debris rained down to bury them but if so their screams had gone unheard lost in the reverberations of the explosion and a burst of automatic gunfire from the gap in the shattered wall where now the daylight was filtering in through a black smog of smoke and dust jesus christ almighty trask shouted over the din and what the hell god someone is going to pay for all of sir an urgent voice echoed from the back of the cave this way if youre coming come now come on lets go said anna marie her face pale as death those two men back there nathan held backthey were going to help me and now theyre gone his voice was shaky from more than the mindless violence he could hear the whispers of the recently dead all the fear and the doubt and the dread of the endless dark trask saw how he held his left shoulder and the scarlet seeping through his fingers are you okay yes no the other answered shaking his head undecidedly i mean this was for me so dont waste it anna marie hissed now lets go shes stronger than she looks trask thought following after her and behind them in the reek and the turmoil more gunshots and shouting as men came clambering over the rubble their faces smudged but their eyes eager as they scanned the basement at the back of the cave unseen until now a solid plug of concrete stood wall to wall and floor to ceiling it was fitted with a steel manhole or airlock three feet in diameter to the left of the stream the stream itself came gushing out of a steel spout of roughly the same diameter but set lower in the wall some twelve inches above the sluice two more outlets where they flanked this central jet were dry the outflow was insufficient to warrant their operation the airlock door stood open and trask helped anna marie to slide through then directed nathan chung and the caver to follow after trask went last and as he grasped handles on the door and swung his feet into the tube anna marie called back to him from the other side close the door after you ben just yank on the handles he reached out again and did so feeling the circular door settle onto oiled hinges but before swinging it shut he saw shadows mobile on the wall of the cave as two armed gasmasked men entered at the run silhouetted against the smoky lighting of the wiremesh tunnel trask saw that they wore civilian clothing the anonymous grey of cmi as yet however they hadnt seen him then a third man unmasked joined them and trask froze as he heard this one say okay where are they for it was a voice he recognized a lot older than he remembered true but the same clipped efficient cynical and selfserving voice he had known all those years ago yet even though his talent told trask it was so still he had to be sure even at the risk of life and limb which was why he waited with the door only halfclosed knowing that if they spotted him and started shooting and if a few lucky rounds should get into the tube then hed be finished a bunch of them came running in here a gruff muffled voice answered the first they can only be back there if the three of us open up together hose the place down well probably get them all and remember our orders concerning the one called nathan are clear were to kill him if the others get taken out in the process so what i dont much care about the others that eager oh so wellremembered voice snarled in return but as for the alien my orders are to take him alive now cover me the owner of the voice crouched down and came loping through the writhing smoke into the cave following the course of the sluice trask had his machinepistol and it was still cocked apply a gentle pressure to the trigger this one would bother him no more but he couldnt do it even though he now knew who or what he was dealing with for if harry keogh had spared this man despite all hed done or tried to do to him who was trask to take his life and still he waited tendrils of smoke cleared and now the man was only a few paces away trasks eyes were accustomed to the gloom he looked saw knew that he was right and at the same time the man spotted him on allfours in the airlock their eyes met narrowed bridged a gap of years and trask remembered again that scene in the garden of the old house outside edinburgh the necroscope harry keogh monstrous in his drooling halloween halogen lanterneyed wamphyri mode holding in one hand a small thin driedup witheredlooking prune of a man called geoffrey paxton paxton the mindflea an ebranch telepath but treacherous to a fault indeed to every fault in the book he had been maybe twentyseven then was in his early forties now but while the weaselish face and eyes and certainly the voice were the same paxtons body appeared to have undergone something of a metamorphosis of its own deprived by the necroscope of his telepathy paxton had had to develop other talents not mental or parapsychological but physical forced to work for a living hed been obliged to become more nearly the man and trask thought why hes looking in good shape his body at least but the mind was the same as ever still devious still full of hatred still lusting after revenge revenge against harry keogh or his heirs and once again trask recognized the truth of it and as easily as that the mystery was solved paxton of cmi sixteen years it had taken him to get in shape climb to the top become a highranking officer in the department of dirty tricks and all that time hed been watching ebranch and waiting always waiting vindictive god yes he was trask thought but as vindictive as this to have worked all these years for this or was there more to it than simple revenge on harry keogh and whoever followed after him harry had considered paxton a mindflea an irritation an itch he couldnt scratch without surrendering to the monstrous parasitic thing inside him whose prime objective had been to make him wamphyri but in the end hed found a way had entered paxtons mind and made a few adjustments there so that when at last hed scratched the telepathic itch paxtons talent was no more the necroscope had erased it trask knew how he would feel if he were suddenly robbed of his talent he would want it back and paxton did he want his telepathy back or did he want more a whole lot more than that as an esper with ebranch he had read the keogh files of course and hed been right there at the finish during harrys last days in this world so paxton had known the necroscopes capabilities indeed hed experienced harrys talents firsthand he knew about the mobius continuum and about sunsidestarside the vampire world at the end hed known too that harry was a vampire one of the undead but the only one who could talk to the truly dead the only one in the world yes at that time but now there was another nathan and paxton knew about him too thrown out of ebranch the exesper had wormed his way into cmi which with the exception of the branch was the last of the covert government intelligence agencies and hed done it specifically to keep a watch on the mindspies for if there was a way any way at all for paxton to get his telepathy back it would have to be through trasks ebranch and if there was a chance to add to that talent or enhance it then be sure he would take it well and now his time had come opportunity had knocked at last perhaps this son of harry keogh could put right what his vampire father had put wrong but that wasnt the end of it by a long shot for it was also paxtons chance to take his revenge right here and now looking at the man face to face trask knew the truth of it that that was exactly how it was paxton would use nathan if he could and if he couldnt hed kill him trask knew it yes and paxton knew he knew to recognize and evaluate paxton had taken only a second and a lot less than that to forecast his reaction next to the necroscope himself trask had been paxtons worst enemy obviously he still was so that as the ex telepath swung his weapon towards the airlock and squeezed the trigger trask was already closing the door on himself and yanking the handles to lock he heard only the start of it as the cavern filled with the lunatic chatter of sudden death but certainly he knew when the door itself was hit the clamour was deafening as bullets flattened themselves on steel only a few inches from his face trask pushed at the shut door and slid backwards down the smooth bore of the tube a few inches until eager hands grabbed his legs and pulled him through the tube was about seven feet long the thickness of the concrete wall and fitted with handles at the sides to give purchase trask supposed that the airlock would be the weakest part of the system the doors could be blown off it wouldnt take paxton long to cut or blast his way through nathan chung and anna marie were waiting with the three remaining cavers in the white artificial light of the inner cave the faces of all six looked drawn their features etched in fear and looking at them trask thought only one way out now but again nathan had been listening i can still take you somewhere else he said it would only take a moment to set you down in edinburgh or hartlepool or the greek islands if you like trask shook his head son we all have our talents anna marie chung myself and you especially you well lan goodly is talented too and i trust him as well as i trust myself if he says i have no immediate future here then obviously i cant stay here and anyway cant you see what a strange thing that was for him to say no immediate future does that mean there is a future for chung and me but a distant one and does that mean were to make our way to sunsidestarside and then return at some later date nathan nodded i was faced with the same problem once my future was foreseen and i was told it would come about even if i tried to avoid it the future is like the past immutable it cant be avoided therefore its better not to know it anna marie had locked the inner door and was crouched with her ear to it theyre doing something on the far side she said preparing more charges maybe but it will take longer they have to be careful not to bring the whole place down and one of the cavers asked nervously so whos going the three of us trask answered at once but he glanced at anna marie waiting for her to say four as she straightened up i witnessed that mayhem back there that coldblooded murder whoever was responsible he wont want witnesses trask gave it only a moments thought then okay he said i was going to ask you to come anyway oh yes you see the leader of that ratpack back there is geoffrey paxton apparently hes with cmi now hold on a second another caver growled i mean weve been pretty patient here but dont you think its time someone told us what the hells going on nobody told us we were going to war as for this bloke he stared at nathan the way he comes and goes shit were completely in the dark all we know is that were working for you mr trask but are you doing something wrong here or what isnt cmi a government outfit lets get underway trask answered and ill tell you as we go as the cavers made ready their equipment so anna marie applied a field dressing to nathans shoulder his wound was a deep groove along the firm rounded muscle of his upper arm almost a burn as opposed to a cut the bullet had selfcauterized its own damage crisscrossing an earlier burn hed come by only two days earlier in the greek islands the result was a stiffening of the shoulder mercifully that was all and in a little while the party set out up the course of the underground river twentyfive minutes later following the main watercourse deep into a subterranean cavern system the seven were up to their thighs in icecold water and trask had told a muchabbreviated story of an alien world and the vampire creatures who dwelled there where he might have erred nathan was there to correct him also trask had detailed the reasons why nathan must get back there not only to save his world but possibly ours too and had even put forward his theory about paxton the extelepaths reason for wanting to take nathan alive or dead if only for revenge against harry keogh at first the thoroughly downtoearth trio of cavers had seemed sceptical but trasks talent occasionally worked both ways he not only read the truth but the truth was read in him this was one such occasion gradually his demeanour and tone of voice got through to them so that as the party sloshed its way upstream they heard him out without comment in any case theyd seen the cavern of the gate and what it contained following which trasks explanation seemed as good as any and when finally he was finished but didnt miss english say that those cmi people wouldnt want any witnesses the caver spokesmans voice echoed in the cathedrallike acoustics of the place and in the light of powerful torches his face told of his fears well were not just witnesses mr trask those were our colleagues friends who died back there and what about us do we get to enter this other world too or will you leave us down here to face whatevers coming trask looked at him then at nathan and said things have moved too fast i havent had time to think it out i cant say what will or wont work they can come through with us nathan answered theyre sending me home and carrying my weapons after all i wouldnt want them to come to any harm and anyway lardis will be able to put them to good use hell be needing good weapontraining instructors and when it comes to coming back home again this from one of the other cavers but nathan could only shake his head shrug and say i cant make any promises if you knew the wamphyri like i do you wouldnt make any either but theres a chance better than a chance there is a way back for all of you but for the moment its blocked and anyway we cant be sure of the reception youd get at this end but later if theres to be a later i can always take you back to the starside gate yes the cavers looked at each other and in a moment then it looks like were coming with you their spokesman said which coincided with a muffled roar like distant thunder from far back along the way theyd come and there goes the airlock chung groaned by now they were waistdeep in blackly swirling water heading for a dry ledge to one side of the watercourse behind them they towed a pair of lightweight rubber dinghies with tiny but powerful outboard motors and a long buoyant rubber sausage fitted with zipper pockets at a push the dinghies could take three passengers the sausage was a floating transporter nathans weapons and other goods had been stowed in its pockets seven of us the caver spokesman said six in the dinghies and one hanging on behind the sausage ill kitup and as they climbed on to the ledge this is where we lose our pursuers for now anyway there are spare dinghies and airtanks in the refuge but if they want to follow us beyond this point theyll have to go back for them there were six propassisted aqualungs on the ledge and trask found himself feeling a little claustrophobic just looking at them but as the caver spokesman struggled into a wetsuit vest again he reassured trask tor the final leg of the trip a sump some fifty feet end to end but totally submerged well assist you through of course and believe me were lucky the watertable has never been this low any other time wed have been swimming long before this from back along the course theyd followed as they got carefully into the dinghies and started the motors they could hear echoing sounds of splashing and hoarse voices these were left far behind as they lowered their heads and entered a long lake of black water where the ceiling came down to only a few feet and feeling the weight of the carpathian foothills miraculously suspended overhead as they followed a string of luminous bobbing corks into an apparently endless darkness each and every one of the seven fell silent and it was as much as they could do not to hold their breaths but the darkness wasnt endless for a full halfhour they forged at low speed against the flow of the river sometimes with the walls in sight and sometimes when even the ceiling receded out of view but eventually the cavern narrowed down into something of a bottleneck where a dark shingle beach rose inches out of the water and to one side of the beach where the wall was split with a massive crack there the water had a glowing milky sheen to it as if lit by some strange submarine fire nathan recognized that soft but somehow unwelcoming glow well enough beyond that crack in the wall there he said to trask stands the gate and to prove it if only to himself he conjured a mobius door which at once warped and collapsed in upon itself as it had been in perchorsk so it was here in the bowels of the earth the close proximity of the gate interfered with the spacetime matrix and with the mobius continuum of course after beaching the dinghies two of the cavers pulled on vests and fins and set off at once into the water swimming to the crack in the wall they upended and disappeared into the glowing depths behind them they trailed a luminous nylon line made fast to a knob of rock projecting from the wall of the cave in only a minute or two they were back and signalling that nathan trask and chung should enter the water in wetsuits and wearing aqualungs the three took up positions between their guides and hauled themselves hand over hand along the line so they came to the cavern of the gate there on a dry ledge they stripped down and one of the cavers took the smallest of the wetsuits and a lung back through the sump for anna marie assisted by the caver spokesman and his ic she was the last to come through before entering the water with her anna maries escorts partially deflated the sausage transporter and made it fast to the end of the line as for the dinghies they were simply cast off and left to drift downstream and finally all seven of the party stood in the cavern of the gate the cavers had been here before however strange this was nothing new to them but while they hauled on the line and recovered the sausage nathans small arsenal and various items of dry clothing the other four stood gazing all about plainly in awe of the place mainly they looked at the gate or rather they shielded their eyes from its glare the gate it looked nothing like a gate in the common meaning of the word instead it was the very duplicate of that gigantic sphere of alien white light down in the core at perchorsk except here the bulk of its mass seemed lodged in the low ceiling or grown there like a massive blister of cold fire the way home nathan said simply but his words were a sigh perhaps even a prayer looking at him trask thought and this time there really is only one way out if nathan heard him he made no answer part two sunsidestarside i starside staring with squinting eyes all about the cavern of the gate trask thought we might already be in another world and those must be its inhabitants once inhabitants nathan told him in a whisper that somehow managed to echo but not of this world ben starside and no were not there yet the cavern was roughly the shape of the interior of a rugby ball halffull of water and big as a church the black inwardcurving walls were ribbed like a gigantic throat with cracks and crevices here and there where the water had eaten into the rock strata shallow ledges at various levels and black tunnels two to three feet in diameter where the mouths of a great many magmass wormholes alien energy channels disappeared into the otherwise solid bedrock and seated crouched or crammed into several of the higher niches where they had doubtless escaped from rising water in times of flooding trasks inhabitants leered out in stony silence or at least they were silent to trask and the others but not to the necroscope for when nathan had spoken to trask out loud of course his words no less than his thoughts were deadspeak his words and thoughts alike they always were deadspeak except when he shielded them and the longdead creatures of the cavern had heard him moreover they knew him or his sort at least for he was not the first living man who had spoken to them in that way another had been here before him and because of that other the dead of the cavern responded in a way which nathan had grown to expect hah returned are you well and the first ever be sure ah but it took you long enough what nigh on a thousand sunups id suspect still what is time to such as us this from a nightmarish mummything jammed tight in a niche where dripstone had fused it in position like a weird embryo in a womb of gleaming calcium a hideously misshapen skull whose empty eyesockets reflected the glare of the gate protruded from the grotesque stalactite frozen in true death the yawning jaws were wolfish and toothed like a carnivore and indeed this had been a carnivore wamphyri or a lieutenant on the brink of ascendancy at the very least but now it was just a dead thing yet still it seemed to leer at trask and his party with a permanent imperishable malignancy startled at first trask now stepped closer to the wall of the cavern and gazed up at the monster obviously it had crouched there like this for a very long time what a statue or is it the real thing even asking it he knew that the creature was or had been real alive of course his talent told him that much but he did not have nathans talent could scarcely imagine that even now the necroscope and the ossified thing were conversing oh its the real thing nathan quietly answered withered away shrunken down and encased in stone but definitely real and then to the longdead lieutenant im not who you think i am that one was my father he passed this way before me on his way to starside he was harry keogh and am his son nathan indeed and like father like son you would follow in his footsteps eh well if he went to starside then your fathers jong dead and gone from both worlds now begone for this is a private place it wasnt usual for the dead to be so surly abrupt rude but this wasnt one of the usual dead unperturbed nathan inquired whose man were you anyway the other seemed astonished his very presence his previous nature was enough in itself to cow the thoughts of most of the other dead people here what was this nathan anyway but a pup and a human pup at that whose man was i why i was my own man of course called cezar bitesthrall but nathan knew well enough how the wamphyri named their thralls and so could work it out for himself which lord this one had served bitesthrall but youve given yourself away cezar he said you were in thrall to menor maimbite who died in the battle for the dwellers garden on starside yes and it was my father who killed him now the other really was astonished you are little more than a boy he gasped and yet you know so much how is it you know so much when a man passes through the starside gate he is gone forever yet your knowledge of starside is plainly considerable but did you say that menor is dead truly the caver spokesman suddenly aware of a strange silence said well what now his colleagues were equally mystified not least by nathans expression as he stared at the freakish thing in its high niche but trask anna marie and david chung all knew what now that nathan was speaking to a dead man or something which had once been a man espers they sensed something of it at least in a minute trask whispered stepping back a pace from nathan but never taking his eyes off him for a moment but right now would you mind keeping quiet for a while among the several things he hadnt told them was this that nathan was a necroscope the concepts of teleportation and parallel universes were difficult enough without that he should ask them to also believe in a man who conversed with the dead dead yes nathan had meanwhile answered cezars question a thousand sunups ago aye and all of the olden wamphyri with him a deadspeak gasp what all of them shaithis fess lesk not lesk the glut surety all of them nathan told him he knew the names cezar mentioned for they were like old cursewords among the travellers of sunside and that one who was here that time your father he did ajj this he helped to do it certainly and suddenly cezar guffawed but that old bastard menor maimbite dead eh oh hah hah hah you didnt much care for your master then cezar stopped laughing on the instant and grunted care for him i hated his black heart he caught me licking a woman of his cut out my tongue and made her eat it and there he tojd me now shes tasted your tongue with both her mouths as im sure shes tasted your sex then he throttled her and took me to the starside gate nathan had real experience of the starside gate and knew what that last meant at least he had experience of the gate whose dome showed above the ground something over three years ago hed seen it when accompanying lardis lidesci on his annual pilgrimage into the gaunt aching emptiness which was then starside and just a few months ago hed passed through it into perchorsk moreover hed had ebranchs keogh files read to him and knew there were two gates the upper gate had been created when a russian experiment the perchorsk projekt backfired and blasted a grey hole between parallel dimensions the second was a thing of nature lodged beneath the first in what was once a pit and so invisible from the surface by virtue of its manmade twin since time immemorial the lower natural original gate which had its exit here in this subterranean cavern in romania had been used infrequently and according to circumstance as an instrument of wamphyri punishment revenge or simple cruelty into which the lords of starside had tossed enemies vanquished foes and disobedient thralls so you were hurled into the white gaping maw of hell nathan nodded grimly through which you sank down into this place aye the other grunted but when i got here the water was high and dark and swift and so i crept up here onto this ledge and waited waited waited soon i was too weak to swim even if i could swim and the cold and the damp had stiffened all my joints starvation i was not yet wamphyri but a lieutenant even a vampires longevity could not sustain me through the rigours of this place and like all of these others i feared the water mightily finally i was as you see me now stiffened to a stone or very nearly so and that was the end of cezar bitesthrall he uttered a deadspeak sigh and after a moment continued and you do you really intend to go in the other direction what and are you then a madman ah but it will take real magic to keep you alive in starside except and yet again his gasp no not so for they are no more the old wamphyri dead and gone forever but is it really so they were gone for a while nathan answered eh explain the old wamphyri are dead aye but in the east beyond the great red waste others were waiting out their time now they are back in starside in the last great aerie of the wamphyri i go as my father went before me to destroy them who destroy mine but your name nathan keogh the first however rare is a traveller name be sure but keogh ah i remember your fathers name and he was a helllender yes nathan nodded but my mother was a kiklu szgany the other sighed his partial understanding and said myself i was of the szgany stengi based fifty miles east of the great pass there were kiklus in my tribe too he fell silent as if memories of the olden times were proving too much for him but in another moment his deadspeak voice had turned hard as his calcium sheath huh all such things are done with now even life itself done with i was szgany i was made undead possibly i might even have been wamphyri but all of these years in this place frozen in the true death its as if all my life were a dream and you have disturbed it because of you i know the truth of it that it was wasted youve brought me no comfort nathan keogh at which another voice but a much harder darker even angry voice broke in comfort is that what youre all about cezar bitesthrajl comfort what and you a lieutenant of the wamphyri hah but menor erred when he apprenticed you even here in this dreary place we have comforts enough and weve had enough of talk too now still the chatter and let this fool go on to his sure death in starside nathan located the source of the voice a dripstone bulge in the wall where a gleaming calcium candle seven feet tall seemed lodged in an ancient crevice under fanglike festoons of stalactite formations the sheath was semiopaque glasslike beneath it frozen ferocious features were barely visible but now that nathan knew the source of the voice he also knew the nature of its owner wamphyri nathan it was anna marie breaking into his thoughts drawing him back from his deadspeak communications he glanced at her yes we cant stay here the cold and the time wed planned for you to go through in three days time by our calculations based on what little we know that would make it sunup on sunside but right now the sun is sinking towards the barrier mountains even as we speak and we dont know how long the journey through the gate is going to take nathan turned to trask while i talk to them you could begin by passing my weapons up into the gate according to the files they will be drawn up go right through slide down the dome of the underground gate in starside and we wont be far behind well go through together or as close together as possible then as trask and the others set to it he turned again to the dripstone thing in its stalactite tomb who were you bah rather what am i now that a mere child has power over me while i stand impotent a stone which was once a man and more than a man even a lord of the wamphyri but that was then and this is now nathan lapsed into common speech which in his case was deadspeak of course but easier you were a man you were wamphyri but now you are a fossil this is probably your last chance to talk to a man of the living world even of two worlds will you waste it the other considered his words while from behind nathan now what the hell the caver spokesman snatched back his hand from where he had passed a box of ammunition up into the glare of the gate hed been distracted by the sight and sound of nathan talking to something locked in the dripstone talking to it as if it lived and might even answer him back the light seemed to suck at me of course trask told him in the same way that it takes these weapons from us so it will take us its like an invisible conveyorbelt or an elevator to another world he passed up a selfloading rifle buttfirst watched the stock disappear into the glare and felt first the attraction then the fierce irresistible suction as the weapon was drawn from his hand and into the gate just dont let your fingers touch the surface thats all unless you want to be the first of us into starside who is there now in starside to remember me the exlord of the wamphyri wondered in nathans mind no one in starside nathan answered but werent you a traveller first didnt you ascend in the usual way you must have had your tribe like everyone else maybe sons of your sons are alive even now on sunside i was a ferenc said the other gloomily we were outcasts supplicants metalworkers we made war gauntlets for the wamphyri we had a pact with them hah i was taken when i was seventeen no human offspring from my loins nathan keogh but as the thing in the stalactite had mentioned the name ferenc so a massed groan of horror had gone up from others among the caverns inhabitants who until now had been silent ferenc a curse in itself the very word and the object of their terror had heard their deadspeak moaning aye a ferenc he told them and even now well quite obviously it means something to be what i have been that is why i find comfort however cold even in a place such as this the very knowledge of your fear comforts me that as a dead thing even now i strike terror into your hearts you quaking leathery trogs and traveller cowards for such as you even to be in the same company with myself its an honour and for as much as a stone thing may have thralls all of you are my thralls from this time forward so be it nathan bridled this dead thing ferenc wamphyri whatever he should not have named travellers cowards the szgany were never that and so pay him no heed he told the ghosts of everyone who was ever trapped here for if he is the greatest of you all then he is also the greatest coward what wamphyri strong and fearless as ten men oh but if so how is it hes still here or is it that he feared the water as much as the rest of you aye and maybe feared it even more now let me tell you something since time immemorial this watercourse has been the route by which certain brave wamphyri lords invaded the helllands so becoming a pestilence in both worlds but in this world they were small and kept small by the efforts of mere men but this one this ferenc was too small to even venture into the water his supplicant blood ran true to the very end aye and how is that for a coward such as you could never be thralls to such as this what why he was even usurped and thrown from his seat in starside else why is he here at all occasionally deadspeak conveys more than is said but now the ferencs fury couldnt be more in evidence if he were alive and free of his stalactite sheath why you insolent little pup oh be quiet nathan climbed up to the encysted figure and rapped with hard knuckles against the dripstone and think on this ferenc if ever i should pass this way again i might easily bring a hammer and chisel with me and chip away at you until youre no more and when all of your pieces are rounded to pebbles in this dark river and your evil essence dispersed far and wide what will you have of comforts then eh and how many trembling thralls but from the other there was no answer at all except perhaps a far faint whimper nathan anna marie was looking up at him the time and trask said son its not getting any warmer in here wed best be on our way nathan got down said very well but that he glanced up once last time at the horror in the crack and glared at the thing was something i had to do and anyway my time wasnt wasted like my father before me ive learned something oh yes that in death even the true death the wamphyri are just as loathsome as in life or in undeath how how do we go about it the caver spokesmans voice shook a little trask shrugged you came close to answering that one yourself just a few minutes ago reach up jump and let the gate do the rest it will take you in pass you through which will take how long were not sure said anna marie and nathan told her if you go first we can help you she moved between him and trask they lifted her up she held up her arms and was taken effortlessly from them and as she slid into the white glare they heard her gasp drawn out almost interminably as she disappeared trask followed immediately so that as anna maries feet passed into the glare he was already jumping and reaching out after her quickly nathan told chung and the cavers lets all go through together the cavers jumped almost as a man and as a man were taken up and nathan and chung were last but as the others had disappeared into the sphere of white light so nathan had remembered one who wasnt here and also he remembered his own misha the misery she must be experiencing not knowing what had become of him no need for zek to go through that quickly he reached out for her and made contact in the moment before he felt the gate sucking at him then it was the work of that single moment to pass on the information that ben trask was on his way to starside but zeks answering mental cry of denial astonishment pain was shut off even as she issued it after the initial suction that first weird tugowar between gravity and the gates attraction the feeling of being drawn up of the defeat of gravity itself disappeared completely it was simply a drifting sensation but of drifting upwards like a swimmer surfacing after a dive looking up or ahead nathan and chung could see the others as in a shaft of white light seemingly floating there unsupported anna marie was in front followed by trask then the cavers in a triangular formation and they were all looking down or back at nathan and chung in its way trask thought its as strange as the mobius continuum the weightlessness the sensation of emptiness the effortless mobility but now instead of moving from place to place were moving between worlds unlike the mobius continuum however such thoughts had no weight at all this place was real enough no metaphysical continuum this but a physical reality the crossover between parallel universes and where the mobius continuum might have been that element in which god said let there be light this might well be the light itself a misty light white as snow but of an even temperature so that the cold of the cavern was soon left far behind and so the seven fell upwards into an apparently endless white somewhere and such was the silence each of them could hear the uneven nervous breathing of the others and perhaps even the beating of their hearts even knowing it must come their resurgence was something of a shock anna marie first she passed through the skin of the gate then halfslid halfrolled down the curve of the resilient dome on to the heaped jumble of nathans armoury where his weapons had come to rest on a bed of stony debris that formed a shelf around the spheres perimeter and in those same few moments she saw that the sphere of white light was lodged like a plug in a massive hole or a childs marble pushed down into sand by the weight of a finger directly overhead the lower hemisphere of a second globe seemed suspended in the same shaft looking almost identical to the gate as it had appeared in the ceiling of the cavern of petrified monsters a distance of only five or six feet separated the two singularities so that anna marie couldnt help wondering or should i think of it as a duality but in any case she knew that the top half of that uppermost gate stood open to the air glaring out on the vampire world of starside and all around her in the scree and rubble and cut in the wall of the shaft itself were those alien energy wormholes that she had seen in the cavern of the romanian gate so that as trask came through she found wind to shout ben look out the wormholes for they were glasssmooth only fall into one it might take a long time to get out again if ever but in a moment trask was on his feet assisting the disorientated cavers as they came through and finally chung and nathan then as they dusted themselves down from now on we have to mind how we go trask told them his voice steady but echoing when harry keogh came this way he tried several of these wormholes before he found one that connected with the surface but he was only one man and there are seven of us avoid holes that slant downwards they twist and turn could easily make a sudden descent look for upwardleading holes but in any case go slowly and take no chances and the first man to see daylight overhead or starlight nathan put in grimly trask looked at him and nodded or starlight yes and he left it at that they separated along the scree ledge chose wormholes went headfirst into them first in the glare of the gate then in the light of pencil pocket torches and trask was the one who found the way up there were probably several but he was first and the route that his wormhole took fitted harry keoghs description precisely it climbed gently at first not so steeply as to cause him to slide back in a little while it swung left then rose marginally more steeply a short claustrophobic climb before the bore levelled out and swung right following which it shot up almost vertically and looking up as from the bottom of a shallow well starlight trask backed off returned to the main shaft and the glare of the gate called for the others anna marie nathan and one of the cavers were already there chung and the other two cavers soon came crawling backwards out of wormholes this is it trask told them indicating the mouth of the exit into starside as to how we go about it nathan goes first and ill be right behind him ill help him up out of the well onto the surface the rest of us string ourselves out along the route and pass the weapons along and up to him finally he helps us to get out me first then anna marie and the rest of you in whatever order you prefer on the surface we each take what weapons we can carry and get clear of the upper gate that might take more than one trip but it has to be done its not simply that the weapons are important of course they are but its also that nathan cant er he cant work to best effect too close to the gate but i warn you now we wont have any time to look about and gawp when i looked up the last nine or ten feet of wormhole looked into the sky of starside i saw stars up there if it isnt sundown its pretty damned close now are there any questions the caver spokesman said that second gate on the surface thats our return route right right but not yet oh we could use it all right but we cant guarantee our reception at the other end in perchorsk theyve learned to be extremely cautious of things that come through the gate so cautious they might easily kill you in half a dozen different ways before you even got to say hello especially now youve seen that stuff back in the refuge down in the sump well by comparison thats pretty tame and once were away from the gate what then trask looked at nathan who said then its my problem but this is my world and i know oh several routes out of here into sunside and before they could ask any more questions anna marie said were wasting time and theres also something you may have forgotten oh trask looked at her turkur tzonov and his men could well be in the vicinity how long is it since you saw him enter the gate in perchorsk and how long would it take him to walk through or havent you worked it out trask did so and quickly maybe three and a half hours since we saw him go through its hard to gauge but we know he was walking while we were transported also my watch stopped during transit and all of our watches stopped the caver spokesman told him and anna marie said whichever way we look at it tzonov cant be too far away from us she inclined her head upwards either he and his men are closing with the gates exit right now and will soon come through onto the boulder plains or theyre already here somewhere overhead perhaps heading for the barrier mountains and the great pass into sunside trask nodded first priority then as soon as were out we choose personal weapons and hang onto them but the last thing we need is a firefight on starside okay lets twenty minutes later they were out and nathans single glance all about had confirmed the fact that he was home or close to it for of course starside of the barrier mountains could never be considered home in the real sense of the word not to men anyway as for the six newcomers to this place all very well for trask to warn against gawping but this was a different world and weird staring all about what trask and the others saw was this first the gate the dazzling white hemisphere was perhaps thirty feet in diameter and set in a crater like the raised rim of a volcanic blowhole all around its perimeter penetrating the earth and the crater walls alike to a radius of over sixty feet magmass wormholes gaped everywhere the seven had emerged from one such hole and now must be careful where they stepped the walls of the holes were glasssmooth and some were very nearly perpendicular their depth was entirely conjectural away from the gate itself the perceptions of the visitors were at first baffled disorientated by the contrasts of what might easily be considered a surreal or even hallucinogenic landscape except it was all too real perhaps because of the alien nature of the place their eyes were first drawn to those one or two features which were most readily acceptable like the mountains behind the gate maybe two miles south the barrier mountains rose gaunt and grey from foothills and scree escarpments up sparselyclad slopes over crags and buttresses through ravines and saddles to sloping plateaux and sharpfanged peaks that were rapidly fading from amethyst to ashgrey silhouettes in the twilight before true night the immense range sprawled east on the one hand west on the other as far as the eye could see its peaks marched away to far horizons merged with them passed into purple velvet distances and disappeared at the rim of the world but for all that the range displayed many of the mundane features of earthly mountains still these peaks were most obviously alien they felt cold and alien and trask found himself thinking as at least one other had thought before him only take away the trees under the timberline these could well be the mountains of the moon closer maybe two to three miles south and a little east the mouth of a canyon the great pass opened onto the barren boulder plains apart from this pass where in ages past the barrier range had cracked open the march of the mountains seemed entirely unbroken and so the mountains and the great pass through them and the hush of twilight were in the main acceptable to human perceptions but as for the rest of starside to the west there was only the sparselywooded flank of the mountains and at the foot of the range the boulder plains rolling north turning blue then dark blue into a mainly featureless distance but directly to the north to the far north the blue turned smoky black and the earth was a darkness shot through with dull silver streaks there under the weird weave of ghostly aurora and the glitter of unknown constellations like blue iceshards frozen in the vaulted dark of the skies the surface of what might be a sullen sea or possibly a sheet of glacial ice made a misty mirrorimage of the alien heavens and if the mountains belonged on the moon then this was a picture of some cold and dying planet way out beyond arcturus a chill wind had come up blowing from the north it was gradually eating its way through the clothing of the seven to their very bones they felt it and shivered but not only on the outside for it was a chill of the soul sensing their thoughts nathan told them that wind blows off the icelands in the olden times when a vampire lord was found wanting sometimes the others would banish him north such errant lords suffered various forms of punishment to be driven north possibly to a freezing death or to be buried alive out on the boulder plains or maybe to be hurled into the helllands gate from which no one ever returned well not until now the seven had taken up nathans weapons as he led them away from the hemisphere of white light he paused for a moment to point east and a little north now that the painful glare of the gate was behind them and their eyes had grown accustomed to starsides preternatural gloom their view of the boulder plains was that much clearer and there to the northeast of the gate of all they had seen so far the barren boulder plains and what stood or lay in a vast jumble upon them were the most surreal of all the boulder plains were just what the term implied seemingly endless plains reaching out from the barrier mountains to the northern horizon under its writhing dome of shimmering auroras they might be the bed of some aeondead ocean like the misnamed mares of the moon but scattered far and wide across them like clods of earth thrown haphazardly down on the bed of a dried up lake boulder piles and individual rocks stood starkly silhouetted in the glare of the gate casting concentric rings of shadows outwards from the central point of illumination well away from the gate they were like eerie white sentinels and farther still they were grey ghosts gradually merging into the powderblue background weathered into weird shapes many of the boulders were grotesque as gargoyles so that the overall effect was surreal like a painting by salvador dali all it would seem to lack was a focal point an object of form or structure so striking as to distract the eye from what might otherwise be considered its monotony and out there some eight or nine miles east and two to three north indeed that singularity existed for even at that distance the seven could make out a nest of squat mistwreathed columns like some immense stonehenge like the stumps of a ring of gigantic petrified mushrooms or the mighty pedestals of toppled cyclopean statues rising up from vast heaps of scree and stony debris and tumbled down on the alien earth itself halfburied in the riven soil the shattered bodies of the fallen gods all formed into tumuli or strewn into doglegged mounds of rubble about the bases of the naked stumps but central in this primal fossil forest a mighty stack remained unscathed by earthquake or any device of man or monsters the last great aerie of the wamphyri and karenstack nathan whispered in awe of that incredible fang or whatever theyve named it now and trask and the others gazed their fascination however morbid across all the misted miles to that lone kilometrehigh sentinel rock still standing there in the east among the rubble of the fallen aeries where harry keogh had brought them crashing down onto the boulder plains then trask chung and anna marie were given to wonder but if this is only the last of the aeries and not the greatest by any means then how must it have looked when all of the stacks were standing and all of their inhabitants alive or undead trask couldnt take his eyes off that alien skyscraper tower so that he stumbled over small rocks as nathan led the way even farther from the gates glare possibly the stack had weathered out from the barrier range and been left standing there like a series of mighty buttes as the mountains themselves retreated certainly they had been a natural feature of this place at least until the first of the vampire lords had commenced work on them but now especially in its upper sections or levels this last great aerie of the wamphyri looked anything but natural what with all of those chimneys and causeways those towers turrets and flying buttresses those landingbays balconies and windows behind which even as trask gazed faint glimmering lights were flickering into being one by one or was that simply a whim of his imagination a trick of the spectral light a mirage of the twining mists which draped the distant menhir no mirage ben nathan told him look the other way across the barrier mountains trask and the others they all looked and saw that the sky over the mountains was now indigo shot with fading shafts of gold and that the shafts formed a slowly turning fan like the spokes of a phantom wheel then the fan seemed to fold in upon itself and faded in a moment to a memory in the minds eye and sundown nathan told them the true night and time we were gone from here those lights in karenstack the wamphyri are up and about perhaps theyre already abroad in sunside but if not they soon will be and we stand directly in their path now wait a moment he conjured a mobius door which shrank a little from the proximity of the gate then firmed up and stood steady good we can go he turned to the cavers you first if not for me you wouldnt be here so i want to make sure youre safe form a ring and hold on to each other and well just hold on but no questions and no talking just bear with me then expanding his door he guided them through it and stepped in after them and trask chung and anna marie were left alone on the boulder plains but not for long maybe a minute and a half at most and then jesus trask gasped as a ragged shadow flitted close overhead his eyes scanned skyward and his machinepistol made its typical metallic chching sound as he instinctively cocked it and bats he whispered as he spied what spied upon them desmodus anna maries breath was ragged pretty much the same as the vampires of earth but big she too cocked her weapon big david chung was quick to follow suit why those things must be three feet across wingtip to wingtip but not especially dangerous anna marie had regained her composure oh if there was only one of us injured then they might attack but right now theyre merely curious were strange to them they didnt expect to find us here shh listen there were half a dozen of the giant bats and now they were circling calling to each other with shrill barely audible whistles barely audible to human ears that is but miles across the boulder plains their cries would certainly be heard by others of their ilk and perhaps by others not quite of their ilk and maybe not too many miles away at that the advance guard said trask his throat suddenly dry aerial observers trackers bloodhounds right chung choked the word out and look here come the masters of the hounds he pointed a shaking hand in the sky barely half a mile away a pair of weirdly pulsing manta shapes blotted out the stars as they descended from on high and they were headed directly for the three espers where they stood frozen like rabbits in the glare of headlight beams on the cold uncaring plain of boulders ii on the plain of boulders twentyfive to thirty minutes earlier in turgosheim it had been that maglore the mage was down in madmanse or what had been madmanse when the killglance brothers wran and spiro had resided there down in that haunted cobwebbed batshrouded mausoleum of a place inspecting it as a prospective extension of his own runemanse hed been there with his lieutenant karpath seersthrall making diagrams of the manse and measuring certain of its rooms which he might use as metamorphic vats for maglore had many monsters to fashion and the space in runemanse was all but used up but down in madmanse where even now the dread spirit of its murdered onetime master eygor killglance seemed to waft on a gloomy aether suddenly the grey fur at the back of maglores neck had tingled and stood erect and for a moment however brief a symbol had blazed up bright in the eye of his seers mind this symbol it was maglores sigil by which every other lord and lady of the wamphyri knew him but it was also the sigil of another gone from maglores ken for some seventeen sunups now and now returned was it possible the seerlords window on olden sunsidestarside returned to life or undeath but now that vormulac unsleep and his aerial vampire army were flown west on their crusade against wratha the risen and maglore left to his own devices in the mighty gorge of turgosheim this was just the stroke of good fortune hed been seeking indeed for if that oh so crafty nathan was back in olden sunside why then vormulacs progress might yet be spied upon and maglore heir to all the lore of a hitherto unknown land nathan maglore had stood up straight and sniffed at the air gazing all about in the gloom of deserted madmanse why it is as if i can even smell you nathan paleblood the hulking karpaths eyes had narrowed as maglore rubbed clawlike hands together chuckled and headed for an upwardsleading stairwell what of him master at which maglore had paused and looked back his crimson eyes flaring up in the dark paleblood nathan paleblood but you mean nathan seersthrall surely and karpath had backed off a pace i i used to think of him as paleblood master because he was so pale and his blood so weak oh maglores voice was deep dark clotted but this this urge to apportion names worries me somewhat karpath for its outside your jurisdiction in runemanse only maglore names the creatures which are his in all such matters the wamphyri are jealous to a fault which im sure you know so is it perhaps that you anticipate your ascension do you lust after my egg karpath master the other trembled master i this much i promise when i decide that the time is ripe to invest another with my powers you shall be the first to know following which without pause the seerlord maglore had proceeded alone to his room of meditation and in that room maglores shewstone stood upon a slender onyx base to one side of a work bench seated at the bench he might simply turn and place his hands upon the instrument of his scrying or farseeing talent except the device was of no stone or crystal as such but a metal precious in the world beyond the starside gate yet common in the vampire world shaped in gold it was in fact a weighty model of maglores sigil a twisted loop ten inches long and five wide compact yet massy and potent this was the medium through which maglore concentrated enhanced wamphyri powers to contact and speak to his various spies in sunside and with which he had hoped to follow the adventures of nathan in olden sunsidestarside to that end when nathan had lived here a while in runemanse not as the seerlords thrall or familiar but more nearly as his friend maglore had made him a gift of a golden earring in the same design but only an inch long not only a practical but also an appropriate gift for the mobius loop was nathans symbol too indeed when first he had come here the youth had worn a twisted leather strap upon his wrist and some four months ago when the seerlord had arranged nathans escape from turgosheim on an aberrant illtempered flyer then the earring had gone with him maglores window on a faroff land of legend and the youth all unsuspecting of the seerlords motive at least that was how it was supposed to have been but scarcely had nathan arrived in olden sunside in the west than contact had been broken and now maglore remembered how it had been how then as now he had sensed something rushed to his room of meditation and pjaced trembling fingers upon the golden sigil how he had let his mind drift out from turgosheim then hurtle west at the unthinkable speed of thought a flight which he had terminated when hed seen how lifeless was the sigil a strangely twisted mass of heavy metal and nothing more for the moment and as far as nathan was concerned anyway so the seerlords window on an unknown world had been closed but it was a weird thing because despite that nathans aura was gone the feeling had persisted that he was not dead and maglore had wondered what then undead is he locked in that metamorphic sleep which ever precedes the vampire condition has he at last succumbed to the seduction of vampirism does wratha or one of hers have him he had not known the answer then but now ahhh for as his hands touched the sigil and his mind sped west there surely burned nathans flame the youth was alive he was back from wherever he had been and maglores lodestone earring still secure in his ear mere inches from the centre of his brain maglore closed his burning eyes and concentrated concentrated and in a moment looked out through nathans eyes and looked upon the boulder plains of far starside and in the distance that looming menhir which was the last great aerie of the wamphyri he looked and knew it as the home of wratha and her renegades even as nathan knew it more than this he knew what was uppermost in nathans mind the utter destruction of wratha and all like her and everything they stood for and strong maglore sighed ah strong what nathan paleblood no not this one then the picture of the mighty stack faded and in its place an ephemeral portal formed of golden shimmering smoke that was how maglore saw nathans mobius door and as nathan stepped forward and entered that door so the seerlord felt something of its power a whirlpool of symbols which maglore had known before the esoteric guardian of nathans secret mind the incredible numbers vortex but not quite the same no for now those symbols were ordered they had intelligence and flowed with a will of their own or perhaps with nathans will yes for nathan was their master but as nathan had stepped through that metaphysical door so hed been snatched from maglores mind had disappeared out of this universe yet however tenuously their minds were still linked so that maglore felt himself moving with nathan but at such an astonishing speed indeed even as fast as maglores thoughts themselves and as before nathan was in control maglore gasped snatched his stiffened fingers from the loop and staggered back a pace or two shocked his eyes stood out from their orbits in vast amaze for he knew that nathan had moved himself or had physically removed himself from the plain of boulders to some other place and he had been in complete command hed known what he was about then much like a child whispering in the dark maglore reassured himself but didnt i once say he had powers this one and recognizing if not understanding his fear gazing all about his room of meditation to make sure no one had seen he quickly regained control of himself but as his mind cleared and his breathing grew less ragged suddenly he felt weak made weak perhaps by nathans strength or by abstinence well at least there was a remedy for that he reached out for karpath where he went about his duties elsewhere in runemanse and asked him karpath are there fresh ones indeed master the other answered at once men and women both then send me a strong man later seek out orlea and tell her i am young again and i have my needs and karpath answered so be it master but when maglore withdrew his probe the lieutenant grinned in his morbid fashion for he knew what were the seerlords needs as for the first the blood is the life and as for the second to live is to lust while down in madmanse in an airless diseased disused refuse pit sealed up for more than fifty years that which upon a time had been eygor killglance sat or slumped against a nitrestreaked wall but while up above in runemanse the seerlord maglores appearance was more or less human that of eygor in his pit was nothing less than a nightmare for the long exanimate exlord of madmanse was a vast and monstrous anomaly an amalgam a welding together of everything unwholesome into one being one creature anthropomorphic yes manlike in outline at least but with that any past or present connection with humanity must surely be at an end for eygors metamorphism had long since absolved or removed him from the frailties of form and aspect of mundane mankind much like the beings in the romanian cavern of the gate eygor killglance might at first be mistaken for a strange stalagmite formation a fantastic dripstone creation of nature but on closer examination one would soon discover feverish differences for example the petrified creatures in the cavern of the gate were not eighteen feet tall and composed of fused bone black mummied flesh knobs of gristly cartilage and plates of gleamingblue chitin nor had they additional mouths in their dripstone bodies and limbs to complement the ones in their faces but there in that gloomy madmanse pit a cobwebbed cathedral of a place vast and highvaulted whose walls dripped slime and nitre such were eygors form and aspect the floor around him was a clutter of anomalous debris humped fibrous boggy spongy bones and whiteshining cartilage remains gleamed everywhere like a boneyard of extinct monsters of which the exlord of madmanse had been one of course and because he had been intelligent wamphyri he had also been the worst of them the shape and delirious design of this thing slumped in a kneeling position and halfwelded to the wall were terrible in themselves its horny fossil feet shrivelled leathery thighs arched back and shoulders and misshapen screaming skull the huge head was thrown back jaws frozen in some unending rictus a withered arm lay upon a ledge ending in a talon that drooped from a wrist thick as a mans thigh blackened bones protruded from dusty fretted flesh this was eygor the oncelord and once feared more than any other creature in all turgosheim eygor whose contemporaries had named him killglance because of that mordant talent which enabled him to murder men with the sheer poison of his looks alone whose own bloodsons wran and spiro had so feared him that in the end theyd murdered him in this pit except there is murder and murder and eygors had lasted long and long that hed deserved it was undeniable for eygor was the cruellest of creatures he had desired that his sons should be powerful feared in turgosheim even as he himself was feared but in order to make them strong he had been ruthless and his brutalities unbearable wran and spiro had feared their lord and father aye but more than the man theyd feared his evil eye for they had seen him use it against the szgany and had watched his human victims shrivel and die in the withering furnace of his gaze and for all that they were wamphyri in their own right they too had tasted the bile of eygors glance and knew that his power was exponential the more he used it the stronger it grew today he killed only men but tomorrow and so for him there was no tomorrow his bloodsons had deadened his senses with strong drink poisoned his food with silver and while he lay in his stupor they blinded him when he leapt shrieking awake then theyd taunted him and led him blundering through madmanse right to the rim of this very pit and over it and at the last when he lay broken at the bottom they had choked the pit with boulders and sealed it but eygor was wamphyri and did not die well not immediately for a sixmonth he lived on muck and bones and while his metamorphic flesh remained pliable gathered to himself the remnants of dead constructs the armour of warriors debris of cartilage creatures marrow of monsters planning to break out he made a giant of himself but the refuse pit was as deep as his sustenance was bad and eygors strength waned even as his size increased and of course he was blind he fashioned eyes for himself but they were poor things and lacking in power all of their special evil had been burned out of them finally starved and stiffening eygor had slumped against the wall and moved no more but while the evil and hatred were gone from his eyes still they burned bright in his undying mind for just like the minds of common men those of vampires too go on beyond death and just as the evil power of his mind had been vast during life and undeath so it continued in the true death which perhaps explained the morbid atmosphere of madmanse for if only in mind and spirit eygor killglance dwelled there still when for a while the necroscope nathan kiklu lived in maglores runemanse eygor had spoken to him in his dreams lured him down into deserted madmanse even attempted to bargain with him for the thing in the pit had eavesdropped on the deadspeak conversations of dreaming thyre ancients in their cavern mausoleums under the drifted sands of sunsides deserts and he understood nathans power over the dead that they would even leave their graves at his command and his proposition was this if nathan should see fit to bring him back to life if only long enough to take revenge upon his sons then the necroscope could ask what he would of him and be heir to eygors greatest mystery the secret of his killing eye that had been eygors wamphyri vow his promise for the future which nathan had spurned but eygor knew that the future was a long and devious thing and that what stands today often falls tomorrow or most certainly the day after that at the moment nathan did not need an extra talent he had sufficient of his own but tomorrow and tomorrow then what had been eygors killing eye in life became his seeing eye in death so that he followed the youths adventures from that time forward even up to the time when nathan fled to his old home in the west but after that nathans passing or what eygor had taken for his passing had been like a cold wind blowing in the pitthings mind and like the guttering of a distant candle in the dark night of death eygor had seen nathans light go out which could mean only one thing that the necroscope was no more except the future is a long and devious thing and history often repeats itself and in that selfsame moment during maglores inspection of madmanse when he had paused and lifted his head sniffed and sensed nathans return so too had eygor sensed it but where maglore had breathed nathans name eygor in the bowels of the place could only deadspeak it nathaaan like the soughing of the wind in an aeries battlements or the sighing of a ghost in its refuse pits for nathan was there in eygors mind far away true but shining with his unique light as before so that eygor knew him at once and the pitthings all but forgotten desire to be up and about in the world of the living returned immediately for the necroscope nathan was his one hope of revenge against his bloodsons wran and spiro and as if the thought of his sons had galvanized eygors dead flesh albeit momentarily there had sounded in the pit a creaking as of rusted hinges and before all fell still and eerily silent again a single streamer of dust had come drifting down from the high cobwebbed ceiling the wamphyri lord maglore of runemanse and the exlord eygor killglance were not the only ones who knew that the necroscope nathan was back all the dead of starside knew it too and as his aura washed out from him as it was felt and his light was seen in the otherwise uttermost darkness so would the dead of sunside know it but there were others yet more special who had known of nathans return from the moment he moved away from the influence of the gate onto the plain of boulders his nephew wolves knew it blaze dock and grinner he had named the first and wisest of these for the white diagonal stripe across his grey forehead as if the fur there was marked with frost dock was the one with a stump of a tail where an angry vixen had found cause to chastise him when he was a cub while grinner was the one with an uneven temper whose blackgleaming upper lip was wont to draw back from his teeth so that it might seem he was grinning all three of them they knew he was back for sure and waking in their barrier mountains den blinking triangular yellow eyes and yawning knowing in their way that it was twilight and their mistress moon would soon be sailing on high they simply acknowledged his return and were glad or as glad as wolves may be nor were they the last of nathans relatives to know but perhaps most special of all dreaming in their cavern mausoleums the revered and mummied ancients of the thyre knew that he was back for among the dead of the desert folk he was as great a legend as his father had been to the great majority of mundane mankind in an alien world an entire dimension away nathan who had brought light into their darkness translated their works and appraised their living descendants of a continuity of sorts in a place beyond death if there was a single place in sunside more safe than any other it must be with the thyre for dwelling so close to the sun they had never known the terror of the wamphyri except in the lore and lives of the szgany with whom they occasionally traded being telepathic albeit secretly so that men had never suspected their talent the thyre and their dead had more readily accepted nathans deadspeak thus enabling him to become their spokesman among the living which was how he knew exactly where to take the cavers for safety and who would welcome him in that place so that even as maglore the mage recoiled from the power of the now purposeful numbers vortex drew back clawlike hands from his golden sigil and wondered at nathans velocity as he sped where and through what weird medium the necroscope had already used the mobius continuum to reach his destination and guiding his charges out through a mobius door and holding on to them as they staggered this way and that gasping their amazement he sighed his relief that the coordinates had not misled him except of course he knew that it was more than mathematics which had guided him safely here then as if to confirm it nathan and this was one deadspeak voice which he would never forget the first such voice which had ever deigned to acknowledge him nathan you were absent gone away from us even out of the world then a moment ago you came back but far away on starside i cannot be mistaken for i sensed you there yet now you are here or is it that your telepathy has outstripped you if so then your instructors among the thyre should be congratulated that you have learned to project your mind with such clarity for i would swear that you are more than a mere thought it was the philosopher rogei a thyre ancient and this was his resting place and that of many another like him the cavern of the ancients one of the many mausoleums where the thyre entombed their most revered a great glowing cave buried deep in a desert gorge but a cave unlike any other overhead splitting the sandstone ceiling wall to wall like the slit pupil of a cats eye a slash of white quartz seemed carved from light the cave was cracked right across its width but the slow seep of centuries had filled the gap with crystals which had hardened to stone light still found a way in from somewhere overhead but to get here must pass through the quartz hence the hazy softly luminous glow stalactites of crystal festooned the ceiling and glowing dripstone mounds like candles of light reached up from the floor and all around the caves perimeter in alcoves and niches on shelves and ledges carved from the stone itself lay the ancients of the thyre in their last resting places slowly becoming one with the dust of ages while the three cavers got a grip on themselves as best they might the necroscope quickly crossed the floor to rogei in his niche finding him among all the others was no problem the ancients deadspeak led nathan directly to him and close up as nathan drew near rogei knew that indeed this was more than a mere thought you you really are here his deadspeak gasp of astonishment was as real as if nathan had heard it with his ears yes i really am but i cant stay not just now i will be back though if only to collect these friends of mine you have brought others here of your own kind but now rogei was frowning there was nothing else for it nathan told him i came at a time not of my choosing and even as we speak or if not now then very soon the wamphyri will be raiding on sunside ive got to help my people but i cant look after these others at the same time theyre simply not prepared for sunside i cant take them there not when the wamphyri are there and so i propose to leave them here for now you would help your people but how nathan showed him a variety of weapons showed him how they worked and their effect but all in his mind and they were a wonder to rogei who could scarcely believe their powers of devastation and at last he understood something of the places nathan had been to and the things he must have seen these weapons are not of sunside he said no and neither are they of starside and so if they are not of this world the helllands and he saw in nathans deadspeak mind that he was right that first time i was here nathan let his thoughts fly back in time you told me i was a necroscope well and so was my father before me i discovered his world his people their weapons the means by which to save my people now im back and ive brought those weapons with me for the first time the szgany can meet the wamphyri on their own terms with blood and fire rogei drew back from the pictures in nathans head which were a tumult for deadspeak often conveys more than is spoken or visualized which in nathans case meant all of the pent up hatreds of his young manhood i saw my tribe decimated and my home destroyed he growled it was a miracle that anyone survived a miracle called lardis our chief well now i have to see if he still survives and do what i can to even the score for a moment rogei was silent his empty eyesockets gazing blindly on nathan where he stood but then he said and is this the youth who came wandering into the desert to die only to find purpose in the cavern of the ancients the same youth nathan answered and the same purpose it has always been the same i suppose but i lacked the drive and the means life seemed hopeless even pointless i thought id lost everything i was wrong much had been saved and now at last ive found the means all thanks to you rogei tome you gave me a reason to live showed me the way through you i met shaeken and through him sought out ethloi the elder who knew numbers it was ethloi who told me that if one day i could find a way to control the numbers vortex and show it ordered in my mind as pictures upon a tapestry then that i might discover a key well he was right and i did discover it not in this world but in the hell lands but how would i ever have got there in the first place if not for thikkoul the astrologer who read my future in the stars and so you see it was you who set my feet upon the path should i be proud of it rogei sounded gloomy now you were proud of me upon a time still am indeed love you but with all of this blood and thunder in your heart what will be the end of it you seek to destroy the wamphyri you say but is that possible or have i found my lost son only to lose him again in a great and terrible bloodwar am i a son to you then it was an incredible honour i wish you could have been you felt like one when you were here and working among the thyre then you wont lose me nathan promised and hoped he could keep his word but before anything more could be said nathan the caver spokesman had stopped worrying about nathans penchant for talking to dead things someone is coming nathan knew where from the cavern of the ancients had an exit out on to a sheer cliff face with worn and crumbling sandstone steps descending into a gorge but there was also a tunnel that connected to a thyre community called placeundertheyellowcliffs out of great respect for their dead the thyre kept a discreet watch over their resting places this would be a guardian whose duty it was to attend the ancients in their mausoleum the cavers were hushed now nathan too as soft cautious footsteps sounded from an ascending shaft a moment later and a figure rose up into view female she blinked curious olive eyes with large lemongreen pupils but just inside the cavern she paused froze poised as if for flight she leaned forward on her toes lifted her chin and sniffed at the caverns musty air in her slender hands she carried a bow at the ready nocked with a long arrow she saw the three cavers saw nathan too only a moment after they had seen her she wore a red skirt and sandals nothing else her small breasts were loose pearshaped slightly pendulous her ears were large mouth and chin small nose wide and flattened with darkflaring nostrils alert she held herself trembling erect graceful her demeanour was somehow regal and she was young her youth showed in her large eyes shining there with a brilliant clarity under the horny ridges of her eyebrows also in the gleam of her limbs whose sheen was the natural product of thyre body oils brown as a nut but at the same time smooth like all her race she was slender to the point of emaciation atwei nathan recognized her at once and stepped forward her mouth fell open and she shook her head in disbelief at the same time he felt her probing his identity and knowing she was not mistaken she had known for some little time but had scarcely dared to believe now she took a trembling step towards him then paused and looked at the cavers friends he said at which she dropped her weapon and flew across the floor of the cavern of the ancients into his arms but in the next moment drew back and stood upright head down hands clasped in front of her and that was unseemly she said he took her into his arms again anyway and said little sister brother she answered which was as much a compliment as rogei calling him son but nathan had no time and she saw the turmoil of interests in his mind his people however were uppermost and she knew why outside in the open desert and in sunside and especially in starside it was sundown care for my friends here he told atwei releasing her and dont worry ill be back for them it seemed very little by way of explanation little enough to say after almost two years absence but explanations must wait meanwhile there were other matters which could not he chose weapons for himself conjured a mobius door then paused and looked at atwei again and sister he told her ive been to strange places and learned strange things dont be afraid because he willed it his words were deadspeak which rogei heard and to which he answered take care necroscope atwei knew nothing of that but in nathans mind she felt the rush and roar of the numbers vortex and was afraid despite his warning especially when he turned to one side stepped forward a pace and disappeared and reemerged on the boulder plains in the vicinity of the helllands gate and indeed it was as if all hell had been let loose the scene was fantastic a few minutes earlier there had been only the glaring hemisphere of white light the boulders ranging outwards across the gaunt wastelands and in a misted distance the toppled aeries of the wamphyri where karenstack or what had been karenstack stood tall and central among the stumps of the fallen stacks but now ben trask and david chung were each down on one knee aiming into the sky and hosing fire and steel at a circling wamphyri flyer and skimming towards the pair weaving from side to side as it avoided the jagged crests of rock jumbles and the jutting fangs of lone boulders a second manta flyer reached out its prehistoric neck and spatulate head and the pouch in its underside yawned open where the neck joined the body seated in ornate saddles at the bases of the flyers necks wamphyri lieutenants leaned forward and urged their mounts on having no knowledge of guns they heard the hellish chattering of the weapons but had no idea of their firepower so far they had been lucky despite the awesome size of their mounts neither the flyers nor their riders had yet taken a hit or it could be that the shooting had only just begun or that the aim of the gunmen was off or perhaps that the flyers had been hit but it hadnt registered nathan looked for anna marie she stepped out from behind a boulder and started firing the recoil of her weapon was such that it threw her backwards so that she stumbled and fell and the flyer swooping low over the boulder plains veered a little and headed straight for her in the moment after stepping out of his mobius door nathan had loaded his weapon now he called out anna marie to me she saw him and came stumbling in his direction and again the flyer veered from its course arching its wings and settling towards them where she tripped and fell against him forward of the corrugated belly its underslung pouch opened wider yet chung was still firing at the other creature where now it had stopped circling and was sideslipping this way and that like a flat stone sinking in water bearing its rider gently to earth but trask had seen anna marie and nathans danger and had turned his machinepistol on the beast and rider threatening them the flyer was hit in the leading edge of a wing and its tapering neck reared up and back as a neat line of holes stitched themselves into its rubbery grey flesh but still it came swerving between the last pair of boulders its airtrap wings actually brushing their domes as the beast closed with its wouldbe targets by now the rider knew there was something wrong he had heard the spattering impact of bullets felt the shuddering of his mount as it skewed this way and that and in his mind hed felt something of the brutes dull pain the damage to its vampire flesh but he wasnt wamphyri just a lieutenant with no real rapport with his mount if necessary he would drive the flyer to the limits of its endurance indeed he must for his lord and master gorvi the guile would require an accounting dripping fluids from its wounds the beast fell towards nathan and anna marie the saucer eyes in its hideously human head glared at them its pinklipped pouch was a yawning mantrap lined with cartilage hooks whose fetor they could smell and almost taste it was that close trask shouted something incoherent and blazed away until his magazine was empty and still the thing bore down on them nathan could see its riders eyes feral yellow and red in their cores with bloodlust the man knew he was going to drink red tonight take thralls for his master or meat for the manses provisioning and he laughed as he commanded his mount take them or knock them down at least nathan heard him his unsubtle telepathic command and so knew to counter the flyers reaction to it get down he shouted pushing anna marie aside and hurling himself in the other direction rolling in the dust the gaping pouch passed between them literally scooping at the dirt as the arches of manta wings passed over them with feet to spare then the great beast turned its head to look back as its diamond shape cleared them in so doing it presented nathan with a shot he couldnt resist he brought his crossbow to bear squeezed the trigger the rider lieutenant was also looking back he threw back his head and laughed as nathans bolt zipped under the arched wing and entered the flyers neck fifteen inches back from its head what a mere crossbow bolt and buried in all that muscle the sting of a stinkgnat to a creature huge and insensitive as a flyer and he at once yanked on the reins and turned his attention to trask and chung where they frantically reloaded none of this taking more than a second then there sounded a muffled explosion not a gunshot as nathans bolt exploded with force enough to fell a large pine the flyers neck blew apart in gristle cartilage grey flesh and red ruin and sent a spray of blood flying on the boulder plains completely severed from the neck the head commenced a crimsonspraying cartwheel to earth and as the neck collapsed downward and struck the stony ground so the blanketlike body jackknifed and rose up hurling the rider free behind him even as he flew almost three and a half tons of rubbery meat membrane and alveolate bone crashed down shuddering and raised a cloud of dust the beast had been a small one of its kind meanwhile the other flyer had settled to earth and its rider had dismounted he came at a run but ducking weaving aware now that the group of people on the boulder plains werent typical sunsiders behind a rocky outcrop he helped his fellow lieutenant to his feet the man was shaken but not seriously hurt metamorphic vampire flesh shrugged off minor cuts and bruises without regard but on high almost as high as an aerie itself and disguised amidst the clouds a third manta shape rode the night thermals and its rider was different again nor was he alone behind him mantle fluttering and propulsive orifices sputtering an aerial nightmare pulsed like a monster octopus against the stars a warrior accompanying gorvi the guile and his men on their way to sunside but gorvi was gorvi and having detected strangers on the boulder plains hed sent his lieutenants to investigate while he stood off now he heard the chatter of gunfire saw the flickering fire of the guns and sensed the shock and astonishment in the minds of his lieutenants gorvi knew something was very much amiss but the height was too great even for his vampire eyes to make out anything in detail so now he sent destroy all opposition take prisoners see to it then having made contact he at once received news from one of his men on the ground a series of frantic chaotic mindpictures which brought the entire thing into something of perspective a flyer had been downed crippled or dead his lieutenants faced human beings but not szgany there were men and one woman on the ground pale creatures who appeared weak but they were armed with incredible weapons even now gorvis men were under fire all sorts of ideas ranged through the guiles mind despite what his man had said gorvi suspected that this could only be a party of travellers on their way over the boulder plains to make a surprise attack on the last aerie they would know that at sundown wrathstack was empty of all but thralls and mindless guardian creatures with their new weapons they would attempt to destroy gorvis earthbound guardian warriors in the scree and rubble at the foot of the stack enter guilesump and poison his wells and so forth maybe they could break into madmanse and destroy the killglance twins gaslings in their chambers and so bring down the entire stack with a mighty explosion it had been done before as witness all the toppled aeries of the old wamphyri indeed in an age immemorial it had even been tried in turgosheim and yet only a handful of them no even with their superior weapons their task was impossible unless they were a suicide squad and gorvi wouldnt put that past the lidescis either or perhaps they had simply come to discover the lie of the land for some future invasion with the rest of the lords already raiding on sunside the way had been clear for a covert expeditionary force to make its way unseen over the boulder plains and so discover a safe route for later use it had long been a matter of some concern to gorvi that guilesump was open to attack from the bottoms he was brought rudely back from his musing by his mans urgent mindcall master what now and attack gorvi ordered at once send in my familiar bats to flush them out and your flyer to crush them what do you call yourself a lieutenant use your head man or lose it for all their weapons these people are only human odder so be about your work and never fear for i gorvi am coming and to his warrior down he sent down onto the plains deflate your bladders and descend prepare to create your most powerful exhaust stenches with which to sicken them ill violent homecoming who oppose me and mine and think on this when all is done there wijj be a reward aye for i shall feed you the very best of tidbits the ones that scream when you crunch them riderless using rocky outcrops and hillocks of stony debris to shield its bulk the flyer came skimming across the boulder plain it had only one purpose its vampire master dismounted now had sent only one telepathic command from where he went afoot among the scattered rocks fall on them a command that nathan had heard but trask and chung had taken refuge in a cluster of boulders close by it would be no easy thing to prise them out of there or to fall on them and their ability to fire out was unaffected their location was a natural vantage point nathan and anna marie however remained out in the open and so were an easy target and the flyer was headed for them anna marie saw the brute coming forming its wings into vast scoops deliberately stalling itself its intention could not be clearer panicked she made to hobble away nathan caught her arm and said no not that way he conjured a door pulled her in after him took her to a place he knew it was a flattopped bluff to one side of the mouth of the great pass with an easy scramble down to safety lardis lidesci had brought him here once to watch the sun rising on the last aerie and steadying her he said you should be safe here if all goes well ill come back for you if not well sunside lies beyond the pass it was as much as he had time for and then he went back for trask and chung frustrated the flyer was making a low hovering pass over the cluster of boulders where nathans colleagues were sheltering they cradled their weapons but were saving ammunition and waiting for further developments emerging from the mobius continuum close to the nest of boulders nathan yelled hold your fire but as he sprinted towards them he saw the two vampire lieutenants creeping up on their flank skidding to a halt and pointing nathan shouted on your right down in that hollow which was a moment before the lieutenants sprang into view and came loping zigzagging towards the clump of boulders then a shadow passed over nathan where he stood undecided and a second shadow and at the same time he heard a sound to fill his veins with ice water the sputtering throb of a wamphyri warriors biopropulsive vents and oh how he knew what that meant so that his mind and blood froze as he felt himself carried back back in time back to that night in settlement when wrathas raiders had left the town in ruins the night his brother nestor had been taken by the wamphyri when nathan had seen misha with canker canison and thought that she too had been stolen away into starside the night a warrior reduced nona kiklus house to rubble leaving her son to believe that his mother was nathan for christs sake trasks shouted warning snatched him out of it or back into it trasks shout and the obscene snarling of automatic weapons nathans eyes focused he saw the vampire lieutenants closing with the boulder clump saw them hurl themselves headlong in superhuman dives up over the protective rock barrier and saw them slam to a halt in midair even thrown backwards by the twin streams of smoking steel that slammed into them the two vampire lieutenants were out of it incapacitated if only for the moment but gorvis lesser familiars were not they came shrilling from the west no longer as mere trackers but more nearly as hounds harriers not in the least clumsy for their size the giant desmodus bats seemed like a horde as they wove this way and that while in fact there were only six of them at most yet such was their speed and erratic patterns of flight as individuals they presented nearimpossible targets nathan had reached the jumble of rocks where trask and chung had taken cover if he squeezed his way in with them it might well prove difficult to conjure a mobius door within the confines of their sanctuary no he must first get them out of there ben david he called to them out here to me out in the open and he worked frantically to reload his crossbow then as a pair of the bats swooped chattering on him he ducked down and glanced skywards and glimpsed what he had known must be up there just a glimpse for the thing was still high overhead and there was already more than enough happening on the ground to keep nathan occupied but the throb of propulsors was louder now and the first faint reminder of that nightmare stench from the past was falling like some vile rotting rain all about momentarily distracted at last nathan finished reloading then scanning the boulderstrewn landscape all around he saw a flyer coming in low the biggest so far and armoured and its rider vulturelike hunched forward in the saddle a weird scarecrow figure with eyes so deeply sunken under jutting black brows they were little more than a crimson glimmer angular and deathly corpselike in his figure and riding posture yet radiating power a devious strength it was perfectly obvious that this one was no mere lieutenant no indeed for he was a lord of vampires wamphyri it was the first time nathan had laid eyes on gorvi the guile one of the renegade lords who had fled turgosheim with wratha the risen nevertheless he knew him from a description hed had from maglore in runemanse the dome of his head kept shaven save for a single central lock with a knot hanging to the rear his sallow parchment features and shifty sunken eyes and hands jike skinny claws but full of a true lords strength and dressed in black head to toe always with his black cloak flapping like tattered wings oh yes gorvi the guile definitely braver now that their vampire master was here the great bats formed a cloud came shrilling in a flurry of thrumming wings nathans crossbow would be worse than useless wasted against them doubly frustrating their buffeting made it impossible to set his sights on the larger higher targets but the riderless flyer was also back appearing as from nowhere hovering into view over the tops of nearby boulders nathan kneeled took aim and the great bats at once struck against him knocking him offbalance as he sprawled so the rest of the flock fell towards him and ben trask seeing his chance as the bats crowded together opened up with his machinepistol three of the six literally exploded in midair torn into bloody fragments by the ferocity of trasks firepower and the rest of them scattered in disarray shrilling their alarm as they swerved left and right and made off into the maze of leaning rocks why do you wait nathan heard gorvis furious mindshout which the vampire lord directed at the riderless flyer finish it settle on them smother them with your bulk and drive your thrusters down between the rocks to crush them the thing came arching its wings gentling to earth and between the segments of its underbelly rubbery landing appendages uncoiling like quivering nests of sentient worms nathan knew he couldnt miss he simply raised his gunhand aimed at the juncture of neck and body above the slit of the pouch and squeezed the trigger and as the flyer came drifting towards the clump of boulders so the bolt flew home nathan turned his face away it seemed a long time perhaps the detonator was faulty the bolt a dud but then a dull crump as if a boulder had toppled and fallen to earth nathan looked not six feet away the flyers huge but patently human face at the end of its tenfoot neck gazed at him in vast amaze a sort of vacant astonishment in the moment before it twisted into an agonized mask threshed left and right opened its jaws and emitted an earpiercing shriek then the creatures membranous airscoop wings pounded at the air as if to bear it up up away from its pain which was inescapable the thing skewed wildly to the left tilted allowed nathan to see close up the damage his explosive bolt had done the gaping hole that rained pink fluids where the flyers head and neck had been halfsevered from the body there was scarcely enough muscle left to hold the head erect and nothing at all of strength or will the beating of the wings slowed to a quiver as the beast commenced a staggering stalling glide a tilting wingtip got snagged between tall boulders turning the flyer like a pivot its grotesque head sank down touched crumbling earth dug in and ploughed a furrow the long neck concertinaed buckled at the point of injury and snapped with a soft cartilage crack dust rose in a cloud as the manta wings flopped uselessly and the carcass slewed to a shuddering halt nathan looked at the weapon in his hand and felt awesomely powerful he tightened his grip on it shook it in the air and shouted his triumph through bared teeth his elation was shortlived however warrior stench thickened in a moment and again a monstrously pulsing shadow blotted out the stars in its passing trask and chung emerged from their nest of boulders nathan saw the looks on their faces as they crouched down shrank back stared slackjawed above and behind him he spun on his heel and saw his worst nightmare throbbing obscenely in midair a wamphyri warrior with its airtrap mantle fluttering and its gasbladders fully inflated the warriors sputtering biopropulsors emitted clouds of stenchvapour as it turned and came pulsing and rumbling over the barren boulder plains like the two downed flyers this monster was small of its kind but despite that it flew it was not a flyer as such in its delirious design it was not dissimilar to sunsides small lakedwelling harmless freshwater octopuses its body sack was rather more elongated and its tentacles more properly launching thrusters than appendages for walking or groping for shrimp prey in the pebbles of a pool but its principal dissimilarity lay in the eyes their shrieking madness their malign intent their number and in its size for even a small warrior is not small nathan recognized his error one of comparison distance had fooled him causing him to compare this thing with a creature of nature distance and perspective for the warrior was all of a hundred and fifty yards away at which distance the idea of it was still acceptable barely and given that the safety margin was narrowing even now for a little while at least a man might retain sufficient composure to think of such a thing in terms of other animals but as it pulsed closer there was no real comparison that a thing like this could lift its massive bulk even an inch from the earth let alone fly seemed patently impossible yet here it spurted against the starspattered horizon like an alien aerial slug just looking at it details were branded on nathans feverish mind of greymottled flesh with fishscale armour gleaming metallicblue in starshine of gasbladder clusters bulging like strange wattles or nests of morbid tumors from both sides of the segmented flexible spine constantly shrinking and expanding regulating the monsters balance of cartilage hooks and sawing appendages and chitin grapples in the shape of crab claws but over and above everything else the evil pseudointelligence of its swivelling searching saucer eyes and their placement in the sloping prow of the skull the softer membrane of the undermantle and flanking the propulsors in the anal region where a spiked tail flailed like a mace and acted as a rudder it was only fifty yards away now and it had spotted the three men propulsors blasting the warrior lowered its head and zeroed in on them crush them let their pulp stain those boulders crimson gorvis mindcry galvanized nathan to activity jerking to his feet he glanced at his crossbow knew there was no time to reload then ben trask grabbed his elbow and nathan jumped six inches in the air for christs sake trask yelled over the rumble of the warriors propulsors nathan get us out of here and to one side david chung gasped god i just dont believe it gorvis lieutenants their leatherclad bodies holed and both of them leaking red from a dozen wounds had appeared from behind the clump of boulders staggering but yet advancing on the three trask on the other hand had seen vampires closeup before and he believed it well enough while overhead leaning forward in the ornate saddle of his flyer gorvi himself stabbed a trembling outraged claw of a hand at the three and commanded his warrior now crush them now aye and those idiot weakhng thrajjs of mine with them chung was quick to get a grip of himself even as nathan conjured a mobius door the chinaman turned his machinepistol on gorvis lieutenants at pointblank range he literally tore them apart his spray of bullets punched crimson laceholes in their leather armour across and back up and down they were swatted like flies knocked flat on their backs on the stony ground and trask opened up on the warrior less than twentyfive yards away the thing had opened its jaws inside it wasnt so much a mouth as a cave of daggers trask was shaken but held his aim directly into that gaping maw and slimedripping teeth flew in shards as steel met bone in shattering collision none of which deflected the warrior from its course by an inch nathan had his door holding it steady he grabbed trasks arm chungs too but the warrior was almost upon them grunting its challenge and intent on ramming them against the clump of boulders it came head on trask snarled his fear aimed at the foremost cluster of gasbladders let fly with a final spray of bullets and as bladders exploded like grenades and the thing screamed swerved and turned the armoured mass of its flank to the fore so nathan yanked on his colleagues arms and dragged them offbalance into the mobius continuum in the void of the continuum trask panted his relief as he fingered his torn jacket and knew that the sleeve had been ripped off on one of the warriors scales gorvis warrior sprawled for the moment winded in the lee of the boulders scales had been wrenched loose several eyes and launching limbs crushed and more bladders burst in the collision with the rocks the nightmare beasts airtrap mantle was holed in several places along its left flank but not so badly it wouldnt mend first however it must rest feed fashion fresh bladders from its metamorphic flesh that is if its master desired it should ever fly again gorvi had landed furious the vampire lord approached and examined the space between his construct and the boulders where he hoped to find the crushed remains of his dead foes whatever they had been and yet that space was empty well not quite empty for the bodies of his thralls were there at least all crumpled broken and dead or undead for even now they were not completely beyond repair if gorvi so desired it except he did not desire it not for this pair of unworthy dogs as well that hed sent the best and longest lasting of his lieutenants ahead of him into sunside to fight alongside wratha and the others else it might just as easily be turgis gorvisman lying here all full of holes and his blood leaked out on the other hand well he was a one to look out for that turgis gorvi coujd have left him in charge of guilesump except by now hed probably have been at it with one or another of gorvis females or several of them huh a man couldnt trust anyone these days but the strange and sudden absence of these alien interlopers or their corpses at least was a puzzle gorvi had seen them here he was sure he had seen his warrior crash into them as for their awesome weapons why for all he knew they could be trained on him even now he at once crouched down sent a cautious vampire probe into the maze of boulders their aura their scent would soon give these humans away if theyd somehow managed to wriggle back in there the warm salty scent of untainted blood but no they werent there only an oily smell now and a trace of their human breath hanging sweet on the still air and lingering smells of cloth and hot steel too from their clothing and their weapons alien smells all but nothing of the flesh and blood people who had made them gorvi snarled his frustration cursed his misfortune to have lost two flyers a pair of lieutenants a warrior damaged and depleted well at least the last might still be salvaged and so feed he commanded the beast the monsters permanent prow eyes immediately swivelled in gorvis direction blank black disks which should scarcely be capable of reasoning intelligence as such more properly receptors for the tiny brute mind within they yet displayed all the evil of a warped mutant sentience a deviousness whose source lay in gorvi himself the warrior was after all his construct and therefore imbued with the guiles essence feed he could sense the beasts querying hesitation its dull apprehension but surely these are yours master gorvi snorted nodded his skulllike head they were mine aye but now i give them to you so feed and grow strong take these thralls of mine but leave the flyers where they are let them rot here do not glut but fuel and repair yourself then when you are fit for it make your way back to guilesump the warriors launching limbs surged into motion turning it about the saucer eyes in its great armoured head focused as one on the gutted lieutenants powerful jaws gaped and saliva slopped from leathery lips as a forked tongue thick as a mans thigh tasted then snatched first one shattered body and then the other as a chameleon takes flies so the guiles battleconstruct took the dead lieutenants and if gorvis promise of a few minutes ago had ever registered at all it was now forgotten wiped out obliterated from the monsters onetrack mind in the brief but passionate rapture of its feedingfrenzy for these tidbits neither screamed nor made any sound at all when they were crunched but their flesh was soft and succulent for all that while his construct refuelled itself the guile returned thoughtfully to his nodding flyer climbed into the saddle and urged the beast aloft so far the night was a disaster first in guilesump there had been several unforeseen administrative tasks morbid fluids to draw off from a stillborn warrior lest the thing go rancid in its vat quarrelsome thralls to cow an illtempered woman to chastise but hed felt uneasy about tonights mass raid right from the start what to join up with nestor and canker both of whom hated him wratha who despised him and the killglance twins who were mad on this less than predictable soiree against the resourceful lidescis it had been indeed more than a feeling of uneasiness rather an aura of foreboding a doomladen atmosphere hanging over wrathstack itself ever since the socalled lady had broached the thing this onslaught against the szgany lidesci or perhaps it was simply that dwelling in the stacks basement as it were in guilesump level with the scree jumbles and so open to attack from the ground gorvi had come to feel more and more vulnerable whichever tonight hed held back determined to be last into the field of battle huh much good it had done him for now this and perhaps this too was an omen a warning that he was as well out of it and certainly he was out of it for there was no way he would join in any grand battle without a strong force of lieutenants thralls and warriors about him not for the sake of the battle itself at least oh let the others seek glory all they would gorvi could do without battlescars what cowardice no never for he was wamphyri but he was also the guile and he well deserved his name wherefore he would watch the others a while and see which way it went and however it went at the end of the night gorvi would have his own tale to tell of how he had quashed a sneak attack on the last aerie while canker and nestor and the rest were rutting counting coup and glutting themselves on sunside booty and aye this way hed yet be a hero in his own right sunside he ordered his flyer as it gained height cross the dome of the helllands gate climb on the wind off the icelands and follow the foothills west then up into the western peaks and through them and down on to sunsides flank there well land in the foothills and see what we shall see from their vantage point on the flattopped bluff in the mouth of the great pass nathan trask chung and anna marie all four of them together had watched gorvis takeoff and had seen him set his course west down on the boulder plains however his damaged warrior was still very much in evidence its roaring and grunting echoed up to them and puffs of exhaust gases rose like vile smoke rings from its venting the four couldnt know it but the bodies of the vampire lords lieutenants were even now undergoing a process of digestion their leather gear and all but they had merely whetted the warriors appetite and his attention was now centered upon the vastly sprawled corpses of the flyers both were as dead as undead vampire things can be despite that they had that in their blood which would keep them alive for a long time yet but since a good deal of that blood had been spilled the flyers were dead to all intents and purposes depleted dead and deserted but the warrior was mindful of gorvis last command that it must not glut itself and dared not disobey it the creature felt very little of and understood even less about physical pain but even as an infant or unformed thing still waxing in the morbid fluids of its vat womb it had felt the sting of its masters corrective minddarts and knew how he could bring all of its functions to a shuddering cringing halt with just a single stab so the flyers were out of the question and meanwhile the warrior had clear instructions which it must follow as a t duty to gorvi the guile its master and to guilesump his manse to rest a while replenish its gasbladders and propulsive system and let its metamorphism seal the holes in its membranous aerial mantle then to fly back to the last aerie and its pen in the stem of the stack and since sleep is the best way of conserving energy and the greatest aid to any healing process for vampire flesh no less than human the monster closed its eyes slowed its metabolism shut down the bulk of its sensory apparatus and slept only two scanners remained active and then barely a pseudoeye in the things blunt prow skull and another at the base of a spine in its flaillike rudder linked to the rudimentary brain these would keep watch any abrupt or inexplicable change in the warriors immediate surroundings and it would come snarling awake nathan knew that much at least for hed learned a lot about wamphyri warriors and guardian creatures in turgosheim and now atop the bluff he asked trask and chung i take it you left the weapons hidden away in those boulders the two men glanced at each other could only shrug and trask said we couldnt go on the offensive and look after the weapons survival had to come first nathan the others nod i understand of course but until that warrior heals itself and moves off which could easily take as long as the rest of this sundown or three days earthtime i darent go back for the guns so we have to make do with what weve got but our friends the cavers took their loads with them chung pointed out er wherever you took them i mean again nathans nod right but before i can go back for them i have to carry you to safety in sunside or what should be safety except well its night now and so i have one or two things to check out before i can move you it shouldnt take too long but until im done you must keep a low profile and wait for me here he conjured a mobius door stepped through it and disappeared and reappeared in the cavern of the ancients atwei and the three cavers were still there also a young thyre male and so were the sacks of arms which the cavers had brought with them nathan had no time for explanations atwei stay here with my friends he told her in her own tongue and taking up one of the bundles he was gone again to the bald rounded plateau of sanctuary rock where that landmark refuge backed up on sunsides foothills at the edge of the forest to the west of ruined settlement nathan had chosen the rock because its dome was a vantage point from which he should be able to spy out the lie of the land east and west along the flank of the barrier mountains the region which hed once called home and travelling there through the mobius continuum he had remembered it as he had known it all his young life the dome of the rock towered more than two hundred feet over the slope of a stony hill it was like a huge oval boulder toppled over on its side halfburied in a hillside that climbed through pines and birches and bramble and blackthorn undergrowth above the rock the green belt was narrow shaded and gloomy where it wound with the contours of the foothills rising steeply across its width its foliage grew sparse at the feet of frowning cliffs below the patchy woods descended into a thinly swirling mist levelled out and thickened into forest proper finally faded with distance into a greygreen fuzz of softedged canopy and the gently mobile concentric contours of false misted horizons as to why the place was called sanctuary rock in the olden times indeed since time immemorial the szgany had hidden from starsides vampires in the roots of the rock hidden in the guts of the boulder which was mainly solid in its body and dome but hollow as a rotten tooth in its base and now the szgany lidesci not only hid there but lived there too they also lived in settlement which was no great distance away but at night invariably withdrew to the safety of the rock over the years the lidescis had burrowed extensively to make the place more nearly inhabitable and they had opened up a maze of passages granaries animal pens private habitations for family units storage facilities even recreational areas they had tunnelled their way from a huge overhung entrance and various connected cavern systems under the eastern rim of the rock right through to the rear and the far side also theyd strategically mined all of the major entrances with barrels of crude but effective gunpowder so that the rock was now a sanctuary makeshift encampment lethal trap and escape route all in one as for the rocks location for fifteen to twenty miles around this was lidesci territory which lardis lidesci had always guarded jealously and protected with his life especially against the night raids of the vampire lords of starside and it was the necroscopes guess that if tonight the wamphyri could be found anywhere on sunside then that but in the moment that nathan emerged from the mobius continuum he knew that there was no if about it for they were here even now they were actually here at sanctuary rock far to the south across the sprawling expanse of nightdark woods and the furnace desert which lay beyond a curved horizon was silhouetted against a band of molten yellow light fading upwards into pink and amethyst then light and darkblue finally black reaching back to the sky overhead where the stars were as shards of blue ice frozen in alien configurations or at least the sky should be black but it should not be shot through with lances of coloured light and dotted with nightmare shapes that sputtered explosively or glided silently through the black smoke rising from oily fires and the exhaust trails of careening rockets sanctuary rock was suffering a concerted attack and following the silence and darkness of the mobius continuum it was as if nathan had stepped forth into hell itself down there on the sparsely wooded slopes at the foot of the rock close too close to the gaping entrance to the main cavern system there were warriors on the ground one of them the biggest one seemed crippled it was burning roaring and hissing like a herd of rutting shads and heaving its forequarters this way and that on an apparently broken spine its hindquarters were writhing a mass of flames where travellers had poured oil on the thing and fired it but there were lesser warriors too smaller less cumbersome undamaged as yet and very very dangerous and enraged of course even as nathan watched one of the things rose up on its forward thrusting limbs and fired a short burst from its propulsors seeming to bound in the air it crashed down among a group of the rocks defenders crushed several of them to the earth commenced snapping at the rest its chitin clubs pincers and slabbers wove menacingly in all directions nathan also saw flyers down there on the ground half a dozen of them at least but they were all positioned well back from the forward edge of the battle area ideally situated for relaunching facing downhill on the narrow trails leading to the rock they waited for further instructions their masters lieutenants and senior thralls had dismounted and went afoot like infantrymen shadowing and directing the battleengines which were the warriors other flyers and warriors were in the air probably less than two dozen of them in all but seeming to nathan to swarm in their hundreds they were not quite the height of the dome of the rock so that in fact he looked down on them silhouetted against firelight and the flaring multicoloured trails of rockets only a handful of the warriors were big ones but the smaller variety was versatile and full of a terrible vitality nathan saw two of them go spiralling down propulsors sputtering thrusters uncoiling to land near the base of the rock on its western approaches well theyd achieve very little there uninhabitable and therefore undefended on that flank the rock was solid and its face sheer it sank straight into the stony ground on the other hand it wouldnt take long for the warriors to get airborne again and turn their monstrous energies to the eastern flank while overhead maybe two hundred and fifty feet over the dome of the rock and six hundred above the forest circling like vultures over some soontobe corpse the wamphyri generals themselves rode the night air blotted out the stars in their wheeling and gazed down through red and rapacious eyes on the efforts of their army there were five of them mounted on armoured flyers and five firstlieutenants in attendance on lesser beasts aware of their presence from the moment he vacated the mobius continuum nathan had automatically taken cover in a clump of gorse growing in the scant soil of a deeply scarred depression now having appraised himself of the situation he looked skyward again to see what the lords were up to and none too soon for they were spiralling down towards the dome of the rock approaching the flat central area of its plateau as they prepared to land this was to be their command position from which theyd manoeuvre their men and monsters on the ground the entire scene had been stunning to nathans senses from the very first moment the roaring of beasts and screams of men carried up from below on air warmed by fear fire and fighting the shrill whistle or occasional shriek of unreliable missiles and the deafening blasts of sound and blinding explosions when they burst against vampire flesh or more frequently empty air the stench of sulphur and of warrior exhaust gases drifting in poisonous grey and yellow clouds through the night and the mindsearing sight of nightmare shapes throbbing or undulating in the starspattered sky but over and above everything else the knowledge that they were his people down there fighting and dying for the rock and for human existence itself stunning to nathans senses yes but the vampire lords would soon be landing for long moments frozen at last nathan was galvanized into frantic activity shaking out some of the arms from his bundle he saw what hed got there fragmentation grenades a mm twin rocketlauncher fully loaded a lightweight flamethrower and a machinepistol and ammo he yanked the rocketlauncher free stuffed grenades into his pockets crammed what he could of the rest of the stuff back into the bundle and shoved it deep into the roots of the gorse the first flyer was coming in for a landing it was one of the lesser beasts commanded by a lieutenant nathan stood up and came head and shoulders above the gorse hed gone entirely unnoticed so far but for some little time had been shielding his mind while intercepting the telepathic messages of the wamphyri lords and those of one lady their leader safety down on this great boulder well see so much more clearly she was saying but it seems to me our forces on the ground are already costing the lidescis dear and pushing them back into their holes by the time we send down another three or four warriors well have them in full rout after that if we can only get a beast inside the rock she left the rest of it unthought the lady wrathas great mount was coming in immediately behind her lieutenants lesser beast the rest of the wamphyri lords followed on behind descending in a loose v formation but next in line after wratha the risen was one whose thoughts grew more anxious and confused moment to moment who now sent her this urgent message wratha back off dont land theres someone there an enemy even a great enemy aye and hes dangerous recognizing that telepathic voice at once nathan thrilled with a variety of emotions not least horror for its owner was his twin brother lord nestor of the wamphyri iv nestor for something less than an hour now lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri had known it the fact that his mainly unremembered brother was back in sunsidestarside in precisely the same moment that maglore of runemanse had known it and the mummied monstrous eygor killglance in his refuse pit and the dead and dreaming thyre and nathans nephew wolves so too had nestor known it and just as surely as the rest except and paradoxically nestor had found it harder to credit for he had believed that he was his brothers murderer indeed he had known that nathan was gone forever banished from this vampire world into the starside gate from which neither man monster nor any creature of nature or the vats had ever yet returned it must be so for all of seventeen even eighteen sunups ago nestors firstlieutenant zahar lichloathe had reported the fact of it that acting on nestors orders hed tossed nathan into the gate and sent him to hell since when and until this very night nestor had been certain of it for with his brothers departure one other curse at least had been lifted like a yoke from his shoulders which now was back the numbers vortex that cryptic madly whirling dustdevil device of symbols figures and cyphers which bursting out from the core of his twins weird mind had often overflowed into nestors dreams too nathans mindshield wherein as a child he had used to hide himself away now revealed him as a light in the night or as the smell of traveller campfires floating on the breeze off sunside reveals a campsite or the frenzied buzzing of carrion flies a piece of rotting meat nestor had first sensed the thing as he and the others crossed the spine of the barrier mountains midway between the great pass and settlement but behind him its source had been behind him in starside in the vicinity of the starside gate now what would a man of sunside be doing there and what would a dead man be doing anywhere but then as they had descended into sunsides foothills so the mountains had blocked it out a little and supposing it to have been a rogue memory out of times best forgotten he had tried his best to do the same shut it out of his thoughts but as the massed might of wrathstack spurted and pulsed west like a flock of shadows against the greater shadow of the mountains so the thing had been there again swirling in nestors vampire mind and stronger than ever before for where in past times the vortex had been disordered chaotic insensible now it had direction and was purposeful and yet if his great enemy was in fact alive then what was happening here for first nestor had sensed him close to the helllands gate and now far to the south in the desert beyond the forests and savanna it made no sense no man can be in two places at once then nestor had felt an urgent need to reprimand or at least to question his man zahar and had called him up alongside the better to speak to him and riding the night a little apart from the main force without so much as glancing at his great grim lieutenant nestor had inquired of him in his softest voice zahar are you faithful to you master always zahar spoke the words out loud knowing that nestor would hear them despite the winds bluster but for all that he had answered in the affirmative still hed been concerned what was nestors purpose hed wondered asking such a question at a time and in a place such as this then the necromancer had looked at him a frowning even disapproving glance across the gulf of air and shuttering his scarlet eyes somewhat but have you never disobeyed me the other had given his head a fervent shake nor shall i ever lord for a moment nestor had held his gaze eye to eye in the night across the squalling updrafts scarlet to feral yellow and hed known that his lieutenant spoke the truth for zahar lichloathe feared his masters art and the pain it could bring not only in this world but also in the next not even the dead were safe from one such as he a necromancer who tortured them for their secrets causing them pain in their dead flesh as if it were alive but in the course of the last four to five months zahar had learned to fear him even more when such a change was apparent in him that by comparison zahars previous master vasagi the suck had seemed a friendly even a merry creature gazing at nestor however briefly staring at him where he sat forward in the saddle and leaned a little into the wind this is what zahar saw a man changed immensely two and a half years ago he had been a sixfooter and now was almost seven hed been tanned by the sun and was now pallored by the night and by his condition for his flesh had taken on the leaden look of undeath his szgany eyes had been dark naturally but not for long a day at most the change that shapes had taken him that fast wamphyri aye hed been a natural and eyes red as fire and yet perhaps not as natural as might at first be imagined for he covered his leaden flesh as if ashamed of it swathing himself in black head to toe so that his eyes burned out over a mask of black cloth shame or denial whichever but even as a lord freshly ascended through all the pain frustration and uncertainty of his vampire metamorphosis still nestor had retained something of his sunside heritage and for a while for all that hed become more and more wamphyri still he had been the man sufficient that when he went hunting in sunside one night with the doglord canker canison hed come back with a sweetheart out of earlier times the girl glina who had loved him ah but that had been the last of his humanity for where now were glina and the child she brought with her out of sunside zahar knew well enough for he had been witness and more than witness the child was dead all burst into tatters from the force of his descent on to the rocks at the foot of wrathstack and glina burned by the sun and likewise fallen from on high her body walled up with stones in a crevice west of the great pass all of which by nestors command if not his hand and the change still taking place in him all of this running concurrent with his affair with wratha the risen during which his step had seemed lighter his spirit uplifted but their love had been as false as wratha herself was false or as nestor was false in any case it had not lasted for by then he had discovered his necromancy that he could speak with dead men and torture them for their secrets and when that had become known to him his change had taken a new direction it was a darker nestor who stalked the night and moved like a ghost through the mazy ways of suckscar oh they saw each other from time to time even now nestor and wratha and went to each other in their beds for they were wamphyri and had their needs but the first allegiance of a vampire lord is to himself he seeks security provides for his longevity this was no time for lovers when winds of war were blowing out of the east from beyond the great red waste there was szgany blood to be spilled undead armies to build aye and soon there would be powerful invaders to be killed that was the way of things crush or be crushed so the delights of dalliance were put aside and now the blackdraped creature who rode the night wind alongside zahar had precious little of the man in him but a great deal of the vampire more than that however there was something which zahar couldnt fathom an unspeakable terror but some morbid fear perhaps gnawing at his masters necromantic mind zahars glance was too bold likewise his thoughts however much he would shield them dangerously bold aye he knew it and looked away forced his mind to opaque meaningless meanderings that way was the safest reading most of zahars thoughts anyway nestor had known that his man would never dare lie to him but to be sure zahar he said now listen that night when i crashed on sunside and you thought that was lost forever you captured him my great enemy and told me how he awakened in the moment that you tossed him into the gate but are you sure absolutely sure that he disappeared into the gate yes master and hastily but all in accordance with your orders and of course nestor had nodded in a little while of course but after zahar had fallen back in line again that disturbance of psyche that thrill of awareness that recognition of the vortex it was here he nathan was here it came and went a surge from far across the forest to the southeast then nothing as if a candle had been lit however briefly then snuffed and at once a second flareup but fainter from across the mountains in starside so that nestor had wondered one great enemy or should that be two or three or was it all in his head and then he had wondered was that it was his mind going as well as his body for nathan and his numbers vortex werent the only curse on nestor lichloathe and the thing in his body struck far more terror than any imagined condition of his mind ah yes for unlike the questionable nature of the latter the thing in his body was indisputably real yet both curses had the same source a night of illomen some eighteen sundowns gone when he and zahar went ahunting in sunside hunting for his great enemy nathan and for a treacherous lidesci bitch called misha then as the wamphyri lords and their aerial army headed for sanctuary rock so nestors mind drifted back in time recalling all the terrors of that night but scarcely wishing to remember all the fearful times passed between the doglord canker canison who from time to time read the future in dreams had warned nestor not to go but the necromancer would have none of it his great enemy was in sunside and nestor intended to have it out with him canker had been right and the raid was a disaster nestors flyer was crippled half of its face shot away its small brain seriously damaged nestor too was badly wounded halfblinded by silver shot from a lidesci shotgun only sheer wamphyri tenacity and willpower had kept him in the saddle as his dying beast glided south losing height over the forest then the crash unconsciousness a slow awakening some pain best ignored the wamphyri turn pain aside mainly they suffer in silence while their parasites see to the mending but the place of awakening a leper colony leprosy great bane of vampires nestor had fled before the fear and loathing of it and also before the killing rays of the rising sun deep into the forest to a cave in the bank of a river where hed slept and dreamed fever dreams through the long sunside day and while he moaned and nightmared so his leech had commenced a healing metamorphism deep within his damaged flesh with the night hed crossed into starside and there in the barrier mountains had been met by his man zahar and canker canison apparently none the worse for wear but saying nothing at all of how hed survived the previous day and night lord nestor had returned to suckscar his manse in the last great aerie of the wamphyri following which he scarcely desired to remember what had come after that not here and now with so many keen wamphyri minds around him it could well be that hed remembered too much already but he doubted it the minds of the others were intent upon what was to be not what might have been but zahar lichloathe flying in line somewhat to the rear of his master remembered that time just as well as nestor he guarded his thoughts as best he could be sure but he remembered all the same in suckscar the necromancer lord lichloathe had very quickly fallen into something of a routine but one known only to himself at first and strange for a lord of the wamphyri perhaps even morbidly so zahar remembered the background details penultimate of the stacks great manses situated beneath wrathspire which was the very tip and towered more than half a mile over the rubble and scree suckscar had been a dingy doomfraught place before vasagis demise and nestors ascension even by wamphyri standards it had been doleful with an aura all its own or the sucks a cold one entirely unfathomable except by his peers and often by them too vasagi had been a monster among monsters the victim of a hereditary bone disease when a surge of growth in his jaws and teeth had threatened to outstrip the metamorphic flesh of his face then hed simply extruded them which is to say hed stripped his upper jaw of teeth unhinged the lower jaw withdrawn all flesh from the offending bones and so been rid of them and in their place hed shaped his face to a tapering pink tentacle tipped with a flexible needle siphon not unlike the proboscis of a bee this was a weapon hed used with remarkable dexterity and in a variety of ways sliding it into the finest vein to draw off blood or through an eardrum or eye deep into the whorl of a brain to vampirize instruct cripple or kill speechless because of his selfinflicted deformity the suck had become a master of mime but he was also a mentalist second to none so that between gestures and telepathy he was always understood when he wanted to be keeping mainly to himself and to his manse however vasagi had little use for speech of any sort but preferred his privacy similarly he had seemed to prefer austerity when nestor had ascended to suckscar after wran the rage killed vasagi in a sunside duel hed been dismayed at the lack of lighting heating the inadequate water supply and the sparsity of facilities in general the fixtures were all in place but mainly turned off or stopped up for vasagi had not availed himself of these common utilities likewise the lives of his thralls be they fledgling vampires or lieutenants alike austere and because vasagi was dumb they too were quiet sparing of speech cowed where they crept through suckscar and while its a fact that all vampire thralls fear their masters vasagi the sucks feared him more for with his alien features crimson eyes weird snout and stabbing siphon he looked far more an insect than a man in the days before their sunside duel wran the rage had often taunted vasagi that he only ever mounted his odalisks from the rear because they could not bear to look him in the face well and theyd bear it even less after the duel for in an act as merciless as it was monstrous wran had severed vasagis proboscis leaving him only a redspurting sleeve for a face except of course the vampire women of suckscar would never see that awful sight for this was a fight to the death or rather it should have been in any case wran had left the suck broken and bloody pegged out on the slope of a southfacing foothill left him there in the twilight in the dawn mists of sunside to await the rising sun and an agonizing death since when and to date no one in the last aerie had seen or heard of him there again neither was he missed except perhaps by the lady wratha who had counted him an ally but in suckscar vasagis aura had lingered on his people continued to be morose alienated and sparing both of speech and the utilities for a while at least until they were used to nestor then the young lord lichloathe had changed all that he was no cold creature but a man out of sunside and his likes and lusts more nearly a mans the vampire lord vasagi the suck when hed taken a woman had fucked and feasted at the same time penetrating not only with his member but also his siphon in breast throat or root of tongue while bedding with him had been a very painful affair with nestor it should be a pleasure since he was mainly innocent of women vasagis odalisks had instructed him in their various ways and nestor had been an avid pupil until soon enough with the assistance of the szgany girl glina berea he in turn instructed them as for suckscar nestor turned on the water which drawn up from gorvis wells was processed by wrathas siphoneers in wrathspire he had the gas inlets cleaned and refurbished as required drawing off his share of gas from the methane chambers of madmanse to give suckscar additional light and warmth and despite that it might be considered a luxury not a necessity he even saw to the few requirements of his thralls so that their lives too were not entirely lacking in comforts but in turn he demanded obedience absolute from thralls and lieutenants alike with harsh and occasionally fatal penalties for any who failed him and because nestors word was law and his law was strict they did not fail him and everything in suckscar was his his people and creatures even vasagis warriors still waxing in their vats were now nestors to do with as he desired it had been a period of adjustment in suckscar and for lord lichloathes thralls in large part one of contentment but in any case the basic needs of their existence were much improved in the beginning at least until nestor had discovered his necromancy and especially later following that night when he and zahar had gone ahunting together across the barrier mountains in sunside since when things had deteriorated not so much in the maintenance or morale of suckscar itself but more properly in its lord and master his moods had grown changeable as the winds and his thralls had commenced to go quietly again as in the days of vasagi it was as zahar had been quick to note as if a morbid spell was upon him or a morbid dread within once hurrying to nestors private rooms with a message from the necromancers friend and neighbour in mangemanse the doglord canker canison zahar had discovered his master naked bathing and apparently engaged in a most minute examination of his person the skin of his forearms and thighs so engrossed was he that for a while zahars presence had gone unnoticed but when it was then nestor had been furious what and did his most trusted lieutenant now spy on him in the privacy of his own apartments well then from now on these rooms were forbidden to him and all others nor would zahar enter with any message unless nestor first called for him moreover there would be no more telepathic communication between the two unless nestor himself initiated it and should zahar ever feel the need to encroach upon nestors mind unbidden in however small a degree let him first discover the secrets of flight for he would surely find himself hurled from one of suckscars windows zahar had never seen him so wroth but he was aware that the replenishment of fuel for the lords firehole was an ongoing task so much so that a thrall was employed to that end only carrying szgany charcoal to nestors bathroom and he did know that nestor drew off a deal of water from the catchment sluices so as to leave siphoned water free for the use of the manse generally it could only be that nestor bathed himself frequently very frequently but to what end a man can only be so clean after all or perhaps he cleaned more than his body perhaps he would also cleanse his soul but of what deeds performed which even a hardened lieutenant might find unwholesome for nestor was a necromancer and zahar had used to think surety the terrors and torments of life are sufficient without that men shoujd be tortured in death too which were of course thoughts that he kept to himself as best he might or was it that nestor cleansed himself of innocent blood if so then he must be the first lord of the wamphyri to admit his guilt aye for the others revelled in it ah but theres guilt and theres guilt and zahar remembered the woman glina and her bairn except that was another thought best kept to himself then there was the matter of nestors needs he had only ever stinted himself in respect of his women when he was going to wratha on a regular basis for he would save his energy for her before their affaire however and in the period of gradually declining passion which had followed it nestor had not gone short despite that vasagi had been no great beauty himself hed had an eye for goodlooking girls and had taken his fair share out of sunside along with the sucks leech nestor had inherited them and tried them all indeed hed tried one of them one of the first too far and depleted her even unto death or undeath then lest she rise up from her fatal sleep wamphyri an unwanted lady even a mistress in nestors manse zahar had advised that she be carried into the barrier mountains pegged out to await the sunrise and so destroyed and his master had agreed so no lack of women to warm nestors bed neither before nor after his grand romance with wratha yet ever since returning from sunside on foot following that hunting trip he seemed to have lost all interest in suckscars females or if not all then most and his appetite nestor had never much cared for it red when must needs then hed have it but lightlycooked meats generally sufficed except when he did take it live then he would ensure that the donor died immediately afterwards not undeath but the true death that the corpse was cleansed flensed and the flesh roasted before it went to the provisioning and always and only for the consumption of warriors whose constitution was such that they could digest and dispose of almost anything and yet he lusted after blood like all of them zahar knew this quite definitely for hed raided with nestor on sunside and seen him kill with the best and with a bloody zest which is a sure gauge of wamphyri vitality for invariably the bloodlust of the kill runs commensurate with the scarlet thirst so why not in nestor whatever the answer it probably explained his leaden pallor even for a lord of the wamphyri nestor lichloathe was undeniably pale these days the blood is the life and nestor was scarcely living it to the full on the other hand hed been looking forward with some anticipation to this raid on the lidescis and zahar recalled how in the early dawn twilight some hundred or so hours ago nestor had called him to his southfacing room of repose it was a rare thing these days to be offered audience with the necromancer in his rooms but it was also worrying one could never be sure what nestor had on his mind on this occasion however hed merely craved company the presence of someone other than himself also he had desired to talk a little a great window in nestors room of repose looked out over the boulder plains to the barrier mountains whose topmost peaks were edged with yellow now as the sun rose far to the south many hours yet before that furnace orb would blaze between the peaks on wrathstack itself and even then only on the bleached or calcined south face of lofty wrathspire long before that wrathas black batfur curtains would have been drawn against even the smallest hurtful ray and the lady herself removed to some darker safer place as for the other manses despite that the sun never shone on them generally their vampire masters took to their beds at sunup and slept their fill in the wake of the long night but nestor was and always had been different he feared the deadly power of the sun aye but it fascinated him nonetheless and he would often sit in his room of repose to watch that poisonous golden stain creeping on the distant crags and stay there till the last possible unbearable moment when he would seem to hear a far faint seething as of acid eating stone and that was where zahar had found his master when nestor called for him seated at the great open window with the baffles thrown wide gazing into the southwest at the goldrimmed barrier mountains in a little while nestor had said to him you know that ive told wratha the location of a lidesci stronghold called sanctuary rock it had not been a question but a statement of fact the stack has lesser channels of communication as well you know lord zahar had answered carefully thralls mend the water and gas pipes between the manses and carry out work on the high faces replenishing watercatchment skins sigils pennants sometimes they strike up conversation the word is that we attack tonight all of us aye nestors nod you me grig norbis lexis asabar and the best of our aspirant thralls the lady wratha and her lads likewise lords spiro killglance and wran the rage gorvi the guile and canker canison plus a force of warriors indeed ajj the warriors barring only those fresh weaned the very best blood of the stack and only a handful of trustee thralls left behind to see to our manses in our absence the lidescis are doomed lord at which nestor had gripped the arms of his chair and turned his face sharply towards him oh really are they youre sure of that but theyre a tenacious people zahar so are lichens tenacious lord yet you may scrape them from the rocks on the heel of your boot yet lichens dont die in the sunlight look there the barrier mountains there are lichens in the peaks they live where we may not likewise the szgany but but the sunlight is a natural thing not a szgany weapon it was upon a time nestor brooded turning his gaze on the barrier mountains as before i i seem to remember a myth or legend a story out of another time when i was a small thing or even before i was born and the legend was this that before wratha and the rest of us there were other vampires here quite obviously it was so signs of their habitation are all around and of their decline their demise this is but one aerie the last aerie but sprawling on the boulder plains for all to see lie the skeletons of others that died in a great and terrible war and in their shattered stumps evidence of smoke terrific heat explosions for in that forgotten time the sun also shone in starside i know this myth lord zahar had answered except i am older than you begging your pardon and know it for a fact i was a child in sunside eight or nine years old and wait nestor had looked at him again a curious glance this time first tell me do you miss it miss what lord zahars frown your childhood your humanhood do you miss sunside you were stolen by vasagi and changed into you but all so recent a little over three years surely you remember how it was now tell me zahar do you miss what you had and what you were mystified zahar could only shrug i am a vampire lord i have what i have what vasagi and you lord have given me if i am fortunate if i am very fortunate why i might go on forever or if not forever for a very long time but in all honesty i cannot say i do not know if i miss anything there are things which i crave certainly but then i am a vampire lord then why do i miss it eh the timbre of nestors voice was suddenly deeper full of a strange melancholy why is it that you remember without caring while i who have forgotten almost everything care so much you care about sunside about the travellers zahar had offered a shrug not hard to fathom the szgany are your livelihood future longevity the blood without looking at the other nestor had held up a hand to still his tongue and said wearily do not tell me that it is the life for i know it but i ask you to consider this could it also be the death zahar had been baffled but then hed braved a smile we are playing a word game am i correct lord at first nestor had given his head a shake but in another moment hed nodded of course and from zahar ruefully im not so good at them lord even at the best of times vasagi spoke infrequently not to say curiously hmm nestor had mused and then returning to the previous theme no i dont care about the szgany and especially not the szgany lidesci not any longer despite that they were your people but zahar realized at once that that was a stupid thing to ask of one of the wamphyri and of course not lord hed continued immediately you care only for yourself and for your manse of course and for those in your care again nestor had looked at him did i not care for wratha the risen zahars smile had vanished convoluted thinking and argument aside he must be careful how he answered that one this is merely a game lord i mean am i to speak openly there had been no emotion of any sort in nestors scarlet gaze when hed answered oh yes i demand it and zahar had discovered his throat to have gone a little dry as he said perhaps perhaps it was not so much care as lust lord then wincing inwardly he had waited but nestor had not appeared to take offence and without too much pause is there no love in vampires then i have heard of it but i never saw it glad to be on a different tack zahar had sighed his relief but do you love zahar there are women in your manse lord other than your own of course i go to one of them yes but love her women other than my own but al of them are mine surely as are we all zahar had quickly agreed but you dont call on all the manses women for not all of them are worthy and of course i know your preferences nestor nodded i have my harem yes indeed lord but sometimes they go wanting as you will it naturally recently i have denied them and yourself lord again nestors swift glance have they gone to others to you to other lieutenants other men common thralls zahar had backed off a hasty step but they would not dare what your women go to other men and what man of yours would hope or try or have nerve i mean i know what you mean my reach is long my hand is heavy and hard again zahars sigh yes lord am i too hard you are precisely as hard as required lord no more no less at which nestor had looked at him and grinned mirthlessly clever you are good at word games zahar well considering that vasagi was so difficult to speak to and the nuances of his speech so hard to grasp but still youve not answered my question you averred that the blood is the life and in my turn i asked can it also be the death how do you answer zahar was stalled i have no answer your riddle defeats me how can blood be death we drink to live not to die and if what we drink is tainted poisoned lord nestors shrug poisoned if you will yes with silver or kneblasch nestors look had been doleful and zahar suspected that hed missed his masters meaning but after a moment abruptly put all that aside the other said except you must believe me when i tell you that there are worse poisons than silver and kneblasch then for a while he had sat in silence zahar waiting on his word until the word game is over i won but yet may lose now tell me about this sunsider myth when the sun shone on starside zahar nodded then shook his head it was not the sun but a man with the power of the sun eh the sun shone out of him out of his eyes his mouth his arse make sense i only know what i remember lord zahar had protested i was but a boy and you were not yet born things get warped in the retelling perhaps i was born after all nestor had sat up again do you mean the time when the clouds burned red over starside and a wind from hell blew through the great pass into sunside killing men and trogs alike this man from the helllands had something to do with that no before that four years at least alas i dont know the details or who or what was involved agitated or impatient nestor sat back again and fidgeted tell it anyway the man was a helllander who came from beyond the starside gate he joined his son who was here before him that one was called the dweller and the wamphyri feared him greatly he kept a garden in the western heights between the mountains and the foothills the wamphyri banded together against him raided on him in his garden they were met with fierce opposition the dweller and his father used the power of the sun do not ask me how lord for i dont know to destroy the vampire army in the air defeated broken a handful of survivors flew home to their aeries on the boulder plains except the stacks were no more all bar this one the last aerie in those days called karenstack after the lady who dwelled here they lay broken on the plain as to why this one was spared alas i dont know ah nestors sigh the fallen aeries indeed lord for the dweller and his father were here first they were magicians with the power to move instantaneously from place to place without consideration of distance they destroyed the gasbeasts poured naked sunlight into the methane chambers reduced the stacks to rubble when all was finished the few wamphyri survivors flew off and exiled themselves in the icelands again nestors sigh for it appeared hed been holding his breath a while and the tumbled stacks hed whispered once again the blackening the great stone corpses crumpled to the plain and looking at his lieutenant zahar in this regard your memory matches my thoughts precisely for i too had heard this legend except i had forgotten it as ive forgotten most things at last he had showed more than the usual animation and zahar had congratulated himself that hed excited his master is it important lord nestors frown his wrinkled forehead and pursed lips i dont know but one thing for sure wratha and the others have it wrong for they believe it was a szgany suicide squad raiding through the pass at sunup who exploded the aeries in their bases and blew them to hell well for the moment well let them continue to believe it but did you never mention this myth to vasagi zahars shrug as we have agreed lord the suck was not talkative and anyway it is generally the case that wamphyri lords are not much given to conversation with mere lieutenants er which is not to say that you lower yourself lord but that yes i know nestor had cut him off but lower myself of course i dont lower myself what it is that you are elevated consider yourself fortunate i do lord then also consider this but consider it an order never speak of these matters again except to me if or when i desire it what i know cant hurt me and what my colleagues do not know wont concern them understood yes lord following which nestor had mused darkly but out loud it seems there were powers in those days some of which might even have transferred to the present it will bear looking into is it your thought that there may be magicians among the szgany lidesci even now lord at which nestor had given him the strangest look of all before answering i think there may well have been one yes at least until that night we went ahunting together you and i on sunside and then he had very grimly repeated aye i think there just might have been one at least all of which uneasy conversation had taken place some hundred or so hours ago in lord nestor lichloathes room of repose in suckscar but now zahar must drag his mind back to the present the here and now the fact that just a moment ago hed heard his master issue a mindwarning to wratha the risen wratha back off dont jand theres someone there an enemy even a great enemy aye and hes dangerous danger and the first duty of a lieutenant is to protect his lord and master zahar urged his flyer forward alongside nestor and he looked where nestor was looking front and left the lady wrathas huge ornately saddled manta flyer was descending towards the flat plateaulike dome of that great boulder or massively rounded outcrop called sanctuary rock directly in front of her her firstlieutenants creature was about to touch down more yet to the left paralleling nestor but slightly higher so forming an awkward v behind wratha canker canison stood in his saddle hauled on his reins and barked a string of vivid curses eager as ever deliberately stalling his flyer so that it would lose height more quickly the doglord was anxious to be down and following on behind these three wran the rage killglance in nestors slipstream his brother spiro in cankers and their chieflieutenants of course forming the trailing legs of the v but suddenly visible in a patch of crevicegrown gorse directly in the flight or landingpath of the foremost flyer a man had appeared as if from nowhere he wore a strange mask with protruding reflective eyes and carried upon his shoulder a device like a long box which he seemed to be aiming at the lead flyer heeding nestors warning however wratha was already in contact with that creatures rider whoever he is gather him up in your beasts pouch she commanded spill him into space over the rim of the rock moving to obey jockeying his mount forward on arched airtrap wings the lead rider closed with his victim but in the next instant madness and mayhem part three wamphyri i canker and siggi only minutes ago the wamphyri had circled high over sanctuary rock before commencing their spiralling descent and mirrored in the doglord canker canisons feral yellow crimsoncored nightsighted eyes as he looked down the great weathered dome had appeared as the skull of a fallen colossus the scant patches of gorse and bramble were all that remained of the ancient giants hair but apart from this coarse vegetation in the suturelike cracks and crevices the flat pate had seemed as bald and as empty of life and of death as it was of thoughts a safe high vantage point from which to observe the fighting that was how it had looked certainly all calm and serene on the plateau of the rock though thered been no lack of war and death below except that had been minutes ago while this was now and now madness and mayhem even if the doglord had dreamed it in advance if hed forecast it through his oneiromancy which this time he had not still canker would scarcely have credited its reality but standing tall in his saddle cajoling his stalled flyer as it formed airtraps of its manta wings and let down its coiled thrusters to reduce the shock of a forced landing he had seen it with his own eyes and so must believe it a man standing there in the nightdark gorse on the plateau of the rock with a long box or tubething balanced on his shoulder and wearing a bulgeeyed mask over his head and face standing square in the path of wrathas man goban at that and goban all set to make a landing then lord nestor lichloathe pointing and gesticulating while the man in the gorse aimed his long box at gobans mount it had been gloamy in the starlight on the dome of the rock it might even have been dark if not for the intermittent flaring of lidesci missiles skittering wild in the sky and the glow of firelight reflected from a handful of clouds but what is the night to wamphyri eyes nothing and the twilight even less canker had been able to see well enough also he had heard nestors warning and wrathas instructions to her man that he should brush this fool from the rim of the rock goban had at once spurred his flyer forward in a swoop but then a burst of light like a miniature sun issuing from the box on the mans shoulder a spear of light reaching out but swift as a snakes kiss and tipped with bright metal it left a vapour trail and hissed like a warrior and its bite was yet more deadly gobans mounts pouch was open to grasp this madman and sweep him before it over the rim but flyer and rider they never reached him the spear took the flyer in its pouch situated where the long tapering neck widened into the body directly under the saddle it sped deep into the cartilagehooked mouthlike pouch and was deflected upwards penetrating the flesh of the flyer between pouch and saddle where it detonated armourpiercing and packed with ultrahighexplosive the rocket would have stopped a halftrack by comparison the alveolate bones and membranous flesh of the flyer were like tissue paper they would absorb bullets easily enough and a good many bullets at that before enough liquid was let out that the creature was seriously hurt but a mm rocket is something else nathan had seen the results of explosive crossbow bolts in the flesh of flyers but hed seen nothing like this the blast was starshaped and struck out in all directions downwards it unhinged the beasts pouch as easily as a man might pick off a small scab and hurled it to earth sideways it ripped through the base of the flyers neck shearing flesh and saddle trappings alike and stripping meat membrane and cartilage from the leading edges of the wings upwards it sliced through the saddle like a knife and sliced through goban too rider saddle and all were hurled upwards in two parts literally torn asunder a two to threefoot section had been chopped out of the flyers spine all control was gone and apart from the undead nature of its blood the thing was quite literally dead in the air the eyes in the almosthuman head at the end of its long slowly slumping neck glazed over its pink worm thrusters convulsed spastically then coiled themselves up back into their body cavities it swerved this way and that as its wingarches began to collapse but still it came gliding forward nathan ducked down scrambled to avoid a drenching rain of fluids as the flyers rubbery bulk and nests of twitching thrusters scraped by barely overhead and with its tapering tail vibrating like a crippled snake tearing up the gorse as it went the thing headed for the rim and the shattering fall beyond it but nathans headgear the rocketlaunchers nitesite targeting set had been knocked askew on his head down on his knees in the gorse elated by his success he worked frantically to get it realigned finally he was striking back at the wamphyri there was another rocket waiting in its tube all it required was his finger on the button however momentarily the lords and lady were in disarray following on in line of descent behind gobans mount wrathas creature had instinctively reared back from the flash of light and its concussion jolted she clung to the twin pommels on her left and drawing level with her cankers flyer was skittish afraid its thrusters groped nervously for a hold on the rock an arched wingtip touched down and canker felt himself tilted in his saddle cursing lashing out with a booted foot at his mounts flank the dog lord leaped free swung from the bony leading edge of a wing let himself fall sprawling in the gorse in another moment his flyer touched down and canker was on his feet and nathan saw him they saw and knew each other the doglord knew him but not from where or when nathan on the other hand remembered only too well where and when it was a nightmare he would never forget that night in settlement the first time wratha and her renegades raided there nona kiklus house had been levelled by a warrior and nathan knocked out later coming to his senses he had found his girl misha zanesti lying unconscious in the rubble halfcarrying misha staggering towards a break in the stockade fence hed heard a panting and a patter of padded feet from behind him and looking back it had been this one canker canison canker only to look at him was to know that thered been a dog fox or wolf in his ancestry or possibly a combination he was loupgarou a werewolf and the first time nathan had seen him his error in this respect had been wholly understandable for he had thought that this was one of settlements domesticated animals this great wolfshape coming out of the destruction of settlements main street and making straight for him seeking human company in order to escape the invasion of the wamphyri but then hed noticed that this wolf seemed enveloped in a drifting cloud of mist and that it was more biped than quadruped the thing loped towards him with an aggressive forwardleaning eagerness it only paused to cock its head and turn its great ears this way and that listening or when it went on all fours in order to sniff the earth the cores of its eyes were scarlet and glowed like lamps in the dark and then nathan saw that the mist wasnt surrounding this creature but issuing from it the wamphyri nathan had heard campfire stories about them their powers hybridisms animalisms in that moment he knew what he was facing and that he was a dead man canker came loping reared up snarling tall and taller than a man nathan tried to shake misha awake no use he tried to ward the dog fox wolfthing off canker sniffed at him cocked his head on one side dripped saliva from his jaws and looked at the girl in nathans arms and tours he growled nathan put misha behind him but the doglord grabbed him and tossed him aside as easily as that and no not yours mine he said after that nathan had known no more until he had woken up to find misha gone and if canker had her it was a horror he nightmared still the sight of misha in this beasts arms and canker stripping her rags of clothing from her a nightmare he would never forget flashing once again in a series of vivid kaleidoscopic pictures across the screen of his mind neither would he forget the vow hed made that night that he wouldnt rest until the doglord was nothing but a puff of black smoke and a foul stench drifting on the sullied air and now they were here he and canker were here face to face in the gorse not fifteen paces apart the telemetry was right nathan centred cankers chest his heart in the luminous crosshairs of his nitesite lenses and squeezed the trigger canker saw it coming it was as if he dreamed while still awake a flash of waking oneiromancy a glimpse into his immediate future nothingness an empty blackness death nestor lichloathe witnessed the whole thing he saw the burst of brilliant white light from the devastating boxlike weapon on his great enemys shoulder and the gleaming warhead extending itself at magical speed on a smoking stem of white hot fire towards canker he saw the doglord dive for cover as the missile hissed between him and his skittering mount to slam into his firstlieutenant upon his flyer still airborne but about to touch down behind him well and that one touched down all right but in several crimson pieces nestor didnt know exactly where the spear had driven home but the lieutenants lesser flyer was driven downwards like a swatted moth by the force of the blast its back broken and its rider he literally rained to earth then fully in command again and furious wratha sent her beast surging forward towards the man in the gorse its pouch clamped shut on his shoulder weapon and all and he was dragged kicking and fighting like the madman he must be towards the rim for a brief moment nestor felt pride this was his brother nathan and he was the great and powerful enemy that nestor had named him no shame in being wary of this one nor any point in hating him now for at last he was gone how hed come back it no longer mattered for he certainly wouldnt be coming back from this gone yes gone over the cliff as wrathas creature opened its pouch and let him fall for a moment he hung there suspended against the far faint glimmer of the distant horizon and then he was no more a stone sent hurtling into the abyss but canker lay where hed fallen in the gorse the doglord hadnt stirred nestor gentled his beast to earth he dismounted ran to his friend there was blood on cankers leather tunic also in the coarse wolfs hair of his head hed cracked his skull hard against one of the domes jagged suturelike fissures even a vampires brain can be shaken insensible nestor cradled cankers head and looked into eyes even now glazing over closing canker didnt see him only a picture in the eye of his own mind which nestor clearly read there and siggi canker sighed as he fell unconscious my silver silver mistress out of the moon who will care care for you now after that only the nothingness which canker had foreseen the empty blackness but it was not the emptiness or the blackness of the true death then as cankers leech commenced to work its metamorphism and heal his broken skull so the darkness formed into a dream and his dream was to remember how she had come to him and the memory was of all that had occurred in the four months passed between it had happened after nestor was lost on sunside when he made his way back across the barrier mountains on foot and called for his man zahar to meet him in the peaks with a spare flyer canker too had been waiting for and had received that call and flew out with zahar to greet the necromancer and congratulate him on his safe return but flying back to the last aerie as theyd passed low over the helllands gate a diversion a female figure had stepped down from the crater rim of the gate to go stumbling and fumbling out on to the boulder plain but an entirely human woman here landing the three had approached her nestor and zahar curiously but canker in total amazement awe wonder transfixed the doglord as his eyes soaked up the beauty of this utterly astonishing creature and she was beautiful her colours alien her clothes light and lighter than moonbeams at which canker had known what she was what she must be szgany no never some freakish albino traveller woman whose colours had been absent from birth impossible why her eyes were bluer then the vault of the sky on a clear day and as for her design and the rest of her colours she was a statuesque unheard of silvery blonde and her skin was pale unblemished perfect likewise her features longlimbed her flesh was firm beneath undergarments of sheer silk which were clearly visible under the swirl and waft of a gown wispy as butterfly wings and far less than opaque those looks colours garments oh yes canker had known what she was all right long and long now he had dreamed his oneiromantic dreams of her his silver mistress in the moon for the doglord worshipped the moon on high and serenaded her in her tumbling orbit and on a balcony in mangemanse in wrathstack the last aerie he had even constructed a mighty organ of hollow bones whose music accompanied him when he sang to her and all this because he had dreamed of her that one day she would answer his call and lured by his music step down from on high to be with him in mangemanse which now she had there had been no question of arguing the point with him canker knew what he knew that beyond any slightest shadow of a doubt this was his silver mistress from the moon and if nestor or zahar had disputed cankers authority in this matter especially if they had disputed his proprietary right then there would have been trouble but no they had recognized his right of ownership or if not that theyd been too astonished to deny him either his dreams or his rights and canker had carried her off to mangemanse carried her off literally for when he had first approached her near the starside gate she had taken one look at him and fainted away in his arms obviously she was overwhelmed to have found him so soon the one whod lured her down from her temple on high and him so handsome and all but in mangemanse she had soon recovered from her swoon and in a little while canker had known that indeed he was not mistaken for plainly she had no knowledge of things here in the world of men and the wamphyri what but shed seemed innocent of knowledge itself not ignorant no not with her astonishing grace and beauty for a clod of earth is ignorant while silver shining luna has knowledge to light the world but innocent of the ways of the world and yet well not entirely innocent certainly she had known how to charm canker but that had come later first he must instruct her in oh almost everything in the ways of the stack the aerie as a whole and then in the ways of mangemanse wherein she was now mistress second only to canker himself mistress aye and only a woman not even wamphyri hah only a woman indeed but never before a woman such as this one and so he had set about to teach her except how to instruct someone he could not even speak to who had no knowledge of the szganywamphyri tongue which had been something to give him pause until for knowledge canker had substituted use his moon mistress had no use of the tongue yet understood every word a thoughtthief aye a mentalist the moon beings had no spoken language as such because they conversed mind to mind when they so desired and when they did not then they obscured their thoughts in impenetrable mental mists it was so canker couldnt get into her mind for the great banks of fog that she conjured there but only natural after all no maiden of worth would let her beau see what was on her mind surely for women have their lustful thoughts just as surely as men canker knew that for a fact his vampire women were whores from one set of lips to the other and kissed and sucked with both but sex with such as cankers moon mistress unthinkable at first what but she was untouchable a goddess he had made her so and she sat upon her throne of fine carved cartilage in the doglords most private of private chambers and of all the men and monsters in mangemanse his was the only form she ever saw and she was for his eyes only at first except what good is a goddess without her worshippers and if she were a goddess then surely canker was a god or would be if he was not found wanting and so he must woo her win her over convince her of his godhead he must become godlike in her eyes and not only in the eyes of his silver moon mistress but in the eyes of the manse entire well he was that already or if not a god a lord certainly but to own a goddess for his mate ah his most improbable dream come true her name was siggi leaning over her as she slept her fitful sleeps and slipping into her mind during those few brief moments when her guard was down and the mindmist rolled back a little canker had learned that much at least and in another world she had known an enemy whose name and face formed the core of all her nightmares even now in cankers care she feared him and moaned his name when silver pearls of perspiration formed gleaming on her brow turkur turkur tzonov a strange and alien name unheard of among szgany and wamphyri alike but one which cankers silver moon mistress would never forget nor canker now that he knew it and growling low in his throat peering into her cringing shuddering mind hed even seen the face of this moon monster as siggi remembered it the broad bronze dome of his head smooth and hairless yet glowing with vitality to match the flesh of his face and in stark contrast the purple deepsunken orbits of grey penetrating eyes which for all that they were human nevertheless contained an inhuman power eyes that could look into or even through a man which would make this one a great leader among men impressive among men but canker was wamphyri still he sensed the moonmans extraordinary fascination his weird allure and quite definitely he was of the moon where else would siggi have known and feared him if not in that hurtling world on high but quite apart from cankers logic in this respect there were also the looks of the man his colours and demeanour he glowed no less than siggi herself and what little hair he displayed was silverblond as siggis own his slender eyebrows haughtily tilted highlighting the tanned sharpetched ridges of his brows then there was his nose sharphooked which for all its lack of convolutions gave him the look of a warlord aye and with his wellfleshed mouth above a strong square chin and cheeks so very slightly hollowed he was not entirely unhandsome this proud and haughty warriorpriest of the moon a warriorpriest proud and haughty haughty twice now that word had commended itself to the lord of mangemanse as descriptive of this turkur tzonov and twice too often siggi feared his memory or was it his reality that she feared she had come down to starside from the moon and might not this turkur follow her what magic did he have this moonpriest and if he should come to claim siggi back how might canker answer the challenge with all my heart with all my blood with all my sinew with all my wamphyri strength with my oneiromancy with my lycanthropy with everything i own and all that i am neither man monster nor moonthing no child of nature or of the vats or any alien world shall ever part us i canker canison swear it by my teeth my balls by the very blood that thunders in my veins and rushing to a northfacing window and glaring at the hurtling moon let him come this turkur proud and haughty canker will show him proud and haughty iji eat his eyes and face and send him home on a great black flyer blind and red and smoking from his wounds and screaming in the night it was his wamphyri vow siggi got used to him she even got used to his guardian creatures which prowled the mazy corridors of his manse when their master was abed or hunting in sunside she very soon acclimatized which is to say she accepted her lot for to a mind vacant as hers this was all she had ever known the manse and all its monsters were home and canker her protector moreover he adored her and for all the knowledge that she had lost stolen from her mind in the magmass bowels of perchorsk by the madman turkur tzonov still siggi retained her sensuality her overpowering animal magnetism that essence of womanhood which was hers in abundance and she needed in all her life since she was fourteen siggi had not gone without a man she could not remember them now but she remembered how she knew how and as always and as is the case with most sensual women she felt the attraction of power in mangemanse there was only one power one raw source of furious energy and its name was canker canison as for his pups his bloodsons lieutenants thralls oh they were men despite the taint of their masters animalism but canker himself was magnificent and to a mind wiped clean of ideals of the idea of man the beatific the noble the honourable canker was the ideal f romantic the doglord was that he would take her to the northfacing gallery which housed his incredible instrument of hollow bones adjust the baffles to let in the winds that blew off the icelands and play his mighty organ with all the verve if not the skill of a veritable maestro and while the rest of wrathstack groaned at the resulting cacophony siggi the moon mistress would laugh and applaud and even be brought to tears by the joy of cankers music or perhaps by its pain but he would never suspect it for she knew he played for her and all the time he kept her upon a pedestal far above all earthly desires and never a single carnal thought in the doglords cesspit vampire mind not about siggi for she was his silver moon mistress whose flesh was holy of holies and he was only a great dog he would not corrupt her nor change her in any way and when she went to her bed canker would be there asleep upon a pallet outside her door for instead of a doglord hed become like unto a watchdog and a faithful dog at that but with or without her memories siggi was still siggi and a lustful woman because canker was all she knew she wanted him and anyway he was almost as much man as dog in the end she seduced him and even suspecting it might destroy her led him to her bed astonished believing he dreamed a most marvellous albeit forbidden dream he went to her then knowing her flesh was frail canker was gentle with her perhaps too gentle so that she must become the aggressor at which the great and terrible beast was conquered not alone by beauty but also by urges as alien and powerful as his own until he became a toy for a woman out of another world innocent in her way siggi couldnt know it but in toying with canker canison she toyed with her very soul canker must show his moon mistress to the stack to the aerie as a whole to all the lords and chiefest of the lieutenants and even to the lady wratha most certainly to her hah let that one see a real lady except it was not the doglords way to welcome visitors into his manse mangemanse was a secret place and its wolfish master kennelproud so he spoke to the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe in neighbouring suckscar his one true friend in all wrathstack and with some few small misgivings nestor made the arrangements the lords and lady were invited up or down in wrathas case into suckscar to a grand reception in honour of siggi cankers silver moon mistress but a reception for a commoner a thrall a mere woman even a woman from another world it was unheard of and yet the lords were curious each and every one of them and wratha the risen even more so so it was that in the eleventh sundown following siggis arrival in starside her reception took place in suckscar and the vampire lords and lady came to discover the nature of this remarkable creature who had so captured the doglords previously rabid heart and monumental imagination nor would their curiosity be disappointed siggi had not been seen when canker first brought her to the last aerie and even if she had been then slumped across his saddle in a swoon she would have been thought just another captive taken by force out of sunside no one but nestor lichloathe knew how cankers silver mistress looked her stunning colours shape or fabulous design in general nor would they until the last possible moment canker was a sly showman even as sly as the fox in his mixed ancestry he had a sense of the dramatic and appreciated the delicious tingle of anticipation the sudden shock of revelation the stunned astonishment of denouement he revelled in upstaging all other actors at every given opportunity in this instance siggis reception and since posturing was integral to his character canker was never on time he preferred the grand entrance nestor lichloathe had announced the reception following a raid on the szgany of tireni scarp some eighty miles west of settlement under yanni tireni their leader the folk of tireni scarp were ferocious as the szgany lidesci they didnt have lardis lidescis weird weapons but their skill with lures and pitfall traps and their accuracy with silvertipped kneblaschsoaked cross bow bolts and ballistaehurled fireballs was phenomenal so that just like lardiss people the szgany tireni had survived without returning to the wild and becoming travellers but on this occasion the raid had been successful and a number of thralls had been taken alive without cost to the wamphyri yet another reason to celebrate and in accordance with cankers instructions nestor had mentioned in passing the fact that the doglord would present the new mistress of mangemanse at that same affair a reception of sorts in suckscar which nestor would host canker had of course made himself scarce at the time so avoiding any banter or questions in this respect with his sense of the dramatic hed wanted siggi to come as a complete surprise which she would the time had been set four hours before sunup allowing plenty of time for strutting wagering eating and drinking before all must depart in the early dawn back to their various manses and the security of their dark places nestor had retired to suckscar to make the necessary arrangements wratha and her chiefest lieutenants would come down on foot out of wrathspire and the doglord and his whelps were wellacquainted with the way up from mangemanse as for the rest wran and spiro killglance and their men could not come through mangemanse and so must fly and gorvi the guile could scarcely be expected to climb almost half a mile vertical out of guilesump which meant he too would use a flyer a landingbay must be made ready with lieutenants and thralls in attendance to handle the flyers nestor had seen to everything it was no great effort he owed the doglord this much at least came the time appointed deceptively dandyish wran the rage was first up accompanied by his first and secondlieutenants wran was magnificent in a wolfgrey cloak crimson cummerbund black batfur trousers and leather boots he sniffed the air superciliously and tweaked the small black wen on his chin his brother the everscowling spiro killglance followed close behind as was his wont he dressed in rags likewise his men nestor greeted them in the landingbay instructed his thralls in the temporary stabling of their beasts and had a lieutenant escort them down into the great hall beneath his private quarters minutes later as the gauntly sinister gorvi the guile and his lieutenants made their approach nestors man grig reported wrathas arrival by internal stairwell the lady was acquainted with this route into suckscar nestors guardian creatures were accustomed to her in any case he had ordered that there be no let or hindrance and so she had passed in safety with two of her men which left only canker and his pups and his silver moon mistress of course but all of the others were in suckscar a good halfhour before canker put in his appearance and during that time nestor had done his best to entertain them despite that in the main he despised them well he scarcely despised wratha the risen but appeared more than a little wary of her and kept his mind shielded from her probes at all times being female she was curious and more than mildly peeved in the last few weeks their affaire had all but fizzled out she was unable to explain the change come over her former lover not only was nestors attitude radically different but also his character even his mien he seemed to have assumed the guise of a mystic a recluse like one of the gaunt old men of turgosheim or rather like a young vormulac unsleep or a zolteist ascetic like the seerlord maglore indeed nestors change was startling especially to one who had known him as wratha had known him nothing remotely ascetic about that nestor not as wratha had known him but this sudden fad of his for wrapping up keeping himself covered like a child in swaddling clothes almost as if he were ashamed of his flesh or as if he were shy of some blemish or other but on the other hand well nestors ascension to a lord of the wamphyri had been lightning fast when the change that shapes had moulded him like a soft candle in a flame it had seemed that he was a natural a vampire born but perhaps it had been too fast and something had been burned out of him other than his humanity or there again it could be that recognition awareness of his vampire condition had changed him the fact that his universe had now expanded beyond all previous boundaries it was ever traumatic the change that shapes but sometimes more so in which case he might yet change back again and be what he had been when finally his blood had settled down and his vampire leech had determined his destiny or was it something else entirely where now was the zest and the lust and the dark thrill of being the thrill of being wamphyri it had been vibrant in him he had revelled in it even without his parasites drive his own had been as a roaring fire in him so that hed blazed with its heat and glowed red in his dark heart wratha knew for she had felt it there and she had loved him in and out of her bed loved the touch and the smell and the very thought of him but all gone now and ah she missed it she missed it but not that much for one erection is much like another and a man is only a man after all the fire had burned too brightly that must be it which was a concept that wratha could accept the idea that perhaps she the lady herself had sucked it out of him that she wratha the risen had reduced him to less than her needs until she no longer had need of him at all she could accept that yes and yet what if she was wrong what if nestor shielded his mind not to hide his weakness but to protect a strength a passion beyond her comprehension beyond her wamphyri comprehension because everything that was human in her had long since fled the seething searing corruption of her leech was that it did he yet retain a capacity an entirely human capacity for love for the true living love for love inadmissible by virtue of his nature for love unrequited for a love out of his mainly unremembered past which was a concept wratha could not accept never that she had exhausted him fine but that some other had distracted or abstracted him never there had been this szgany wench misha a lidesci bitch out of his vague and shadowy past when nestors mind had been more accessible wratha had discovered her there still in his thoughts despite that he was wamphyri and for all of the past that his damaged mind had forgotten hed remembered her well enow and his hatred for the one who had stolen her from him that was why hed gone with zahar that time into sunside to settle an old score almost three months ago aye and hed never been the same since for all her much vaunted mentalism wratha never had discovered what happened that time but now that she remembered it she could clearly see how it coincided with his change all of which had gone unnoticed at the time for events of moment had been crowding thick and fast such as the reunification of the aerie under wratha the foundation of supplicant szgany tribes east of the great pass the creation of a tithe system similar to the one theyd known in old turgosheim from the proceeds of which to build their armies against the chance of some future invasion events of moment aye and all coming at more or less the same time not to mention a few of lesser importance such as the doglord rinding his socalled silver moon mistress all lost and alone wandering on the boulder plains in the vicinity of the starside gate which was a timely recollection for surely that was cankers great bark of a laugh even now as the echoes of that uproarious laughter came drifting down into the banquet hall the lady wratha gave a mental nod of recognition and exasperation for aye indeed it was cankers laugh preceding the doglord as lightning precedes the thunder ii wratha wran spiro as the echoes of canker canisons laughter died away wratha returned from her mental meanderings glanced all about nestors banquet table and contained herself as best she could the heat of her inward conjecturing specifically with regard to lord lichloathe had not been so great that it had wrought any noticeable physical change in her to all intents and purposes and with the acceptable exceptions of her conchlike ears convolute snout scarlet eyes and divided tongue she was just like a young and beautiful girl the practised and effortless metamorphism of her leech hid the monster under the skin indeed it hid it well so that no one not even a lord of the wamphyri would suspect the century of time which she had lived not until she was angered sufficiently that the monster became ascendant and the facade of her skill was stripped away then the ladys change at such times was legendary a veritable transformation an incredible katabolism like watching the tenday decay of a ripe apple to a spotted mouldering fungus lump but all accelerated or compressed to a period of ten nightmarish seconds and then it would be seen that indeed the female of the species is the most dangerous and the most venomous but for now the monster was hidden and wratha was beautiful nothing of the leadenness of the lords about her her skin was pale as milk unblemished her jetblack shining hair fell in plaits to her shoulders which were fitted with a torque of finely worked gold depending from this golden harness ropes of plaited batfur formed a smoky curtain to her knees smoky but by no means opaque for as she moved so the ropes would sway revealing a soft curved breast or brown nipple rounded hip and smooth thigh delicate arms and hands where they broke through and so she scarcely kept herself secure from viewing it was a distraction which kept the lords from scanning her mind by occupying theirs paradoxically but not unusually wrathas eyes were least in evidence protected by a scarp of carved bone upon her brow their fire was subdued by the ornamentation of blue glass ovals at her temples and matching earrings in the finefurred lobes of her ears this too was deliberate for if wrathas deceit were at all visible then surely it was in her eyes which is to say that however inarticulately nevertheless the truth of her being was shouted from them so that she must make every effort to deaden their unquiet voice and disguise their undead evil slightly protuberant until she was enraged when they bulged they gave away that which the lady would keep secret or at least hidden and so formed her most vulnerable feature but in any case hers was a grotesque deceit apart from which and the usual anomalies of vampirism wratha might well be szgany a cleanlimbed gypsy girl from sunside whose flesh was still untried but beauty is only skindeep and so much for looks the lady sat at one end of the long table with her chief lieutenants flanking her gorvi and his two sat along one side which they shared with spiro and his ruffians nestor grig and zahar occupied the other side along with wran the rage and his pair but at the doglords request the head of the table had been left free for him spread before them were various appetizers halved wolf and bearhearts floating in blood suckling shad basted in its mothers milk various joints rareroasted and thicksliced from the same mature beast bowls of fruit and pitchers of weak ale spoils of the tithe naturally but nothing ostentatious not so much a banquet as a buffet nestor lichloathe was on his feet he too had heard cankers laughter from on high and his gaze rested upon a balcony overlooking his great hall with a corridor behind that led to the landing bay sure enough the doglord was there and with him his silver moon mistress what little was to be seen of her as yet why she was as much covered all swathed and shielded from the sight of men and of wratha as nestor himself the lady stared as did the others but nestor paced to the sweep of his great stone staircase and called up to canker come down my friend alas but youre late and the food is cold i had a little trouble canker barked lying with great proficiency a creature of mine went mad and i saw it as my personal duty to slaughter him for the provisioning but he shrugged it was bloody work and afterwards all to be made tidy and so you must excuse us that were late he led his mystery woman down the stairwell with two great shaggy lieutenants a pair of his pups following close behind these were not the doglords bloodsons as such but when canker took thralls out of sunside he usually picked wolfishlooking ones so that in other circumstances these two might easily have been his bloodsons as leader of the pack patriarchal as it was all of the doglordss thralls and lieutenants were his pups of course at the bottom of the sweeping staircase canker paused for effect turned to nestor and bowed stiffly he was dressed all in red red vest and cloak and baggy red breeks the hair on his head shone red to match the cores of his eyes it was the fox in him of course but startling nevertheless nestor had never seen him so wellgroomed but in another moment the doglords wild wolf laughter rang out again then turned to howling as he threw back his head went to all fours and in order to give full vent shook from head to toe finally the ringing echoes died away canker fell silent and flowed upright shook himself again an entirely voluntary action this time as if to shake off a mood and glanced all about his hosts great hall then my lord nestor he panted and to the rest my lords and lady i am genuinely sorry im late but as you know ive no sense of timing why i was probably late at my own whelping and if im lucky i may even be late to my grave as for these little gatherings of ours too infrequent by far it must seem that im always late wasnt it so at wrans reception in wrathspire that time when hed rid us all of vasagi the suck two and a half years ago as i recall but i remember it well that was when the young lord lichloathe first came among us out of sunside and fell heir to suckscar aye and fortunate for canker that he did for it was nestor who taught me the moon music with which to lure my silver mistress down from the moon and i learned his tune and perfected my art and likewise perfected my organ of warrior bones hoisted up from olden battlefields but it was at wrans reception that i first broached the idea tootling a small szgany flute for your amusement and you were amused of course for you thought me mad his lips curled back from great wolf jaws and he grinned a toothy grin then held up a massive paw now dont deny it you thought me crazed a victim of the moon as my father before me but no the moon is not my tormentor but my friend and mentor who sent me dreams of a silver mistress a message from the moon for i have a talent oneiromancy with which i read the future and the truth in dreams and knew that she was real and hour on hour night after night i played my moon music and sang to her on high knowing she would heed me and come down to be mine in mangemanse which she did but here i have been remiss for ive kept her to myself indeed i shall continue to do so and let him die most agonizingly who dares so much as lay a hand or even considers such an act the soft black leather of his lips again drew back to display the gleam of elongated canines and a low threatening growl escaped his throat but a moment later as for the fact of her being he continued its high time you all knew what ive done what canker has achieved with his moon music and in his madness wherefore lo and behold i give you siggi until now she had been wrapped in a robe of purest white albino batfur her face hidden behind a shimmering veil hanging from a crown of figured cartilage as the doglord finished speaking however he took the crown from her head and gave it to one of his whelps then carefully unfastened the robe and lifted it from siggis marble shoulders until she stood there almost exactly as first seen in the dim false dawn of starside and the preternatural glow of the helllands gate almost exactly as first seen but of course that had been some three months ago and behold canker said again she is awake and to a man and a woman they knew what he meant for despite that as yet she was still his silver moon mistress and her colours alien and beautiful beyond reason they could each of them see that this would not could not last silverblonde her hair and skin a fading gold aye for now and desirable in her various parts to drive men wild true but rumour had had it that her eyes were blue as the sky under the northern auroras and plainly they were not so that wratha knew she was no longer the only lady in wrathstack awake canker barked again a single word but all of them knew what it meant that siggi had been asleep and a long cold breathless sleep at that the sleep which changes life to undeath moreover hed drained her to the dregs or if not that his passion had been such that indeed he snarled cutting all such inference short for just as i lured her down from the moon so she has lured my egg out of me accept her for she has ascended this lady and is wamphyri crimsoneyed she clung to the doglords arm smiled however vacantly yet in no way naively and showed them her pure white teeth and they saw in the ribbed deeps of her scarlet yawning mouth how already the dark cleft of siggis pointed tongue was deepening for division the dream had been canker canisons and yet it had involved others especially the lady wratha and had been dreamed as from their point of view as if seen through their eyes as well as cankers own though rare this was hardly strange to him it had happened before and was phenomenal of his oneiromancy which allowed him to see the truth of his dreams this time hed seen how wrathas concern for nestor lichloathe was much like his own despite that their motives were different for while his was born out of love for the man hers was based mainly in love of self which nevertheless requires the confirmation or consummation of another that was why she could be dispassionate about nestor one moment and furious the next when she wondered if there was some other and remembered this lidesci bitch in sunside as for canker he knew there was another also that nestors old scars were itching again those mental scars out of his mainly forgotten youth however obliquely canker and lord lichloathe had even talked about it on occasion about nestors great enemy among the szgany lidesci whats more the doglord knew that nestor had tried to put this unknown rival down with neardisastrous results so that wratha the risens suspicions had only confirmed what canker already knew that indeed there was an unknown woman in nestors past but it was all a very tangled skein and anyway cankers head hurt and the night wind was cold where it whipped back his hair driving a thin trickle of blood into his eye and what he tried to sit up and couldnt budge but an arm loosely lashed to his saddle he was facedown on the one side bent in the middle and legs all adangle on the other and viewed down below before it faded into mist and smoke and distance a scene straight out of hell explosions bright glaring blasting but louder and deadlier far than anything the szgany lidesci had used before their smoke and roaring voices drifting up on the night air along with the howl of maimed warriors and the dying sputter of failed propulsors and mewling flyers limping aloft on blazing wings only to go tumbling back into fire and smoke a warrior airborne its bladders exploding as a shrilling rocket scored a direct hit the crippled beast floundering to earth where antlike figures fell upon it with oil and torches and turned it to a living bonfire a frenzied metallic cachinnation as of giant cicadas accompanied by stuttering flashes of bright white light and the death screams of men and monsters but mainly of thralls lieutenants flyers warriors in short a rout and what canker wondered again this time out loud flying alongside nestor lichloathe knew that he was conscious and called out canker your left hand and arm are free i tied your left foot with a slipknot only reach down and tug on the rope your leg will come free meanwhile and as youve no doubt gathered were on our way home and then more viciously through grinding teeth where i suppose well look at each other stupidly lick our wounds and count our fucking losses the necromancer was more animated certainly in his emotions than canker had seen him in a threemonth but the doglord had a headache and problems enough of his own on the left flank and a short distance to the rear spiro and wran killglance watched canker free himself straighten up in the saddle and loll there like a drunkard and thought as one man damn it to hell twins it was no great feat to share their thoughts while keeping them guarded from the others and the manhound jives wran the rage grunted what did you expect spiro scowled across at his brother that a knock on that great thick wolfhead would kill him woujd that it had that way at least something wouid be salvaged from this night aye youre right spiros mental nod of agreement quite a lot salvaged come to think of it for id have been up into mangemanse in a trice and all thats his would be mine wrans lewd grin what all of it he licked his lips and flashed a picture of siggi at his brother including this all of it answered the other wrans grin slid away as if wiped clean off his face in the slipstream of air spiros attitude irritated him greatly these days had done so ever since he made his first kill with his evil eye but it hadnt always been so back in turgosheim those many years ago the twins had been united in mutual fear and hatred of their father and his killing eye until at last theyd murdered him but now the longer wran lived in close proximity to his brother in madmanse and the more he looked at him the more he thought to see the spitting image of their father old eygor killglance himself looking back at him out of spiros killing eyes which was a thought he not only kept from the rest of the wamphyri but also from his twin well said spiro abruptly as if ready for an argument and caught offguard for a moment wran finally repeated him well was there a question you know there was i said that in the event canker had been seriously incapacitated then id take madmanse and all that went with it and you said nothing which seems to me to pose a question in itself do you disapprove wrans mental shrug not really for who knows maybe we have been cooped up together too long both in turgosheim and in wrathstack and it was always the plan that you would have a manse of your own some day but this siggi is a lot of woman would you keep her all to yourself too a bit greedy isnt it oh and do you fancy her spiro was scowling even harder now but i thought wratha was your meat again wrans shrug wratha will suit me fine if she can be tamed but you saw her when all went crazy back there oh she can fool men looking the way she does like a young wanton out of sunside but when shes wrathful and his mind flew back some ten to fifteen minutes in time to picture wratha as they had seen her atop the dome of the great rock in those moments before and after she forced their attacker over the rim to his death her cry of rage turning to a cackle even as she turned to a hag as she urged her mount forward and issued her mental command grasp him lift him dump him from the edge and wrathas monstrous metamorphosis not only in the tone of her voice but also in her face and figure wran had witnessed it before as had spiro and canker aye and gorvi too wherever he was now some three and a half years earlier at an extraordinary meeting of the wamphyri in vormulac taintspores melancholy vormspire in turgosheim at which lord vormulac had presided and wran knew that it was wrathas vampire leech reacting to her emotions her shock and anger by pumping its essence into her veins in the same way that lesser mortals pump adrenalin it was her parasites response to gird the lady for whatever trial was in the offing but the change it wrought in her was seen as terrible even by the utterly terrible wamphyri even by wran the rage himself for the girl was gone from her saddle in a matter of moments and in her place a witch wratha had gained spindly craggy inches in height seem ing to elongate vertically as beneath her leather armour the healthy bloom of her flesh turned leaden as a lords and her cheeks shrank inwards to age her to gauntness the convolutions of her nose had taken on much clearer definition its flat flange turning darkly moist with nostrils that flared and gaped the overlapping leaves of her leather breastplate collapsed like a last sigh as beneath it her breasts flopped to flaccid dugs but her eyes were the worst for while spiro had the killing eye the lady wrathas were pure poison and beneath the visor upon her brow they had become as blobs of hellfire as if theyd been peeled to bleeding and drawn half out of their sockets even among the wamphyri whose mutations were many and whose metamorphism allowed transmutation into endless varieties of form few manifestations were as ghastly as wratha the risens change when she was threatened and her leech took the upper hand and aye when shes wrathful wran said again musingly as for me i merely rage but wratha is monstrous spiro agreed that says it all especially coming from such as us her peers as it were but on the other hand this siggi wran returned from his reflections whether she hails from the moon or not is mainly woman albeit a lot of woman oh shell be wamphyri eventually aye but aways to go yet before she has the measure of such as wratha then shell be some lady spiro and will you be able to handle her dyou think spiro had never been quick on the uptake but now he was bastard you dont fool me i dont have her yet and already youre drooling over her his thoughts were vehement almost shouted and be careful wrans mental voice was a hiss of warning guard your thoughts they are guarded damn you best guard yourownfrom me calm down calm down wran chuckled darkly dont you know when your own brother is having a joke with you as for mangemanse and siggi they are yours if the opportunity should dawn but until then and suddenly wrans mood as he fell silent seemed far more ominous so that spiro felt obliged to prompt him well brother the more i consider it wran continued after a while the more certain i am weve made a big mistake joining up with wratha and the others again i mean with the guile well thats different we know where we stand with him we dont give him an inch ever but these others he pulled a wry face how dyou mean well just look at the mess theyve dropped us in tonight frankly the reason i was having a joke with you was to take my mind off our losses why theres almost half as much dead meat back there about the foot of that rock as there is undead stuff in wrathstack huh spiro grunted dyou think i dont know it what use to build armies just to send them into that sort of hell the lidescis wont break we should have learned that by now they wont break for wratha or for anyone else we should leave lardis and his lot till last convert the rest then bury the lidescis under such a mass of vampire flesh that even they cant resist wran had to agree and admitted we lost some good lieutenants some good meat down there in the smoke and the stink and damn it i still havent worked out what happened aye it was quick spiro gave a mental nod that mayhem atop the rock before wratha pushed that lunatic off the edge of the cliff him and his lightningbox and then all hell breaking loose below until then it seemed our forces on the ground were doing well but their weapons wran shook his head i saw warriors destroyed like clumps of rag i mean we know they can work metals these people but miracles spiro was silent for a moment then said the necromancer knew he was there eh the madman on the dome of the rock lichloathe cried out to wratha in the moment before she would have landed warning her off he knew that this what a great enemy he called him was there perhaps he saw him but no one else saw him how so huh if i had seen him first and if id been quicker thinking i might have used my killing eye on him but things were happening so fast wran thought about it a moment then said theres more to the young lord lichloathe than meets the eye another mistake that i ever introduced him into wrathstack in the first place what in the last threemonth hes gone as weird reclusive and silent as vasagi the suck in his time well we all know what happened to vasagi he should take care this necromancer lest he go the same way but not yet wrans shrug you can find fault with him challenge him if you want after all its you who needs a manse of his own not i also were supposed to be allies remember and what if wratha and the doglords premonitions about vormulac unsleep are correct it might be as well to remain unified under wratha for the time being at least but when things are resolved however theyre resolved that will be time enough spiro finished it for him none of which was overheard by the rest for like canker canison they were all concentrating on their own problems it had been nathans plan to get off a shot at canker conjure a mobius door and get out of there on the instant but several things had conspired to stop him his consuming hatred of the doglord had demanded that he at least make an attempt on his life but the knowledge that his brother was among these wamphyri lords had probably served to distract him and deflect his aim also he found it difficult as yet to concentrate on physical action while exercising mental control over the metaphysical mobius continuum it would come with time but he wasnt yet the master which his father had been and with both rockets fired then the necroscope had been in trouble there were grenades in his pockets but the launchers shoulderclasp had caught on his jacket and he was unable to rid himself of the thing and then that monstrous woman had been there and there had been no time left to do anything a moment more and hed felt himself gripped by the shoulder driven forward released into freefall and then into fullfall in one respect however nathan was like his father and exactly like him when his life was threatened then he was at his best knowing about death what it was and what it was not nathan had the utmost regard for life especially his own so that hed found it less than astonishing how the proximity of death mobilized him for life freeing himself at last of the rocketlaunchers tube kicking it away from him nathan had tumbled head over heels in midair while plunging towards the base of the rock then instinctively curving himself like a leaf and after a moment of rocking from side to side hed found himself falling facedown and that the stony screelittered slope at f the foot of the rock was rushing towards him at a fearful velocity but no hesitation this time hed forced mutating mobius equations onto the screen of his mind conjured a door directly in his hurtling path and fell straight through it into the merciful darkness of the mobius continuum and none too soon for in the next second he would have smashed down to stain the scree black with his blood in the blue starlight and knowing how close he had come the necroscope was angry with himself yes but mainly with the wamphyri in the mobius continuum he controlled his still hurtling body headed for wellknown coordinates emerged in the main entrance cavern to sanctuary rock perhaps four hundred feet from where hed been dropped from the rim into an echoing babbling blast of noise and ruddy torchcast light a smokewreathed turmoil of frenzied activity and a combined sulphur kneblasch and sweatstench like standing at the brink of hell men were at work organized by a gangling simian central figure who stood on a flattopped daislike boulder and shouted commands at teams of cursing sweating szgany lardis lidesci there could be no mistaking him and as for the men he commanded they were his people and they were nathans people here in the main cavern entrance maybe sixty of them the rest were out there in the night doing battle with vampire thralls and warriors risking and giving up their lives in the unequal redraging contest between good and evil the bloodwar between humanity and the wamphyri but those of them here in the cavern they hauled small carts carrying makeshift bamboo rockets that trickled coarse black gunpowder propellant from dangerously short fuses or they formed a sweating grimy chaingang passing buckets of kneblaschlaced oil handtohand out into the fearful lurid hoarsevoiced night while others on ladders rammed dangling ropelike chains of fuse into the dark ominous recesses of high ledges or heaped small squat barrels in trenches along the walls taken as a group these men formed a support and supply team for the frontline troops but they were also the rearguard in the event that the action spilled back into sanctuary rock itself keep it moving lardiss bullvoice roared out and in the next moment as his dark eyes swept across the panorama of frantic activity so they settled on nathan then his mouth fell open and his eyes bugged and he pointed a shaking astonished disbelieving hand the necroscope had no time to spare he broke through the garlicreeking chaingang ran forward caught lardiss arm as the other jumped down from his dais lardis you the old lidesci gasped his bloodshot eyes still huge and round he scarcely believed it but had to nathan kiklu but where from this time instinctively suspiciously he narrowed his eyes and how no time to explain nathan shook his head but i have men with weapons fantastic weapons lardis except they are strangers i mean they look and sound strange these men and if i bring them here now your own men might mistake them for enemies thered be no time for questions and my friends could be killed not while im here lardis shook his head then stay here and ill be back nathan told him eh back lardis gaped and gaped even wider actually staggering a little as nathan took a step to one side and halfdisappeared then stepped back and was whole again because in that moment as he had been about to depart so nathan had heard a sputtering blast of propulsors and thered sounded a rumbling and roaring from immediately outside the yawning cavern entrance a small wamphyri warrior had breached all of lardiss defences and was out there even now about to break in brave men came running stumbling retreating into the temporary safety of the cave even the bravest of them knew that it meant unavoidable nightmarish death to go up against something like the thing outside and back lardis yelled as a monstrously evil shape bulked huge against the glaring night beyond the mouth of the cavern everybody back into the escape tunnels recovering from what he had just seen not the threat outside but nathans almostdisappearing act he was quickly in charge again for in any case this wasnt the first time that hed seen it and now that nathan was back he suspected it wouldnt be the last also he knew that what he had believed for quite some time now was proven beyond a doubt that nathan kiklu was in fact a son of the long dead harry helllander called dwellersire for there had only ever been two who could come and go like that harry and his changeling son the dweller both of whom were dead but what is in the blood is in the blood and quite obviously it had come out in nathan too the riddle was at last solved and the solution indisputable which in turn meant that there was hope yet if sanctuary rock could survive the night lardis gave himself a shake snatched a torch from the hand of a retreating man looked for the dangling end of a rope fuse where it snaked down from explosive charges in the high inwardcurving walls but no nathan told him taking the torch from him and jamming it in a crack in the dais boulder i said we had weapons he took grenades from his pockets handed one to lardis ran towards the entrance whose walls flared red from the fires outside and reverberated to the sounds of battle lardis looked at the deadly egg in his hand and remembered the last time hed held one when the helllander jazz simmons had been here oh twentyone years ago lardis hadnt much cared for the things then and still didnt but he knew what they could do gritting his teeth he ran after nathan to where the necroscope had skidded to a halt in the very entrance just outside turning its great savage head this way and that a metallicgleaming machine of death yet a creature of flesh and blood a vampire construct coughed and snarled as its small but incredibly vicious brain considered the possibilities for additional mayhem even as it did so nathan heard a mental order from its lieutenant commander out there in the night enter the cave in the name of your maker wran the rage you are ordered to kill ravage destroy be about your work and as the horror bunched its thrusters beneath its bulk and prepared to propel itself forward into the cavern nathan held up his grenade where lardis could see it twisted its cap and yanked on its fusepin to prime it they were small these handhurled bombs only two and a half inches long like large eggs small heavy deadly effective far beyond anything that was available in jazz simmonss time but lardis couldnt know that as he imitated nathans actions and together they tossed their grenades right down the warriors throat then nathan grabbed lardiss arm and dragged him behind a stalagmite stump and two seconds later crump crump two muffled shuddering detonations as the grenades exploded one of them went off on its way to the creatures stomach ruining many of its vital organs the other in the back of its throat letting out a blast of hot white light a lick of fire and spurts of steaming plasma through a blackened hole where its thyroid cartilage had been it also shattered the beasts spine and shocked its tiny brain to a standstill the warriors gaping mouth and nostrils issued thick yellow smoke its head was thrown up by the blast the propulsors flanking its anus fired one last time in nervous reflex reaction to send it in a clatter of chitin scales halfway up the external face of the rock where finally the thing shut down and as its grotesque lifeless body came cartwheeling back to earth some small distance away so nathan and lardis felt the ground shudder under their feet but there was still no time to spare nathan dug two more eggs out of his pocket and handed them to lardis said til be back left the other standing there as he conjured a mobius door and passed through it to the sentinel bluff where it stood close to the mouth of the great pass and looked out over the foothills to the boulder plains of starside also to anna marie english ben trask and david chung all of whom gasped and started in unison as he appeared how long was i he asked it had seemed like ages ten minutes at most trask answered him its grown a little darker down there on the plains but the stars have compensated they seem that much brighter bigger our friend down there hasnt moved much not that weve noticed he meant the wounded warrior there again weve not been doing much moving either nor are we feeling any warmer inactivity had chilled their blood im moving you nathan told them into battle but first we need arms threefifths of our arsenal is temporarily beyond reach so first we have to pick up whats left hold onto each other and if you think itll help you might try closing your eyes he conjured a door and guided them through it one after the other then stepped through after them and took them to the cavern of the ancients the trio of cavers were still there also atwei and several thyre males from placeundertheyellowcliffs when nathan and the others appeared as if from thin air all of the thyre with the exception of atwei were startled one of them even cried out but as atwei stepped forward and said nathan so he was recognized by all of them including a thyre elder but no time he wearily shook his head not for explanations or for anything else later maybe until then atwei will you continue to care for my friends these three men and this woman she nodded of course we will brother nathan turned to trask and chung where they stood staring all about in open astonishment ben david are you both familiar with the rest of these weapons as the cavers handed over the two remaining bundles of arms and ammunition the espers nodded their confirmation very well nathan said but since we cant afford to lose anything else lets do it here they broke open the bundles on the sandy floor and made their choice of weapons grenades ammunition for their machinepistols and three crossbows one of which was for nathan himself in all the coming and going he seemed to have lost his original weapon but quickly scanning what was left the necroscope felt a sinking sensation as he realized how little there actually was and how much time it would take to teach the szgany how to use flamethrowers selfloading rifles rocketlaunchers in fact he never would be able to teach them to fire the latter there were only half a dozen rockets and none to waste in practice no time to worry over that now however a second or two more to pick up a carton of a dozen exploding bolts and they were ready and lets go said nathan and took trask and chung to sanctuary rock where lardis lidesci and one other old friend of the necroscopes were waiting for them ill the battle at the rock lardis lidesci and andrei romani made an odd pair the one a born leader hotheaded full of fire vision action the other cool calm calculating a friend and adviser but both of them were fighters to the last drop of their blood theyd been the closest of friends all their lives they were united as all of lardiss szgany lidesci were united in their hatred of the wamphyri it was their apparent disparity that made their relationship so successful despite that the old lidesci frequently accepted and acted upon andreis advice he would never admit it and for all that andrei despaired of his leaders volatile temper lardiss tendency to leap before looking he knew it was the reason the szgany lidesci continued to survive lardis came of seer stock and something of that art was in him andrei had seen evidence of it before an uncanny knack of knowing when things werent quite right enabling him to calculate the odds in advance of calamity which was why andrei kept his advice to a minimum and acted mainly as lardiss principal support his righthand man and why the other valued him above all other men because he had the effect of cooling his toohot blood when without him it might boil over so their partnership worked and so the szgany lidesci survived or had survived until this night their looks were different too andrei romani was a lithe rangy man with nothing of fat but a great deal of muscle on his shoulders arms striding legs the years had cost him a lot of hair but little else his dark szgany eyes were still keen and his aim with a crossbow deadly thats why andrei was back in the cavern entrance even now to replenish his quiver with bolts for outside the handtohand fighting was fierce and bloody and handtohand he thought hurrying to a wooden barrel of ironwood bolts close to lardiss command position aye and its all down to crossbows these days now that the last of the dwellers shotgun shejjs are used up but for all that andreis shotgun his weapon out of another world was alien and more than twenty years old it had long been his pride and joy and he still kept it clean oiled polished just in case as for old well men grow old faster than machines and theyre that much harder to repair too lardis lidesci could tell you all about that who for the first time in his life had commenced to feel rheumatic twinges or growing pains as he was wont to call them in his knees and elbows but what else can he tejj me andrei wondered spying his leader through the smoke and turmoil and noticing a certain look on his face as if hed seen a ghost andrei went over to the other where he had moved to the central boulder and leaned against it took his arm and stared into his eyes and fired off questions without saying a word and he wondered about the old lidesci how he was his heart health his mind stability the hell of it was that was all he ever did wonder for there was never time to inquire lardis was short barrelbodied near apelike in the great length of his arms his lank black hair framed a weatherbeaten face where a flattened nose sat uncomfortably over a mouth missing several of its worn uneven teeth under shaggy eyebrows lardiss dark brown eyes glittered his minds agility even as the man himself remained agile despite his stumpy shape rheumatism and the inescapable fact of his mounting years for he was old now or at least starting to show his age twothirds of a lifetime spent fighting the wamphyri would age any man before his time another year or two and his only son jason would have stepped into his shoes except jason had been taken in that very first raid almost three and a half years ago since when no man had heard of him seeing nathan tonight had brought it all back to lardis alas that it had brought more than jason back and the thought that he too might be alive for nestor kiklu nathans brother had also been taken that night and he had been heard of lardis had seen it for himself some seventeen eighteen sunups ago nathan kiklu had returned from allegedly fantastic adventures in the mythical east beyond the great red waste where hed dwelled a while in the gorge of turgosheim as a companion or familiar to lord maglore the mage in the selfstyled magicians runemanse an aerie of the wamphyri there discovering that the powerful vormulac unsleep and the other wouldbe warriorlords of turgosheim were intent upon the imminent pursuit and punishment of the lady wratha and her renegades nathan had stolen a flyer with which to make his escape west that he had come out of turgosheim unscathed untainted had seemed a miracle in its own right but that hed done so in the saddle of a wamphyri flyer a fantastic adventure indeed but one which lardis had heard from nathans own lips so that hed accepted it and no sooner had the youth returned than he had taken a wife or rather shed taken him his girl misha zanesti had waited for him long enough and her father varna had seen to it that she would wait no longer then in the deep twilight before the night as the couple had returned from their nuptial trek back to sanctuary rock disaster lardis had gone out from the rock into the night to meet them and hasten them home and so hed seen it for himself and had witnessed the weirdness of it nathan and misha returning ajong a foothills track to the rock but descending towards them out of the twilights mist a pair of wamphyri flyers their riders could be lords lieutenants lardis didnt know but he knew what they were after and these young lovers out in the open unprotected and unsuspecting then theyd felt the throbbing of the mistdamp air glanced skywards seen hell descending out of the stars one beast and rider had gone after misha the other after nathan lardis had seen the girl take a tumble into a covered pit a trap for flyers and warriors alike she might be shaken even a little hurt but at least she was safe for the moment and so lardis had gone after nathan head over heels down a screeslide slithering on his rump and heels he had actually passed under one of the flyers where it floated down upon nathan its great manta wings formed into airscoops then lardis had collided with nathan and a moment later the pair of them had come to a halt at the bottom of the slope but relentless as some grotesque sentient shadow and almost as close the flyer had been right there behind them lardis was first on his feet hed turned his shotgun on the flyer discharged it pointblank into the creatures eyes once twice the things highpitched scream the frenzied lashing of its bloodied head left and right the insane pounding of its wings immeasurable satisfaction and yelling like a madman the old lidesci had reloaded and aimed his weapon again but this time at the vampire lord himself where he fought to control his injured mount which was when the mist had lifted a little and lardis and nathan too had seen just exactly who it was rocking in the saddle of his agonized beast nathans brother nestor lord nestor of the wamphyri but in that precise moment lardis had got off a shot which he was certain found its mark whether or no the injured flyer had lifted off into the mist and nothing more seen of beast or rider following which it should have been over but wasnt for breaking through the mist the second flyer had snatched nathan up and made off with him and just like jason and nestor before him neither had he been seen to this day so that lardis had suspected he was dead until tonight but if nathan still lived then what of jason lardiss son lost so long ago and what of nestor the lord nestor as he was now or as lardis had last seen him with his face torn to a splash of blood against the mistgrey night except lardis hadnt really recognized him then not then and not for some little time it was only later when he went to his bed slept and nightmared the thing through that hed seen that awful face again scarleteyed and bloated with black hatred but young and proud for all that and in outline at least the very image of the one hed come to kill then in his dreams lardis had known hed suspected that nathan knew too but nathan had no longer been here to ask and of course lardis had never dared speak to nana kiklu about it and certainly not to misha poor misha shed got back her lover only to lose him again the strength of the girl that she hadnt fallen apart from it all and all of it beginning to connect up in lardiss mind solidifying there making sense at last nestor kiklu a vampire lord and this sudden attack on sanctuary rock which had always been the szgany lidescis best kept secret of course nestor had told them but why not before hed probably been one of them since the time he was stolen away nestor and nathan rivals for misha zanesti was that it nathans love had brought him back most definitely and against all odds at that but nestor nathans jove and nestors what hatred but they were twin brothers born of one womb in the same hour ah but nestor was wamphyri now blood brothers aye what is it my friend andrei romanis anxious inquiry drew the other out of it out of the past and his morbid reverie both and back into the fearfraught present what have you seen whats wrong eh lardis looked at him not what ive seen but who who aye lardiss curt nod and not whats wrong but right i hope will you explain let these explain said lardis and showed him nathans grenades but before the other could say a word no let him explain and lardis pointed across the cavern nathan trask and chung had emerged from the mobius continuum against the wall of the cavern where nathan had put in his first appearance andrei took in all three at a glance but mainly nathan and like lardis he knew him at once what but thats nathan kiklu he gasped before falling silent lost for words the three came hurrying through the hustle and bustle but this time not unnoticed a group of sweating grimy sharpeyed men stepped forward pinioning their arms as they drew close to lardis the old lidesci quickly cautioned them now hold for i know these men theyre friends be about your business andrei still couldnt speak and he noticed that the two with nathan seemed similarly shocked stumbling incapacitated but it only lasted a few seconds then nathan and andrei grasped forearms in the customary szgany greeting and so did the strangers with andrei and lardis both not so strange after all and andrei said nathan put that down he took andreis crossbow and handed him a new one brand new the oil still gleaming on it as for bolts nathan held up a fistful use these but careful how you handle them and dont drop them when you go out stick close to lardis and watch his back when we go out andreis mouth had difficulty staying shut even when he wasnt speaking thats right nathan nodded into the thick of it now listen if you come up against warriors lardis has the answer right there in his hands he indicated the grenades as for these bolts theyll kill thralls lieutenants even flyers and theyll kill them dead lardis pocketed the grenades took the second of nathans three crossbows and a fistful of explosive bolts and growled is there a plan nathan shook his head only to destroy our enemies and save the rock sounds like a good one to me lardis and andrei headed for the cavern entrance where again the sounds of battle were on the increase but when nathan and the others didnt follow they looked back and saw that the necroscope and his helllander friends were gone up into the foothills directly above the rock from which vantage point to look down on the fighting and take their pick of opponents and those flyers trask pointed down there on the trails where they lead to the rock there must be seven or eight of them maybe more with all this smoke and fire its hard to tell but if we could take out the flyers nathan shook his head not all of them there are lieutenants down there too if we cut off their escape route they can only stand and fight i mean to the very end and that would mean more szgany losses half of them then said chung then when those monsters see whats happening to their mounts theyll likely make a run for it okay take us down there nathan and lets see what we can do perhaps surprised the necroscope looked at him frowned youre ready not really but as ready as i ever will be chungs grin was nervous now nathan seemed worried about it theres still so much you dont know i mean there are traps down there camouflaged pits in the earth flyertraps mainly but warriortraps too dont make a mistake and fall into one and dont get too much blood on you it isnt especially active in itself unless its from a lord or senior lieutenant which could be dangerous in your eyes nose mouth but well you cant be too careful son trask told him you had better believe that well be careful we fought with your father on earth remember and we were careful there too just get us down there the sooner this is over the better very well but keep within hailing distance then if you see lieutenants or thralls coming you can call for me without more ado he conjured a door guided trask through it and out into a part of the flyer launchingarea which was farthest from the rock where monstrous grey shapes nodded in the mist not very far away then good luck ben nathan told him leaving him there it was chungs turn and nathan dropped him off a little closer to the rock but in a place where there was no sign of human or rather inhuman activity just continuing sounds of fierce fighting from the neardistant rock and finally the necroscope located himself at the head of the column of flyers so that he would be the first to note any retreat of the lieutenants from their frontline positions nathan chose a flyer ran towards it through drifting smoke and reek lobbed a grenade that bounced and rolled to a standstill directly under the flyers nodding head a moment later the detonation was so vicious that it stripped the creatures face of flesh hurling back its head so violently that the tapering neck was broken in the whiplash and again nathan felt the power of these weapons from another world and thrilled to it well and why not as the wamphyri and their creatures thralls lieutenants took pleasure in destroying men so he could rejoice in destroying them what was their warcry wamphyri wamphyri nathan felt like shouting human human he chose another target a second grey head nodding and mistwreathed maybe thirty yards away except someone was coming crouching low panting someone whose eyes were feral yellow glowing like gold in the dark a lieutenant nathan snatched his crossbow from his belt nocked its wire loaded the bolt was aware that the vampire was almost upon him he lifted his arm and hand head and eyes and saw a flameeyed demon with jaws gaping and arms outstretched rushing at him he squeezed the trigger then hurled himself backwards and to one side the lieutenant mewled like a mad thing as he staggered snatched at the bolt in the right of his chest and tried to draw it out sprawling in the dirt of the trail nathan turned his face away and with a sound like a crack of doom flesh and innards went flying in all directions and half a man staggered this way and that upon the old trail before collapsing in grotesque and bloody disarray behind nathan lost in the smoke and rolling mist there were other explosions dim flashes of light but these werent the softsounding pyrotechnics of lardiss inferior gunpowder they came with a series of crisp cracks which even the swirling mist couldnt deaden it had to be trask and chung about their deadly work good from the other direction however towards sanctuary rock hoarse cries of rage and terror screams the throb and sputter of warrior propulsors the occasional whine and careening flare of a rocket run wild but nathan knew that lardis was there he had heard at least two explosions which could only be caused by grenades the old lidesci had already expended his most effective weapons necessarily nathan was sure the necroscopes blood was up and up there in the front line he knew that blood was being spilled good clean szgany blood some of it spilled or perhaps changed forever the idea of transferring himself into that zone was terrifying but that was why he was here if he didnt at least try to make sunsidestarside safe for his people then what was the point he used the mobius route back up into the foothills for orientation then transferred down onto the approach trail to the main cavern entrance maybe one hundred and twenty yards from the foot of the massive outcrop a defensive arrangement of covered pits and trenches had been dug in the hard earth and rock in plan the pits formed two concentric semicircles ringing the entrance in they were eccentrically positioned so that any advancing enemy who avoided the first row must run right into the second on the ground however and due to the declining terrain the rocks defences presented an even more complicated picture enemy forces approaching from the forest must push uphill towards the rock while those from the east could follow the more or less even flow of the foothill contours lardis had known this too when hed dug his pits it was why in addition hed drug a trench behind the pits on the level ground and that was where the thick of the fighting was taking place even now but pits and trenches were not the rocks only defences thirty yards within the inner circle a low drystone wall had been built with upward tilting kilnglazed pipes of clay cemented in position every other pace providing launchtubes for the stems of lardiss rockets the old lidescis missile battery the wall was mainly drystone to allow for rapid rebuilding in the event that it was breached flattened by the sheer bulk of a warrior and every other pace were stout wooden stakes with their points sharpened to needles also facing outwards to impale onrushing monsters also at the base of the rock itself where that colossal boulders roots buried themselves in the earth halfhidden in the natural camouflage of screegrown vines and shrubbery a second battery this time of stonehurling engines and giant crossbows with bolts formed of young arrowstraight strippeddown pines while inside the covered pits beds of slender stakes harpoontipped to catch and hold any flyer warrior or vampire thrall that might fall on them and recesses in the walls where men could wait with buckets of oil and flints and candles at the ready most of the pits on the level were on fire their withe frames of twisted straw and gorse camouflage going up in smoke and flame into the reeking night meat was steaming in several of them while others were simply smoking blackened holes in the earth the hot air was full of death smells that caught in mens throats making them choke retch nathan had emerged from the continuum behind the rocks defenders where the fortified wall faced first the trench then the twin rows of pits since the men on the rocks side of the wall were all facing the other way hed stepped into existence all unseen and now for the first time he saw evidence of the handtohand fighting how it had washed to and fro over this very spot obviously the warrior which he and lardis had dispatched in the cavern entrance had been accompanied by vampire thralls led by lieutenants there were a number of corpses littering the stony ground many of them without heads the ones with heads were human his own people szgany killed in the fighting their wounds were horrific the work of wamphyri gauntlets flensed faces chests laid open through flesh and ribs throats ripped out literally even through a swirling ground mist it could be seen that the earth was stained black in the fire and starlight and the whole area stank of brutal butchery and blood it had been scenes such as this scenes as violent mindstunning as this that had driven nathan from his cause and course in the first place out into sunsides furnace desert to die only to discover the thyre his ability to talk to the dead and fresh hope for the future and now this was that future and he must fight to come to terms with it get a grip on himself his soaring emotions he didnt have the time to stand and consider what had happened here it could all too easily happen again if he simply stood still and let it but terrible memories had been set in motion and terrible scenes out of a none too distant past inescapable as a recurrent nightmare nathan viewed them as a ghostly tableau against the equally surreal swirlysmoking backdrop of mist fire and bloodsplashed night that time when hed searched for his brother stolen by a flyer out of ravaged settlement the szgany sintana true travellers in sunsides forests had befriended him and in turn nathan had made them a promise if he couldnt find nestor then he would join them where they planned to establish a permanent camp at the edge of the sprawling savanna dividing the forest from the furnace deserts the reason they would settle there was simple that much closer to the sun and distant from the barrier mountains it had seemed unlikely that the wamphyri would venture there that had been the reasoning anyway and when nathan was done with his searching thats where hed found them or what was left of them nikha sintana and eleni his sister their faces and the faces of their people haunted nathan still nikha young in years old in his ways wild as the woods and gentle as its creatures but hard in the ways of survival so it had seemed the actual number of his years had been a secret hidden in the agelessness of his penetrating intelligent brown eyes and in skin weathered to a supple leather he had seemed like part of the landscape at one with nature his hooked nose sharp as a kites beak but lacking its cruelty his brow with the flat slope of a wolfs yet broad enough to accommodate a good brain and wide inscrutable eyes his thin lips and dark grey shoulderlength hair nikha had reminded nathan of nothing so much as a lean and rangy hunting owl and eleni maybe twenty twentyone years old and typically szgany all lithe and sinuous movements smooth as oil shiny black hair and skin tanned to a glow shed seemed as wild even wilder than her brother given the chance and in a better world eleni would be ever vivacious and live her life to the full her mouth had been generous and sensuous at one and the same time with a laugh that was husky and teasing but never quite seducing because when finally she did love the chosen one would get it all and because at that time nathan had thought that misha was dead he had even considered becoming that one but it hadnt worked out that way following their trail through the night to where the forest met the prairie at last hed seen the carts and caravans of the szgany sintana sheltering under mighty ironwoods their fire had been a welcoming splash of leaping light holding back the shadows in the space under the trees it had welcomed nathan aye but in the same way that it had welcomed others before him the wamphyri they werent there now but the evidence of their having been was unmistakable nathan remembered it as if it were but a moment ago he stood under the ironwoods where the dusty ground had been swept free of needles to form a small clearing in its own right but in the shadows bloated black shapes like windblown weeds went lumping and fluttering low along the ground hiding from him in dark places then as he heard a chittering in the night and started in recognition of the sound something wet dripped down and splashed on his forearm where his sleeves were rolled up looking down he saw that his arm was red likewise the earth under his feet and looking up he saw the trees strange ripe fruit all dripping their juices strung up by their heels with their throats slashed ear to ear the drained corpses of the szgany sintana swaying there on creaking ropes under the branches of the ironwoods and all festooned with black desmodus bats wamphyri familiars so glutted with blood they couldnt fly and these loathsome bloated monsters falling or flopping to the ground and scuttling off into the shrieking night the shrieking night instinctively nathan crouched down and shot a terrified glance overhead as if expecting to see a body dangling by its heels and dripping blood but it was only a szgany rocket gone offcourse which showered sparks on him and whistled off into the mist its shrieking had startled him to life except it wasnt the only thing that shrieked or roared looking around perhaps in desperation lardis had seen the necroscope nathan quick he ran to the knot of defenders at the wall joined lardis and his men lardis pointed east to the trench pits and the swirling mist beyond weve fought them off once twice the first wave came with the warrior that we destroyed at the entrance and the second was made up of thralls on a suicide mission those who are left are mainly lieutenants but they are the most dangerous and theyve called down another warrior look a handful of tall grey figures moved in the mist around the perimeter of one of the innermost pits from the sinuous loping flow of their movements they were plainly lieutenants along with them a halfdozen vampire thralls held up leather shields against incoming bolts from the defenders at the wall so protecting their superiors and shouting instructions all of them urged action from a warrior where it had fallen into the pit a small one of its sort the creature floundered it was caught on harpoon flukes and several of its gasbladders had been ruptured in the event of it freeing itself however this superficial damage wouldnt impede its fighting ferocity its monstrous thirst for blood war indeed its frustration would make it yet more ferocious but jammed awkwardly in the hole it had difficulty bringing its thrusters and propulsors into play hence the things roaring the occasional sputter of its propulsors and jets of noxious fumes issuing from the pit even as nathan and lardis watched so the creature got its monstrous head up over the rim and the glare of the red eyes in its bony prowlike chitinscaled slope of a forehead threatened the defenders at the wall with a nightmarish death its propulsors fired again and the horror jerked halfway out of the pit nathan had two grenades left handing one of them to lardis he said now they squeezed through a breach in the wall ran forward were met by eager lieutenants loping the other way in anticipation of their warriors imminent attack but andrei romani and other defenders were right on their leaders heels crossbow bolts flew in the night passing far too close by nathans reckoning a lieutenant was swatted from his feet and blown to bits before he hit the ground a flameeyed thrall cursed and spat where he writhed upon the earth tugging frantically at ironwood bolts in his chest and belly snarling men fell on him with sharp knives hammers stakes nathan and lardis left the handtohand fighting behind arrived at the pit armed their grenades lieutenants came at the run out of the smoke and mist the pair lobbed their grenades into the pit then turned and fled andrei was still with them he fired the last of his explosive bolts into a lieutenants shoulder and joined them in flight behind them there was an explosion the sharp crack of a bolt and now nathan thought the warrior roared its triumph as it bunched its thrusters and its propulsors sputtered into life but just a moment too late twin blasts tore the night accompanied by brilliant flashes of light and an agonized mewling as chitin scales and chunks of raw flesh shot skywards the detonations had cracked the things carapace setting fire to its mantle and gasbladders lesser explosions and the flames that roared up to hurl back the shadows and the mewling that climbed the scales to a continuous highpitched screaming signalled the monsters finish then arriving back at the wall nathan heard it the lady wrathas raging and her final command from her vantage point on the dome of the rock fools weak fools what and have mere men the szgany lidesci defeated you yet again get out of there those of you who may flee flee for your jives aye for we your masters and i your mistress would have words with you back in wrathstack wrathas promise or threat was all too evident in the grating of her hideous mind croak nathan took lardiss arm theyre pulling out theyve had enough its all over for now anyway lardis looked snarled his triumph then shook his fist j and laughed like a lunatic nathan was right lieutenants and thralls were vacating their positions slinking back into the mist making for their flyers but from back along the trail out of the blood and sulphur reek the night and its leaping shadows there sounded a sudden stuttering of automatic fire trask and chung picking off vampire thralls where they tried to make their escape nathan used the mobius continuum picked up his friends transferred them back to lardis and the defenders at the wall they were safe now all of them well from the wamphyri at least if not from the nightmare of what must follow in that respect it would be as well if anna marie english and the others were at least offered the opportunity to see it too and so know what they were into with that in mind nathan collected them from the cavern of the ancients when they were all together again and perfunctory introductions concluded very well said lardis lidesci nodding grimly where he surveyed the littered battlefield and now lets be at it all of which had been something less than thirtyfive minutes ago but on high over the barrier mountains and heading home the wamphyri were still feeling bruised by their defeat and wratha was still raging albeit in her secret mind raging and rotating the facts of the night those known and others as yet unknowable but facts nevertheless because they had happened in the depths of her secret vampire thoughts she should be grateful to nestor that he had warned her not to land as she made her descent but she was not how had the necromancer known there was danger how had he a veritable infant among the wamphyri seen or sensed that which she had not what but hed been a lord for less than three years so he spoke to dead men so what that one on top of sanctuary rock had been very much alive but no longer what was this thing with nestor and the szgany lidesci again a picture formed in the ladys mind of the one on the rock him and his deadly tube nestors great enemy and much like lardis lidesci before her wratha wondered at the connection nestor misha and a great enemy or a great rival was that it was he still mooning over this traveller shad misha was that why hed finally set himself against the szgany lidesci because he had a rival among them but if so why wait so long also wratha had thought that that had been all over and done with following nestors last abortive strike against this socalled great enemy and it still didnt explain how he had known there was danger on the rocks roof was nestor using her to his own ends she wondered using the rest of them too as a punitive force in some private feud in which case tonights losses were all down to him and raging still she told herself very well lets see how he reacts to this then opening her mind for all to see and hear and using her mentalism to the full she cried now hear my vow i wratha the risen make it and i shall keep it from now on it is sacred to me and i make it so that you all may know it and call me wratha vowbreaker if i do not keep it i shall destroy the szgany lidesci by skill or trickery wit or sheer unbendable will by the blood that is the life i shall destroy them wratha had made such vows before but never out in the open where she could be held to them ah but no one would have to hold her to this one be sure as she had spoken so wratha had cast a sideways glance at nestor at him and into his mind or at least she had tried but his mind was clamped shut as a lichen to its rock impenetrable he sat there pale as new lead in his saddle his body swathed and his face cowled and rode the night wind and never a sign that he had even heard her he was that cold or seemed to be until all mine who are able to me he called abruptly theres a j deed must be done any who are injured damaged get on i back to the last aerie and wait on my return he and his peeled off swooped southwards and letting a tailwind off the icelands take them they quickly dwindled to gnats in the clouds scudding high over sunsides forests astonished wratha and the others let them go and carried on homewards but the lady wondered what now is he also a madman this necromancer before she could consider it further ho wratha came a shouted greeting across the gulf of air and all you others there but a sorry looking lot if ever i saw one it was gorvi the guile wheeling on the wind and coming up alongside to where wratha and the lords spearheaded their reduced forces gorvi and his flyer alone have i missed something i wonder he continued quieter now well perhaps it were better missed at that it appears you had problems he seemed to commiserate but in fact they knew he gloated until he looked back at the tattered remnants of the army that had left wrathstack and especially at what was left of his own contingent then what gorvi gasped but how have you protected my men and creatures wratha what has become of them his words were supposed to be accusing yet sounded as a wail the cry of a wrongful child who knows hes about to be smacked where were you gorvi wrathas growl sounded in his mind and the mental voices of all the others with her gorvi would babble an answer a wellrehearsed excuse concerning a deadly force of strangers on starsides boulder plains but before he could do so there came a diversion a giant desmodus bat one of wrathas familiars appeared out of the east in a whirring of tired wings and settled to the neck of her mount there the creature clung exhausted finally folding back its black membrane wings and chittering a faint but not that faint message and wratha at once straightened up rigid in her saddle the language of bats ranges from the faint to the fantastic from barely audible to seeming silence in the ears of common humanity but to the wamphyri each note is distinct and has meaning and the meaning of wrathas familiar was clear it was one of two creatures which shed positioned as sentinels in the eastern peaks at the edge of the great red waste her earlywarning system against a surprise attack out of turgosheim which was why it was here now so that gorvi the guile was the only one among them who actually felt a sense of relief as a certain dreaded name took form in the suddenly whirling chaos of wratha the risens mind but even his relief was only temporary for the worst fears of each and every one of them were suddenly come true then the ladys jaw fell open and her eyes stood out like lamps in her gaunt and haggard face and she beat her breast and cried her frustration why now why now until finally she croaked the very last name that any of her colleagues had ever wanted to hear vormulac what of him wran the rage gasped in her mind unwilling to believe it despite that he knew hes crossed the great red waste she answered speaking to all of them at once hes here in the east of olden starside even now our mortaj if not our immortaj enemy lord vormulac unsleep of turgosheim him and his aye and they are many iv vormulac in turgosheim maglore the mage had been busy for a night and a day which was the equivalent of an entire week in a parallel world currently beyond lord maglores ken hed been busy ever since the warriorlord vormulac taintspore called unsleep had ventured forth from melancholy vormspire and from the gorge of turgosheim itself into the unknown west with his vampire army that had been in the twilight before the night and how maglore had gloated where he watched from the roof of runemanse as his supposed colleagues and all their creatures vacated the gorge to fly west in the shadow of the mountains bound for a legendary land of plenty beyond the great red waste in the eye of memory he could see it even now the beginning of that grand crusade and all the pomp and splendour of vormulacs marvellous exit from turgosheim but quite apart from his ambitions to actually witness that exodus had been a wonderful experience to stand there on the roof of promontory runemanse with karpath seersthrall his righthand man watching first the flypast then the departure to see the massed might of turgosheim on parade as it were under its many generals and all of them under vormulacs overall command the gradually burgeoning whorl of that aerial army within and level with the rim of the gorge as emerging from the landingbays of individual spires and manses the contingents filled their spaces within the soaring ranks aweinspiring the gleam of polished leather bodyarmour ironstudded trappings golden ornamentation the raucous banging and blaring of drums gongs and horns from the various aeries where common thralls made noise to speed their masters to victory in far foreign places the rumbling cough and sputter of warrior exhausts then to see the great spiral unwind as vormulac unsleep himself led the column westwards out of the gorge to recognize and check off the various sigils standards and pennants fluttering in the vile slipstream of propulsive gases where they passed level with maglore and dwindled into distance vormulacs own hanging man emblem grigor haksons odious rampant rod the virgin grandam devetakis grinscowl mask the lady ursula torspawns szgany bells lord eran painscars spiny gauntlet lord tangirus warriortooth necklace zuns bloodied tusks and lady zindevar cronesaps spitted pig and many another they had all been there lorn halfstruck lord of trollmanse lady valeria of valspire black boris who kept trog

fregscarp laughing zack shornskull of zackspire oh and at least a dozen and a half more noticeable if only by their absence were such as wran the rage and spiro killglance wratha the risen canker canison vasagi the suck and gorvi the guile but since ostensibly they had been the spur for this allegedly punitive expedition that was only to be expected for in fact all six of them were fled into the unknown west where theyd hidden themselves away for more than three years now and where vormulac and his army hoped to seek them out to punish them for treason against all of turgosheims wamphyri but in fact they had committed no such heinous crime nor any crime at all or only a middling one at best for in truth wratha and her gang had only ever sought to be what they were wamphyri which by reason of turgosheims politics was a sort of treason in itself against zolteism and hah maglore thought zolteism indeed turgo zolte had been the father of them all the founder of turgosheim who had fled with his children out of the west from the wrath of shaitan the unborn but all of that was history an immemorial legend as for zolteism that was turgos legacy and some would say his curse for of all the wamphyri who had been and were to be turgo was the one who had denied himself to do battle with his leech he had been and had continued to be his own man even unto death following which the creed of zolteism was passed down to them who survived him in turgosheim the blood is the life aye but in moderation to lust after power territory thralls and possessions is the way of life in moderation the thrill of the kill is a joy but all in moderation and according to rules that was the essence of zolteism to deny ones parasite keep it in its place and be master of ones own urges ones own destiny moreover turgos creed had been seen to make sense the szgany of turgosheims sunside had become so reduced in number that the bloodwars must cease or the wamphyri themselves die out from lack of nourishment for in the beginning in turgosheims youth the interstack wars had been many and the toll in human lives in szgany beasts and vitals in general enormous without that zolteism was enforced the blood itself would soon become enfeebled run cold run out thus if the vampire lords would live so must the creed and of course the weakest of them had been eager to embrace it or if not the weakest the wisest certainly it was all history now aye but the creed had survived and maglore the mage had been a true zolteist an ascetic all of his days well within limits of course maglore and devetaki skullguise even vormulac unsleep himself ascetics of sorts for these three had been turgosheims secret triumvirate its regulators who recognized the folly of depleting sunside to the dregs and besides life had been good for them in their mighty manses towering high over turgosheims lesser knolls and hovels until wratha the risen and her renegades had made warriors that flew and with them had flown out of turgosheim into the fabled west that was their crime that of their own admission wratha and her outlaws had stolen forbidden flesh out of sunside from which to build millenniabanned constructs also that they had cheated in the tithe in order to further improve their get but it was not why vormulac had ordered his massive war effort culminating these three years later in a socalled crusade no that had been done out of fear fear that indeed a fabulous land of plenty lay far to the west beyond the great red waste and that the lady would utilize its riches to build an invincible vampire army of her own and fear that she would return one night and wrest turgosheim from its rightful leaders for in her time shed made a habit of rising up and returning this lady which was why they had named her wratha the risen in his room of meditation these were some of the thoughts that passed through maglores mind as he gazed upon his golden sigil shewstone and considered putting it to use where was wratha now he wondered and where vormulac and how would it go when they met or collided and where for that matter was nathan maglores window on an unknown world that was why the seerlord merely considered using the mobius loop sigil because the last time hed done so well it had been to discover that the crafty nathan was oh so much more crafty than maglore had ever guessed oh he had long suspected that nathan was a weird one but never the extent of his weirdness still with all of those unknown miles between and the great red waste itself as a buffer zone where would the harm be but being a mage of sorts and certainly a seer maglore respected the talents of others and despite that he was wamphyri and knew no real fear for the time being he curbed his curiosity with regard to nathan and turned instead to vormulac for prior to lord taintspores departure his old friend and colleague maglore had given him a goodluck piece a golden ring for his ear in the shape of a twisted figure of eight maglores sigil surely a sign of undying even undead friendship that a man honour another with his own talisman the sign of his house and being and so in precisely the same way that nathan kiklu wore a ring of gold six inches from the centre of his brain so now vormulac unsleep absent vampire lord of melancholy vormspire wore another an hour and a half had passed since maglore last expended psychic effort on that powerful image that abstract symbol of alien mathematics during which interval hed taken sustenance and satisfied other appetites now replete and a deal more relaxed he would try again vormulac yes so thinking and closing his mind to everything else he rested long talonlike hands on the massy gleaming strangely twisted loop of gold and sent his seers probe winging west in search of the warriorlord taintspore and in another moment vormulac unsleeps mood was black as his soul would be if he had one the flight out of turgosheim and across the great red waste into these unknown western parts had been arduous to say the very least in fact and in proper perspective it had been a hairraising nailbiting apparently endless nightmare of a journey of course lord vormulac would never dream of admitting such to any of the lesser lords throughout he had appeared the great leader entirely unshakable utterly inscrutable the warriorlord vormulac of turgosheim but to himself on several occasions he had wished that hed never set out and thered been as many times again when hed thought he would never see it through known for his fits of melancholy as well as for his might now that most powerful lord of the wamphyri looked more morose withdrawn and doomfraught than ever yet at the same time seated upright and solid as a rock in the saddle of his flyer at the head of what had been an awesome army he seemed more determined too for hed made a vow of vengeance those three long years ago after wratha had flown the coop and he wasnt about to deny himself the pleasure of sealing it now vormulac was a huge man almost seven feet tall he was no strict adherent to zolteism but neither was he a glutton he had not dealt his fellow lords ill not even in his prime his forces had never attacked other than in the defence of vormspire but when on occasion he had been obliged to make war then it had been utter and ruthless vormulac was a hard man eighty years ago hed lain gonarspire and trogmanse to waste bound their masters in chains and hung them out to dry where the suns hot smelt would discover and dispose of them since when the gorge had stayed relatively free from internal feuding despite that vormulac had ascended to vormspire all of one hundred and twenty years ago he kept his head shaved and wore the forelocks of a common thrall a creature of lifelong habit what had suited his old master engor sporeson in an earlier age continued to suit vormulac to this day his thralls his lieutenants and even his women were similarly cropped and several younger lords had emulated the fashion not least laughing zack shornskull of zackspire vormulacs forelocks having lost most of their jet sheen through long years of sleeplessness were irongrey as if covered in dust they were plaited and finished with lead weights which dangled onto his nipples his eyes not quite uniformly crimson but marked with yellow flecks were closeset and deepsunken in ochre orbits his nose was long slender and sharply hooked at the bridge its convolutions and the gape of its nostrils were less marked than in most lords but its great length was a singular anomaly its tip came down almost to the centre of his upper lip lending his looks a hawkish severity severe yes yet melancholy too some said it was a lost love had robbed him of seventy years sleep others had it that he feared to sleep lest starting awake he might find himself a leper as his old master before him only combine the two theories and something of the truth would be known vormulac himself had mastered the art of not dwelling upon it except when he slept which was why he didnt nor had he slept this last sunup but had weathered out an entirely wretched day in the shade of the barrier mountains sitting in a cave with only the meat of trogs and a cup of vile mushroom wine for consolation and thoughts of red revenge of course against wratha whose fault it was that he was here at all now flying west again in the early hours of sundown he found himself looking back on the misadventure so far as it had proceeded with something of relief and thanking whichever star he was born under that things had not been worse first the planning which had not been of the best but vormulacs generals had thought if wratha the risen managed it in total secrecy with mainly untried men and monsters and no apparent effort all of a hundred and fifty sunups ago then there cant be that much to it how can we fail with all the thought and effort that were putting into it and having the choicest materials out of sunside with which to work then as if simply thinking these things had been enough the very idea of failure had been put aside thought and effort had become less than adequate liaison and cooperation between the manses had broken down as the vampire lords vied to create the finest contingent of men and fighting creatures for vormulacs aerial army the thrill or glory of the coming venture far outweighed any niggling doubts with regard to the possibility of failure in short the lords and ladies of turgosheim were grown overconfident but contrary to their beliefs and prior to wrathas departure from the gorge she had worked in close liaison with her conspirators and because their departure had been an escape from dire punishment theyd put that much more effort into it it had only looked easy by virtue of its simplicity a handful of aerial warriors and a dozen or so of lieutenants and flyers not much in the way of logistical problems there a fuelling stop in the western heights of the mountains before attempting the great red waste finally the mighty leap westwards into the unknown simple aye the differences had been these that wratha the risens party had been small while vormulac commanded a polyglot and potentially unruly army that her constructs were comparatively light creatures and built for flight because she had dispensed with weapons ornamentation and almost every other unnecessary encumbrance or accessory of war and death in favour of the basic requirements of life while the warriorlord unsleeps creatures were weighty and armoured to the hilt for battle and that while she pursued ambition she was herself pursued out of frustration revenge and fear not only differences but positive advantages to the lady that is and one more advantage which vormulac was only now beginning to take into account wratha had fled knowing that she would be pursued so that by now surely three years had been time enough for her to take adequate precautions wherever she was now in whatever manse she called home the place would be a fortress be sure but fortresses have fallen before and so would this one when vormulac found it then there would be war a bloodwar aye if only to pay the lady back for all of his troubles now in the eye of memory the warriorlord reviewed those troubles which had started as early as stage one the refuelling stop on the westernmost jut of the eastern range wratha had stopped there too at the beginning of her flight into the west after shed gone vormulac had sent his lieutenants to check the place out theyd found signs of her halt spilled meal from her flyers feedbags beastdroppings various other signs yes her creatures had refuelled themselves there and so had wratha and her renegades as witness the discarded clothing of several thralls after she and her lads had drained the thralls of their lifeblood then their cadavers would have gone to the warriors there had been just four of those one of which vormulac remembered very well indeed the handiwork of canker canison that had been a terrible construct it had all but wrecked the great hall in vormspire and would have wrecked vormulac and the others too if they hadnt escaped into boltholes it had been as a direct result of that nightmare that the lords had proved so zealous in the construction of their own warriors but lord unsleep couldnt fault them there he had built a thing or two himself in the last three years and not all of them successful either but of the seventy fighting creatures that did finally set out that night from turgosheim with vormulac taintspore his fellow lords and ladies and their one hundred and twenty lieutenants and thralls they had been warriors aye and twothirds of them too hungry too hotblooded too loadeddown with armourplate and all manner of fearsome but unwieldy appendages too chitinplated gouges grapples retractable claws huh just how unwieldy had been seen at that first landing wrathas choice of a refuelling stop had been a flat summit a mainly sheersided plateau where the last of the peaks and rockpiles tumbled to the smoking ochre desert which formed a skirt around the great red waste for her purposes the place had been ideal because shed landed less than two dozen creatures in all but for vormulac a disaster for he was attempting to land one hundred and seventy and there simply wasnt room there might have been space enough if the generals had proceeded in an orderly fashion but as the lords at the rear of the column had seen those at the front landing so it had become apparent that the choicest of the laidup provisions would go to the first down in all likelihood the last down would get nothing at all and between here and olden starside in the unknown west if that alleged land of plenty existed there was nothing but the great red waste neitherfood of any sort nor drink nor any sustenance at all other than what they carried which meant the beasts of cours and the men themselves then breaking ranks all of the lords and ladies alike had vied to be first in line for food after vormulac and in the ensuing melee the warriorlord himself had been fortunate not to get run off the edge of the plateau what a mess it should have been orderly yes but the wamphyri are greedy and territorial each man or woman for him or herself and to hell with the hindermost they had practised rattling their gauntlets aye and parading their creatures the issue of their vats but knew nothing of cooperation also a good many of them were rivals there were old feuds to be settled and old scars still itching why they would never have come together at all if not for vormulacs crusade and what with all the jostling the jibes and the taunting the suddenly electric tension the throb of hot blood nerves balanced on a knifeedge tempers fraying flyers tilting this way and that their vampire riders cursing shouting hauling on the reins all desperate to discover a patch of dust in which to flop down warriors accidentally colliding as they made their approach runs then doing it again but deliberately as finally the tempers of men and beasts both shattered into shards wamphyri and in the midst of the melee the first bloody scuffle then two three an uproar while on the rim of the rock many of the thralls lieutenants flyers and warriors who were already down found themselves pushed into space as a massive tugowar over the provisions milled to and fro this way and that the plateau was a high one some who fell from the rim had time to form airfoil shapes and save themselves most of the flyers survived of course and several of the warriors but others injured in the fighting simply plunged to the scree and boulder bottoms where for them the crusade came to an abrupt end finally the dust had settled and vormulac stamped here and there shouting clouting browbeating the rest into submission and demanding the presence of the idiot planner whose idea it had been to refuel here en masse that task had gone to zestos kalkas a lesser lord who now appeared to be absent there was a man of his however doing his utmost to look fierce as he stepped forward in answer to vormulacs call then it had come out how zestos and his senior lieutenants had been swept from the rim gaul had witnessed it with his own eyes which now were nervous wary huh then it appears youve ascended lord unsleep had told him without further ado but perhaps my lord kalkas is alive down there he might have been alive up here vormulac had at once growled but not for long for if he were alive i would bind him in chains myself and hurl him from the rim the fool and after a moments thought i have a suggestion yes my lord take a flyer descend find zestos cut out his parasite and accept its egg at that gauls feral eyes had seemed to light with a red internal fire preempting his actual ascension yes my lord indeed and listen vormulac had told him youre lucky youre one of his and i should kill you too but i need a man to lead his contingent whats left of it yes my lord with which gaul kalksman had scurried off to find a flyer but at that it hadnt worked out too badly three flyers and six warriors lost over the edge four more of each damaged on landing three lords and some seven lieutenants either killed accidentally or slain in the fighting along with perhaps fifteen thralls as for those injured in the fray they had been put to death and so became part and parcel of the provisions theyd fought over it seemed only right by then the sun had been well down the hurtling moon was up the refuelling had been attended to and no time to spare for no man knew how wide was the great red waste a hundred or a thousand or five thousand miles but all knew how long was sundown morning must not find them in flight but flown over the wastelands and landed in the west then we take off in order vormulac had shouted for everyone to hear once up spread out make room the sky is wide but keep the same ceiling i go first and the rest follow on fainthearts may fall out now go back to turgosheim keep old maglore company the blood we seek is only for the strong you lords are responsible for your men as they are for their beasts within your own contingents during the journey any who are lost through weakness are lost make good use of them before surrendering their scraps to the great red waste we go with which hed lifted off on his flyer found a thermal and risen up until a band of orange light cracked the southern horizon so much for altitude any higher and they would catch up with the sun and it with them so vormulac had headed west while behind him the whorl of his army had straightened itself out like the coils of some strange aerial snake and before too long the stench of acid vapours had come drifting up from the great red waste vormulac couldnt know it but despite all of wratha the risens advantages three years earlier she too had experienced difficulties cankers warrior had been the most heavily armoured of her partys constructs and it had used up a deal of energy and suffered some small damage in rescuing wratha and the others from melancholy vormspire the landing the fighting the relaunching but out over the great red waste the thing had paid the price in full its loss had scarcely been mourned its vital fluids and flesh had served to fuel the rest of them on their way likewise with vormulacs army for less than eight hours after setting out devetaki skullguise had drawn up alongside and called in his mind vormulac it appears theres a small problem a creature of mine is nearing exhaustion perhaps it was injured in all that huffing and puffing at the plateau i thought it prudent to let it fall behind a little and so conserve its energy what would you have me do devetaki had been wearing her scowling halfmask ample evidence of her displeasure but there had been nothing for it except the obvious answer are any of your other constructs in need of sustenance lady if so bring them up front here if not then as you slip back to the weak one be so good as to pass on the word devetaki had understood him well enough since her warrior was doomed best to let the others make use of it and as shed reined back to let the various lords and ladies pass her by so she had informed them ill be sending a weary creature up front doubtless the extra effort will finally exhaust him if any of your warriors would benefit from a good meal you are welcome never let it be said that the mistress of masquemanse is mean and falling to the rear she had ordered her tired beast to speed for the front for we shall be landing soon when for you therell be tidbits galore propulsors throbbing the thing had immediately spurted ahead to its doom for as the last of its propulsive gases were burned several larger warriors fell to and in short order incapacitated separated and finally devoured it only a wellgnawed skeleton and half a dozen sections of blueglinting carapace had been left to go tumbling into the acid reek of the wastelands it was a scene which would be repeated many times until towards the end even healthy creatures would be sacrificed in order that the rest might survive a great many warriors aye so that now only thirtyseven were left flyers had been lost too weary from inhaling the reek they had choked stiffened gone spiralling into a bubbling red oblivion and nothing for it but that their riders go with them lieutenants and common vampire thralls alike but as for the rest survive they had for a night that seemed an eternity yet felt paradoxically too short by far the lords had food in their saddlebags which they devoured they had water in skins which they drank and when these had been used up they unplugged cartilage stoppers in the knuckled spines of their flyers to sip sparingly on vital fluids like the lady wrathas party before them some had slept while others maintained the course the stars had been like foggy icechips on high in the poisonous vapours rising from the open sore of the great red waste vormulac had despaired if only to himself far faint cries had come drifting up out of the fetid fog like the wailing of souls in hell as even more exhausted constructs descended to the redsmouldering death of the wastelands but as the first crack of hazy golden light appeared on the southern horizon so lord unsleep had spied ahead a rising moon all bitten in half as if by some cosmic monster and despite that his view was obscured by fading fumes he knew it was no monster gnawing at the moon but the spires of distant mountains the barrier mountains of olden starside and straightening in his saddle hed sent back weve done it the worst is over weve crossed the great red waste now spare your creatures and glide for we need to lose height no need to worry these poisonous fumes are thinning and theres only the sun to fear now only the sun but lord unsleep had known that his skysnakes tail was many a mile long and hed wondered if they would all make it not all of them had many hours later alighting in the shade of the barrier mountains vormulac had climbed a crag to a vantage point from which to gaze east and watch them come in and peering through eyes still sore from the reek of the wastelands he had seen a golden stain spreading on the higher peaks and had known that a fan of deadly light was even now lowering itself as the sun commenced its tortuous climb up over sunsides rim he actually watched while that fan swept lower and lower and saw its beams dispersing the mists over the plains between the mountains and the rough red desert but the mists were not all that those rays would disperse the men and beasts at the very tip of the skysnakes tail didnt stand a chance they were weary the flyers were exhausted and the warriors depleted of gases and substance both mainly they were drifting in on membrane wings that no longer had any lift in them which threatened to collapse at any moment or suspended from fluttering halfempty buoyancybladders whose essence had been drained off to fuel their coughing sputtering propulsors they knew they should lose altitude but in fact were fighting gravity for once down thered be no getting up again just a series of inevitable crashes in the rusty red earth forming the very tip of the tail four men and flyers had herded a small knot of forsaken warriors from as many different contingents the latter had been too tired even to squabble of these dozen men and creatures the very last pair being also the highest had been first to succumb yellowed by sunlight then browned blackened and incinerated to smoke and smoulder the scorched debris that once was a flyer and rider had drifted to ochre earth then it had been the turn of a warrior its gasbladders exploding mantle bursting into flames armoured body plummeting like a stone to shattering extinction and finally a seething of smoke in the brightening sky even an explosion or two as an unrelenting sun caught up with the rest of them at a stroke vormulac had felt no remorse only annoyance that his army was so depleted they had harboured in trog caverns behind the foothills blood of the submen wasnt much to their liking but beggars cant be choosers the warriors werent fussy and the flyers were happy to subsist on lichens licked from the rocks rest was what they had needed most only black boris who back in turgosheim kept trog mistresses had seemed happy with the way things were working out having taken a firm young female alive boris was soon in fine fettle he had food and fanny all in one exhausted beasts had been seen to as best possible and given shelter in shallow caves thralls too had circumstances been different common vampire thralls such as these might well have expected to become one with the provisioning a good many lieutenants had died however and others had ascended to the seats of lost lords these thralls were lucky they would replace dead or elevated lieutenants some had even been promoted that same day their lords had taken small measures of sustenance from them in return transfusing copious doses of their own vampire essence thus a dual purpose was served and thus the seemingly interminable day had crept by in the dreary dank of trog caverns and the lifepreserving shade of the rearing barrier mountains all of these things had been seen felt or experienced by the seerlord maglore in his talisman shewstone in runemanse these and others such as the onset of night and vormulacs mountingup and departure from the trog territories to journey still farther west his soaring climb on bitter night thermals into the heights from which to gaze down on a hitherto unknown sunside unknown to lord unsleep at any rate the way his previously repressed wamphyri senses came awake how hed smelled strong szgany flesh down there in the dark and the silence the very materiel and even the ordnance of the bloodwar to come but there was something that maglore had not seen which vormulac himself had never suspected it was simply this that one of two sentinel desmodus bats wrathas familiars had witnessed the arrival of the aerial army out of turgosheim the lady had positioned them some two hundred and fifteen miles apart one at the very tip of the range the other in the heights where the mountains burgeoned into a true barrier the first creature had seen vormulacs arrival yes but hastening west with its warning had failed to see the party of trogs out hunting in the grey twilight before the dawn and it had only become aware of their nets hurled skywards into its flitting path when it was far too late perhaps something of its shrill piercing cry of fear and warning both had crossed the many miles to its sentinel twin but not enough to act upon not until the warriorlords invading army became visible to it too which was why wratha got her warning late for despite that her second creature had nearexhausted itself in the frenzy of its flight still vormulac was only hours behind when it alighted on the neck of the ladys flyer by now maglore the mage was eager to scan nathan once more withdrawing from vormulacs mind he cast his probe again but this time with a more youthful target in mind and a more useful one possibly as yet maglore had no great knowledge of the legendary western sunside perhaps by now his window on that unknown world had settled down and was no longer doing well whatever it was that he had been doing and nathan so rapt upon what he was doing that when maglore oh so tentatively entered his mind he noticed nothing at all of his presence there it wasnt that lardis lidesci was a normally vicious or vindictive man but that he never missed an opportunity to glean even the smallest piece of information on the doings the coming and goings the evil works of the wamphyri it was one of his mechanisms for survival and like his father before him lardis was an excellent survivor anna marie english wasnt able to watch which was hardly surprising lardis gave her into the care of a szgany woman to be taken into the rock and instructed in its ways these were also the ways of survival of courseeverything was survival with the szgany lidesci but nathan trask chung and the three cavers accompanied lardis and andrei romani as first they examined and questioned the szgany survivors of the handtohand fighting then interrogated a badly injured lieutenant and several vampire thralls before that however there was the burning of the dead alj of the dead szgany and vampires alike and not on any funeral pyre but in a blazing pit a warriortrap that was already an inferno without ceremony the bodies were wrapped in sacking and bundled into the flames first five of the rocks brave defenders while many old friends looked on with lowered heads and recalled other perhaps better times then after a barely decent interval fourteen dead thralls finally the grotesque remains of seven lieutenants as they burned a handful of lardiss men tossed resinous pine branches into the pit to fuel the fire but as the lieutenants bodies and pieces went into the flames lardis had been quick to beckon his men back from the edge this was just a precautionary measure the dead lieutenants had all been young men exszgany vampirized and promoted within the last three years it seemed unlikely that there would be much of undead wamphyri monstrousness in them nor was there but better safe than sorry the flames consumed them without incident lardis was jubilant albeit quietly tonights toll of vampires was far and away the best that the szgany lidesci had ever achieved the cost however had been great the lives of five good men and true was too much to pay even for a victory such as this but the discovery of the rock by wratha and the vampire lords that was the worst blow of all it took the edge off the old lidescis triumph on the other hand nathans return and these fighting helllanders hed brought with him and the incredible weapons they had brought with them these were wonderful things indeed there was nothing in the world lardis would enjoy more than to sit down right here and now with nathan and the newcomers and hear their story except there was business he must see to first the sort of business that wouldnt wait there had been men hurt in the handtohand crossbows rockets and shotguns were fine at a distance but in any melee a wamphyri gauntlet was superior an ironwood bolt through the eye or heart may be a clean way for a vampire to go but for a man to have his face ripped off or to be disembowelled or to lose a limb and bleed to death is something else that was how lardiss five brave ones had died trying to hold their minced guts in and it was also why theyd been first into the fire so that their women wouldnt see them like that a man has his dignity as for questioning and examining the surviving defenders that was another precautionary measure it was always important to ensure that the men had not been injured in any way especially by being bitten for the poisonous bite of the wamphyri is often quickacting and even the bravest man might find himself suddenly reluctant to admit of well a slight neck injury say the captured thralls were tied to crosses bedded in the earth not for the sake of cruelty but because it was the best way of keeping watch over them even tied up they could slip away like snakes into the thinnest ground mist their interrogation didnt take long they hissed and spat and writhed but answered no questions at all why should they when they knew what was their lot perhaps if lardis had the time he would be much more persuasive but since the location of sanctuary rock was no longer a secret the old lidesci had other plans for tonight well and hadnt he always been a traveller at heart unemotionally having been through all of this before and knowing there was no alternative he ordered the grimacing squirming thralls put down as cleanly and painlessly as possible shot through their hearts pointblank and by marksmen they never knew what hit them nor ever felt the furnace heat of the firepit finally it was the turn of the injured lieutenant except injury was scarcely the word for the monstrous damage he had suffered and unlike those who had gone to the fire before him this one was no fledgling recruit no not by any means a much older man a changeling to the point that he might almost be wamphyri there was no question but that he had come out of turgosheim along with wratha and the others lardis andrei and nathan looked up at him on his cross waiting for him to recover consciousness but to trask chung and the others where they stood back among a crowd of silent watchful szgany it seemed unlikely that he ever would perhaps at that trask should have known better for he at least had known his fair share of horrors such as this albeit in another world in the pulsating glow of the firepit the crucified man was as gory a sight as could be imagined he had been brought down by andrei romani stopped by an explosive bolt shot into the muscle of his right shoulder either the bolt was faulty or the blast went awry else he were surely a dead thing but in any case the detonation had cost him his right arm and all the flesh of his right breast his upper ribs were all sprung on that side and stuck out red and black and above the empty socket and shattered shoulder his face and neck were a blistered black fusion of scorched flesh but as the men on the ground waited so finally the left eye opened and the merest crack in the roasted meat where the right eye should be and there was an eye in there a blob of sulphur flecked with red just like the left not quite wamphyri no but he might have been if hed lived except he knew he would not live for lardis lidesci intended otherwise and as he slowly became aware and lifted his head who are you lardis wasted no time go fuck a shad the other wheezed coughing blood and mucus unlike the thralls he wasnt merely tied to the cross but was nailed there truly crucified since his right arm was missing silver wire had been looped under his chin to support his head but it also constricted his throat and made it hard for him to speak no ordinary man would even have tried lardis shook his head im a man not a thrall i dont fuck shads and im a lieutenant the other spat i have pride very well then lieutenant lardis nodded til ask you again who are you since im doomed anyway it cant hurt to tell you the other answered im turgis gorvisman last lieutenant out of turgosheim what gorvi the guiles man what of it turgis struggled a little on his cross then gasped and hung still while fullfledged wamphyri have ways of stilling their pain their lieutenants are not so fortunate lardis shook his head just a pity youre not him thats all he said for i would dearly love to have gorvi himself up there in your place the other narrowed his one good eye stared down on lardis and said youll be the lidesci then lardis the chief aye and i fancy it was gorvi who took my son you didnt know for sure then turgis writhed a little then coughed up more blood well now you do the first time we raided on settlement aye gorvi took your son i remember it well he sent me down into the town with the others while he attacked the house on the knoll he likes to keep to himself does gorvi likes to keep out of trouble too and jason my son is still there in wrathstack the old lidesci tried to keep the anxiety the eagerness the need to know out of his voice but failed turgis gagged turned his head this way and that and vibrated for a moment like a crippled snake against the upright of his cross urine smoked where it dribbled from under his clout this con conversation is all very ah ah very well but it gains me nothing i desire to be dead will you make it clean lardis andrei even nathan all of them had heard much the same plea before but this was important to lardis tell me the truth and ill make it clean your your boy was a brave one but hes dead lardis closed his eyes and breathed a sigh of agony relief who can say and and was his death clean too clean aye the one on the cross nodded he tried to escape failed climbed wrathstack to a high place jumped he killed himself he was your son lardis perhaps he knew more even a lot more but lardis was satisfied truth be known he was even grateful and now you can die he said except will you die cleanly turgis looked down on him for myself i say yes indeed i welcome it but i have been with gorvi for long and long my blood is changed even as i am changed lardis andrei nathan all three stepped back and more yet well away from the foot of the cross lardis nodded to men on the flanks they lassoed both ends of the horizontal bar with good ropes and waited others with crossbows came forward but when turgis saw them he commenced to writhe and spit again he was tormented in two directions tortured by pain and terror both he wanted to die but his blood didnt and now said lardis three bolts flew home straight to turgis gorvismans heart he cried out once then flopped down on his nails and hung still for a moment then his belly and chest burst open and a nest of white worms lashed and squirmed amidst the crimson of his innards a thing of white siphon arms like some grotesque aquatic anemone it tossed the rags of his flesh aside drew blood from faltering veins sprayed scarlet all about as if pissing on unseen foes indeed it tried to but they were out of harms way the men on the ropes waited no longer but hauled on the cross until it toppled lengthwise into the firepit and very shortly a protracted hissing and a plume of black smoke were all that remained of turgis gorvisman in runemanse maglore the mage slowly withdrew his hands from the mobius sigil his mind from nathans his seers probe back across those thousands of miles to its home in his vampire mentality and for a long while he simply sat there with the pictures of what he has seen gradually fading in his inner eye but not in his memory of the things hed seen he might easily have guessed some of them in advance certainly with regard to vormulacs crusade but others would have been quite impossible to imagine impossible to believe if he hadnt seen them with his own eyes well through the eyes of another at least nathans mind might well be obscured but his eyes were crystal clear maglore didnt have to know what he was thinking to see what he was seeing in olden sunsidestarside the szgany fought back whats more they sometimes won now that nathan was back perhaps they would win that much more frequently maglore had feared the return of a great army one night out of the west maybe he would be wiser to fear the return of just one man maybe he should never have let that man go in the first place but what had nathan been except a strange szgany youth a weird blondhaired blueeyed pet a freakish familiar so it had seemed and now a mistake there again maglore comforted himself the man who never made a mistake never made anything on the other hand neither had he lived to regret it part four further incursions factions skirmishes counting coup nathan i ebranch turchin tzonov fifteen hours after the battle at the rock in a parallel world beyond the starside gate a world where it was pm in london and midnight in moscow three heads of department had a meeting of sorts at the london headquarters of ebranch the three were the minister responsible whose name was known to a small handful but never used lan goodly temporary head of ebranch and gustav turchin premier of the loosely named and very loosely connected soviet alliance also known as the uss or union of soviet states a fourth person was present not in any official capacity but because she was the only person now living on earth who had ever been to sunsidestarside which was in the main the subject of the meeting lan goodly had asked zek foener to be there but she had already decided to fly in on the first plane out of zante the others had made no objection perhaps they might have if they had known what was on goodlys mind or perhaps on the other hand theyd made no objection because they did know what was on his mind for something of the sort was on theirs too introductions had been brief to the point of perfunctory communications were secure premier turchins larger than life image was on the big screen of the ops rooms central console the other three were seated in padded swivelchairs within the consoles operational perimeter sixteen hundred miles away in moscow turchin was looking at them on just such a screen the russian premier was short blocky and looked unshakable as a sumo wrestler it was his image and not only on the screen but also in real life considering all the problems of the massive territory he presided over he had to look that way what with escalating food riots in kasakhstan terrorism in the ukraine mafiastyle gangwars in moscow itself territorial disputes far and wide and the accelerating decay of law and order just about everywhere he must at least give the impression of toughness his lips were thin and compressed under an angular nose his dark eyes were restless under bushy black eyebrows that crushed together in a frown the corners of his mouth were turned down because he hated being in the wrong but then so did they all and not a man of them had had anything good to report indeed they each of them felt a certain relief if not downright satisfaction at the discomfort of the others zek foener knew this of course and thought the germans have a word or it schadenfreude each of the men had stated his position or in effect made his confession if not of guilt then of incompetence in one degree or another but also knew that the others were at least equally to blame laying blame wasnt the purpose of the exercise however but to untangle the very complicated skein of things back into something of order it was imperative that they unravel that skein and quickly for a frightful pattern was beginning to emerge briefly then said turchin after a silence that had already lasted for several long seconds clearly i was right to take my softly softly approach with turkur tzonov for as ive stated previously i was already on to him and it was only a matter of time as it now works out it was your pushing me that speeded up the process in moving my own men into perchorsk i alerted tzonov and made him jump the gun in one way a bad thing perhaps but in another he shrugged and looked to the others for their opinions meaning hes out of it now lost in another world this was goodly but the precogs face was sour as a lemon sir i hate to remind you but that is a nightmare scenario that tzonov or someone like him should pass through the perchorsk gate into starside wonderful if we could be sure he or they would stay there but terrifying to think they might come back and what they might come back as premier the minister cut in i know youve heard much the same thing before but do you take our meaning mr goodly and i everyone at ebranch we have had to deal with this sort of thing before we know what were talking about youve come in on this a lot later whereas we have been with it from the beginning for a great many years and you must never forget that while there are two routes into this parallel world there are also two ways out now youve let tzonov go in there with a platoon of trained men and as you have let your mr paxton go in it was turchins turn to cut in and with just as many trained men if not more whats more it appears paxton has brought down the roof of that underground river behind him however temporarily also i didnt let turkur tzonov do anything why the way you have it anyone would think he had my authority im not accusing the minister held up his hands placatingly just stating facts but now we have ben trask david chung anna marie english and a bunch of potholers and a halfcompany of paramilitaries lost between two worlds and thats too many too many of them who can and just might come back as vampires and if its tzonov what with his powers and ambitions and if its trask chung or english with theirs turchin countered or this nathan this this necroscope zek foener said this is getting us nowhere surely the point is that good men and bad ones have crossed over and its the bad ones we dont want to come back or if they do we want to know that we can stop them when they get here have i got it right and isnt it also that wed like to get our friends the good ones out of there if thats at all possible i mean get them out unchanged get them out as men zek has said it all goodlys highpitched voice fluted out we know whats on your mind sir and we agree with you those gates must be closed and this time permanently but not before weve got our friends back what happens to tzonov paxton and their men we couldnt care less but we do care about our friends turchin nodded so despite that youve just this minute told me that too many of our people have gone through already now youre contemplating sending even more is that it yes the minister nodded but a joint effort our best shot and if it doesnt work time enough then to close the gates permanently huh turchins mouth turned down more yet oh yes a joint effort but only because i have the gate eh because this mr paxton of yours has blocked the way to the one in romania he looked pointedly searchingly at the minister now tell me dont you think it is time i knew a little more about this man oh yes i know cmi for your eyes only and definitely not for mine but arent we in a little too deep for all that cloak and dagger stuff now theres no more cold war and certainly not between we four the minister was suddenly looking uncomfortable very but i still cant talk about oh yes you can goodly told him the premier is right the stakes are too high for coverups ebranch was less than diplomatic in its eagerness to get a hold of nathan and premier turchin was less than effective at stopping turkur tzonov dead in his tracks weve owned up to our errors so now its your turn because i have to admit im interested in paxton too i thought hed stopped being a thorn in our side a long time ago when harry left us and now this but lets face it in your official capacity you have to be responsible for a lot more things than just ebranch so lets have it all out in the open and then maybe we can move on the minister took a deep breath said very well and after a moments thought originally paxton was my idea a bad one as it turned out he had a talent telepathy in which he was very gifted but he was too much of a loner to fit snugly into an organization such as ebranch and the fact of the matter is that i needed a watcher to watch the watchers ebranch looked out for my countrys security among other things and did a wonderful job of it but being what it was there was always the chance that someone in the branch might go rotten it wasnt impossible by any means after all it had happened before and to a head of branch at that the time norman wellesley turned traitor talents such as ebranch employed for good might conceivably be employed in the opposite direction and devastatingly or for personal gain whatever paxton would be a branch operative responsible to head of branch naturally but mainly responsible and reporting to me this wasnt just my idea but fitted in well with the thinking of others higher up so paxton entered ebranch to make a long story short he didnt fit in the others sniffed him out almost from square one he especially fell foul of ben trask and more especially of harry keogh paxton fucked up the minister shrugged apologetically excuse the expression but right now it seems the only one that fits rightly or wrongly he was responsible for the death of the then head of branch darcy clarke and would have been responsible for the necroscopes death too except keogh was a different kettle of fish but we mustnt forget that at the time we were trying to kill keogh so in a way it wasnt a personal thing you could say it was paxtons duty to kill him but keogh wasnt about to die not that easily paxton failed the necroscope was multitalented and got into his enemys telepathic mind he did something to him that killed his talent robbed him of his mindreading skill afterwards paxton came to see me he was a broken man and i have to admit to feeling partly responsible the minister paused and shuffled uncomfortably but in a little while continued remember i am responsible for ebranch not only for what the branch does but also for its security and geoffrey paxton knew a hell of a lot about the organization and all its members i thought it would probably be a good idea to retain a measure of control over him to continue to be his paymaster after all its unusual for a dog to bite the hand that feeds it that was my reasoning anyway there was an opening in cmi i got him work there in an administrative capacity watched him for five years until eventually i was satisfied hed settled down and wasnt going to be a problem but cmi has its own command and control structure and its own rules one of which is that when a man gets promoted to command level he also gets a change of name its a simple security measure i had already lost track of paxton but would have anyway as he went up in the world goodly asked how far up the minister glanced at him coldly then back at turchin on screen he took another deep breath and said as an organization cmi is split three ways from the bottom up administration operations command control and instruction paxton performed so well on the command level that they were reluctant to let him work in a field capacity he persisted in volunteering however and eventually got a transfer and yet another new name would you believe smith no one outside cmi could keep track of him after that which is the whole idea of course cmi ops has three branches three officers commanding and paxton or john smith is now one of them it didnt take you long to find out about all of this about paxton i mean goodlys tone of voice sounded close to accusing and the minister at once rounded on him mr goodly youve known me for more than twenty years is there no trust left just recently damn little goodly snapped gentlemen turchin said holding up his hands and zek added lets keep it impersonal if you fight now youll only be wasting time and its not our time to waste but bens davids and all the others listen the minister told all three a hint of desperation showing in his voice ever since i found out that cmi were interested in the branch over and above what one would normally expect and especially interested in nathan ive been trying to discover what was going on goodly he turned to the other wasnt it i who warned you theyd be coming for nathan here at hq look paxton is his own boss within the organization well more or less i mean there is an overall officer commanding but he no more suspected paxton than anyone else the raid on the hq and the trouble at radujevac were the first he knew of it paxton was doing his own thing dont you see the minister paused to mop his brow and after a moment continued paxton has a flat in the city weve checked it out and at last were beginning to understand its full of stuff on ebranch the full range of the branchs talents on harry keogh the necroscopes origins and what he was capable of and on the gates at perchorsk and radujevac almost everything you have on file right here at hq remember paxton worked here he didnt have to lift any of this stuff he was required to know it he knew harry keogh well enough for sure goodly frowned an obsession i think so the minister had cooled down a little he wanted his talent back harry keogh had robbed him of his telepathy and he wanted it back again a vampire took his talent away from him so perhaps a vampire could return it and paxton knows there are vampires in starside this time the minister thought he was finished but goodly didnt so he was interested in nathan the son of harry keogh but how did he find out that nathan had come over i mean that hed come through the gate into perchorsk the minister slumped in his chair yes youre right i had to tell cmi i mean i had to ebranch and cmi are all we have left in the line of national security if anything was to go wrong we would need a backup and cmi would be it so i had to bring them in on it and of course paxton got to know about it it switched him on it was what hed been waiting for now he could stop playing and start pursuing his real goal to get his talent back in this world or in some other turchin was looking mystified but if he knows about the radujevac gate if all he wants to do is cross into starside why hasnt he tried it earlier the minister threw his hands in the air i dont know maybe he wanted to be sure maybe he was waiting until he had a full hand maybe the rest of it was literally an obsession just a crazy idea he was playing about with until he found out about nathan the son of harry keogh the man whod caused all of his problems in the first place it must have seemed too good to be true it confirmed what paxton had always suspected for another necroscope had come into our world out of sunsidestarside and now he paxton was tired of waiting if he wanted to get his talent back and maybe other talents too he knew where he had to go but there could also be a revenge motive hed failed to kill keogh so maybe he could get his boy instead but not until he had what he wanted out of him just how he would go about that i cant say and maybe paxton cant either maybe hes playing by ear anyway beyond this point its all conjectural and youre as wise as i am the rest of it is known the minister was through all very pat said goodly softly after a while you dont believe me the minister looked at him again yes i do because my talent tells me nothing is going to change around here youre going to be the minister responsible for quite some time to come which also means that whatever youre doing wrong or mistakenly was done with the best of motives because if it wasnt the branch has a knack of dealing with its enemies turchin spoke up do you threaten your superior goodly looked long and hard at the screen no he shook his head not a threat but a promise and if youre unwilling to help us out of this i make you the same promise look its quite obvious that youre a good man ben trask thinks so anyway and thats good enough for me you are trying to help your country and were trying to help our friends but neither side can succeed alone so in helping us youll be helping yourself because if you dont well come what may i personally guarantee that ebranch wont be helping you out of anything again not ever finally turchin smiled that kind of loyalty means something to me its my kind of loyalty but you know mr goodly my entire country expects my loyalty and between the three of you youve made it all too plain where my duty lies the radujevac gate is closed for the moment and now i believe we must close the one in perchorsk too zek was on her feet at once but not until ben trask and the others are out turchin shook his head i cant promise that there will have to be a time limit on it but you wont stop us from going in her gasp the way her face lit up told turchin a great deal again he smiled no i wont stop you indeed youll get all the help i can give you it wont be like the last time you went through into starside miss foener and as quickly as it had come his smile fell away how things have changed eh for some maybe goodly was quick off the mark unfortunately not for others have you forgotten so soon siggi dam was forced through that gate too but well be damn lucky to find her and frowning thoughtfully zek said or unlucky the minister responsible was now much more at ease however yes he quickly put in but that was turkur tzonovs doing things have changed and for the better due mainly to the efforts of premier turchin and then more businesslike very well sir youll set a time limit and upon its expiry the gate will be closed but how will you do it i mean its been tried before you know turchin shook his head no they tried to destroy it from within with nuclear weapons but i said well close it and we will under a million tons of rock you can thank your mr paxton for the idea he may have made a very temporary thing of it but my solution will be permanent surely nothing of flesh and blood can withstand the weight of a mountain youll bring the roof down on the place goodly pictured the perchorsk complex that vast spherical cavern at its core riddled with magmass wormholes the whole place could easily be made to collapse in upon itself and upon the gate blocking it forever but how much time will you give us how much time will you need zek ventured three days turchin shrugged seemed bemused certainly my dear but will that be enough three er starside days returning his shrug she tried to look innocent and failed three weeks now turchin was plainly staggered after what youve told me about that place the dangers it harbours but the minister responsible was nodding they might well need all of that and more yes he agreed eventually turchin gave in as you will twentyone days and when will your party set out tomorrow goodly answered or the next day at the very latest and although he was cringing inside he doggedly deciphered a brief echoing precognitive glimpse of the future tomorrow or the day after its got to be after that and for as far as i can see right now there will be nothing much jeft for us here not for me and zek anyway all of which conversation had taken place some fifteen hours after the battle at sanctuary rock by no means a protracted period not in the whirl of political and diplomatic activity following on the debacle at radujevac but in the world of the vampires that same fifteen hours had seemed a long long time indeed a great deal had happened there involving some politics but almost nothing of diplomacy turkur tzonov along with staffsergeant bruno krasin and his somewhat reduced section of thirteen men including the effeminate yet sadistic locator alexei yefros who but for his talent might best be classified excess baggage had passed through the perchorsk gate some two and a quarter hours before nathan and his party entered the radujevac gate therefore it might logically be concluded that they would arrive in starside first but in the context of abstract spacetime mathematics considering the complexities of white black and grey holes and passageways between worlds and indeed universes in general there was sufficient disparity that they arrived last even in earths mundane science it is accepted that a straight line is not the shortest distance between two points in any case tzonov and his men had gone on foot carrying their weapons while the necroscopes party had been conveyed between worlds and all of their equipment with them the fighting between gorvi the guiles warrior and lieutenants and nathans party had been over for something more than an hour when tzonovs section emerged from the uppermost of the starside gates emerged into starlit night naturally and stepped down from the crater rim onto the eerie foreboding bluetinged boulder plains it was a stroke of bad luck but tzonov had always known that the chance of it being sunup was only a little better than two to one against on the other hand tzonovs men were trained and their egomaniac leader knew that starsides vampire men and creatures could be stopped all it took was firepower and he had plenty of that the oncehead of russias ebranch wasnt looking for that sort of confrontation however not at this time and certainly not on starside his coming here at all had been a course of last resort which he had been forced to take and that in turn meant that the sooner he made his way through the great pass into sunside and safety the better to conquer and convert a world first conquer its weakest inhabitants tzonovs knowledge of the vampire world was rudimentary but he did know that the gate stood close to a pass through the barrier mountains standing at the base of the crater wall and shielding his eyes from the glare of the gate he scanned carefully along the silhouette of the starlimned range of towering peaks and high plateaux until he spied a deep cleft a little to the east of his location it must be the pass where the mountains were split to their roots and as krasin lined up his suddenly silent men in three ranks tzonov pointed out the way for them setting out alexei yefros kept pace with tzonov a short distance behind the squad yefros was a thinfaced weasel of a creature a misogynist with bright narrow blackbird eyes a thin nose and lips and a very ugly sadistic streak his hair was shinyblack and stuck flat to his scalp as if painted there his reflexes were fast his movements quick nervous but rarely fumbling tzonov had looked into his mind on a number of occasions and knew it for a cesspool the mans sexual proclivities were unusual to say the least tzonov had never made friends easily and yefros was not a man he would have chosen anyway but the locator had been in perchorsk when gustav turchin made his move and knowing which side his bread was buttered hed fled with tzonov and the rest to the gate at the core of the complex anyway they were espers together and yefros much admired tzonov which was why the latter suffered his company also there could be no question but that as a locator yefros was one of the best a fact which he was now able to prove your alien is here he told tzonov there can be no mistaking his signal he throws off those esoteric numbers and symbols of his like a dog shedding fleas he nodded his head west and a little south almost at right angles to their direction of travel hes that way across the mountains huh tzonov grunted hes on sunside with the szgany or gypsies to you but you waste your talent on that one oh i know you found him easily enough up there in the urals but it wont be so easy the next time nathan had to go on foot then but no longer he is a necroscope and has his fathers talents we want to get somewhere we walk but he simply goes there he can be here there everywhere youd get dizzy just looking for him you are a locator and im a telepath and our talents come in very handy but his are amazing and deadly thats the reason i issued that order on the way in here that hes to be shot on sight as he finished speaking there came a weird hissing and a coughing rumble from somewhere to the left and a little behind them an animal articulation as opposed to any kind of mechanical sound signalling the squad to keep a low profile bruno krasin at once scaled a jagged leaning boulder put nitesite binoculars to his eyes and scanned the land eastwards and to the rear in another moment as the noise sounded again krasins jaw fell open in a silent gasp and he signalled tzonov to join him the squad kept going as tzonov climbed up beside his senior man while at the foot of the boulder yefros waited nervous as a cat in the shadows what is it tzonov whispered taking the binoculars from his ic in his perception bruno krasin was the perfect military underling the blood of cossack forefathers ran strong in him darkskinned wiry longlimbed and as fit as tzonov himself krasin was tall thirtyish squarejawed hardeyed as a boy he had been indoctrinated in the ways of an obsolete ideology by his hardline communist father an exofficer of the kgb it was entirely in keeping that krasin was one of tzonovs most trusted men now he hissed a warning shh but offered no other reply he scarcely needed to tzonov would have to be blind not to see the thing his own gasp was audible indeed visible as his breath plumed in the cold night air and the horizontal sweep of his binoculars jerked abruptly to a halt then a warrior he breathed cold sweat gleaming on his brow until now the thing had been hidden by the terrain it lay in a slight depression in the lee of a cluster of boulders where gorvi the guile had left it tzonov could make out the heaving motion of scales as the thing breathed the jetting of hot air through nostrils six inches wide the glimmer of starlight on chitin we had better get after the men bruno he whispered and from now on the order is absolute silence what is it yefros called up to them his nervous voice echoing out and away as if in answer they heard for the third time that primal threatening rumble of sound and magnified in the lenses of the nitesites tzonov saw an armourplated prowlike head lift listlessly from the earth and a flicker of eyes like scarlet lamps in the face of the disturbed monster tzonov handed the binoculars back to krasin glanced down once furiously at yefros and jumped landing expertly soundlessly in the dust he straightened up and grabbed the locator by the throat cutting off any further questions and fool he hissed locator oh and do you want to be located if you would go on jiving keep fucking quiet releasing the other he thrust him away and told him catch up with the section but quietly as yefros threw a narroweyed accusing glance at his superior and stumbled away rubbing at his throat krasin came down from his observation point in a barely audible whisper he said i think the things asleep we may have disturbed it a little thats all they hurried to catch up with the rest and in the bluetinged night of starside made all possible speed for the mouth of the pass from behind but gradually fading the uneasy rumbling of the warrior followed them most of the way in the pass several surprises were waiting because of the low trajectory of the sun and the elevation of the barrier range it had been night on starside for some hours now but it soon became apparent that on sunside darkness had fallen much more recently following a barely discernible trail through the scree of shattered boulders tumbled from the heights in something less than an hour the squad passed through a dogleg defile and saw ahead the very last trace of a sunset strange until tzonov remembered that a day and night in the vampire world were the equivalent of a whole week in his the sun hod set on sunside but a slowly fading crack of amethyst light yet remained to show where it had sunk down out of sight pale though that glow was it threw the walls of the pass and the distant crest of a rising saddle into silhouette and in so doing it became as it were the light at the end of the tunnel for tzonovs men this world even this pass into sunside had seemed full of morbid alien auras rightly so but now in the glow of this faint crack of light the spirits of the men were lifted they even began to exchange small talk albeit in whispers the second surprise was nothing of nature but an artifact perhaps of men but tzonov who knew some few things at least about this vampire world had his doubts for some time he had been keeping himself apart from yefros walking at the head of the section with krasin now he called for the locator to join them and in the light of electric torchbeams they picked out the roughhewn features of a towering edifice here where the bed of the gorge had narrowed to a bottleneck at the foot of sheer canyon walls the east face had been carved into a rearing keep or observation post ideally sited to guard the pass or perhaps it was a wamphyri waystation where lieutenant slavetakers had rested during the long trek back to starside with szgany captives tzonovs understanding however was that the last members of the old wamphyri had died out sixteen years ago when nuclear missiles had been fired into starside from perchorsk which meant that this castle could only be a relic of old times and no longer in use but on the other hand tzonov had seen a warrior creature back there on the plain of boulders and hed had it from siggi dam how nathan had been punished even banished from sunsidestarside by a new breed of wamphyri indeed it had been one of tzonovs fears that nathan might be a spy for vampire masters sent to check out the lie of the land before the lords themselves came through also as tzonov and the section had climbed the foothills gradient to the pass he and bruno krasin had paused and turned for a moment to gaze out over starside far in the northeast theyd spied a distant stack and tzonov knew that he hadnt imagined those flickering lights and the smoke going up there might not be as many of the wamphyri as before but there could be no denying that they were here and it was sundown their time tzonov shrugged off a feeling of foreboding dismissing it like an itch between his shoulderblades and gave his attention to the great gaunt keep in any case he felt sure his men had the measure of anything they might find here nothing that lived could possibly face up to their weapons except hed seen film of the early perchorsk encounters and now remembered some of the things that had come through into the core they had been stopped yes but it hadnt been that easy the men were waiting for him to say something he turned to yefros and asked well what do you make of it the locator was peering at the castle built into the face of the cliff concentrating upon it searching through its massive walls nervously alert birdlike his shining black eyes moved from feature to feature getting the feel of it he took in its awesome starlit gauntness its texture of bluegleaming stone the inhuman soullessness of bleak frowning facades its battlements carved of solid rock notched into gaping embrasures or merlons thrusting up into towers and turrets its flying buttresses and the menacing chutes of its gargoyle corbels well tzonov said again torchbeams reached out swept up and up the face of the great keep ledges in the virgin rock had been carved into massive steps causeways climbing from one level to the next vertiginous arches made bridges to parts of the architecture which were otherwise inaccessible where the overhanging face jutted or generally obstructed cowled windowholes gloomed like dark eyes in the starsilvered stone frowning down on the midgets ogling from the shadows well wait yefros muttered peevishly he still hadnt forgiven tzonov and wanted him to know it also he wanted his talent appreciated why should tzonov get all of his admiration while alexei yefros got nothing in return looking into yefross black eyes tzonov read the locators thoughts his disappointment that his superior had such scant regard for him maybe in future he should treat him more kindly while he needed him anyway but for the time being he knew that yefros was doing his job that he was diligently searching the keep and so kept his peace and the locator continued his mental exploration the structure started maybe fifty feet up the cliff face halfway to the top of a lone projecting stack in the chimney between cliff and pillar stone steps were visible zigzagging upwards to the mouth of a domed cave presumably this cavern entrance was extensive with its own passageways into the keep proper higher still the fortifications spread outwards across the face of the cliff like a weird stone fungus covering natures efforts with the lesser but more purposeful works of men well men of sorts but plainly the builders of the keep werent here now no figures moved on the battlements or on the stairways no lights shone in the windows turrets or high balconies the place was deserted which yefros now confirmed no one is in there its empty but there are i dont know echoes echoes tzonov waited yefros shrugged its as if the keep itself were undead as if the very stones waited but you sensed or located no one nothing yefros looked puzzled undecided even harassed but finally he answered no i located no one it was the first time tzonov had seen him uncertain of his talent by now tzonov was convinced that the place was even more ancient than hed at first thought in the old times there had been wars between the wamphyri lords bloodwars when this keep would have been a fortress proper it certainly seemed unlikely that a structure like this so well fortified and apparently impregnable had been built to fend off common szgany tribesmen but there was no reason why common men couldnt defend it thats our refuge till morning he said which in turn means we have three days here earthtime and turning to krasin see to it krasin gathered the squad to him in a semicircle allowed those who wished to smoke to do so told them the place seems deserted in you go search and secure but carefully sort out defensive positions and prepare a roster for guard duties then back out here to gather fuel among this rubble there are trees fallen from the heights gather wood and lets have some fires going then well break out the rations any questions no then get to it at its base where the stack stood free of the cliff and formed the keeps foundation stone it was surrounded by a wall whose ends joined up with the cliff face the wall was of massive masonry stood twelve to fifteen feet high and was crowned with merlons and embrasures every other merlon had been shaped into a stone dragon with a gaping mouth that formed a circular corbel chute but these dragons were of no mundane design they had the lean bodies of wolves poised to leap the folded wings of bats and the faces of men well of monsters at least huge agesblackened ironstudded gates leaned open on rusted hinges embellished with the same awesome dragon motif their welcome seemed cynical to say the least the squad went through them at the run in teams of four one left one right two covering a breathless pause of five seconds to secure positions then a leapfrog movement forward as the next team followed on tzonov yefros and krasin came on behind moving from one secured position to the next and so into the courtyard and from there to the steps and cavern entrance finally into the keep itself sprawling across the face of the cliff the keeps extensive surface area was greatly disproportionate to its depth the builders hadnt hollowed out the cliff to any great extent but had used natural caves wherever possible quite obviously and just as tzonov had supposed the place must have been a waystation and observation post dust lay thickly layered wherever time or the elements had deposited it with never a foot or clawprint to disturb it other than the fresh sharpetched imprints of combat boots the men relaxed a little defensive points were manned wood was gathered in less than half an hour smoke and cooking smells went up from chimneys cold for fifty years tzonov said nothing but as he looked at the great girth of the fireplaces and the size of the rusted iron spits he couldnt help thinking the last time that people cooked here people were cooked here it was a nightmarish thought but not nearly as nightmarish as the huge mummified grey thing which one of the men discovered in a previously unexplored observation tower where access had been difficult due to fallen masonry tzonov was with krasin when the shuddering soldier reported his find and was at once arrested by the mans answer to krasins abrupt what is it its something i found sir i stumbled against it touched it and its dead but what it is well it isnt a man they returned with him to his discovery and on the way tzonov called for yefros to accompany them in the tower over the gorge they shone their torches where the soldier pointed and tzonov understood what hed meant quite definitely the thing was not a man but a long time ago it might have been several men the thing was as big as a horse but there could be no further comparison with anything of earthly origin except perhaps men its many legs and feet and single pair of arms and hands were short and stubby but manlike rather if men wore them they would not look out of place the thing had fallen over on its side and died there it must be dead for it was partly mummified the dry air had kept it from corruption tzonov got down on one knee shone a torch on the thing close up take three men cut them across their bodies about nipple height and fold them forward at the waist one behind the other then fuse them chest to buttocks and so on all three into one now take the excised material and mould it into a long flexible neck with nothing much of a head but a mouthful of grinding teeth rudimentary nostrils and ears and a great many eyes along the neck and tapering nub of a head so providing your your what your alien sixlegged centaur or simply your observer your thing anyway with the means to scan in every direction simultaneously that was what this abomination was a wamphyri construct a sentinel whose sole function had been to keep watch over the gorge except its eyes were fused shut now in merciful death so it seemed the entire creature was covered in thick leathery skin where this had desiccated and cracked open it was seen to be more in the nature of animal hide an eighth of an inch thick protection against the cold during monotonously long nights of duty in the keep possibly the most puzzling feature in tzonovs estimation was an upwardprojecting featureless nodule at the base of the neck its short stem was knuckled like a spine but its bald bulbous terminal might easily be a second cranium with a smaller brain housed in a skull only half the size of a normal human head alexei he glanced up at the locator what do you make of this yefros was standing beside him gazing down on the thing in disgust i dont know he shook his head but there was once a theory mainly fallen into disrepute now that certain dinosaurs evolved secondary brains in their spines to control their armoured tails they were too big and lumbering it was natures way of balancing the deficiency of slow thought processes and reflexes this however he shook his head again gulping audibly as he backed away is nothing of nature i believe it is the echo i talked about it was made by men and it was made of men yes and a long time ago and one more thing turkur it isnt dead yet not quite dead anyway in the last few seconds tzonov had become aware of a sick smell rising from the shrivelled crumpled thing externally it was fairly wellpreserved but internally now as an eyelid cracked open in the nearmummified neck and others in the blob of a head he kicked himself backwards away from it sprawling in the dust some of the eyes were black sockets dribbling a thick tarry morbid substance others were yellow with pus but one at least was clear and stared directly however vacantly at turkur tzonov his talent was instinct in him even sprawling there he could read the things feeble mind as clearly as a living mans and actually felt the faint pulse of thoughts which it sent hurtling towards starside from the telepathic ganglion in its secondary brain master my lord there are men in the keep that was all but the rotting eyes of the undead horror continued to follow the four as they left the turret and descended gratefully into the company of other human beings in a little while they returned with flamethrowers and burned the watcher where it lay later still tzonov ordered his own sentries to be especially wary for the duration of their stay after all he knew that the creature had transmitted a final message to someone somewhere in that last however he was mistaken the thing had tried certainly but uselessly and just like the blazing observer itself as chemical fire reduced it to roiling smoke and greasy ashes tzonov had no way of knowing that its message had not and could never be received he himself had been able to read the thought by virtue of his eyetoeye telepathy but as for anyone else the creature could only communicate with its master whichever lord had built it and the maker and master of the watcher the great lord shaithis of the wamphyri had been dead now for more than sixteen years ii reconnaissance there was no way that turkur tzonov could know it but a few scant minutes after he and his halfplatoon had left starside to enter the mouth of the great pass and therefore into the shelter and doubtful safety of the gorges shadows and shielding rock walls the lady wratha and her much depleted wrathstack army passed half a mile beyond the glaring hemisphere of the starside gate on her way back to the last aerie the dimly flickering lights that tzonov and krasin had seen in that solitary stacks windows were wrathas beacons guiding her home but if he and his section had entered the pass only a minute or so later then despite all of their human ingenuity and muchvaunted firepower they might never have entered it at all for then wratha or canker gorvi wran or spiro or even some senior lieutenant might well have detected the aroma of human flesh picked up human thoughts or by some other means unique to their individual wamphyri senses or talents become aware of the presence of men in starside or there again perhaps not certainly the lady and lords had more important things on their minds indeed it could well be that tzonov and his men owed their survival to wrathas concern for her own for the ladys eyes scanned starsides skies this night not its land and her senses were alert for intruders not refugees do you have a plan wran the rages query entered wrathas mind undisguised urgent and anxious with a battle in the offing there was no time for bluff and bluster he could rant and rage all he wanted then but little use for such now aye she sent back but only if you and spiro gorvi and canker and the necromancer nestor lichloathe whatever that one is up to and wherever he is now will agree to put yourselves your men and monsters at my command then i may have a plan at your command of course as lord taintspore commands his army out of turgosheim so i shall command the forces of the last aerie and just as vormulac has his generals i shall have mine what and didnt we always plan it that way huh spiro killglance scowled across the gulf of air we should put ourselves and our men under the orders of a woman and where has that got us so far tonight for instance was that an example of your leadership wrathas scowl was no less severe my shell is that of a woman aye but my leech is a vampire no less than yours and i am all wamphyri as for leadership would you even know that lord vormulac was here if not for me and as for tonight so the lidescis waylaid us it has happened to the best spiro wasnt satisfied but in a fight youre not built for it wratha built for other things certainly built to be under a man to accommodate him but did you think to fuck them all to death tussling with a man in your bed is all very well lady but going up against a gang of them wearing gauntlets is something else again now tell me what do you really know of fighting to command is not to fight fool her retort was stinging in its intensity to command is to direct the fighting and we arent talking about a skirmish or even a battle but a war a fullscale bloodwar listen vormulac is a warlord born but you when you and your brother were wetting yourselves if your father so much as glanced at you lord unsleep was settling blood feuds in turgosheim and settling them his way he bound far greater lords than you in chains and strung them up by their heels for the sun to fry hah only be sure hell do it again here tonight if you dont listen to reason gorvi the guile had been silent for some time fallen out of favour with the rest he had to mind his words but at last he felt obliged to ask so what is this plan of yours wratha and how do we bring it into being and anyway what makes you think youre so much smarter than us when it comes to plotting wars just like his real voice his mental sendings seemed to ooze insinuate and cling like glutinous tar hah she snorted in return and now the socalled guile says his piece as if he has the right but a fairer question might be where was gorvi this night when the best of his men were being slaughtered at sanctuary rock what he commenced to bluster but if youd only hear my story no time for stories gorvi wratha cut him short time for action and barely enough time at that very well you ask why i am smarter and ill tell you because im a woman all right you have your guile but i have my womans wiles all doubled and redoubled by my leech and i was never the dullard believe me as a girl on sunside i killed a lieutenant and fresh risen as a vampire i did away with his brother then to be a lady i usurped karl the crag all by my wits alone where muscle would not suffice so tell me who better to lead you now when sheer numbers may whelm you down and all the tenacity and willpower of a world will not suffice the simple truth is that none of us is experienced in war for in turgosheim we were too soft for too long we have almost forgotten how to wage war in the years since i ascended there have been damn few feuds let alone wars and as for the szgany we knew they were the most docile of creatures thats why these lidescis continue to get the better of us because were not used to resistance finally she paused and swept hot red eyes over all of them until there im done she told them you may fall in with me or simply fall and in the morning wake with the sunrise to find it shining in your eyes but make up your minds quick for well soon be home and ive orders to give and then youll see if i have a plan or not canker canison was still groggy from the knock hed taken but it was his turn to say his piece wratha im with you he barked in her mind my heads still singing and i cant think a damn but youre the only thing thats held us together so far and individually were finished for sure so what will you have me and mine do order away lady wratha turned to scan the hagridden sky under its canopy of blueglittering stars she looked upon her colleagues all grim in their saddles where they rode for the northstar whose pharos eye gleamed down on wrathstack silhouetted now against the shimmer of the northern aurora silent scowling the wamphyri lords rode the wind and to a man they were aware of the truth in cankers words but the lady would have it from their own lips their own minds and the rest of you she said what of you others what of you wran spiro gorvi will you stand like giants or fall like swatted flies wran had his pride but he was not a fool and in a little while say on lady came his mental grunt followed by spiros rasped so be it and finally gorvis grudging any plan has to be better than none there was no time for wratha to take pleasure in their submission their admission that they needed her skills as a f leader if anything she felt a sensation of relief and nothing of elation and so steered well clear of gloating as she began to outline her plan very well now listen its my belief that vormulac is no more than an hour and a half away at most which means we have a lot to do and very little time in which to do it if you follow my instructions to the letter we may survive the first assault after that its in the hands of fortune and the fates if you believe in such personally i believe in me and so must you this is how it shall be and as wrathstack loomed ever closer so she went on to lay the foundations of survival in a little while handpicked lieutenants and warriors began to peel off from the main aerial formation and go winging down to those strewn blackened exploded stumps of starside stacks whose names were long forgotten and shortly after that wratha and the rest arrived back in wrathstack but even before they landed in their various bays their orders had been received and acted upon by rear parties left in charge of the manses in guilesump madmanse wrathspire and mangemanse and especially in suckscar from which for the moment and possibly for some time to come the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe was absent which meant that his thralls and lieutenants were more than usually anxious for their own and the manses safety lights grew dim and blinked out as gasjets were plugged and mantles hooded and smoke ceased coiling from the chimneys as fires were extinguished cooking smells escaping from the kitchens to the open air were wafted this way and that dissipated by frantic wings of desmodus all other culinary activity came to an abrupt halt all signs and sigils pennants and heraldic devices were taken down and replaced by a handful of mouldering indecipherable rags out of ages past watercatchment skins were removed and likewise replaced by tattered decaying leathers all signs of recent usage of external stairs and causeways platforms turrets and such and after the various parties had landed in their manses of the landingbays themselves were disguised or camouflaged which included the removal of main supports and ironwood stanchions and the indiscriminate scattering of dust and debris where bays had been polished by the constant slither and thrust of flyers bellies so that in less than an hour the stack had taken on an appearance of disuse to the point of dereliction exactly as wratha required it and not only lights and fires smoke and smells but even the thoughts of the stacks diverse inhabitants lords lieutenants thralls and creatures alike were stilled from the basement of guilesump up through the broad levels of the killglance brothers madmanse and from canker canisons mangemanse through suckscar and wrathspire to the latters topmost turret such telepathic silence reigned as never coujd be heard wrathstack was dead or seemed it perhaps lord unsleeps great bat familiars his aerial scouts should have known better and perhaps not there was after all something of the bat in the wamphyri too not to mention other creatures such as the wolf and in cankers case the fox but more devious far there was also that of men in them they were or had been men they had the minds of men and therefore mans intelligence his cunning and tenacity but vastly enhanced by their vampire leeches and where cunning and tenacity are concerned wratha of course was a woman and so to vormulacs advance intelligence agents his familiar bats where they scouted out the way some ninety minutes ahead of the main body of his army wrathstack looked as wratha intended it to look empty and derelict even her own familiars seemed wild untamed without purpose in their flitting sideslipping weaving and plummeting courtship flights in and about wrathspires towers and turrets but sensing the approach of strangers outsiders the initial curiosity which these indigenous bats displayed quickly turned to anxiety for their colony their territory and as three of vormulacs creatures commenced circling wrathspires ramparts so the aeries own inhabitants bolted for familiar cranny entranceways into the stack and disappeared within plainly they werent much for defending their territory these great cowards vormulacs scouts set up a derisive chittering and made to follow the stacks bats to their very roost where in future they would lord it over the entire colony and so the lord unsleeps creatures entered wrathstack whose massive walls muffled to indecipherable squeaks and squeals their panic cries of shock surprise and sudden death and the brief flailing of membrane wings to the fading echoes of a flutter a second trio of vormulacs creatures had stooped on the tumbled aeries of the old wamphyri lying broken on the boulder plains exploring them in the exposed exploded areas of their shattered stems and bases but delving too deeply they fared no better than the others netted by lieutenants and trampled by warriors their cries were trapped in dust and rubble and lost in the ruins of blackened basements no word of wrathas whereabouts would reach turgosheims army through the medium of desmodus at least and indeed a halfhour later neither a creature nor a sound nor even a thought betrayed the lady but an effect of fickle nature that announced her presence even a dozen miles away and so went far beyond wrathas or anyone elses control ten miles east of the great pass into sunside lord vormulac taintspore had landed his army in the heights of the barrier mountains on what was once a mighty lava flow now a series of gently sloping plateau summits like a giants causeway rising from east to west and gradually angling south into the fanged caldera of the dead volcano from there he and his most valued confidante the socalled virgin grandam devetaki skullguise along with laughing zack shornskull and lady zindevar cronesap mounted fresh flyers and went up again to find a place to perch spy out the land and confer a while in private but after they found a landing site in the topmost peaks of the agesworn caldera and when they gazed out from their high vantage point on all of this unknown land what they saw cut conversation to a minimum far to the south the rim of the world was outlined against a haze of faint starlight its curve silhouetted by a dim sickle of amethyst light growing dimmer by the minute residual of sunset and at the foot of the barrier mountains ranging out and away to the savanna and the far furnace deserts all of sunsides forests spread like a dark green ocean under everbrightening icecluster stars from east to west as far as the eyes could see that fertile tract with its promise and much more than a promise of human life for there in the woods campfires four sets of them two to the east one directly below and another a mile or so west not the fires of trogs no for here in old sunside the aboriginals were as their turgosheim cousins night creatures cavedwellers starsiders wherefore these must be the camps of men they could only be hot human blood for lord taintspores army to fuel his war on wratha the risen except if wratha and her renegades were here then what sort of men were these western sunsiders that they lit her way with fires to guide her to them in the night had she brought them to heel so quickly then in the space of only two or three years were these the fires of supplicant tribes as the szgany of turgosheims sunside or was it that wratha and her lot like so many of vormulacs men and creatures had failed to make the crossing from east to west had been devoured by the rising sun or had fallen into the reeking acid lakes of the great red waste in which case these people would never have suspected wrathas existence in the first place and so would continue their simple lives as always which might possibly explain these apparently careless fires but in turn posed another question why so few fires or was there another entirely different infinitely more threatening solution to this puzzle back in turgosheim the venerable maglore had declared these western regions free of wamphyri influence indeed the seerlord maglore had been sure that the last of the old wamphyri had died out some eight hundred sunups ago in a terrible holocaust wrought by a magician in their midst who had called up things beyond his control but what if maglore was wrong and the old wamphyri survived to this day what a greeting wratha would have had from them the theory might also serve to explain these campfires for if there were vampires here and if their reign had been unbroken since time immemorial then of course a majority of the tribes would be supplicant all of these were points which vormulac and his generals chewed over in the peaks before laughing zack shornskull said there is of course a simple way to find out take a handful of chosen men and monsters fly down on the most isolated of those fires and take prisoners its something that must be done anyway if wed feed our men and beasts then if the people down there arent supplicants already they damn soon will be and a heavy tithe to pay too i fear and zack a squat barrelbodied tub of a lord chuckled deep in the back of his throat as was his wont there was never any humour in zacks mirth but he chuckled anyway before vormulac could answer devetaki exclaimed look there and all heads turned north where she pointed which was the moment that wratha was discovered or if not the lady herself her fortress stack at least and see said devetaki see now tell me is that an aerie or what erratic in its orbit the pale disk of a blue and silver moon seemed on a level with their eyes over the cold northern horizon perhaps it was lit by the northstar or by starshine in general or its own surface was of reflective rocks whichever and despite that the sun was down the moon sailed over starside like a softly glowing bubble in the sky except it seemed stabbed in its belly by a mighty spire by the topmost fang of the last aerie and just as that telltale moon had informed vormulac of his safe passage over the great red waste so now it informed on wrathstack which was otherwise camouflaged by night and dark and distance and down there cried devetaki whose eyes were keener that the rest put together there to the west that glowing light in the starside foothills what of that see it throws a plume of foxfire out across the plain of boulders for she had spied the starside gate vormulac frowned snapped his fingers i sent a team of great bats ahead along the spine of these barrier mountains he said six of them but only five returned they reported a great wonder a ball of cold white light halfburied in the foothills the familiar who was lost strayed too close to the light was blinded by it and eaten up such was my translation of their report that he nodded his great head in the direction of devetakis pointing finger is perhaps the thing which they reported no doubt well find out more as we journey west ah but i sent six more to spy out the land across the plain of boulders and see if they could discover ought of wratha the risen so far theyve not returned not a one of them he turned cold suspicious goldflecked scarlet eyes on the distant stack and as vormulacs frown deepened so his eyebrows drew together over the bridge of his hawk nose then to zindevar cronesap my lady what of your own familiars which you brought with you out of turgosheim i trust you instructed them as i required of you zindevar was a lady in name only no more or less than any wamphyri lady except she made no effort to hide the truth of her aspect the facts of her lifestyle which in any event were plainly evident in her face and form what looks and shape she had worn on the day of her ascension shed kept they were scarcely desirable to men but in zindevars case this was just as well with the exception of a small handful of fighting men her male thralls and lieutenants were eunuchs which and apart from breeding stock all men shoujd be according to the lady aye six of them she answered i sent three along the sunside flank as far as they could go and still return in the first quarter of the night dont expect them back yet a while the others went out over the sunside forests to see what they could discover of secretive szgany with a bit of luck theyll ignore campfires such as these weve seen as being the work of supplicants and seek out the furtive ones in the forests if such men are to be found then my bloodhounds will find them be sure vormulac gave a grunt perhaps of disappointment this lastmentioned trio of yours they too might take hours in the performance of their task she shrugged mannish shoulders as long as it takes is it important the warriorlord glanced at her wrinkled his nostrils a very little otherwise was not intimidated by the lady zindevars decidedly male aura for the atmosphere about her was ever pervaded with this manly odour a cloying stench of sweat and muscle which all her many perfumes together could not hope to obscure despite her years whose number fell not far short of vormulacs hundred and fifty she looked youngish or in her middlespan at most which said a deal for her lifestyle zindevar was no zolteist no great ascetic indeed and in her leather armour for all that her face was rouged and painted under her visor and the telltale girth of her bust and behind she looked far more the warrior than a good many of vormulacs handsome young lords eventually he answered her it could be important aye for i would like to send a few more bats to spy on that tower there and on those lesser mounds lying scattered all about he indicated the lone stack far out on the boulder plains a dark fang now and hard to make out for the hurtling moon had ridden on and the auroral curtain wove too high to make a silhouette and humped on the plain in disarray those dark and enigmatic remains of which hed spoken he turned to devetaki skullguise my lady do you have bats with you or if not do you know of any other who brought his familiar creatures with him out of turgosheim devetaki answered with a nod her goldfiligreed frowning halfmask glinting with reflected starshine yes to your second question my lord unsleep probably i cant be certain of course for a great many of us made the crossing and we each looked to our own contingents but to hazard a guess did you ever know wamus of wamscarp to venture anywhere without his familiars why lord wamus is himself a great bat or as close as he can get good vormulac was pleased as always your advice is the very best devetaki and your common sense easily outweighs the socalled talents of so many of your contemporaries he smiled a rare appreciative if gloomy smile at her til talk to wamus the virgin grandam probably as old and wise in the ways of turgosheim as vormulac himself had been a favourite of his for decades she had long been a member of the gorges covert yet governing triumvirate its other members being maglore the mage and the warriorlord unsleep of course so vormulac was wellacquainted with devetakis history he knew she professed zolteism as a creed and much like himself was an ascetic within the limits of wamphyri nature at least devetaki skullguise was no girl but a mature woman regal of stature proud but not haughty as to the privileges of her title she was neither a virgin nor in the matriarchal sense a grandam she desired no bloodsons or daughters to fight over masquemanse when she was gone for shed seen more than enough of that as a thrall gifted with a rare beauty redheaded longlimbed fullbreasted and unblemished devetaki had been taken in the tithe as a girl alas shed gone to a manse whose master had daughters out of diverse females but no sons also he had no special odalisk no wife as such on whom to bestow his egg his vampire daughters vied with each other naturally to see which one would become wamphyri and a lady in all likelihood they would be wamphyri anyway but the one who got his egg would be first among them now however when they saw devetaki and knew how their father was taken with her she soon became the victim of their jealousy for if he should fall in love with her who could say but that in the heat of passion she might not receive his egg and so usurp them all to cut a long story short she was challenged by the strongest of his girls she was offered an ironwood knife while her opponent wore a gauntlet she stabbed the other to the heart and took her head but in the fighting lost the right half of her pretty face flensed from the cheekbone the lord of the manse had heard the commotion and came to see enraged at the loss of one of his five daughters furious at the spoiling of devetakis face and driven to an absolute frenzy by the sight of so much blood spilled in his own manse all without his permission he suffered a brainstorm and collapsed he was old after all and his leech doubtless believing it was all up with him produced an egg which issued from his mouth as the pearly thing skittered this way and that upon the floor the surviving daughters scrabbled to attract or otherwise obtain it by scooping it up by attempting to fall upon it with their mouths even by opening their bodies to it but the blood is the life and devetaki was drenched in blood sensing her strength the egg knew that it had found a worthy host it turned scarlet in the moment that it touched her it flowed like living liquid to the raw pulp of her face and as the others tore their hair the egg soaked into her devetaki was wamphyri and three sunups later when the lord of the manse died she ascended to a lady then one by one without too much ado she did away with the other sisters and so became sole heir to one of the mightiest manses in turgosheim and from then on she made it plain how she had got her egg not through the seduction of her lord or by usurping him or through any act of lust or love but simply because the vampire seed had known who should be its rightful recipient and to this day she had never admitted to being an odalisk in the first place hence virgin and the grandam in her title referred to her long years as mistress of masquemanse not to her progeny for there was none as for skullguise the cognomen resulted from a small affectation when devetakis mood was good she wore a smiling halfmask over the naked bone when it was sour or serious she wore a frowning halfmask but when she was most angry then she wore no mask at all vormulacs praise had obviously pleased her saying nothing at all she turned her face away and took her smiling mask from her belt to replace the scowl shed been wearing on the other hand laughing zack shornskull was not pleased at all lord vormulac he said times wasting why send more bats to look at that lone tower when you can send men if wratha is there and unless she has built herself a powerful army why my contingent alone has her measure and if she did have such an army do you honestly believe shed still be in hiding no not wratha she would be fighting vormulac for all that he was the warriorlord knew as much about true war as the others very little he was expert at settling feuds and putting down insurrection but his knowledge of logistics strategy the science or basic elements of war was rudimentary to say the least he did know however that he had men and beasts to feed and must find adequate shelter for them before sunup and that he must yet fight a bloody war whenever that should come but he also knew wratha was devious to a fault and that laughing zack probably underestimated her and with regard to lord shornskull himself vormulac was finding it irksome the ways in which this fool aped him the way he stuck so close and copied his thralls hairstyle and pretended a comparable status so that all in all it might be a good thing to put him out of sight a while are you suggesting that you personally investigate that stack out there the warriorlords irongrey moustaches twitched a very little where they dipped to meet his goatish beard it was a sure sign of his displeasure but zack chose to ignore it have you something against the idea nothing at all on the contrary i like it a warlord should appreciate those among his generals who take the initiative perhaps you would like to command the crusade entire now zack backed off a little my only desire is to save time lord vormulac good then be on your way and zindevar here can go with you to organize a party of her own to investigate those fires ive matters to talk over with devetaki it was a cursory dismissal which this time zack had the common sense to recognize a nod of his head to devetaki another to vormulac and he made for his flyer zindevar likewise but scowling as she went when they had gone vormulac said he irritates me because youre forty years older wiser stronger devetaki told him its that zindevar who irritates me the crone now what matters are these you would discuss eh ah no that was mainly to be rid of them though there are things to talk about certainly devetaki i think i may go down with zindevar and see whats what with those fires similarly i want you to take a reconnaissance party and go on ahead perhaps as far as that light in the foothills except i would caution you mind how you go aye for i value your company and friendship as much as your counsel and now give me the benefit of your good advice and tell me what else should i do to ensure that all runs smooth two things only she told him without pause and let these suffice one always insure that your men and creatures are fed and watered that they have what small pleasures are due them and sleep out of harms way where the sun may not find them two hold tight your rein on spoilers and troublemakers these lords were feudal before our time and would be again without that we curb them he nodded devetaki as always you are my right arm and now lets get to it they took a little longer coming than wratha had thought and there were not so many of them also they came in something of stealth or quietly at least which is to say they too kept their minds shielded which was all to the good no telltale thoughts issued out from the last aerie and no sly alien probes sought entry the telepathic aether seemed sterile too sterile from on high laughing zack shornskull looked down on the upper ramparts of wrathstack and thought i dont like it nothing stirs well except for those ancient penants all sluggishiiy aflutter neither a thought nor even a bat yet a place as massive as that must surely have its colonies and he chuckled however grimly a trap an ambush or is she simply hiding what disaster could have befallen the lady that the proud and haughty wratha even wratha the risen has gone to earth like some sunside fox or could it be that the place is truly deserted but this massive mighty stack deserted and as easily and as suddenly as that zacks great wide grinning mouth was moist and flowing with saliva lust for the aerie itself for in turgosheim zackstack was the veriest pimple by comparison like a heap of pebbles in the bed of the gorge and only marginally taller than lorn halfstrucks trollmanse but this place why it could easily equal or even contain one third of all turgosheims great manses if a man were lord here if a single man were lord and master of the entire stack why he could build house and command such an army that but then so could a woman zacks lustful territorial thoughts the inspiration of his leech subsided as quickly as they had risen for in his passion hed hit upon an inescapable truth that if wratha was here then she was here no lord or lady of the wamphyri could ever have resisted it the opportunity to reign over an aerie such as this to reign supreme but on the other hand this was only one stack and all the vast expanse of this new starside still unexplored wratha and her five had fled out of turgosheim that time was it possible that they all inhabited aeries such as this strewn far and wide across these boulder plains in which case they would not have had time to build their armies not yet as a colony working together perhaps but not as individuals constantly vying with each other so perhaps one of the rebels was here or in the case of the killglance brothers maybe two of them but which zack signalled his party to move in closer especially his eager warriors who had stood well off so as not to alert with the throb and sputter of their propulsors and continued to circle the upper levels and gradually losing altitude he sank through the sombre night until the bluetinged white calcined fangs and sloping roofs of wrathspire rose up like a castle within his spiral and the boneembellished base plummeted far below and still nothing stirred neither a breath nor a thought so that zack was given to think deserted aye it could well be but men and monsters had been here upon a time certainly as witness the windows balconies chimneys flying buttresses platforms causeways and and landingbays why send in thralls or lieutenants to examine the stack when there were warriors to do the job and laughing his most sinister laugh lord shornskull opened his mind and called them in and ordered the first of them down into the yawning cavern mouth of the largest of the uppermost bays then even as the creature descended hovering at the rim of the bay with mantle fluttering gasbags inflated and propulsors angling this way and that zack heard it the faintest echo of telepathic terror a telltale gibbering in the psychic aether like the whinny of a cornered goat as the wolves close in no no he mustnt find me here please jet him go away awaaay wratha she was here after all alone undefended and in zack ordered his construct without further pause its propulsors fired once landing limbs uncoiled reached out the great armoured body settled to the polished rim of the bay fascinated zacks aerial troops looked on all eyes zeroed in on the landingbays windows balconies precarious causeways if the great aerie had defenders surely they must show themselves now yet all was still silent somewhere within the lady hid wratha the risen a woman at bay and laughing zack would drag her in chains naked and begging before vormulac taintspore for his notsotender mercies but wratha had heard that last again her terror was such she could not contain it but once more issued a futile appeal to faithless fates please dont let him find me please make him go away and in alj of you zack ordered his troops there are landingbays on ajl levels use them find her find wratha and bring her to me its possible shes alone but any with her destroy them feed them to the warriors to fuel them back to the barrier mountains but do not harm wratha not a hair of her head for i fancy lord unsjeep has plans of his own for her ill starside ambush nestors enquiry cankers discovery all eyes were on wrathstack and not one of them watching the fireblackened ruins of the tumbled stacks of the old wamphyri where they littered the plain of boulders for miles all around since the closest of these shattered stumps and the mounds and tumuli of their debris lay something more than a mile away and the more immediate visual lure of the last aerie and the drama about to be enacted there was so strong this was scarcely surprising but as zacks forces approached and carried out cursory examinations of the ledges and landingbays on the various levels while zack himself stood off to survey and command the activities of his party so a massed emergence and launching was taking place from several of the fallen stacks most of wrathstacks major entranceways were in the eastfacing wall of the aerie wrathas ambush came from the west and as the rumble of zacks warriors propulsors disguised the throb and stutter of wrathas so the gauntly looming mass of the aerie itself served to hide their approach from view zack had five warriors three of his own and two borrowed specifically for this detail one of the latter was a giant of a beast of vormulacs design and construction in zacks estimation too unwieldy by far the rest of them were smaller but devastatingly fearsome creatures for all that he also had six flyers in addition to his own they carried three lieutenants and six senior thralls the latter mounted two to a beast accompanied by a flyer and two thrall minders or commanders the giant warrior had proceeded to the base of the stack and was about to land in a vast landingbay only a few hundred feet over the boulder plains the remaining warriors and their commanders had taken up roughly equidistant hovering positions close to platforms entranceways and landingbays as suitable or available in the length of the stack laughing zack himself attended his own warrior where it had landed in wrathas main bay and was using its chitin prow as a batteringram to force massive inner doors hearing the doors groaning and straining under the brutal attack zacks grin was broad as his lustful face for a while until suddenly it became apparent to lord shornskull just how precipitant was his laughter for from close at hand and without warning wrathas mental command entered his skull with all the sharpness and force of a szgany crossbow bolt no timid tremulous shuddering and cowering now as that treacherous voice of hers cried strike them strike them now zack hadnt quite landed his flyers wings were hugelyarched airtraps and its thrustercumlanding tentacles were extended reaching for the rim of the bay but instinctively even as wrathas voice and message registered zack backed his mount out over the gulf of air away from the face of the stack which probably served to extend his lifespan a little over the landingbay like lashes over an eye heavy sections of harpoontipped rusty iron grille were held aloft on ropes depending from various windows the ropes were frayed from years of disuse but many of the grille sections had been welded to the vertical face by the action of nitre which did not include those directly above the central landing area suddenly those sections were released their ropes hissing as they uncoiled from narrow windows and the harpoon heads slammed down in line to strike sparks from the polished rock of the bay a moment earlier the long neck of zacks mount would have been pierced through and maybe zack himself even the best possible scenario would have seen him bucked out of his saddle into thin air and oh and who jaughs now eh zack wrathas mocking mental voice taunting him from somewhere within but not for long lady he answered with a snarl turning his startled mount to one side and stalling it into a clumsy glide which was a single moment before he heard the first dull rumble of angry alien propulsors and round from behind the great fang of wrathstack they came full of deadly intent riding a breeze out of the northern icelands and spacing themselves to provide individual challenges to zacks lesser creatures four of the most nightmarish constructs he had ever seen from their aspect alone without that zack sensed the fearsome focus of their tiny minds or saw the scarlet bloodlust in their eager swivelling saucer eyes he knew the defenders were experienced in battle and where his own forces were mainly expeditionary exploratory these were full of purpose a grim determination and knew their enemy a pair of flyers too their lieutenant riders alert and observant in their saddles gliding out from fortifications on wrathspires roof to direct the warriors and in the last great aerie itself a hundred minds coming sharply awake uncloaking as their owners went to work with a vengeance more flyers emerging from secret exits below and rising on the icelands wind and a veritable cloud of small but deadly aerial warriors suddenly appearing as if from nowhere back off get out of it he sent his telepathic command with all the force of his vampire mind theyve set a trap an ambush too late his warrior trapped in wrathas landingbay raged like the mad thing it was and vented furious propulsive gases but to no avail barbed pikeheads came stabbing from niches in the walls and through holes in the floor tearing at its gasbladders and slashing at its undulating mantle mainly unhurt though definitely incapacitated finally the stupid thing answered its masters command and backed out of the bay taking the dangling grilles with it in a jumble of buckled iron it flopped free of the stack and fired its propulsors to stabilize its flight but with air whistling through holes in its mantle and most of its buoyancy gases escaped from ruptured bladders the doomed warriors ungainly retreat was erratic to say the least howling its frustration it quickly capsized commenced a spiralling accelerating dive slammed headlong into one of suckscars causeways at its junction with the stack and burst like a bomb steaming hot plasma painted suckscars slanting strata red great gouts of blood washed outwards in a scarlet flood and ran in a torrent down the wall of the aerie loose scales chunks of smoking meat and chitin shards spun lazily in the gulf of air and as the huge body crumpled to the nearvertical wall clung for a moment and then began to fall its raw flesh left a crimson skidmark where it slipped and slithered until finally it struck a projection and was deflected outwards and down end over end into eternity the rest of zacks party were faring no better close to the base of the stack vormulacs giant construct had somehow been driven from the rim of gorvi the guiles landingbay and attacked in midair by speedier more manoeuvrable creatures with its gasbladders ruptured and listing badly it had been forced down on the boulder plains damaged in the crashlanding it had lain helpless as all three of gorvis ground warriors closed in these earthbound constructs unhampered by the clumsy bladders and skirtlike mantles of their aerial cousins were heavily armoured and hideously agile built and equipped for infighting they grunted their exertions and roared their triumph as they stripped the giant to its alveolate bones and strewed its guts far and wide several of zacks lieutenants and thralls had effected landings in the stacks bays some managed to escape others didnt zack saw a flyer about to launch a handful of defenders emerged from niches to scramble beneath it and cling on to or hack at its launching limbs the flyer tilted over the very rim flapped its manta wings to avoid toppling was held back and down by the sheer weight of numbers clinging to its belly as its rider was bucked cursing from his saddle other defenders rammed pike after pike into the flyers belly before its thrusters were sliced through and it was allowed to fall one of the remaining three warriors had landed on a sabotaged platform defenders of madmanse released chains knocked loose weakened stanchions sent the thing plummeting but some clever thrall had learned a lesson from lardis lidesci before the warrior fell it had been drenched in oil and torched now a fireball lit the dark night air hissing and screaming puffing jets of blue and white fire as it plunged to earth wrathas flyers coming from above attacked zacks they swooped their riders lowered clusters of weighted razorsharp hooks zacks thralls were gripped through leathers and flesh ripped from their saddles and dashed against the aeries wall or simply allowed to fall if they had been wamphyri they might have shaped metamorphic flesh for flight but they were only men a clump of gleaming hooks swung close to zack himself too close he felt the vibration of the air as the weapon whistled by his head and ripped a chunk from his flyers manta wing and that was enough for laughing zack away and run for the barrier mountains he called to men and beasts alike but needlessly even a brave man knows when to flee with or without orders the survivors two warriors one listing badly and three flyers including zacks own one of which was minus its rider turned away from the last aerie and made off or would have but even wratha had not foreseen the rest of it from out of the northeast some pulsing spurting thing zeroed in on zacks damaged warrior ducked beneath the listing hulk of its body and sliced its bladders tip to tail with twin rows of erectile dorsal spines a construct of vasagi the suck at his monstrous best the warrior had been designed with just such a purpose in mind the disposal of other aerial warriors except vasagi was gone now and nestor lichloathe ruled in suckscar wratha had come out onto a balcony to see the last of it it was nestor aye returned now from whatever lone mission had diverted him in sunside nestor upon his flyer all swathed and cloaked as usual his face masked except for his eyes burning with some inner passion or incendiary knowledge and accompanying him his best out of suckscar survivors of the defeat at sanctuary rock they were eager to give good account of themselves and so balance the odds but with what little was left of zacks lot there was scarcely enough work for them nestors warriors fell on lord shornskulls sole remaining beast and dismembered it in short order and his riderless flyer went the same way one lone thrall and flyer first away from the ambush had put sufficient distance between to effect an escape which left laughing zack himself as nestors warriors zeroed in on his flyer and fired on all propulsors for a multiple ram zack reverted to character threw back his great head and laughed loud at nestor across the gulf of air but in the moment before the collision he loosened his cloak divested himself and launched from his doomed flyers back threequarters of the way to earth he achieved metamorphosis formed webbing between his arms and legs flattened his body to an airfoil all in vain for even as he slipped into a controlled glide so nestors flyer swooped on him snatched from midair zack was gripped in the flyers belly pouch with only his left arm and leg protruding these kicked a while regained their normal shape then hung still the flyer had clamped its rubbery pouch shut on zack to expel all air and even a vampire must breathe or suffocate lord shornskull was no exception a moment more and he was not dead but very unconscious so he remained until two hundred and fifty feet over the boulder plains nestor hauled on his reins to bring his mount out of its dive and commanded the creature drop him zacks body fell like a stone burst like an egg spattered the dirt and pebbles black in the starlight his parasite leech itself injured and knowing it was all up for him fled his shattered body one of gorvis warriors coming to investigate failed to see the leech and crushed it flat thus zack suffered the true death and knew only darkness for a while until the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri spoke to him in his fashion and said zacjt shornskull ah but youre a mess now i might even sympathize and leave you in peace or i never knew you in life and so have nothing against you in death but alas it cant be for there are things you know which i must know before i may leave you to sleep the last long sleep and what said zack who did you not feel me before i even spoke to you nestors deadspeak voice oozed like tar strange that because the rest of them do the the rest of them the rest of who the rest of the dead they know when i am near for i can feel them trembling in my mind it is my art you see and the dead ear me for it zack had known he was dead or at least he had very much suspected it in that pitch black interval before his mind was awakened again for regaining consciousness in the last moment before crashing to earth on the boulder plains hed known that no man not even a vampire could survive such a fall yet now it seemed he was alive after all alive aye but blind and crippled and empty for he sensed that even his leech had deserted him hed come so close but closer them you think zack nestor told him for you are dead and i am the necromancer nestor lichloathe there was no feeling none whatever in any of zacks limbs it might even be that he had no limbs or that there was no life in them which would be the case naturally if he were really dead where am i in suckscar to which ive lifted you up in wrathstack which you invaded wrathstack named after wratha the risen well zack had got that right at least and a thrall had escaped to get word of her whereabouts back to vormulac huh cold comfort to lord zack shornskull who was either dead or in the company of a madman his thoughts were deadspeak of course and nestor heard them no either about it zack the necromancer told him in his most gentle and his most terrifying voice you are dead to the world but not to me and now i have some questions or you some small points which we would clarify we myself the lady wratha the killglance brothers canker and gorvi of course and vasagi ah no for he is gone and i have taken his place his manse ah suckscar correct i like the name which isnt out of place after all vasagi sucked with his beak and i with my mind he sucked from veins and i from brains even dead minds i suck knowledge zack and you have what i need so lets be at it the first of my questions how many men monsters and flyers has vormulac unsleep and where is he camped aye a madman zack answered at once what i should tell you where vormulac is why he would tear out my heart and eat it raw and despite the weirdness of lord shornskulls situation he allowed himself a chuckle the worst possible error for a moment later i see you need convincing nestor sighed but ill admit i admire your tenacity to laugh from the throat of death dont you mean in the face of death said zack and nestors answer more doleful yet you do need convincing dont you now listen do you feel this at last zack did feel something a breath of air and a sweet one at that blowing cool in his face like the breath of some gasping sunside woman trapped on the run stripped of her skirt and thrown flat feeling his weight come down on her and his first probing stab in the moist sleeve of her cunt youve a vivid imagination nestor told him quietly but inaccurate to say the least i merely breathed on you i dont take it red too often and my breath is sweet but tell me why dont you breathe on me eh or even spit on me if you like why dont you at least try zack because you cant can you ah but if only you could see what i can see then youd know for sure why you cant breathe see feel shall i show you hhhow can you show a blind man anything i am a necromancer zack you can hear my voice and feel my breath my touch and when i concentrate why then you may even see what i see like so zack saw and screamed even laughing zack screamed like that same sunside slut hed raped his very first shed been after he ascended and achieved his full measure of metamorphism ah that was a fuck shagged dry first then sliced to the ribs as he turned his tool to a cartilagetoothed saw not so dry then but wet and hot on his quivering bone conjured deliberately the memory of her agony served as a balm for his own really said nestor as shornskulls mental shuddering subsided did you do that zack my but you were a hard one in your time not so hard now though indeed youre even a bit soft in places eh and again he showed zack to zack the wobbling soggy mess that had been a man but by now the other was sobbing and nestor very much suspected that he wouldnt need to torture him not this one for he had already tortured him by showing him the truth of his condition zack knew now why he couldnt breathe because a man needs lips and a face and a throat to breathe and he knew why he felt nothing because when your limbs and your body and your head are so much jelly you cant feel anything because you are dead it was true and finally he believed nestor then you may believe this too the necromancer told him just as you felt my breath on the raw red smear of your face so you would feel my hands on your broken body and most sensitive parts that is my art and believe just one more thing i can return to you tenfold all the pain you ever gave all the pain of this vampire world again and again and again for answer the monster zack shornskull continued to sob it was as much as he could do except do you believe me nestor must have an answer yes yes yes zack sobbed and he sensed nestors talon hands draw back from where they were poised and he felt that they drew back reluctantly following which he answered the necromancers questions every one and nestor knew he answered true at the end of it zack wanted to know whats to become of me and he sensed the negligence in nestors answer his deadspeak shrug what else can become its over ill be buried burned or what i am or was a lord of the wamphyri after all have i no rights none our forces are depleted theres the provisioning to consider youll be eaten lords are not eaten zack was aghast their essence may transfer something of them however little may get into lesser creatures is that a fitting end for a lord continuity without consciousness in wartime lords are eaten nestor contradicted him and we are at war you wont infect any of ours but if you did so what they are already vampires every one as for your wamphyri essence that will be well distributed ground down fine with the meat of lesser men why the warriors wont notice the difference you are a monster zacks final protest arent we all nestors answer then as laughing zacks shattered remains were removed so wratha stepped forward spat upon them and cried her derision who laughs last laughs loudest eh zack but lord shornskull couldnt hear her and nestor didnt bother to translate nestor told wratha everything hed learned from zack the warriorlord vormulacs whereabouts the strength of his army the fact that almost every lord and lady in turgosheim with the exception of maglore the mage who had remained behind as caretaker had joined lord unsleeps crusade against her following which she went off with the others escorted from suckscar as was only right and proper to make her plans only the doglord lingered and nestor could tell from cankers expression and actions that something was amiss whats wrong he wanted to know when he was sure that the others were out of his manse where are those high spirits of yours now canker why is your bark changed to a whine but i might easily ask the same of you canker snarled by way of an answer indeed in the last four to five months why i might have asked it a dozen times nestor nodded wearily beckoned the doglord to a chair himself stood gazing from a window at the blackfanged silhouette of the distant barrier range aye things have changed he finally said weve sniffed war a while now and finally its come nerves have become frayed even friendships it appears this has nothing to do with fighting and war canker growled coming directly to the point youve not wanted my friendship for quite some time now since its nothing that i have done it has to be something with you well friends are for listening so now its my turn to ask whats wrong nestor looked at him opened his mouth looked away and said i cant tell you but i can tell you this if ive kept away from you or kept you from me it has done you no harm a riddle if you like i dont and again canker whined fingered the injured side of his face and head again especially his ear shook his head and blinked rapidly that knock you took nestor was solicitous as best he could be maybe maybe not said the other and smiling with his eyes nestor gave a wry chuckle and said now who makes riddles its as if we played word games canker yelped huh but although the necromancers hidden smile had seemed wan it was all it took to perk him up a little he grinned a foxy grin in return sprang up from his chair shook himself like a great dog as was his wont and made to approach nestor at the window but the other at once shrank back at which canker was more than ever crestfallen perhaps perhaps if i tell you then youll tell me no nestor shook his head why not the doglord frowned his spiked eyebrows coming together over his snout because theres no answer to what ails me and since it cant be helped theres no point in mentioning it but thats not to say i cant listen to you didnt you say it yourself that friends are for listening the other loped to his chair and flopped into it and i hate this he said his voice a low growl this impasse an impasse may be breached no this condition your condition canker sat up straighter looked directly into nestors eyes my friend youve heard how the others talk about me behind my back nestor shrugged they talk about me about each other theres no peace or satisfaction in any of them or in me or in you were wamphyri canker clawed at his ear again shook his head more violently yet but in a little while he grew calmer you know of course that my father went baying mad his ear went soft on the inside began to stink and leaked his brains hed seen it coming for he was oneiromantic too so that when his favourite bitch dropped me he named me after his affliction canker as if i were to blame for it or as if i were the spawn of it when i was yet a pup he mounted a flyer and flew off into the sun his talent came to me through his seed and his vampire egg through a fond fatherly kiss but am i also heir to his madness finally nestor understood is that whats bothering you you think youre mad going mad aye canker growled maybe ridiculous what you crazy crazy as a fox perhaps cankers feralcored eyes were suddenly miles away r vacant except for a distant glimmer but i have had such dreams nestor such dreams as even i cant believe my silver mistress in the moon i had thought there was just the one but perhaps the moon is full of them to hell with this war once more im driven to play upon my instrument of bones and do homage to the goddess of the skies he was on his feet again eyes blazing now and now nestor most definitely would not bet upon the doglords sanity he sent out a call to his firstlieutenant zahar come and said to canker mangemanse needs you my friend its time you went down and saw to things hell will have to wait for the war is here my man zahar will see you out but the other grabbed his arm pleading with him nestor my dear young lord out of sunside you must tell me am i mad is the moon eating at my brain nestor saw a way to reason with him did wratha and the others call you mad when first you mentioned your silver moon mistress yes they did even i found it strange but tell me now is she real or not your siggi and now are you saying youve dreamed of others one other more woman than girl mature but a beauty beyond imagining then your madness is not yet proven call her down if you must and if she comes then ill know that im sane exactly zahar came and canker at least partially appeased left f with him but when they were well away from nestors private rooms canker said zahar your master is my friend do you believe that i have seen it lord zahars tone was cautious how may i doubt it canker nodded just so and i fancy that you are a good and true lieutenant and love him well as much as you may is it so you know it is lord then you are concerned for his welfare of course lord ah but what is it that concerns you zahar was the victim of a word game but one with a point as he now saw having admitted his concern for nestor now he must say why or perhaps not for a true lieutenant would never give his master away after all you know i may not tell you that lord he protested my master would send me soaring like a szgany kite from his highest window except im a good deal heavier than a kite and not so airworthy but something ails him dont deny it for ive seen how you shun him ah and canker snapped his fingers but its true you do shun him why this place was full of life or undeath at least but now its gloomy as melancholy vormspire in the gorge of turgosheim very well so you wont tell me whats wrong despite that my only interest lies in putting it right then tell me this instead what happened tonight on sunside where did you go and what did you do zahar was confused the doglord was so quick his questions coming thick and fast zahar couldnt guard his mind and tongue both since his thoughts were transparent to the other he must blank them out but before he could do so he felt cankers telepathic probe only for a moment until zahar conjured thoughts of warmth and softness safety and sleep such thoughts as a foetus might think in its mothers womb it did the trick but how much had the doglord seen judging by his disappointed expression not much and huh canker grunted well and so you are indeed a good man and true which is as it should be protect your masters interests say i and who knows but that one day you might even get his egg at which zahar lichloathe could scarcely contain the look of horror which threatened to twist his face the stab of terror he felt in his heart but no harm done for the doglord had not noticed apparently canker had noticed and he at least had kept his thoughts to himself as hed probed zahars mind and spied on all the vivid memories which flashed there memories of nestors raid after the ignominious defeat of the wamphyri at sanctuary rock a place at the edge of the forest where the mighty ironwoods grew to the rim of the savanna beyond which the furnace deserts sprawled south a place under the trees of lowroofed construction as if huddling or hiding there and a place that nestor had known about obviously not so strange canker thought despite the lads amnesia there were still things he occasionally remembered from the old days from his time as a szgany youth in the tribe of lardis lidesci and as the doglord proceeded down into mangemanse he scanned the screen of his own memory recalling the rest of what hed read in zahars unguarded mind of nestors flyers silent landing a little way out on the savanna where a hummock of crabgrass half an acre square guaranteed an easy takeoff of his handful of men fanning out to surround the dark huddle of lodges beneath the trees while he brought up his eager fighting beasts from where they waited like storm clouds in the starlit sky and of his command that the warriors crash down indiscriminately through the forests canopy how they brought down massive branches with them and crushed many of the furtiveseeming dwellings into the floor of the forest then the hoarsevoiced screams that at once went up from the wrecked houses the frightened bellowing of domestic beasts in their pens and the squawk and flutter of chickens in their coops the uproar of the warriors where they proceeded with their deadly work except here a surprising perhaps even astonishing thing the necromancers strict mental command going out to his warriors and thralls alike that they must not eat of the flesh of these men and beasts then what was the point of it revenge but for what and anyway wouldnt that be the sweetest revenge of all to eat your enemies but no the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe had other ideas and gave his men other orders at his command his monsters had quit their wrecking and ravaging and headed for the open savanna and his men where they had spread themselves out around the low fence enclosing this secret community had set fire to the place and as the flames roared up and the surviving inhabitants attempted to escape into the nightdark woods instead of taking prisoners or recruiting thralls nestor had caused his men to throw them back into the fire but here a weird distortion of memory of zahars memory at least for canker was merely reviewing what he had glimpsed in the lieutenants mind those terrified figures fleeing some stumbling even crawling from the flames but only to be thrown back again ablebodied no not a one of them there was no fight in them they were weak crippled broken people these but crippled by the warriors ravaged by the heat of the conflagration broken in their bones by flying debris from their collapsing houses or what their silhouettes against the leaping flames grotesque misshapen twisted incomplete at first it had seemed that their clothes must be in tatters but this was no distortion for suddenly it had dawned on zahar that they themselves were the tatters and now it dawned on the doglord too and as simply and as devastatingly and as mindblastingly as that he knew that nestor had burned a leper colony the rest of it total understanding of nestors predicament came like a clap of thunder even as canker descended into mangemanse and shivering and shuddering he went to his rooms and called for one of his pups a trusted lieutenant to attend him then the internal route up into suckscar he told his man in something of a whimper or a whisper at least have it sealed tonight at once now no one shall pass that way again nothing shall pass that way not even air or light yes lord said the other gawping is that all canker nodded absentmindedly then gave himself a shake no something else wratha the risen may call for the lords myself included to attend her warcouncil all well and good except i may not hear her ill be at my devotions in the cavern of my instrument i want you to listen for her call and alert me when it comes yes lord then be about it the other departed but on his way from the doglords apartments loping through the mazy passageways and halls of mangemanse he gave a massive start coming from behind him passing him by and filling all the manse with its throbbing ululations such a longdrawn out mournful howl of a cry as never before was uttered doleful and doomfraught finally it tapered to a sob and died away the lieutenant shook his head worriedly and went about his duties as instructed iv devetakis lure some thirtyfive minutes earlier devetaki skullguise and her small reconnaissance party had landed on the boulder plains in the vicinity of the glaring hemisphere gate a cursory purely visual examination of the phenomenon had told the lady nothing but acute wamphyri senses had warned her to leave well enough alone whatever the gate was at present it was quiescent and probably better that way before landing she and her men had spied gorvis warrior where it lay recuperating in the lee of a boulder clump failing to recognize her but sensing that she was wamphyri it had issued vile gases and a warning honk but made no violent movement patently the thing was injured which meant very little sometimes an injured warrior was all the more dangerous since she had brought no fighting beasts of her own with her only the speediest flyers on what was mainly an exploratory trip devetaki ignored the creature for the moment but sent a messenger back to vormulac to report its location there was sufficient meat here to fuel lord unsleeps beasts through all the long night ahead and for some time to come his men would have other needs however taking off again she had ventured south for the mouth of the great pass and rising above it to a position approximately central in the width of the range had sensed human thoughts in the darkness of the canyon yawning below landing on a plateau east of the pass devetaki had cautioned her thralls to silence while she a highly skilled mentalist attempted to listenin on the minds of those below that they were not szgany was immediately apparent for the szgany of sunside had long since learned to shield their minds from wamphyri probes come sundown they were expert at suppressing disguising diffusing or thinning their thoughts they became moths owls or foxes in the night also in olden times in turgosheim theyd had a trick of smearing themselves with foul oil of kneblasch so discouraging investigation but as often as not the stink itself had located them and the oil could always be removed oh the szgany were wise in the ways of the wamphyri and vice versa wherefore these men in the pass were not szgany but if not travellers starside trogs or desert thyre and definitely not vampires then what ah but these were strange new lands perhaps inhabited by stranger people as well to listen to their minds a while devetaki thought and see what she could glean but what she gleaned was fantastic two of the minds were powerful talented skilled in the psychic arts one was a seer a locator he could scan afar to discover other minds enemies and even though he was sleeping when devetaki visited him still she must be careful not to announce her presence ah and his mind was dark too treacherous cunning in the olden parlance a magician this one and sinister and the other was little different except not only was his mind very powerful he himself was a power or saw himself as such at any rate a commander of men he should make a fine lieutenant and all of the men with him were his he was their commander his talent was devetakis a mentalist he could read minds at a glance and accurately but the glance was allimportant he needed eyetoeye contact to see in through the windows of the mind a pair of them then magicians and the men with them a dozen at least some wary even worried but mainly full of an alien selfconfidence strong men soldiers and all of them with a good understanding of discipline strategy tactics the very stuff of their profession they had all of those skills which the lords of turgosheim had long forgotten yet these were common men or uncommon men selfconfident aye but an alien selfconfidence as she had already noted and now devetaki looked closer they had weapons and slept with them or if not with them they kept them so close to hand it made no difference several of them dreamed of war and of using those weapons except devetaki could scarcely credit what they dreamed surely these were fantasies but then was it also a fantasy that these men had come into her world through the portal of the glaring starside hemisphere that cold white globe bedded in its crater on the boulder plains and again she thought of maglore the mage in turgosheim and what he had said of the old wamphyri that there had been magicians among them who called up powers they couldnt contain which was the beginning of the end for in a cataclysmic war such weapons were brought to bear against them that they were destroyed in all of their houses then but more carefully yet devetaki went back to the mind of their commander and probing however gently she read his purpose here conquest no less than wratha when she had fled from turgosheim and no less than vormulac now this one would subdue this entire world and bring it under the sway of his home world beyond the starside gate but no devetaki saw that she was wrong it had been his purpose to usurp sunsidestarside perhaps for alien masters but that was before they banished him or caused him to flee from them now he had another purpose he would still conquer this vampire world yes but for himself why this ones daring his ego and aspirations were as great as those of wratha herself even as great as vormulacs possibly as great as devetakis nor was it blind ambition he knew what he was up to what he went up against something of it anyway and just like his men he put his faith in the power of those alien weapons devetaki must probe deeper but he wasnt long asleep and she must be careful not to disturb him that sensitive mind of his might possibly discover her there or if not his mind perhaps that of his locator companion thus it was that concentrating concentrating a lady of the wamphyri gazed upon turkur tzonovs innermost dreams and ambitions turkur dreamed but at first his dreams were obscured by some strange intervention by a presence which watched albeit from afar for a while he tried to distance himself from it which had no more effect than floundering through a swamp to escape ones own shadow for like a mote in the eye the presence was always there until in the end he ignored it he dreamed a little of the past something of the present and snatches from a vague and uncertain future the past was fact however disappointing the present took form as directed by past events if not exactly as turkur would have it but the future could yet be as he willed it if he willed it hard enough and since dreams are the clearinghouses of the conscious mind where not only the desires but all the suppressed guilt of the waking world gains expression and the balance is adjusted accordingly much of what he dreamed was nightmarish so that he tossed and turned a little in his bed in the keep in the pass and all that he dreamed was observed by devetaki skullguise from the past turkur dreamed of the telepath siggi dam of how she had acted and looked after he and alexei yefros had downloaded her brain the night they sent her through the perchorsk gate but because he remembered other times before that remembered her body breasts buttocks and the oh so sweet suction of her sex his dream was a nightmare an expression of his guilt which he would never have admitted during waking hours of course not for siggi had been a traitor after all siggi the clever the awesomely talented the incredibly beautiful reduced to a vegetable bereft of all knowledge except the most basic instincts her recognition of being her telepathy her sexual awakenings shed been like a child again when they were through with her a shivering trembling innocent mentally innocent at least it had been achieved with the aid of a machine a technological marvel or a monstrosity however one chose to view it in his dream turkur remembered how lovely siggi dam had looked lying there drugged and mainly unfeeling but conscious where she waited for them to switch on the machine and he remembered yefros telling him its much like a computer we dont have to delete it all we can start at the beginning with her birth and his answer no jet her keep it we all need to know that for its part of the will to survive without it shed be nothing but a bag of plasma she has to have something of will so that shell know to run hide be afraid as for her childhood most of that can go but her sex her first arousal and the way she has developed or overdeveloped she can keep those things siggi was good at it and it might even keep her alive a while in starside the dream moved on but stayed focused on siggi siggi bundled stumbling through the gate caught by the grey holes seemingly gentle but nevertheless irresistible attraction and drawn in walking in a weird slowmotion wonderingly into a hazy white distance and diminishing in size as the distance increased then siggi pausing looking back trying to come back and failing her discovery that the gate was a oneway ride and of the immundane forces that allowed her to move in one direction only forward into the unknown but then again almost everything had been unknown to this newborn siggi and finally the last theyd seen of her her tiny running figure a shimmering blue and silver and platinumblonde mote on the solid yet hazywhite horizon gradually disappearing into it siggi gone through the gate into starside then as if turkurs memory his psyche his subconscious self could bear it no longer the dream moved on drew closer to the present snatches from the fighting in perchorsk turkurs men against gustav turchins forces the sheer unholy devastation unleashed by the weapons of both sides turkurs escape into the gate his first astonished impressions of starside when he and his team emerged from the glaring portal onto the plain of boulders devetaki viewed all of these things and learned something of turkur tzonovs aspirations too he had failed to become a true power in his own world for the moment but if he could somehow tame this world starting first with the szgany of sunside and eventually bringing the wamphyri themselves to heel what why the unbelievable towering ego the stupendous audacity of the man it was a new feeling for devetaki even a new emotion to stand in awe of anothers grandiose ambitions and be aware that he could probably achieve them or rather to know that he had been capable of achieving them plainly she must have him maybe even both of them tzonov and yefros together and she had reasons galore one they must not be allowed to reach sunside with these alien weapons and their superior knowledge of war fare why the szgany worked metals and could probably duplicate these deathdealing devices these guns with tzonov leading an army of resurgent szgany then the renegade wratha would be the very least of vormulacs problems two quite apart from their military skills and the definite threat of their technology these men were from another world and had full fantastic knowledge of it and there was a whiteglaring gateway into that world down there where the foothills met the boulder plains moreover and based on what devetaki had read in tzonovs subconscious mind the many and diverse inhabitants of that world were generally weak and had little or no belief in vampires even better as yet only a select handful of them knew about this world sunsidestarside obviously there was a lot more to be learned for instance how could a place like that have bred men like tzonov but that was for the future for devetakis future three these alien soldiers were newcomers here if they should fall into wrathas hands their military knowledge and technology would go with them even vormulac and his army out of turgosheim would have no great advantage then if he had one now four only deprive these men of their leader and possibly yefros too and theyd be like chickens without heads running around and squawking a great deal but without getting anywhere that would make them easy prey literally prey for there was an army to be fed or if tzonovs men should prove too valuable for use in the provisioning then they could always be recruited and what chance for wratha then oh the reasons why devetaki should at least attempt to kidnap these two talents were many and obvious not so obvious how to go about it but the virgin grandam was a woman no less than wratha and her mind moved in equally devious circles she was well aware of the weaknesses of men and how to use them to her advantage this siggi dam for instance tzonov thought she must be dead by now and he was probably right but he couldnt know for sure perhaps devetaki could convince him otherwise she issued orders to her men mounted her flyer and keeping well clear of the keep flew down into the pass and winging silently through the night she thought the weaknesses of men aye especially strong men when they think they are safe and secure in their strength but she was thinking of one such weakness in particular their curiosity turkuuur at first it was only a whisper in his dreaming mind but one that grew louder and gained definition apace with its insistence turkuuur turkuuur again he saw pictures of siggi planted in his dreams by devetaki skullguise siggi in the swirling tatters of what had once been her nightattire in which shed been dressed when she went through the perchorsk gate but just as beautiful as ever and as innocent of knowledge or perhaps not presumably she had learned something of this world or she could never have survived turkuuur and suddenly her telepathic voice firmed up turkur youre in danger what danger he mumbled in his sleep and fidgeted awkwardly in his sleepingbag by the hearth of a great fireplace in which embers were still glowing red deep in his subconscious mind however he knew that he was safe there were sentries in the keeps courtyard and watchers in its turrets but human watchers now not things left over from some nightmare past turkur im in the pass i saw you arrive and remembered you and i remember alexei but i cant come to you those men soldiers they frighten me i dont want them to see me i cant come to you because the men frighten me and so does alexei but i know you we trusted each other once you need me now turkur i know about this place its daaangers siggi she had got through to him at last he continued to sleep but his mind was lockedon to his dream and the false images planted there by devetaki in fact the lady was somewhat surprised to discover just how susceptible his mind was telepathic demanding threatening in his waking hours he was used to contacting and probing the conscious minds of inferiors but lacked a defence against her subconscious superiority and devetaki was proud of her mentalism in turgosheim one time when shed caught the seerlord maglore creeping silently through her thoughts devetaki had warned him hands off my mind maglore drift in the shallow thoughts of others all you will and catch what sprats you can but beware the swirjy deeps for there dwell great and vicious fishes and maglore had moved on at once for he had known her telepathic power and accepted her as his peer while this one this turkur accepted no one as his peer apparently therefore he would not believe he was being manipulated he would reason that his thoughts even his subconscious thoughts were wholly original to himself and he would be curious ego curiosity weakness siggi turkur mumbled again twitching more violently yet where how devetaki had developed the theme of his dream now she was sparing in its direction merely guiding turkurs stream of thought and letting him follow the trail and hoping of course that he would follow it all the way im in the pass but theres danger turkur you didnt need me before but now you do dont leave me here in the dangerous dark for if you do who wiji care for you in this new world and who will care for me would you have some coarse gypsy for your companion in sunside or would you have me it was a seductive argument tzonov almost started awake and devetaki knew it was time to move on the beacon of alexei yefross locator mind was impossible to miss his talent worked against him as devetaki located him in roughly the same vicinity probably the same room as turkur tzonov and carefully probed his subconscious thoughts she pictured the machine which she had seen in tzonovs mind and let yefros shape his own dream from the image he saw the machine and hooked up to it lying on a surgical trolley siggi as shed been that night clad only in her gauzy nightthings more beautiful than any woman he had ever known and entirely accessible except tzonov was there and anything like that was out of the question but her mouth so tempting the valley between her breasts the various openings of her body and devetaki thought hah he has the mind of a vampire lord if not the physique little wonder these two were outcasts in their own world but in my world what you would have done to her alexei my lads would do to you except you would probably enjoy it and in the guise of siggi dam devetaki sent into the psychic ether a message that both of these talents would hear im in the pass turkur but im afraid of your soldiers and of alexei yefros both of them came starting awake together and both with the same name on their lips siggi her picture was receding in their minds but a fleeting echo was still there turkur im in the pass towards sunside i was on my way back to the gate on the boulder plains when i saw you but im afraid turkur afraaaid devetaki had got her as nearly as possible right she had been the very essence of siggi dam now that tzonov and yefros were awake however she knew her subterfuge couldnt continue she could no longer be siggi but only a presence and then only to the locator so she became a presence but nothing more than that in the location that shed already chosen in the pass yefros whispered as they unzipped their bags pulled on combat boots and stood up definitely i can feel her there she survived tzonov could scarcely believe it maybe the british got it wrong and this place isnt so deadly after all but no i cant see that perhaps shes simply lucky i heard her speaking to you yefross voice was sibilant in the silence of the keep even sleeping i located her her telepathy the machine certainly didnt take that from her shes seems to be afraid of the men and shes afraid of me too he licked his lips relishing the idea it pleased yefros that someone feared him tzonov finished dressing glanced at the other she fears the filth thats in your mind he said no disrespect to your talent alexei but your personality that leaves a lot to be desired to siggis way of thinking anyway they were in a room approximately one hundred feet above the bed of the pass the room was one of a series cut back from a natural ledge under a massive overhang and walled with masonry from the rim up to the outward curving rock face beyond the wall and arched windowspaces lay empty air an archway led out on to a walled balcony looking down on the pass sharing the room with tzonov and yefros and hearing their movements and something of their conversation bruno krasin had also come awake while krasin knew of their talents he himself was of mundane perceptions and could scarcely comprehend them he understood the physical well enough especially in a military context but esp was metaphysical and so beyond him he tended to forget about it until he saw it in actual use who survived he said coming easily to his feet and am i needed he looked at the two espers their faces glowing dull red in reflected firelight siggi dam survived tzonov told him going out onto the balcony shes hiding somewhere down there in the pass in the direction of sunside were going to find her and bring her in her telepathy is still powerful and she could be extremely useful to us he had almost said to me but didnt want to show his specific interest right now he wasnt ready to admit that interest even to himself despite that something of what she had conveyed to him lingered over something about a companion would he prefer the company of a coarse gypsy woman to her that was a question he could answer later and so he put it to the back of his mind yefros and krasin joined him on the balcony stared down into darkness south the very faintest of afterglows silhouetted a narrow horizon it was less than a smudge above the inky well of night but siggis thoughts had been powerful and she was probably close somewhere down there yefros mused and to tzonov if she sees you shell come to you how do you know shes krasin started to say frowning he checked himself at once a stupid question yefros had simply known that was all do you have her tzonov glanced at the locator yefross eyes were glinting bright in starlight a presence thats all but you know its her right this from krasin without knowing it he had asked the one question that they hadnt and he followed it up with another is she on her own tzonov blinked his penetrating eyes glanced at his section commander and shrugged siggi spoke to me mind to mind alexei got something of it too a presence yefros said again just the one yes tzonov gripped krasins elbow come with us anyway and to yefros check your weapon the locator took out a small calibre highpowered automatic checked the clip replaced it in its shoulderholster more suited to a womans hand still the pistol had stopping power krasin tried not to sneer as he asked is that it yefros answered if a single bullet will stop a man i cant see much sense in using ten twenty an entire stream of them it strikes me well be a long time in this vampire world a little economy now may later be seen to make a lot of sense he spoke without too much animation but couldnt resist raising an almost effeminate eyebrow as krasin checked out his own shortbarrelled lasertargeting mm selfloading rifle krasin didnt notice but tzonov chuckled and said ah yes alexei nasty macho weapons for a nasty macho world but you are right about the economy bit we must be careful how we spend our firepower his own weapon was a machinepistol and as he spoke he moved a lever from rapid to semiautomatic fire now he must pull on the trigger for each individual shot required they descended to the ground floor of the keep quietly through rooms where the men were billeted and down dark echoing stairwells occasionally using external stairways under a clearcut swath of coldly glittering stars where the towering canyon walls met the sky in the courtyard they were challenged by a member of the prowlerguard who loomed out of the shadows his weapon at the ready krasin congratulated him and quietly told him were going out for a while until were back make sure your weapon is on safe you wouldnt want an itchy nervous trigger finger to slip and blow your superiors to hell now would you there was no humour in his remark and a sharp metallic click in the darkness signalled the prowlerguards immediate compliance another prowler was at the massive gates krasin spoke to him briefly and the three moved out into the pass it was eerily quiet so that even the whirring of a tiny bats wings sounded unnaturally loud before the creature sped away into the night then with their torchbeams sweeping the way ahead and following the scarcely recognizable trail along the screelittered canyon floor the three searchers gradually increased the distance between themselves and the keep and the keeps far greater store of firepower of course which was precisely what devetaki skullguise wanted and one hundred yards farther down the pass behind a leaning boulder where she oh so patiently waited that lady uncloaked her telepathic mind and there alexei yefros hissed the locator went into a half crouch and pointed with his torch whose beam dispersed with distance and fell short of lighting up devetakis hiding place by some fifteen to twenty yards as tzonov and krasins torchbeams joined in however the halfburied boulder stood out as a leaning irregular blot against the j greater dark a rock krasin grunted a place to hide tzonov corrected him and to yefros i heard it too alexei and you are right shes there they moved forward left the trail clambered towards the boulder as they went tzonov called out in a low voice siggi it is i turkur i heard your call and ive come for you dont be afraid but in the next moment the female who emerged from behind the boulder certainly wasnt afraid and she most definitely wasnt siggi dam j the sight the jolting shock of her abrupt appearance in the glare of their converging torchbeams stopped all three men dead in their tracks her face froze them its smile was awesome for the mistress of masquemanse was wearing her frowning halfmask and while the leaden side grimaced its counterpart grinned and both of her eyes in f the face and the socket of the halfmask alike were red as clots of blood and glowed with an internal an infernal fire krasin in no way a believer breathed jesus yefros as his jaw fell open gasped not siggi but turkur tzonov cocking his machinepistol said simply chokingly wamphyri devetaki was dressed in exoskeletalstyled battlegear all gleaming leather and sculpted flexible cartilage her gauntlet looked alive on her hand like a vicious spiny beast in its own right and with her long legs proud breasts and red hair flowing she looked every inch a warrior queen of ancient earth it was a disguise of course the product of that metamorphic art which allowed all of the wamphyri effortlessly to maintain a more or less human guise but when threatened or gearing for action that same metamorphism was changing her even now into the monstrous destroyer which she really was the great gape of her jaws and the flickering bifurcate tongue which they housed the quivering batlike convolutions of her flattened nose the hellfire heat of her burning gaze and the sickly mist pouring from her pores and called up writhing from the riven earth as if the pass itself were a tortured living creature then to add to the confusion of these three aliens in her world aware of the mentalism of one of them and the psychic prowess of another devetaki opened her own vampire mind all the way to hurl a gurgling phlegmy thought at them fools why i know what you would do even as you proceed to do it tzonov tested her anyway pulled the trigger of his machinepistol and sprayed the space where she had been or tried to spray it but his weapon was still on singleshot and fired off just one round and in the moment that he fired it devetaki had acted a flowing swirling dislocation of space that moved her like a wraith as if she floated to one side without physical effort back behind the boulder so that tzonovs lone bullet scarred the rock struck sparks from its flinty surface and did no harm at all while devetakis vampire mist swirled mockingly around his ankles then his knees then a vicious mechanical chching as krasin cocked his rifle and ran forward in a crouch to skirt the boulder and his harsh practised authoritative cry of flush the bitch out and yefross terrified stuttering squeal mmmother of god more of them as his talent came into play and located other minds where suddenly they sprang into sharp focus thus in a matter of minutes both tzonovs locator and his military commander had called on deities in whom they had no faith and who certainly would have none in them before krasin could get close to the boulder and attempt to flush the bitch out the psychic ether came leaping alive take them and tzonov scarcely needed eyetoeye contact now devetaki had deliberately fired her order for all to hear and especially turkur tzonov to further increase his confusion and you creature come take me up at which the darkness came alive too something huge and grey previously unnoticed disguised by the night and a backdrop of rubble and jagged canyon walls pushed itself upright on a nest of wormlike thrusters arched its wings stretched its neck and launched out and down from a sliding scree mound a great manta shape drifting on the night air angling for devetakis boulder tzonov would line up his sights on the thing but was distracted by yefross shrieking likewise by krasins curses and the deadly diatribe of his weapon and in any case devetakis flyer was only one thing where to fire first for best effect at the lady of course if only she were visible but in this clinging sickly mist in all this confusion in the flitting shadows of more nightmare flyers which even now soared overhead blotting out the stars and drawing krasins fire tzonov found his voice at last and in the temporary lull while krasin slapped a fresh magazine into his rifles housing shouted back to the keep his voice was hoarse even terrified but the virgin grandams was fearless full of a monstrous anticipation as she told him ah no my pretty briefly so swift and sure in her movements that tzonov barely had time to swing the muzzle of his weapon in her direction devetaki emerged again from hiding sprang skywards and grasped the trailing trappings of her beasts harness it bore her away laughing into the mist and the darkness now tzonovs frantic gasping and cursing joined krasins and both were almost drowned out by yefross womans shrieks as the night and more than the night pressed down on them and the air of the pass seemed full of swooping motion no it was full of motion no longer mere shadows a pair of manta flyers came speeding along the bed of the pass one out of the south the other from the north eager figures leaned forward in their saddles feral eyes gleamed yellow and ivory teeth dripped saliva into redribbed caverns of horror yefros had made his way back to the trail arms and legs frantically pumping the terrified locator was heading for the sanctuary of the keep whose eyesocket windows and cliffhewn balconies were lit up now in the yellowflaring light of hastily fired torches viewed through devetakis mist however the flickering golden fireflies seemed far away indeed and much too far for alexei yefros one of devetakis lieutenants flyers had veered from tzonovs view into the deep shadows of the rearing east wall the other coming through the tunnel of the pass from the north was rapidly losing altitude stalling arching its membranous wings as it settled towards the running figure of yefros like the grasping limbs of some unthinkably huge carnivorous insect or the feelers of a hideous sentient anemone a nest of wormlike thrusters was uncoiling from a belly cavity palps quivering where they reached out after the unsuspecting locator but as mount and rider went drifting by fully intent upon their prey so they presented tzonov with a target he couldnt miss falling to one knee he took careful aim at the leatherclad back and side of the figure in the saddle and just a moment too late sensed rather than saw his own doom almost upon him it came swooping from the shadows in the overhang of the canyon wall the flyer hed lost sight of and where its tapering neck joined a corrugated underbelly a vast scoop lined with cartilage hooks was yawning open to receive him tzonov straightened up swung his machinepistol to face the threat squeezed the trigger with a rrrip of gunfire hot lead was hurled into the gaping bellypouch but tzonov might as well be firing at a jellyfish he dropped his weapon turned to run and felt the shadow of the flyer falling on him like a tangible weight as its head and long neck passed overhead in the next moment the jutting drooling lip of its pouch smacked into the back of his thighs between knees and buttocks and he was folded and scooped up as easily as that before clammy alien flesh closed on him tzonov had time for a single hoarse meaningless cry of protest and the last thing he saw as the cartilagebarbed clamp of the pouch meshed shut was the spastically kicking figure of yefros snatched up and jerked aloft his head and right arm lost in a writhing of greedy triumphant claspers soldiers came running the searchlight beams of their torches cutting swaths of white light through the thinning mist bruno krasin heard their shouts and squeezed himself out from a clump of boulders where hed taken shelter dusting himself down he made stumblingly for the ancient trail came face to face with one of his corporals sergeant the corporal glanced nervously all about and his party took up defensive perimeter positions but krasin had seen everything that had happened and knew it was much too late for that sort of thing too late for tzonov and yefros anyway sergeant the corporal said again what about comrade tzonov and that thin fellow yefros krasin realized how shaken he must look he got a grip of himself stood up straighter and asked did you see anything of it anything of them them krasin nodded then you didnt see anything perhaps it was for the best he desired to command men not leaning towers of jelly what happened the corporal asked as they set off back along the trail krasin paused bent to pick up yefross pistol from where the locator had dropped it called back to the men in the rear somewhere in those rocks theres a machinepistol if you can see it bring it in if not forget it it will keep till morning and to the corporal as for comrades tzonov and yefros i dont think youll be seeing them again and he strode out for the keep but in the next moment he paused again halfturned and gripped the corporals arm drawing him close if you should see them however you have my permission no my orders to shoot on sight for you see it wont be them it might look like them but believe me it wont be and there was a deep deep shudder in krasins voice that the corporal had never heard before back in the keep krasin fortified himself with several mugs of good american coffee then held an ogroup with his four ncos tzonov and yefros are gone he told them taken by the creatures of this world from now on thats how you will think of this place as an alien world whose people can snatch you up just like they snatched them except thats not how its going to be and we wont be caught out again but those two were talented their minds were different from ours i believe its what let them down and lured them into an ambush well were talented too at living in the field and off the land but especially at staying alive now youve all been briefed you know that this is a vampire world you would have been sent here anyway eventually with or without turkur tzonov and i would have been with you your beloved sergeant krasin mother and father both to look after you yes and i know what my children need now listen the vampires of this world live on starside thats north to you that barren place where we left the gate they live there and cant abide the sun which kills them so south is where we are headed but if you ever want to get to sunside if you ever want to see its rivers forests and game and chase its wild gypsy women first youve got to live through one hell of a long night of which there are at least two days still to go very well at first light we move out for as ive said the sun will keep them at bay but between times we have to be extra careful for every man who sleeps i want one awake on the lookout and i dont want anyone on his own drink all the coffee you like but when youre on duty stay awake and alert they know were here now and after talking to tzonov and that snivelling yefros well theyll probably know all about us too but theyll also know about our weapons now i saw tzonov fire pointblank at a flying beast and i myself fired this weapon of mine into the bellies of several but we didnt nearly stop them not with a machinepistol no nor even with a rifle but im betting a grenadelauncher would stop just about anything theyve got and heres something else to keep in mind i fancy that while their flyers are just huge dumb animals their riders are or were men if you knock them out of their saddles its possible their mounts will run as wild as riderless horses okay thats about it maybe theyll come back and maybe they wont but if they do i want to meet them with force let them know what theyre up against they have their own special brand of hell these bastards but they havent seen ours yet not by a longshot finally he paused any questions a lancecorporal took something from a pocket handed it over feel the weight he said it was buried in the dust and dirt of my billet i found it under my sleepingbag the thing was a bracelet an inch wide eighth of an inch thick and it was solid gold yes that too krasin nodded gold is a common metal on sunside its one of the reasons we were coming here before we were forced to come here and its another reason to go on living we wont be marooned here it wont be long before others follow us through or until we can return through the underground gate after all it was tzonov who was on the run while we were only following orders if we go home carrying our own weight in this stuff you can stop worrying about being traitors well all be heroes he looked from face to face anything else but there was nothing okay lets get the heavy stuff set up two machineguns a rocketlauncher flamers too i want weapons on all the balconies and nitesites on that ribbon of sky overhead throughout lets turn this place into a real fucking fortress and to himself well have to if we want to see it through until the morning for krasin knew hed never be able to forget the smile on the females face how her flesh had flowed and changed as shed stepped into view from behind that boulder and she was only one of their women only only a woman do you say well a woman ill grant you but only hah wamphyri my alien friend wamphyri but she liked krasin for all that and considered him a man aye and he would have made a fine lieutenant too and perhaps still would but two out of three wasnt bad not for starters anyway v a lady schemes devetaki vormulac and zindevar arrived back in the lava flow heights within half an hour of one another and eventually came together in a vast horizontal shaft of a cavern which was once the extinct volcanos blowhole or safetyvalve now the warriorlords temporary headquarters lord unsleep and the lady zindevar seemed well pleased with themselves the fires observed on sunside had indeed proved to be the permanent camps of supplicant or fief szgany the tithe they had paid this time had been in blood we took half vormulac dolefully detailed the outcome of his and zindevars joint venture half of everything that is including the people they were docile enough if a little surprised wratha and her lot werent due for three sundowns yet but their szgany supplicants thought wed come out of the last aerie or wrathstack as that fang out there on the plain of boulders is known on some special collecting round by the time theyd got it worked out that we werent a bunch of lieutenants out on a spree and that in fact they couldnt say who we were it was too late even so there was little or no resistance wratha canker gorvi and the killglance brothers seem to have them well trained there was no word of vasagi though so it seems the sucks gone the way of all flesh but there is a new lord among them a fellow called lichloathe lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri a necromancer apparently zindevar took up the story doubtless youve observed the constant stream of flyers lieutenants and thralls were sending down well theyll all get their fill we stunned as many of the szgany as were required about half of them as vormulac stated but mainly the old the unskilled the barren and the burdensome and sent the rest into the woods while we took our fill drained carcasses are being brought back for the warriors though not enough to fuel them through another complete cycle i fear vormulac nodded but we got your message concerning the injured creature on the boulder plains excellent when youve rested awhile and taken a little sustenance id be obliged if youd guide our beastminders and their starveling warriors to the very spot this way the entire army will be fully fuelled for the fighting that lies ahead at which devetaki cocked her head knowingly on one side and inquired there is to be fighting then oh really so is it that im only hearing the good news and what about the bad i saw no sign of laughing zack shornskull as i flew in what of him and his i seem to recall him boasting that his contingent alone would have wratha the risens measure can something have happened to change his mind do you think did wrathas measure exceed his calculations she was all innocence vormulac scowled down the hook of his nose it strikes me youve heard all about it am i right lady well the man was a braggart and a fool but at least he was our fool his loss is sufficient a blow without all this sniping and sniding he was our fool devetaki repeated vormulacs words inquiringly despite that she already knew his joss did you say so everything ive heard is true laughing zack will laugh no more and his troops vormulac sighed a thrall made it back and zindevar put in upon a flyer devetakis scowling mask was entirely in keeping with her mood as she glanced disdainfully at zindevar she not only considered the other lady her social inferior but also a social climber who liked to have her nose and indeed her say in just about everything to the point where in order to be heard she would deliberately introduce trivia into otherwise serious conversations and in an untypically scathing tone the virgin grandam repeated her upon a flyer zindevar really well i scarcely supposed hed walked and ignoring the others spluttering she turned back to vormulac whats the word the warriorlord made no bones of it if were to believe our sole survivor wrathstacks a veritable fortress the aerie houses all of them and they fight as one their creatures are lean mean experienced and fightingfit they swarm like hornets to repel their enemies shornskulls losses were what total and wrathas were nil in short it was a shambles devetaki nodded aye yet i find myself in disagreement with you if only on one point it wasnt a total loss we did get something out of it knowledge we know theyre definitely there also but here she paused to glance sideways at zindevar reading that glance lord unsleep saw that devetaki had something to say but not in front of the glowering cronesap also i think youre looking tired whats more your weariness makes you just a little disagreeable devetaki but the lady zindevar here is wellfed and her men provisioned wherefore i suggest that she goes to seek out the injured wrathstack creature and leads our hungry warriors to their supper also i suggest she does it now zindevar had missed none of the interplay still stinging from devetakis sarcasm she drew apart and hissed hah and do you have favourites my lord no he hissed back but it appears i have generals who spit and snarl at each other when theyd do well to save their venom for our enemies i would hear the rest of what devetaki has to say she snapped and i would have you feed my hungry warriors he puffed himself up and id have you do it now unless you would prefer that i personally feed them perhaps on your lads out of cronespire what lads did i hear myself say no eunuchs most of the poor bastards and how are we to suppose they will fare in the fighting eh why i couldnt put them up against women let alone men his words rang true in whichever sense zindevar was furious she couldnt speak she stormed out from the mouth of the blowhole and began screaming harshly for her lieutenants and beastminders to attend her gesticulating and shouting she disappeared from view devetaki couldnt help but snigger and even vormulac must turn away or break into a smile but finally he controlled himself and said now out with it lady whats on your mind wrathas fortress could well end up her mausoleum devetaki was down to business at once consider the place stands several miles what nine ten out on the barren boulder plains clearly visible for miles around set watchers and why she couldnt even send out a bat without wed see it true vormulac frowned but by the same token we cant get near without she sees us she has the elevation devetaki held up a finger but i fancy weve taken her by surprise our coming at this time i mean her szgany supplicants didnt even know who you were so they werent prepared and i think that shes the same it would be my guess that the ladys had no easy time of it keeping her renegades from each others throats and that theyve only recently joined forces in the fullest sense vormulac was mystified but is that a good or bad thing and if they were not unified before but are now what difference does it make as individual lords they would have built up their individual forces and wrathstack is a vast place i have our lone survivors assurance that it could house all of us and ours for all we know it could be filled with men and beasts from top to toe just waiting to pick us off devetaki put on her smiling mask just waiting aye she said mysteriously eh now tell me this who can afford to wait the longest to wait the and quietly devetaki inquired is she not in siege what his great jaw fell open where is her sustenance where are her provisions why in wrathstack no the virgin grandam shook her head then changed her mind and nodded her immediate provisions aye but later in sunside thats where and how will she supply and resupply her creatures if her army is huge shell need to feed it and well be in the way waiting for her except well be wellfuelled and i say it again if her army is vast devetaki shrugged then i fancy we wont have long to wait how so wrathas no fool she knows the lie of the land we dont by now shell probably know our strength we dont as yet know hers she has all sunside mapped knows its forests and favourite hunting grounds we havent and dont not yet she has all the long long night ahead forty hours and more to go before she indeed we must take to the shade at which vormulac got in but so do we have that she is settled and we are not and where will you puyt your army when the sun comes up devetakis logic was devastating shed always been good at word games at tactics as vormulac now saw he grunted and scratched his beard upon a time i had a wife he said i lost her to a vile disease well enough of love now for all that im a follower of turgo zolte i have my lust from time to time you understand but i tell you devetaki skullguise that if ever i wanted a woman for wife which i dont it would be you because im clever for one thing but also because youre already wamphyri he growled and would not be obliged to ascend over my dead body but aye youre a clever one instead of explaining the meaning of the things youve been saying and telling me what i should do youre waiting for me to beg it out of you she smiled and her mask and face alike matched up its just that i like to feel appreciated she said and more seriously were not much good at this are we eh at what he walked her out into the night and they stood at the rim of the lava flow like a series of waterfalls frozen to a standstill on their way to the boulder plains this warring vormulac looked at her in the light of the stars because weve forgotten how he said as gloomy as ever these thousands of years weve followed the ways of turgo because we had to unlike these vast western territories which were now opening up our place in turgosheim and our own sunside were small concerns if wed destroyed all of the szgany to fuel our wars in the end wed have eaten each other the end of the wamphyri aye so we suppressed our vampire leeches as best we could and grew weak weak in the ways of blood the ways of war the natural ways of the great vampire she nodded between you and me then youre saying that wratha was right to flee turgosheim again his solemn glance between you and me devetaki the szgany of our sunside are grown vile their blood is bad we took all the fight out of them and all the goodness too a long time ago in turgos time we lived on the blood of men men like turgo himself who fought back but now in turgosheim weve become as fleas on a dogs back except the dog is mangy the blood is the life but if its bad blood and now devetaki grasped his arm and her slender fingers were urgent where they bit into his grey flesh is it too late or can we reverse it if we win this war conquer wratha and this new sunsidestarside can we stop the rot his glance was more penetrating now the rot do you feel it too then i thought that i was the only one i thought it was just me gloomy old vormulac unsleep she shuddered ah no my lord for i too have felt it and for years and ive seen it the way in manifests the autisms animalisms mutations and madness in short the decline of the wamphyri did you know i liked wratha upon a time why i believe i still do because shes clean in a way that most of us can never be clean spirited and original whats more i envy her what shes had here and what we must put an end to for the rots in her too or if not in wratha the risen certainly in her renegades the doglord canker canison for instance more animal than man and as for the killglance brothers why even their fathers terrible eye was a weapon and and vormulac cut in wrathas supplicant szgany have it that spiro is now heir to old eygors killing eye devetaki shrugged can we be surprised and what of vasagi the suck with his rampant acromegaly his amazing miming telepathy metamorphism im glad that he has gone and not simply because hes my enemy what why were all our own worst enemies and dangerous ones at that but not as dangerous as these ive mentioned vormulac nodded and said our own worst enemies aye we always have been its nothing new isnt it what zolteism was all about to deny our leeches and be men but we cant be men because we are wamphyri old maglore had it right i remember he once told me were not true masters but slaves to our parasites in turgosheim only a blind man or a fool would ask why beings who could live as long as the wamphyri usually live so short such is our nature however and jealousy hatred and lust and blood of course our way of life just for a moment lord unsleep had looked worn out now straightening up he said but maglore must be something of a fatalist too for i remember he also told me and i think i agree with him so be it perhaps it is as well to leave it at that well and perhaps it is devetaki shook her head i think not better if we weed it out once and for all then start afresh here in these clean western territories or perhaps in another pjace far away where the vampires taint is scarcely known and the blood of men and beasts alike is sweet and clean which was a thought that she kept to herself of course weed it out he looked at her as if to gauge her meaning how when where here in all the battles to come whenever the opportunity arises the virgin grandam answered drawing him aside away from his army where its various contingents were camped and in an undertone my lord vormulac the rot is in us too now believe me that this is nothing personal but the lady zindevar is a corruption in herself as is any creature who goes against nature to that extent eh i cant see that there have always been women who are drawn to women aye but it scarcely leads to strong men and remember shes no underling but a leader are you sure this isnt your leech speaking devetaki is it that you envy zindevar something or other her manse in turgosheim perhaps do i envy zindevar you think i might envy cronespire when i have masquemanse devetaki shook her head but let me go on let me try to convince you of this this creeping disease that has come among us crippling us more all the time and after a moment look at wamus hes brought his bloodsons with him and both of them the same as their father more bat than man why theyre outside of nature vormulac even the nature of the wamphyri and what of lom the stunted whose knuckles drag on the floor or grigor hakson and black boris whose lechery but again vormulac stopped her saying now hold for surely theres lechery in every man like theirs if something so much as looks like a cunt grigor is into it and boris shags with trogs a rival for the doglord that one nor are they alone in their vices and we talk of ascending to a lord or a lady what ascension but surely its a foul descent to disease deformity and madness but we you and i my lord were never that way and there are others among us who are likewise clean they should be spared spared obviously she must speak it out loud or in a whisper at least send out the freaks into battle send them out first so that they may take the brunt of it when its over those who survive will have been weakened that will be the time to strike to do your weeding to cut out the rot exactly and well start again repopulate turgosheim with our own and develop these new territories as best they should be but always with a tight rein on population and a sharp eye out for freaks and degenerates but turgosheim will remain our seat why not the centre of empire certainly to which well return from time to time for the worship of our people vormulac felt himself carried away with the idea i see it clearly the grand triumvirate controlling all from their seat in the gorge of turgosheim eh devetakis turn to exclaim to question triumvirate but can you possibly mean maglore but hasnt the seerlord always been one of us doesnt he even now keep the gorge for us and see to its servicing in our absence isnt he our oldest friend devetaki put on her frowning mask and darkly and quietly she said i have often wondered about maglore for where some go too far he goes too short long on lore and runes and magic short on guts drive and vision where is he now but in turgosheim tending the hearth like some szgany slut while we wage war so i would counsel you thus keep maglore the mage for a friend if you like or better by far keep him as your spy for certainly as a seer and mentalist he has no peer but as a leader with powers that is hardly fitting no this is how i see it lord vormulac unsleep shall be the emperor the virgin grandam devetaki his adviser and the seerlord maglore his shewstone for scrying on his lands and possessions afar to keep them safe we can surely value maglore without that we elevate him to a position of power for after all were wamphyri and devetaki gave what she hoped sounded like a lighthearted laugh the two of us watching each other should be quite sufficient without that we must watch him also vormulac wasnt sure he frowned and tugged on maglores twisted loop sigil where it dangled from the lobe of his ear that golden symbol of the seerlords mysticism given to him by maglore for good luck but devetaki was usually right and so let me think on it lord unsleep growled meanwhile we have other things to talk about and while we talk lets walk together among my generals and so inspire them with our presence devetaki maglore spat out her name as if it were essence of kneblasch socalled virgin grandam socalled lady treacherous scheming backstabbing whore spawn of a leprous spore may your blood turn to acid and scorch your leech to a cinder his own blood was up he stamped shook a fist cupped a talonlike hand under the rim of his mobius sigil shewstone to sweep it from its onyxstemmed table the table itself went toppling so that maglore must reach and out to save it before it struck the floor and shattered and the gleaming strangely twisted mass of his sigil thudded heavily down on to a pile of parchments and skins and lay there all unrepentant maglore was alone in his room of meditation which was just as well if karpath or another lieutenant or thrall had been there certainly the unlucky one would have suffered some small harm and perhaps even a large one for even as the seerlord reached out to save his table still the scarlet lamps of his eyes were glaring all about for some lesser thing on which to vent his fury and they spied just such a thing within easy reach at that his marvellously detailed clay model of turgosheim complete with all its spires and manses including vormulac taintspores melancholy vormspire and devetakis masquemanse of course and striding to the workbench where the model reposed maglore issued a curse through teeth like a tightmeshed mantrap to snarl a plague on your house devetaki and more than a plague a fist with which the seerlord brought his clenched hand smashing down so that masquemanse was stripped from the rim of the gorge and crushed down into the meticulously moulded clay of its bottoms the clay had desiccated somewhat the turrets and towers fell apart the bulk of the flattened manse did not compress but flew in chunks if this were the real turgosheim it could only be that a meteorite had struck home with shattering force to strew bits of masquemanse across half the gorge maglore felt something of the sympathetic magic of his act and rushed from his room of meditation and through the corridors of the vast promontory turret which was runemanse until he could gaze from a window on all the starsilvered bight of the gorge he gazed at masquemanse of course intact despite the destruction of its simulacrum which served to promote a further bout of cursing and fistshaking eventually exhausted by his emotions and determined upon a far more substantial revenge maglore called for his man karpath only just returned to runemanse from certain duties in the shadowy bed of the gorge by the time his lieutenant reported the seerlord had regained control of himself though he still raged inside yes lord the hulking karpath stood before him how goes the work maglore wasted no time as you ordered lord we work from the bottoms up lorn halfstrucks trollmanse fell at once the dwarf had left only one lieutenant in charge who we discovered spent from a surfeit of loms women his plasma was not wamphyri it churns now in a vat along with most of what we found of lord halfstrucks thralls pregnant women were dealt with to insure that nothing of lorn survives and also to fuel your own creatures wherefore it only remains for you to imprint the stuff in the trollmanse vats and eventually youll have warriors to send out far and wide across turgosheims bottoms good and the lesser hovels mordslump zackstack wensknoll and the rest i hope that in all of your rendering down youve not forgotten to do a little recruiting karpath shook his great head we have forgotten nothing lord youll discover all the recruits you need herded together in the base of madmanse the best of the stuff out of the lesser houses with their lords flown they were as easily gathered up as fatherless children only descend take what you will and give back of yourself your thralls shall teem maglore allowed himself a mirthless chuckle it seems i could easily exhaust myself imprinting all of this good stuff into the faith into my faith that is why i must be sure not to give more than i take lest i swoon from my depletion very well then let the work continue except yes lord maglore took him to the window look there karpath followed the line of the others pointing finger masquemanse the same see to that next and then return to your work down below you want to invade devetakis place and i want to destroy devetakis place maglore grabbed him by the shoulder his long nails digging in i want to sack it utterly break off its balconies knock out its windows into the gorge topple its chimneys and leave promontory masquemanse a veritable ruin uninhabited and uninhabitable and all of her thralls and creatures reduced to monsters shambling in the bottoms and guarding the passes and her entire house a burnedout shell where the dust gathers in drifts and the winds mourn but only the winds for i most certainly shall not indeed and from now on ill not hear her name mentioned neither hers nor vormulac unsleeps such was his vehemence that karapth was taken aback it shall be done of course lord maglore but as youre surely aware devetaki i mean she left a strong body of men and monsters guarding the place and masquemanse is heavily fortified moreover her wells are in the bottoms maglore waved his protests aside poison them kill off her siphoneers then when her people are sick attack from the rim of the gorge take up my young hungry warriors on to the rim even as i wean them from their vats and break through the roof of masquemanse into its heart by then our flyers recruited from the other spires and manses will be too many to count we shall strike masquemense full in the face driving in through every landingbay and window so the night shall be spent and all resistance crumbling away as our aerial assault on the face of the manse continues then as our men penetrate deeper and press on up through the manses levels finally well withdraw our forces on the rim the last of the bitchs thralls shall think to escape by that route up on to the roof only to discover that the sun has risen barring their way with golden fire theyll melt said karpath shuddering too true said maglore with a curt nod theyll melt aye and all of the ladys dreams of empire with them so be it and so it would be but a long night to go before then vormulacs army was sprawled all down the ancient lava river where the rock formed folds like frozen falls behind the petrified spume and agesstilled columnar gush shallow caves and weatheredout pockets gave shelter and cold comfort to men and beasts alike the various contingents kept to themselves men hurried here and there pursuing the orders of their lords or ladies an orderly stream of flyers continued to launch or land whichever was the case on their way to or returning from the banquet of blood on sunside the bellypouches of returning flyers invariably disgorged corpses which were dragged away to makeshift warrior pens the flyers had been fed on sunside greenstuff and honey laidup for wratha and commandeered by vormulac and zindevars forces more sparingly on unappetizing lights and giblets human flesh naturally thus all creatures manlike or otherwise manshaped or monstrous had been or were in the process of being fuelled as best possible in the circumstances and apart from the loss of lord shornskulls reconnaissance party all seemed to be going reasonably well silent for a while the warriorlord and the virgin grandam walked together and approached the latters contingent where devetaki had made camp in the lee of a small crumbling secondary cone there she called for one of her lieutenants to attend her and as he approached and bowed said to him the lady zindevar prepares to launch then back to her man go with the lady and guide her with all speed to the injured creature which we spied on the plain of boulders and when shes safely there return at once yes lady her man nodded and went to mount a flyer whats this cooperation and concern vormulac raised an inquiring eyebrow what for zindevar cronesap in her current rage she might overshoot and fly across the rim of the world devetaki answered sourly not that i would care a bit but your warriors and mine would go hungry vormulac grinned in his fashion but said oh well zindevar has her uses did i tell you her familiar bats returned most of them not all of them devetaki looked away for a moment and called loudly after her lieutenant be sure and take a beastminder with you and our warriors also ensure that a chain is established so that all of lord unsleeps creatures follow on in turn now vormulac saw the point of devetakis shouting which were the tasks i gave to zindevar right but you are so sweet on her devetaki looked up at him you ignore that she ignores your orders it was true zindevars fury had overridden common sense some two hundred yards down the lava slope she was just this moment airborne her own warriors were spurting aloft in her wake but not a one of the other contingents fighting beasts thus she ignored lord vormulacs orders apparently or had forgotten them in the grip of her fury vormulac sighed very well but you must let me handle affairs such as this in my own way yes your suggestion with regard to the freakish and aberrant including a certain lady is a good one but i am in command here only let it be noticed that you have more than your share of influence theyll all be jealous even the men no less than zindevar devetaki put on her smiling mask but a moment later was businesslike again what of her bats vormulac shrugged it appears that some went missing the virgin grandam nodded a voracious place apparently where lords and men and beasts alike and even small familiar creatures go out only to be eaten up by wratha or whatever yet some of us do venture forth fulfil our duties and return not alone with news or bounty in the shape of crippled enemy warriors but also with jiving tribute vormulac looked at her more closely where she led the way through a weathered crumbling section of the secondary cones wall into a shallow caldera are you saying you took recruits well excellent but why didnt you mention it before because zindevar was there i trust her as far as i could throw her and confide in her to that same extent yes i found men in the great pass to sunside and took recruits which i now claim for my own it is my right for as my lord will doubtless recall i fuelled his starveling army on a creature of mine out over the great red waste by reason of which my forces are reduced or were let this serve to even up the score behold watched over by a senior thrall turkur tzonov and alexei yefros lay huddled in the shadow of the wall the latters eyes were closed head lolling tzonov on the other hand was wideawake alert staring all about giving a great start as the lord and lady came into view he stood up bowed his head and kept it low stared at the ground under their feet subservient vormulac approved not a bit of it devetaki touched tzonov under the chin drawing up his head clever more like the warriorlord stared and tzonov looked up and back eyetoeye directing her thoughts closely devetaki was into the russians mind in a moment it wouid not serve my purpose if this great lord were to learn that youre a mentalist nor would it serve yours to have those knowing eyes put out tzonov lowered his gaze at once clever vormulac repeated how so just a suspicion devetaki told him then changing the subject but dont you see anything strange i see a great deal thats strange these men are neither trogs nor szgany also in my youth on sunside ah but that was a long time ago i once saw a dead desert nomad and so i know that theyre not thyre either so what are they ive no idea devetaki lied pretending ignorance but this is a strange region which appears to be inhabited by even stranger races she shrugged til find out all about them eventually vormulac looked tzonov up and down his penetrating grey eyes his silverblond eyebrows and tanned healthy flesh the broad bronze dome of his head hinting at a formidable intelligence his sharplyhooked nose as stern if not as long as vormulacs own lending him a hawkish appearance his small pointed ears lying flat to his head and the tooperfect symmetry of his face as a whole whose left and right halves were alike as mirror images and his build athletic powerfully muscled oiled to a perfect flexibility yet tight as a coiled spring a handsome specimen this one if there were tribes such as this on sunside then theyd really be worth fighting over and vormulac could readily understand devetakis determination to keep him hed make a lieutenant and a half possibly a decent plaything too after hed put on some weight height and the cold grey cloak of undeath as for his companion casually the warriorlord put tzonov aside causing him to stumble a little and stooping he took the unconscious yefros by the lapels of his jacket jerking him up off the ground and holding him aloft legs dangling where he could glare directly into his crumpledseeming face but there was no comparison here why the two were dissimilar as wolf and weasel or master and servant and where tzonov seemed intact as yet entirely human vormulac could scarcely help but notice a pair of familiar punctures purple gashes in the lesser mans neck devetaki had converted this one at least plainly he slept the sleep of change as yefros began to choke in vormulacs grip the warriorlord lowered his arm let him crumple to the earth tzonov was quick to catch the locator and let him down more gently after all they were in this together and up to their necks in it at that vormulac turned to devetaki these suits they wear tough stuff not as coarse as szgany weave yet stronger far again her shrug all kinds of benefits seem likely aye i notice youve not yet converted this one he glanced at tzonov who continued to avert his eyes judiciously not alone in deference to vormulacs stature but also because devetaki watched like a hawk easy to do but impossible to reverse was her response i want him freethinking for a little while at least for as youre aware as a thrall hell say what i want him to say do as i direct not always the case vormulac grunted he looks like a strong one to me but i concede your point you desire that he retains his individuality in order that you may better understand his mind before i make it mine aye to see as he or as his kind sees may be of benefit and then because eventually she might be obliged to reveal the truth also i think its entirely possible that theyre talented these two theres something of an aura about them and while conversion to vampirism has been known to amplify certain talents it has the effect of suppressing others for far too long the wamphyri have destroyed what may not be recreated er but this surely was one of several conclusions arrived at during the course of our recent conversation my lord vormulac scratched his head was it why yes i believe it was he seemed satisfied very well i leave it in your capable hands devetaki do as you will and discover what you can but one thing i can tell you now she said quickly as he turned away oh their weapons are devastating really and yet you returned unharmed my superior mentalism entering their minds i saw what was in store for me and mine avoiding it i survived and took prisoners to boot all of which was the truth and leading him out of the crater devetaki glanced back once over her shoulder at turkur tzonov her scarlet eyes telling him never fear for i shall be back my pretty and then well talk some more and they were in a pass leading to sunside but how many of them oh a dozen more at least and armed to the teeth what with stakes of wood knives spears crossbows devetaki shook her head ah no their weapons are astonishing i cant describe them best if you yourself were to see them in action i should go up against them oh if only it could be arranged and it could have been if id had more time to think it out but no for if by chance you had survived the virgin grandams mind was shielded as never before like an ironwood kernel in its shell as she answered ah no not you my lord as commanderinchief you would only attend as an observer but lord wamus perhaps they stood alone on the lava slopes he looked at her and smiled but grimly i see youre thinking we should send out the freaks into battle to test the way ahead devetakis smiling mask was well in keeping as she slowly nodded her head and gazed unflinchingly back at him and vormulac thought she even looked beautiful in the starlight or he might have except he knew what lay beneath the goldfiligreed lead the leering hideousness of flensed bone the naked truth under the lie of the ladys mask but even he did not know all of the truth and therefore none of the lie and despite that he felt a sudden warning chill as if a cold wind had blown on his spine vormulac thought to himself well and what does it matter that shes disfigured for after all beauty is only skin deep in all of us and picturing zindevar and wamus and others who were even less lovely he concluded aye and a good deal shallower in some which only served to show the warriorlords own shallow nature that his wamphyri awareness was so easily confused by the virgin grandams treacherous logic and for once in her life and undeath the virgin grandam was glad of her disfigurement and mask both lest the scarcely concealed selfsatisfied writhing of her mouth become obvious in the iceblue glittering starlight vi devetaki her schemes coalesce nathan after the battle at the rock all of the wamphyri were territorial all of them were greedy scheming and intent upon their own survival with their metamorphism their metaphysical powers magnified emotions vastly inflated egos and vampire tenacity with all of these driving forces which were theirs by virtue of their parasite leeches they understood that success meant power meant survival wherefore infinite success might well mean immortality but even in common men power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and in the wamphyri like all megalomaniacs they only perceived the corruption the evil the perversions of others or should an individual glimpse an aberration in himself his preference would be to blame it upon or assign it to his leech depending on the circumstances thus while acknowledging the dubious benefits of their parasites still they decried their insatiable appetites or vices contrarily and while a victorious lord would revel in his triumph in the event of defeat he would just as readily heap curses upon his thinblooded vampire devetaki skullguise the virgin grandam of masquemanse was no different in turgosheim it had made sense to live an ordered life to exist as governed by the tithe system by no means an austere existence it had scarcely been an opulent one nevertheless zolteism had suited devetaki the creed made clear how each should live commensurate with his or her needs thus the requirements of her house the provisioning of masquemanse had been guaranteed the ladys gauntly jutting promontory of an aerie was by no means a hovel her fair share of the sunside tithe had been considerable while very occasionally her men and creatures might find it necessary to scratch and scrape their mistress had never gone without on the other hand the lesser knolls and crevices of recently ascended vampires and the middling manses of young upandcoming wamphyri lords and ladies commanded a much reduced get out of sunside and frequently were shabby even impoverished thus turgosheims secret triumvirate had established and kept a rein on the gorge and its inhabitants and upon themselves when one has only sufficient for himself and his immediate household all instinctive or leechinspired notions of feuding territorial expansion and empirebuilding become academic finally they assume the status of fantasies plots are still plotted but they are rarely acted out of course in a society whose continuity is based on principles of conservation the rules must be seen to be obeyed by everyone lord vormulac and maglore the mage too were known to be fairly strict adherents to zolteism ascetics so devetaki and everyone else had believed even as her partners in the triumvirate had believed it of each other and of devetaki herself turgosheim was yesterday however and this was here and now and this was freedom or it could be if she and her leech played it right what devetaki had disclosed to vormulac was true she envied wratha and her renegades what theyd had here and what they could have had eventually without turgosheims intervention but what she had necessarily failed to disclose was far more to the point that if she herself could have it for herself then she wouldnt for a moment hesitate even now the thought made her shudder deliciously to be empress of these vast and sprawling territories and all that went with them and perhaps other places much further afield moreover it wasnt impossible that shed come across the key to unlock just such airy ambitions in the shape of turkur tzonov precisely how she would turn that key in what ingenious lock was hard to say just yet but it was in her hand be sure and vormulac taintspore himself approved of it there vormulac currently and however unknowingly he was devetakis tool but a heavy one and unwieldy if she should slip and miss her stroke hed prove a sharp one too despite that he had gone along with her so far still she must be wary her time would come when shed used him to whittle the others down removing all who might possibly have her measure laughing zack shornskull might have been one such but circumstances had seen to him without her help with any luck wamus would be next and as for zindevar she simply must go and straight to hell if at all possible after that any and all of the other lords would consider themselves superior over a mere woman but by then hopefully the bloodwar would have worn their forces down a little the aspirations of black boris went little further than a harem of trog mistresses and grigor the lech had similar weaknesses devetaki was sure that if she struck while they were whoring it up she could take them out with a minimum of trouble eventually of course even vormulac would see the lie of the land how the virgin grandam gathered survivors of defunct contingents to her own to reinforce it and how she had begun to draw apart from him this would probably split the army out of turgosheim into two uneasy camps both of them obliged to remain united and concentrate their efforts against wratha their main priority at least until wrathstack had fallen by which time the warriorlord would have decided how best to deal with devetaki and she would know how best to use the bonus talents of turkur tzonov these were some of the ladys thoughts as the pair approached the camp of wamus behind a timetattered curtain of white volcanic pumice the fragile spume of the lava rivers ancient falls and just as devetaki became aware that shed been lost in thought for too long you are quiet lady rumbled vormulac as if reading her mind which mercifully he wasnt quiet and thoughtful ive seldom found it easy to fathom you so tell me what is it that youre pondering i was thinking she answered at once how best how best to advise you in respect of wrathas containment is she contained not yet and thats the problem then have you thought it out possibly but in a moment if wamus should survive the coming battle at the keep in the pass then well let him hold it for remember as things stand now wratha may yet venture out unseen from wrathstack in its lower levels below our horizon and keeping her head low speed for the pass with wamus or his survivors in the keep well be able to deny her passage into sunside via that route at least that will leave only eastern and western routes open which well also block naturally even now we stand in the way of her easterly excursions obviously she frequently heads in this direction to collect the tithe from her supplicants across the mountains so if we station a sufficiency of men and warriors here this will be the second supply route weve obstructed and possibly wrathas main route at that as for the as yet unseen unknown regions in the west beyond the great pass and the strange cold glaring light of that that what a fallen star is that what it is do you think she shook her head sending her red hair flying and lying said i dont know what it is but as for the west that is for you and i to explore vormulac exclaimed with some animation together i think devetaki shrugged why not after all we are the best of companions and when weve taken the high ground namely these barrier mountains from east to west and if we locate observer units out on the plain of boulders consisting of our fleetest flyers and lieutenants in tune with their lords receptive minds why wrathas every twitch will be relayed to us thus well have her covered from all points only two things she can do after that vormulac nodded or possibly three if we include a slow and highly improbable suicide by starvation shell attempt to break the siege fly into sunside and glut her starveling lads in some lush land of plenty or shell consume wrathstacks provisions in one last massive fuelling and hurl herself into battle the latter if i know wratha devetaki nodded thats precisely what i meant when i guessed we wouldnt have long to wait before this war got well and truly underway shes wratha the risen remember and shes wrathful as ever be sure she wont lie low for long but if i may ignore your creeping starvation solution which im sure she would not contemplate there is a third possibility and real however improbable oh that shell sit tight in the stack till the last minute then gut the rest of them to fuel her own and finally make a break for it shell run for it but where again devetakis shrug turgosheim what back across the great red waste with my army hot on her heels and the seerlord maglore waiting for her in the gorge with all the good stuff we left behind to bring to bear against her vormulac couldnt see it maglore is an old fraud devetaki snorted shed crush him in a trice or convert him to her cause nor would we be hot on her trail not immediately eventually perhaps explain her beasts would be well rested they would make it back to turgosheim ours would be exhausted from all the patrolling watching flying and possibly fighting for remember we dont know what else we might yet come up against such as such as those men from i mean of course those men in the pass so you see before we could get after her we would have to build ourselves up again and meanwhile wratha would be converting all of our good stuff in the gorge of turgosheim vormulac scratched his head and made an unhappy growling sound huh you make it all so complicated war is complicated devetaki insisted but the answer is simple well send back a stiff complement of men and warriors to the eastern tip of the range they can shelter during daylight in the same trog caverns where we rested up after our crossing hah and we know who would find that to his liking black boris is our man then should wratha attempt flight to the east boris and his contingent would intercept and bring her crashing down in the great red waste lord unsleep for all his habitual melancholy had been attentive to everything she said good he said and now can i take it our plan of containment is complete then ill reiterate well have watchers on the plain of boulders keeping an eye on wrathstack well put a party down into the pass so preventing wratha from sneaking into sunside for provisions well leave a strong force of men and beasts here to deny her access to her or should i say to our supplicant tribes and well locate other siege components in the western heights finally well station black boris and his lot in the eastern trog caverns so cutting wratha off if she runs for home even as he spoke the words the warriorlords gloom had seemed to lift a very little but as he finished frowned and his face fell further yet she saw that he was morose as ever what is it my lord wheres my army he answered i lost some before wed even left our homeland others where we paused to refuel and a good many more over the great red waste laughing zack is no more and now i am contemplating sending wamus to his doom or at best into a terrific scrap where if your report on these weird weapons is correct hes bound to suffer severe losses nor is that the end of it you my good devetaki seem intent upon the removal of the unfortunate lady zindevar and any and all others who deviate from your norm thus even before the bloodwar begins in earnest with the bulk of the fighting still to come i see my army being whittled down left right and centre devetaki sighed but understandingly not impatiently i see now your concern for those in your command is that all it is she sighed again for a moment i thought it was some insurmountable problem which i had not foreseen but in any war men and beasts are bound to be lost my lord while in this one at least we can ensure that the brunt of the damage is suffered by those we can best afford to lose why not look at it this way the weakest make the supreme sacrifice for the good of the strong indeed for the survival of the wamphyri vormulac narrowed his eyes i was talking mainly of the rapid dissolution the dispersal of my army the fact that at this rate ill soon be left naked with only my own and a handful of lesser contingents to hand i was not complaining about the sacrifices of war why if i didnt know you better devetaki i might think you were twisting my words but i shall continue to twist them she said or if not twist ill supply the correct words dissolution dispersal i think you mean deployment my lord the tactical positioning of your forces to their best effect yes youre right but when theyre apart from me out of sight i know i shall feel that im losing control not at all she shook her head its why you have generals because you cant fight the entire war on your own she touched his arm but here comes wamus now shall you tell him or shall i i shall task him you shall describe the task and define its difficulties after all youve been there and i havent seeing the warriorlord and devetaki through the fretted curtain of pumice that provided a screening facade to his lava cavern camp lord wamus headed in their direction with his lieutenant bloodsons in tow though wellacquainted with vormulac and his selfappointed aide still wamus screened them in advance the pair felt a highpitched whistle a batlike trill or chittering striking them at all points and bouncing off carrying the details of their identities infallibly back to the weird being that was wamus a moment later and the singular examination stopped wamus stepped closer acknowledged devetaki with a nod of his head and performed a stiff formal bow in deference to vormulac and lord unsleep he inquired wamus the other nodded a gloomy greeting i see you are settling in but not too well i hope not just yet now tell me have you provisioned your men flyers and warriors are they wellfed up to strength fighting fit all is in order thank you and i see you have work for me and mine it was less than telepathy or prognostication more properly a batskill the anticipation of certain requirements in the moment before they become physically apparent as the bat is equipped to calculate an arrows flightpath thus avoiding a collision wamus was aware that this was something more than a friendly visit he had known it from the moment he glimpsed the warriorlord and the lady devetaki through gaps in the pumice curtain and vormulacs mode of greeting had confirmed it fortunately however wamus was not in the habit of avoidance he would not shirk his duties therefore and without waiting for his leaders affirmation good he said giving a curt nod for i deplore inactivity what is required of me while vormulac told him devetaki took the opportunity to scrutinize wamus and his sons through halfshuttered eyes despite that wamscarp was one of turgosheims major manses an echoing cathedral of a place in a stalagmitic cavern system located high in the wall of the gorge still its master was something of an unknown quantity of a solitary nature he was rarely seen in public now as she looked him over however covertly devetaki found herself much in accord with his selfimposed insularity that wamus was of human origin was obvious his anthropomorphism was plain to see despite that his metamorphism tried hard to obscure the fact in this respect wamus and vasagi the suck had been two of a kind they had both practised their metamorphic skills to such an extent that flux was effortless and instantaneous vasagi when the acromegalic extension of certain of his facial bones became grotesque had extruded them in deference to his own freakish design wamus long enamoured of the unerring aerial instinct of bats and determined to achieve similar skills had guided his metamorphism in that direction almost all of the wamphyri could fly though a few like lorn halfstruck were earthbound of their own choice some flew with great skill others less dexterously a handful performed clumsily and only when there was no other option when flight was an absolute necessity metamorphic flux allowed transformation of shape various designs aerofoils and leafshapes had proved successful should a flyer be crippled during an aerial collision then depending on the altitude a vampire lord or lady rider might reasonably expect to launch from the injured beast and make a safe descent conversely lieutenants and common thralls would certainly crash to their deaths for while they had partial metamorphism only the wamphyri had truly mastered it as for wamuss mastery he was to all intents and purposes a bat some six feet tall sleekly furred sharpheaded and with pointed ears curving inwards to the skull thin as a rake but flexible as a whip and light as a feather to boot with hands that reached to his knees and arms webbed to his body with folding furred membranous pinions so that opening them the webbing formed airtrap wings with a quivering convoluted snout taloned extremities and crimson pinprick eyes wamus was a bat but where the creature itself is as one with nature and therefore acceptable lord wamuss imitation made him hideous even in the eyes of his contemporaries he was a man but he was also a great bat no less than desmodus and being wamphyri he was a great deal more than both as for his bloodsons there was nothing to choose between them and their father if anything their faces and forms were even less acceptable the ladys observations had taken no more than a moment or two and meanwhile vormulac had outlined the task in hand it was now devetakis turn to speak describing the location of the keep she offered to lead wamus and his raiders to the canyons rim directly overhead because vormulac was aware of the deadly weapons of the party in the pass she was not remiss in explaining the perils of the mission finally she concluded lord unsleep saw at once that this was a task which you alone were equipped to undertake from the bed of the pass and faced with superior weapons it might seem impossible but the keep stands in the sheer face of the canyon from which it was carved and you may go where lesser flyers may not to such as you access should be no more difficult than entering into your own wamscarp by window or balcony whichever you may choose wamus looked at her and she at once guarded her secret mind he made no attempt to probe her however but merely inquired entry may not be gained by use of common flyers are there no landingbays none she answered the keep while fairly extensive is an observation post or waystation nothing more but its also an important vantage point securing the pass also you should know that great honour attaches lord unsleep and i are agreed that in the event of your taking it you shall keep it thereafter the pass shall be named wamus pass and the keep in the canyon wamskeep wamus drew himself up filled his lungs and for a moment his tiny eyes glittered more brightly yet but then blinking rapidly he said vormulac and you the virgin grandam of masquemanse called skullguise do you say you are agreed but how is it you have the right lady as the warriorlords chief adviser i have it devetaki answered the other nodded blinked again and thought on what hed been told and the keep shall be mine to use to our mutual advantage she reminded him and my name shall be on the keep and on the pass vormulac put in in honour of your victory yes so be it wamus bowed from the waist only allow us a few hours resting time and we shall be ready i go to make my plans and i to take nourishment in sunside devetaki told him shall we meet here then in a matter of what six hours wamus nodded midway between now and midnight aye and bowing again to vormulac he and his bloodsons turned and went back through the timecarved pumice curtain into their temporary camp then vormulac said to devetaki lady there are things i must see to the setting up of ambushes blockades and observation posts and so forth call me when youve eaten and rested and ill be ready well see how well or badly wamus fares when faced with these deadly weapons of yours but as they parted company devetaki was aware of vormulacs hooded eyes upon her more to the point she also felt his feeble inferior telepathic probe and turned it easily aside in a cavelet off nana kiklus carecave where she saw to the requirements of the elderly whom lardis lidesci had given into her charge nathan slept in his mishas arms like a dead man which wasnt at all the cliche that it sounded for as nathan knew only too well the dead do sleep from time to time not only to escape the ennui of their condition but to rest their everquestioning minds for when inquiring mind a no longer physical but metaphysical factory of questioning and reasoning of calculation and conception is all that remains then uninterrupted the mental pursuits of a persons lifetime follow exponential curves almost to infinity but while most questions have answers and problems solutions others appear insoluble or form merely the nuclei of even greater problems and even dead minds can become exhausted as for nathan kiklu or keogh as he now rightly considered himself his mind and body were anything but dead although they felt it and especially his body for in the last two days earthtime parallel earth the earth beyond the starside gate nathan had performed the physical work of at least two men and the metaphysical work of just one man before him his father the necroscope harry keogh and where work such as that was concerned nathan was the only one who could perform it for he was the new necroscope but for all that he was physically exhausted or perhaps because of it his sleeping mind galvanized by the events of the recent past and the mixed emotions evoked by his return to his homeworld went on in a whirlwind spiral of recollection reflection even reacclimatization to the old butnew environment of sunsidestarside it might best be thought of as a kind of jetlag but between universes as opposed to continents and as the sprinter continues to run in his sleep or the longdistance cyclist goes on pedalling so nathan continued to dream to remember and even to communicate eventually not unnaturally his most lucid memories and the happiest ones were uppermost in his mind he dreamed of the occurrences following immediately upon the battle for sanctuary rock after gorvi the guiles lieutenant turgis had undergone interrogation by lardis lidesci and after hed uttered his last curse and died the true death in a szgany firepit and because it was all so fresh the dream was as real as life more nearly a vivid recollection than a dream proper wearily they made their way back to the rock across a battlefield mainly cleared of the debris of war a warrior burned in its own fats kept going by the blazing faggots which lardiss men tossed into the heat and the stench a flyer seemed grotesquely perched upon an agonyarched framework of redglowing skeletal cinder wings its long neck gradually slumping in the melt parting from its body and issuing sooty scraps and sparks that drifted to the sky in a column of smoke a lieutenants bloodied gauntlet lay where he had left it his clenched fist severed from the wrist by a keen machete was still inside noticing this loathsome relic in passing lardis growled have someone deal with that andrei if you please i want no bits left over to contaminate the clean earth no for i swear by my star that the very air these bastards breathed was tainted forever lardis andrei romani a handful of the rocks senior men and nathan trask chung and the three cavers they all walked together many of them shakily stepping carefully near warriortraps left untouched by the fighting whose camouflage of freshcut gorse and greenwoven withe showed intact through the thinning mist but as the last of the rocks defensive systems fell behind and a path through the screestrewn approach lay clear ahead a sudden eruption from sanctuary rocks main cavern entrance nathan should have been expecting it for it wasnt the first time after all word of his return had found its way back to his mother in the rock where she cared for the szgany lidescis old ones and knowing that her son was alive right here and now nothing in earth air fire or water could have kept nana kiklu from him not only his mother but misha too his young wife who shared nanas duties with her both of them came at a run then stumblingly finally halting even as the men halted and nathan looked at them looking at him misha was desperate to be in his arms her breast heaved and her eyes were full of him and full of a mist that threatened to brim over too but she held back in deference to his mother who stepped forward and slapped him then gazed at her stinging hand in wonderment and burst into tears and no one not even nathan had ever seen nana do that before but he knew why and so did all the others so that nana was the only one who was surprised then the piledriver force of her as she flew into his arms so that he must lean forwards to meet her or be knocked off his feet and feeling her against him knowing she was safe and therefore that he was safe as his eyes transferred to misha misha who was calmer now and waiting her turn but who nevertheless had that look about her that said you are realjy for it now my lad finally nana released him and halfflinchingly blinking his eyes nathan turned to misha then all the men with him bursting into nervous laughter as she cocked her head narrowed her eyes and wagged a finger gave a strange whimpering little cry and fell into his embrace fell to with a barrage of kisses that threatened to slurp his face off and finally nathan knew that he was home before they could go off together however nathan growled lardis weve things to talk about me and mine you and yours time later for well proper greetings but much to say and do and little enough time as it is the ladies will have to understand how long nana and misha were at once anxious and misha protesting we too have questions things we want to know then giving nathan that look again i thought you were gone forever dead undead drained of life a flameeyed thrall in wrathstack but his mother shook her head she knew you werent and so did i you knew he looked from one to the other his mother shrugged her eyes were dry now but sarcasm dripped as she said of course the sun continued to come up in the mornings didnt it and misha smiled and added and the stars shone bright as ever at night szgany fondness then nana again very well go and talk but lardis only for an hour i hold you to it he was possibly the greatest szgany leader ever whom even the wamphyri held in some regard but still it was an order and without waiting for an answer the two women went off then come said lardis i have rooms in the rock but as he lead them in through the main entrance the old lidesci turned and said to no one in particular and to everyone except for essential duties get your heads down pass it on youre to get what sleep you can for before too long ill be having you all up again so start dusting off your carts and travois you lads aye for well all be travellers again by morning most of sanctuary rocks friable chalky base was buried in the roots of the foothills rising to the barrier mountains water action in some earlier age had carved most of its cavern systems what else could be excavated by hand had been and it was scarcely surprising that lardis had found evidence of prehistoric habitation even now the rock made an excellent camp and fortress with its constant temperature and alveoli cavelets to house lardiss people it was quite literally a sanctuary or had been until now above the chalky base however the material of the rock was a hard sandstone turning to granite halfway to the dome since geology was an unknown science the lidescis could scarcely be expected to know that the whole rock was an extinct volcanos plug which had weathered out and toppled from on high to where it now stood on its head but the rocks caverns extended upwards only to the sandstone level and to the rear as far back as the foothills bedrock so that while on the one hand the rock had seemed a safe place on the other it had been a trap which was why the old lidesci had cut escape routes through the chalk and sandstone to the overgrown rising ground of the foothills on both sides cramped tunnels that were large enough for men difficult for anything as bulky as a vampire lord and quite impossible for their constructs if ever the wamphyri their thralls or monsters should invade via the main entrance lardis would escape through his boltholes and use crude but effective gunpowder to bring the entire thing down on whatever was behind him lardis had a large lowceilinged cave high up and to the rear of the maze of caverns and fissures that formed sanctuary rocks interior since opening the place up exploring and occasionally excavating its extensive systems room had been made for all of the lidesci tribe but only the fortunate few with apartments on the rim close to the external wall or face of the rock had natural light and rooms with a view this occurred where the rock was pitted right through to its cysts or caves forming windows or air shafts to the outside world in the higher caves these windows made excellent viewports allowing observation of the countryside all around as leader of his people lardis could have had an airier place instead he had denied himself and apportioned all of the perimeter rooms to the old folk and families which was typical of him but at least his place was large with room to accommodate all of his senior men whenever lardis called a meeting here it would be dark black as the pit but for candles in niches in the walls one of these was lit but guttered low lardis leading the way with a flaring torch touched fire to the other candles and set the place to glowing yellow now the group could talk and make proper introductions feeling compressed if not claustrophobic nathan sat opposite lardis at a huge low oval table everything was low the ceiling an uneven blotchy surface scant inches overhead was festooned with stalactite nodes which would raise unpleasant lumps if they should come into sudden accidental contact with a mans forehead or face ben trask sat on nathans left david chung on his right the three cavers sat next to chung with four of lardiss men opposite there were faces nathan knew of old others he had rarely seen or never but he was certainly glad that andrei romani was there and the wiry hunter kirk lisescu grinning ear to ear and eager to have a word with his young friend as soon as the opportunity presented itself for of course to the ones nathan knew he was a new nathan first his absence of three long years when hed wandered among the desertdwelling thyre and dwelled in the seerlord maglores runemanse in turgosheim now his absence of months since the time when hed been stolen away by a wamphyri flyer and no one had known if he were dead or alive or somewhere in between and on both occasions changes in him some fairly dramatic and others less so but startling anyway to the few who had been close to him in the old days for one he was no longer a bumbling blushing boy but a man and one as rare as silver or mirrors or kneblasch in an aerie at that and for another he was no longer blond as new straw but wore grey streaks in his temples that loaned him years hed not yet lived and an air of esoteric knowledge even stranger than the unspent years and he was no longer pale but a tan different again from the weatheredin look of the szgany the result of his time spent in the more frequent daylight of earth especially the light of the greek islands finally necroscope lardis lidesci declared decisively and kirk lisescu added with a wink and a nod in nathans direction aye and your fathers son right down to that faraway look in your eyes kirk sat on lardiss left and was rewarded with an elbow in his ribs but thats knowledge that stays right here lardis cautioned him sternly its for us to know for us in the know and no one else he glared all around the table nana kiklu lives with us shes a good woman whom id protect with my life even as she protected my own lissa upon a time no rumours no wagging tongues no sniggering old biddies who begrudge nana her looks and would definitely begrudge that she once loved the necroscope harry keogh lardis could be outspoken which was how he preferred it it was out in the open now and no more pretending anyway her hzak was dead and died a brave man of the vampire shit in a lords bloody gauntlet which poisoned him and the lidescis were reduced by my own orders widows were taking new husbands and widowers new wives so why shouldnt nana it wasnt her fault she fell for harry helllander so then let no man criticize nathan or his mother and certainly not his father without harry keogh we were all dead men long and long ago well like father like son it could be that without nathan wed be dead tonight or stumbling over the boulder plains to wrathstack or turned to living slime in some lord or ladys vats again he glared all about is it understood all regarding nathan stays here nothing of it goes outside if a man of you has trouble with that leave now but when you go leave anything you heard behind you if not youll have me to deal with later no one moved nor even shuffled good said lardis and andrei romani on lardiss right said good aye and so what anyway hes not the only bastard here im one myself and both of us good uns the rest of them laughed but the three cavers sat silent looking mystified they might glean something from all of this at least it gave them the opportunity to hear the szgany tongue used more extensively and perhaps pick up a few words but in any case they were nathans men and so should stay with him in his group where he could translate or instruct as required as for the subject of lardiss stern warning and andreis goodhearted joking nathan wasnt embarrassed he might have been long ago but no longer both the living and the dead of another world its great majority had explained to him how there was nothing to be ashamed of in his father on the other hand there was a certain something about his ancestry more properly his family that disturbed him something which remained undisclosed as yet desiring it to stay that way he now took the initiative and said lardis before we begin a little information if youll oblige me to bring me up to date the way he said it made lardis look at him in the flickering candlelight for surely information was what they were here about unless there was some secret meaning and there was for it was written on nathans face plain to see by the old lidesci where he sat directly opposite wherefore lardis must give nathan his head to see where the lad would gallop and so aye he said go on what is it you would know tonight was a fierce battle nathan said the wamphyri came here to sanctuary rock which is something new lardis nodded indeed for it seems theyve found us out at last i anticipated it years ago and well move out later tonight i couldnt help noticing that there were a great many of them the wamphyri themselves werent much in evidence not on the ground at least but their men and beasts he let it hang in the air unspoken it was the emphasis he put on themselves that told lardis what this was about and now the old lidesci must find a way to tell him what he wanted to know without telling the others weve heard rumours out of the east said lardis slowly grinding out the words there were always supplicant tribes in the east cowardly dogs well wratha and those other bloodsuckers have started them up again whats more it seems the wamphyri are united again theyve been building their forces without letup also weve been hearing that theres a brandnew lord among them we dont know too much about that one as yet but what we do know isnt good rumour has it that hes a necromancer hes supposed to have been seen by some of karl zestoss people rummaging in the old mounds and tumuli in the woods its only to be expected i suppose of a necromancer and nathan nodded to show he understood understood that lardis knew his brother nestor was a vampire and not merely a vampire but also a lord and now a necromancer it made sense in a way his fathers talent was coming out in nestor just as it had in nathan but whereas in nathan it had been for the good the old lidesci had kept it to himself so as not to hurt nana kiklu and so as not to damage nathans credibility his reasons were obvious while it was not forgotten among the lidescis how harry keogh had joined with his son the dweller to destroy the old wamphyri and reduce their aeries to rubble it was also remembered how in the end harry had become wamphyri if it should now be learned that nestor was this brandnew lord in wrathstack and not only a lord but a necromancer too perhaps that quaint old adage like father like son might take on a new and frightening meaning and how would that affect nathan necroscope now aye but what about tomorrow would it make any difference that he had been born before harry keogh became wamphyri would anyone remember that or even consider it when they discovered that his brother was a monster even lardis himself had lost sleep worrying about it and if he didnt love nathan like a son and if he hadnt lost his own son but he did and he had and that was that nathan was still looking at lardis but the tense look had finally gone out of the old lidescis face the secret was theirs to share between them theirs alone for the moment at least lardis relaxed nodded and said very well i think im ready for a proper introduction to these friends of yours nathan and then well hear your story if memory serves the one you told us last time was pretty damn good but ive a feeling this one is going to top it only lets get on without delay for your mothers given us an hour no more he rubbed his chin in mock concern grinned and said a bit of a girl your mother in her time i wont be the one to cross her be sure the introductions somewhat stilted and complicated by language differences which required interpretation in places followed part five nathan a champion for the living a dreamer for the dead i ojd contacts renewed glancing left and right at trask and chung nathan spoke to the old lidesci as they were my fathers friends before me these men are my friends helllanders if you like but despite what zek foener told you it isnt really hell ive met zek incidentally and she remembers you with great fondness ahhh lardiss long drawnout gasp but you actually met zekintha is she well and jazz ah how that one could fight they should have come together and stayed here in fact i think they did get together why i was almost jealous of him upon a time er it was before lissa of course jazz and zek their blood was good and hot very nearly szgany and their children would have given us new life right across sunside nathan nodded wryly nana and misha would be lucky to see him in just one hour lardis made a wonderful audience but just like a child he would be full of questions best to ignore them and get on with it except well the old lidesci must be told about zek and jazz and so they did get together he said zek remains and shes well yes she took me to jazzs grave in a place so beautiful youd scarcely believe i was pleased to go there with her changing the subject nathan clapped a hand to ben trasks shoulder this man is as brave as they come in any world and without him i couldnt have returned why he even came with me to help you destroy the wamphyri which was true as far as it went he is called ben and lardis zekintha misses him very much in the helllands theirs is a new thing too soon broken ben has a talent he sees the truth of things only lie to him hell know your betrayal show him a false trail hell choose the right one lardis studied trask anew but what was to study if zek found him good then he was good and this small yellowish man is david nathan continued and grasped chungs arm youve much in common with him lardis he sees afar he is a seer as the talent was in your ancestors and remains in your blood so it is in david looking from trask to chung and back again lardis nodded all good things these strange skills of yours and we can use them aye for the wamphyri are talented too well welcome to sanctuary rock ben and david a pity you wont get to know it any better but well soon be out of here now that wratha and her lot know were here its no longer safe trask nodded and carefully haltingly mainly in the szgany tongue said thank you for accepting us obviously nathan has your complete confidence thats not hard to understand his father harry keogh had mine those long years ago i knew him when he was just a man and afterwards before he came back to starside nothing changed him not the real harry not even at the end i know lardis answered for i was there at the end and then in a surprised tone but you speak our tongue not very well but you speak it i noticed it before when we joke you laugh now how is that trask shrugged he looked somewhat mystified himself i have a way with tongues in my world there are many languages i know a little not much a word here and there of most of them but yours is a strange world and i have to admit that ive surprised myself for once it was nathan who knew the truth of it its your talent he said ive noticed that all espers have this knack with tongues especially mentalists myself zekintha others too i suspect matching words to thoughts makes it that much easier in you ben its the fact that youre a human liedetector you know the truth of things even the truth of words i cant explain it any better than that lan goodly has it too and david he looked at chung im getting most of this yes chung nodded ive never questioned my skill chinese parents english upbringing some german and a little french in school the rest just seemed to come naturally no trask shook his head metaphysically nathan has to be right its our esp they settled down and nathan indicated the silent as yet astonished even shaken cavers they were seated on his right beyond chung between the chinaman and kirk lisescu but here nathan found himself embarrassed he had met these men at the romanian refuge since when things had moved so fast he hadnt had time to get to know them even their names escaped him now their spokesman aware of nathans difficulty said im john carling my friends are jim bentley and orson sangster i think we all understand a little of whats being said but nothing of whats going on as for this this what this parallel world its just a nightmare what weve seen so far is unbelievable but for the fact that were all cavers used to being underground well im pretty sure wed all be out of here on the double except we wouldnt know where the hell we were running or what wed be likely to run into at least these people here are friendly and well people carling was a compact capable looking man small wiry dark haired and crewcut his hands were large and strong and he used them for emphasis when he spoke he had a small mouth straight nose slightly hollow cheeks if his hair were longer and his skin a shade darker he could pass for szgany jim bentley was also slender and agile but stood two or three inches taller than carling he had a lopsided mouth a nervous grin red hair and brown eyes a deep crescent moonshaped scar on his forehead was the legacy of some minor caving accident orson sangster was the odd man out heavyset for a caver he was longarmed and lumbering and shared many features with the old lidesci who might best be described as simian also like lardis his looks were deceptive a good disguise for his sharp mind and ready wit ben trask found himself feeling sorry for the three said when we get the chance ill fill you in more properly on what youve got yourselves into but if i tell you that what happens here could well determine the future of our own world then you might appreciate that this is bigger than all of us but in any case like it or not youre in it for the duration listen in and make your best effort to learn the language we could be here for some time to come while trask was speaking nathan had been looking at lardiss senior men he was well acquainted with kirk lisescu and andrei romani of course but the rest were new to him also it seemed that several of the old crew were absent so before beginning his story directing his gaze at andrei who sat silently now apparently lost in thought nathan began to inquire what of your and immediately paused it was his telepathy which hed learned from the thyre to use sparingly so avoiding intrusion into the minds of others andreis thoughts had been so strong however that theyd almost spilled over making nathans inquiry unnecessary almost without trying hed read his answer in the others mind that the romani brothers ion and franci were dead killed in a recent attack on settlement seeing nathans confusion guessing what hed been about to ask andrei nodded said gone aye like so many before them they were two of a team on decoy duty in old settlement theyd been setting small fires and burning beastflesh sending cooking smells up to lure the wamphyri down and it worked there were a lot of the bastards that night but what with dimi petrescus exploding powder and our rockets and all the settlement team had their measure one of our rockets hit a warrior in the gasbladders and set them and his mantle on fire crashing down the beast was halfstunned on impact ion and franci went to fling boiling tar on him but there was more life in the devil than theyd thought andreis eyes had shone misty in the candlelight now as he gave himself a shake he said well thats how it goes and nathan felt him blank it from his mind so that it wouldnt creep back again not until the next time it was sobering saddening and it brought the situation home to everyone with the exception perhaps of the cavers out of respect nathan waited a moment before starting to tell his story but once underway he progressed with some speed and wasted as little time as possible picking up the tale from where lardis must have left it at the time he told how he had been taken by a flyer whose lieutenant rider for some unknown reason had thrown him into the glaring helllands gate on the other side in a place called perchorsk hed been taken prisoner but had managed to escape in enemy territory helllander travellers had befriended and hidden him until trask and his organization could pick him up and convey him to a place of safety then with the assistance of his newfound esper friends nathan had discovered his necroscope connections learning his fathers art of going places he had become the ultimate traveller now by use of a second gate he had managed to return home bringing back helllander weapons with him hopefully to defeat the wamphyri as for trask chung and the others they were here mainly by accident but also because they desired to destroy the wamphyri not unnaturally the helllanders in general thought of the gates as a monstrous threat to their world and desired to close them forever and as soon as possible therefore trask and the others must go back to their own world without delay and while they still could but not before they had trained lardiss men in the use of their amazing weapons later upon their return to the helllands and if it was at all feasible they would continue to send guns and ammunition through until the gates were closed nathan also mentioned that the leader of his helllander enemies from perchorsk had also come through with a good many men and that they had weapons too the szgany should be aware of this that not all foreigners were good sorts as for turkur tzonov nathan scarcely cared what happened to him at all but it would not be a good thing if his weapons fell into wamphyri hands or into the hands of the lady wrathas collaborators her supplicants beyond the great pass lardis rumbled when nathan had done and he spat into the dust of the floor nathan frowned i had forgotten about them perhaps ill have to see what can be done about tzonov after all i have my own reasons for hating him but i had hoped it would be out of my hands apparently not what about these gypsies these helllander travellers plainly lardis was fascinated by the idea nathan pondered a moment looked for the best way to tell it and finally said they are true travellers aye szgany or their ancestors were at least and in the helllands too theyre called szgany or zigeuner they have various names the starside gate has been there a long long time lardis theyre from here dyou mean from sunsidestarside nathan nodded originally yes indeed the chief of the tribe i spent time with i lived in his caravan a day and a night was a direct descendant he was the last of his line of the true szgany blood and carried the history of his forefathers with him likewise it will go with him to his grave and i know that you will say its as well lardis frowned really how do you mean nathan shrugged he was a ferengi lardiss eyes bugged ferengi a ferenc dyou say he turned his face aside and spat again the ferencs were cursed in prehistory since time immemorial there were always ferencs among the old wamphyri fess ferenc was one such and i saw him once during a raid a giant bulgeheaded and blockjawed his bones all wrong and talons for hands but the szgany ferengi nathan nodded but all myths and legends now to them ancestral memory of a time when their lord was big in his castle and they went out across the world to do his bidding they remember the places where their ancestors came from the gates where they emerge into the helllands lardis said we have our legends too we know that as long as the wamphyri have been theyve had three dire punishments for transgressors against their own laws or in other words theyve had three especially unpleasant ways of getting rid of their greatest enemies they were banished to the north to die of hunger and cold in the icelands or they were buried undead in deep pits out on the barren boulder plains till they stiffened to stones in the earth or they were hurled into the starside gate and sent to hell forever for no one ever came back from there aye and sometimes their thralls would go with them is that what youre telling me that the helllands travellers were supplicant szgany nathan nodded some of them must have been unvampirized in order that they could keep watch during the hellland days which are shorter and more frequent than ours to ensure their lords slept in safety lardis looked at him for long moments just legends you say but are you sure thats all they are nathan these lords in this strange world youve visited just legends trask cut in we believe so harry keogh tracked the last of them down and killed him that one was a ferenczy too but harry must have got too close which was his undoing indeed lardis nodded it doesnt do to get too close to the wamphyri he looked at nathan and so when this old chief who sheltered you goes down into the ground it will be the end of his line of the direct line yes nathan answered and trask smiled and said but not of the ferenczys eh lardis frowned come again its a common name in my world trask told him and he looked at andrei romani especially in romania andrei drew breath in a great gasp where what did you say nathan stepped in at once its true enough andrei in the helllands theres a gate indeed the original gate that opens into a country called romania and the travellers gypsies szgany zigeuner call them what you will they are known collectively as romany andrei was agog he glanced this way and that said to lardis should i be insulted did ancestors of mine go into the helllands as vampire thralls but again nathan was quick off the mark not necessarily romani is a common name after all youll forgive my saying so im sure but all along the mountain flank dwell romanis in no way related to you or remotely at best andrei said phew and sat back trask checked his watch and warned your hour is up lardis stood up enough for now were all of us on our knees it has been a hard enough day for us szgany so it must have been what hell for you lot he grinned through crooked ivory teeth but in a moment was serious again ill have someone show you your places get your heads down by all means but try not to make yourselves too comfortable before midnight long before we shall be on our way out of here where to is my business sunup will find us in a new camp which will be soon enough for weapontraining and whatall but you six or seven if the woman was here lardis held out his long arms as if to encompass carling and colleagues then did the same towards trask nathan chung listen im not much of a one for saying thanks theres never been a lot to say thanks for still its plain to me that your being here saved us all tonight i know that as soon as my lads get the chance theyll want to celebrate and have a do aye and rightly so for its been a long time at that then youll be made welcome be sure and as his men lit torches and prepared to leave the cave lardis called out oh yes and another thing i give you fair warning theres a bunch of fine brownlimbed lasses here and many of them without men so watch your step you helllanders for believe me they will be wanting to make you welcome too his chuckles followed them out into the mazy ways of the rock nathan made a small rasping sound in the back of his throat then clearly spoke a name however strange thikkoul for a moment disturbed he struggled a little and turned over in his sleep misha wideawake made room for him then went back to cradling him when hed settled down again her arm went across his body she pressed her breasts to his back her hand found his manhood where it lay limp now it was always a wonder to her how an item so small and soft could grow so large and hard and so swiftly but making love to her this time had been too much for him physically exhausted even before the act afterwards he had fallen straight into a deep sleep it wasnt his usual way she was sure not that shed ever had him long enough to know his usual way but she had understood emptying himself into her had created this void in him no movement no thought nothing but the salving surf of relief rolling over sharp reefs of body and mind except nathans was a special mind and a stranger to inactivity and so in a very little while he had started to dream now he was doing it again and because she loved him misha wondered what he was dreaming about this time as if in answer thikkoul he said again it was a mumble fading into silence and into a peculiar stillness indeed he lay so very still that she knew he must be listening but to what nathaaan it came as from a million miles away a voice remembered as if from a million years ago so it seemed to the necroscope yet how may a man recall to mind a voice he never before heard in life whose owner was dead before he was even born a normal man or normal mind may not except perhaps in flashes of ancestral memory if a man believed in such things but normal minds are incapable of communication with the dead nathaaan the voice came again like an echo out of space and time but far more insistent than any dream and the necroscope had learned to know the difference which was why for the third time in his sleep he spoke the name of his real yet incorporeal contact thikkoul except this time he repeated it to himself under his breath in a language known as deadspeak which was now as natural to him as breathing had there been living minds in tune with nathans at that moment they would doubtless be mystified by a sudden blackout the fact that where nathans subconscious mind had been there was now a void for only the dead could hear deadspeak it was like radio without a receiver or rather the receiver was in nathans head it was like semaphore to a blind man or a distant shout to a man stone deaf and among the living there was only one man who could receive see hear it or perhaps two if nestor were included except his talent took on a different form where incoming transmissions were not voluntary no not at all nathaaan and then more clearly homing in on the necroscope at last nathan is it really you but then who else can it be and who else could this be but thikkoul a thyre astrologer whose talent was to the precog lan goodly what goodlys was to some fairground faker thikkoul who had read nathans future in the stars and read it true however obliquely nathan remembered what thikkoul had told him how first he would be reunited albeit briefly with his mother and misha before disappearing from the world as in the blink of some monstrous glaring eye and indeed he had gone out of this world tossed halfconscious into the glaring eye of the helllands gate by nestors vampire lieutenant but you didnt foretell my return because looked no farther and after ail why should i for when you are gone you are gone in my experience the total absence of a man indicates his demise in all truth nathan i had expected to talk to you again but from our respective resting places in any case are you sorry that i was wrong no of course not and im not blaming you your reading was accurate its simply as you said reading the future is a devious thing that a point will be arrived at is inevitable but how we arrive there is up to time and the tides the tides an expression from another world except thikkoul had seen it in his mind even before he could begin to explain for the thyre were amazing mentalists all and their great majority had been practised in deadspeak long before the advent of harry keogh into their world another world and didnt you always go in search of one so why did you return because this is my world and because everything i love is here also because everything you hate is here fancy the wamphyri oh yes and we may have the means to destroy them at last but here nathan paused for even in the seclusion of deadspeak that was something he didnt want to go into anyway he wasnt sure of the details himself except that the less anyone knew of them dead or alive the better which was why he now changed the subject thikkoul how did you know i was back what you the one man who stands between life and death like a bridge between alien nations a messenger between different spheres of existence an envoy of the otherwise unknown when you went from us a solitary candle blinked out when you returned it burst back into flame i would have tried to contact you earlier but at first we did not dare believe we myself and all of your friends among the thyre ancients with whom you have spoken in the past whose word you passed on to their descendants among the living but in the cavern of the ancients in placeundertheyellowcliffs rogei shaeken and others were suddenly excited via deadspeak they spoke to their colleagues in other places to tolmia and to ethloi the elder in opentothesky who passed the message on that in fact you had returned so it finally reached me thikkoul the stargazer in the hall of endless hours in rivers rush and of course i had to speak to you and offer my services your services oh yes for now that you have a future why i can read it for you but i admit its for myself as much as for you to see the stars again through the eyes of the necroscope nathan thought about it it could be invaluable he said eventually and then rather more cautiously but on the other hand since whatever you see cant be changed i mean since what will be will be of course said thikkoul if disappointedly and nathan sensed his slow deadspeak nod of course and i really cant blame you that you do not wish to know for after all the future of any man even the necroscope can only be so long but if i should change my mind yes yes thats understood said thikkoul and after a moment ive interrupted your sleep enough only remember that im here if ever you should need me i will nathan answered and felt thikkouls incorporeal probe dwindling to nothing in his metaphysical mind in another moment the deadspeak void had disappeared too and the necroscopes dreaming mind was open again open to those several others who had been trying to reach him ever since his return to his home world some hours ago who had known that their best chance would come when he slept various obstructions for one the mass of the barrier mountains for another the fact that nathans mind was either fully occupied or totally empty a deadspeak void and for a third the fact that he slept in the rock though close to its outer perimeter had so far kept them from him but while they waited they had talked among themselves as was their wont in previous times it had scarcely been necessary for them to communicate in this current fashion living together and as joint leaders of the same pack and brothers out of the same litter daily contact had more than sufficed recently however bitter circumstances had forced them apart which was the reason they contacted nathan now that and to welcome him home he had been listening to their telepathic conversation for several minutes before true cognizance dawned that it wasnt a dream but a reality had he been awake nathan would have made the connection at once his own telepathy had long developed to that degree where he recognized the thoughts of others for what they were no longer as the vague static or mental interference which he had known as a child his telepathy and his deadspeak had always been present in him but undeveloped through lack of practice or lack of sympathetic minds on whom to practise the dead wouldnt speak to him and apart from his wolves he had known no telepathic contact or perhaps some but only with nestor which was not an uncommon phenomenon between szgany kith and kin in his travels however the nomadic thyre had opened up both of these esoteric channels to him and in ben trasks parallel world he had finally used his talent to befriend the teeming dead in a way superior to all his expectations in sunside for as far as nathan was aware and with the exception of the thyre of course the great majority of his own world had not changed in their attitude desiring no truck with him at all they continued to shun him wherefore these communications he intercepted now since they were not thyre sendings and could not be szgany deadspeak were telepathic but to speak mindtomind with such as these it resolved a question of old concern whose answer while it had been made apparent in trasks world was one that might only be verified here and this communication was that verification it was something that nathan had always questioned while in his heart knowing that it was true his weird relationship with certain members of the grey brotherhood the wild children of the night the wolves who inhabited sunsidestarsides barrier mountains but a relationship in the true and fullest sense of the word as was now apparent for nathans older brother not nestor kiklu or whatever he called himself now no but a blood brother nevertheless a true son of harry keogh and a woman of his earth had been the dweller himself and the dweller had been a werewolf even as nathan slept on the last pieces of an old puzzle began slotting themselves into place in his metaphysical mind the reason his wolves had always called him uncle surely it was as they themselves had often declared it to be because he was their uncle the reason why hed always been aware of them as other than just wolves and had exercised some power over them because they were of one origin with him one blood the reason why they had always seemed to watch over him as best they could because their father would have wished it even as theyd tried to tell him upon a time and sleeping still he remembered something else they had tried to tell him which thrilled him to his very core for he knew now that he was not the only necroscope what harry keogh had passed down to him and in a yet more morbid manifestation to nestor had also been passed to nathans nephew wolves it had happened on the night of wrathas very first attack on settlement when she and her renegades had flown from karenstack over the barrier mountains and down into sunside for the first time and nathan recalled what his wolves had revealed to him in the aftermath of that raid during a similar exhausted sleep things have come to pass they had told him strange and monstrous creatures are come to dwell in starsides last great aerie out of which they raid on sunside the woods and mountains are no longer safe neither for wolves nor men these are problems for which we have no answers but there is one at least who might know and nathan had said but there is no answer to the wamphyri you may be right you may be wrong but our mother speaks to our father who is your brother if anyone would know he is that one and so we go to speak to the one who suckled us your mother a shewolf aye where her bones lie bleached in a secret place it had been before nathan discovered his talent before he had even known what a necroscope was there was no way he could have understood their what riddles but now oh now he understood well enough that they too in their wolf way were necroscopes necroscopes all three of them and just as nathan talked to his dead so they talked to theirs dock so called because his tail had been shortened by an angry vixen when he was a cub and blaze after the diagonal white stripe across his forehead as if the fur there was marked with frost and grinner whose upper lip was given to curling so that his teeth were always bared even to friends nathans wolves his wolves his nephews even now they heard his thoughts and answered them uncle blaze growled coughed barked in his mind and so youve come back at last you and your numbers there could be but one source my numbers nathan frowned did you not know but they issue from you like light from a beacon not so much during the day but most certainly when you sleep that gave nathan something to think about something to ponder when he woke up and all of this reverted to a dream or if he was lucky to memory for if the numbers vortex made him apparent to his wolves then how transparent was he to others halfforgotten things which had disturbed and worried him at the time of their occurrence now stirred to renewed life in the world beyond the starside gate siggi dam not a locator but a telepath had discovered him easily enough and the last time he was here in sunside his vampire brother nestor had known his whereabouts precisely but the numbers vortex was that it the metaphysical mathematics hed been born with his betrayer from now on he must suppress it especially now that he was back with lardis and the szgany lidesci the last thing he desired to be was a beacon for the wamphyri the shake of a deadspeak head it was blaze again in aji sunsidestarside there are only five who give off numbers like that and only five who can read them if another mind were to touch yours as mine touches it now then he might experience your numbers vortex but to us it has always been a clear signal revealing your whereabouts alas not only to us but also to your brother nestor five of us nathan answered myself the three of you and nestor all of the one blood the nod of a wolf head the flash of its white stripe registering as clearly as if blaze were here right now and nathan could see him as hed known him since his childhood his eyes brown as dark wild honey in the twilight but feral yellow at night lean and muscular surefooted as a mountain goat but fleeter far and intelligent oh way beyond the average intelligence of the pack except for individual markings and habits all three of them were much of a muchness of course they were for they were of the same litter the one blood as was nathan of that blood it made sense yet something indeed several things made very little sense or none at all nestor has a numbers vortex you say my brother gives off numbers his numbers aura is a weak thing and slowly fading but we know him by it all the same aye for our senses are keen and we use them to their full both our senses and his aura to avoid him now blazes wolf voice was a low growl and bitter because hes wamphyri that and more nestor and those others in the last aerie for a while now theyve been our problem too wait said nathan i must be straight on this if nestor has numbers why dont i know it why cant i read them why have i never sensed them i mean nestor hated numbers it was so and now nathan remembered something nestor had used to say that a number was the count of fish he had caught and division was the shareout after a days hunting and multiplication was something rabbits had mastered without once using their fingers and toes he doesnt know he has them or if he does know then he doesnt care to know he blames you nathan for the numbers in his head he always has for when you are near it sets nestors vortex going and he doesnt much care for the whirling in his brain how can you know this because its much the same for us we have numbers too but no use for them what was in our father is in us its why we are different clever but to be what we are doesnt require us to know everything that he knew and nestor is the same can you not try to understand ah but you were far easier to talk to upon a time nathan sensed great frustration in the other a certain urgency but he must have this out i was easier to talk to because i didnt understand i simply accepted now i am beginning to understand but i tell you this just as ive never sensed nestors numbers neither have i sensed yours docks nor dinners a despairing wolf shrug i have tried to answer for nestor perhaps i am right perhaps i am wrong i say how i see and your numbers why havent i sensed them they are subdued dormant our mother told us hide them they are unnatural your father had numbers too and where is your father now gone in a bang and a great flash of light as cubs we put our numbers aside what were they anyway but a distraction could you recall them show them to me my numbers but what a waste of time now tell me uncle have you returned to fight the wamphyri or to play with numbers its important very well but i must be brief watch nathan watched and he saw conjured out of nowhere it was a numbers vortex that same mad cone of numbers yet not the same for while nathans vortex was made up of real numbers from the simple gate marks of the szgany system to all the cyphers symbols and algebraic jumble of alien parallel worlds his wolf nephew blazes vortex was composed in its entirety of wolf numbers paw marks scratches moon and star symbols clusters of five or six rocks pine trees grouped in threes and fours the grey brotherhood counted only those things that had meaning or use to them but no meaning at all to nathan yet the ebb and flow and whirl of the thing was not without direction indeed it appeared to be all about direction nathans own vortex had always seemed to hint of vast distances spanned in a moment and of all time being now also there had been this sense of worlds far beyond all a puzzle then but of awesome relevance now his numbers had proved to be the source material of the mobius continuum itself could there be a similar case here for that familiar feeling of worlds beyond was very real and of their direction nathan found it of great interest he would have liked to study it longer except blaze shut it down before he could even begin this gets us nowhere again his frustration was showing through so that nathan dropped the subject and asked instead where are you now and why did you seek me out to say hello also to warn you and to seek your help though how you may help is beyond me you are too full of your own problems your own questions let me answer yet another of them i am high in the mountains hello to you too then blaze high in the mountains who upon a time was far less irritable and grinner dock if youre listening but you know that if i can help you with something i will first what did you want to warn me about about the wamphyri of course of course but i already know about the wamphyri oh well you know about wratha and hers at least ice melted on nathans spine and trickled there are you telling me there are more come from the east aye when a day at most how many more than we can count but we are wolves not good with numbers the ice trickled faster youve seen them your nephew dock has seen them dock is the leader of the pack that holds the high ground beyond the great pass dock has seen them at a place called stonelikeariver where they camp in great numbers grinner too has seen something of them his pack holds the ground from this side of the pass to the heights over twin fords my pack runs in the west from grinners boundary to a place over tireni scarp beyond that lies the territory of a dangerous old bitchwolf shes a common wolf yet uncommon fiercer than a dog much leader of a fine pack aye but we hold each other in mutual respect and confine ourselves to our own places this way there are no disputes skirmishes the grey brotherhood is a brotherhood or a sisterhood nathan smiled she is a rarity nathans levity had been brief but you yourself have not seen these eastern wamphyri talk to dock and grinner isnt it enough that they have seen them nathan nodded of course and i may tell you this the invasion of these creatures isnt unexpected its the reason i brought strange weapons out of a strange land with which to fight them if youll work with me and the szgany the grey brothers would act as observers and the szgany as fighters that would be invaluable i guarantee our assistance youve had problems have not stated as much wratha and the others eat wolfhearts kidneys and cubs basted in their mothers milk would you not call that problematic its why my brothers and i have split the great pack three ways we were a horde on the mountain slopes too easy to trap they chased us over cliffs they brought down avalanches upon us they used cubs for lures and knew that their mothers would follow to their doom they are a plague they always were in the old times too i wasnt here then nor was i but the szgany have legends men live a long time if theyre lucky and they keep records nathan frowned but nestor has hunted you you say nestor himself i cannot truly say but the others all of them or if not them then their thralls what odds nestor is one of them and as for him there are worse things than the hunting of the grey brothers members of my pack have seen him where he digs among the relics of his own kind to i know nathan cut in i know what nestor does i know what he is a necromancer i heard it from the old lidesci nestor cant help himself as for his hunting he has even hunted me he caught me too for a little while which is why youve been away yes locked away a prisoner in a strange place finally i escaped unharmed but nathan could only shrug and repeat nestor isnt responsible he cant help himself of course not hes wamphyri that last was like an arrow in nathans heart and blaze had felt it go home i am sorry uncle me too and me then for a while nathan was silent mulling over all hed been told by blaze but eventually he asked what advice did your mother give you that time when you went to see her where her bones lie bleached she was the one who said we should spjit the pack blaze answered which was wise of her and weve been that way ever since well and it worked or a while thinned out we could hide that much more easily when the vampires came ahunting but now with the inlux of these newcomers from the east they will be the horde until they too are thinned out nathan nodded and already weve started grinner came back with some eagerness and nathan could almost see his bared fangs gleaming white salivating in the starlight i for one know that you have started i am in the mountains between twin fords and the pass i saw the wamphyri come like a cloud out of the last aerie heading west for settlement or sanctuary rock ah yes but they were a much more ragged cloud when they returned then blaze infected with his brothers excitement and i saw the fires of the battle thunder and firelights in the sky and noises like splitting rocks nathan smiled a thin cold smile oh yes they got the worst of it this time and every time from now on lets hope so contact me when you have news or difficulties and remember what i said as of now we work together keep watch on the movements of the wamphyri you are the eyes of the hawk and the szgany are its talons and what of you nathan in the scheme of things what will you be the warhawks beak i hope to be aye we will keep watch enough for now except i should warn you be careful how you use your deadspeak for nestor has it too with him its different the same and yet the opposite like the light of the moon and the light of the sun one is cold and the other is warm but nestor listens to the thoughts of the dead and eavesdrops on their conversations and on yours when you use deadspeak he could be listening even now indeed im sure he is nathan was at once alert his mind probing the deadspeak aether and in the north starside was that a presence an intelligence listening if so it kept a very low and a very suspicious profile nathan gave a grim nod til try to remember that he said but for now farewell then from dock far away the wag of an unseen tail stump and a far faint whispered keep safe uncle and aye from grinner who liked to keep things short with which they were gone but nathan was not alone and he knew it ii new contacts tried and an old contract denied misha too was fast asleep by now clinging to nathan automatically adjusting to his bodyshape as he lived in dreams that were much more than mere dreams which caused him to moan and mumble a little as he turned in his sleep brief glimpses of the mountain heights of a fleet moon tumbling on high and the throats of the grey brothers athrob with weird unearthly ululations their song of adoration for like all natural creatures of the night in any world they worshipped their silver mistress moon the howls faded away and were gone and nathan had been the only one to hear them or perhaps not the only one for his conversation with blaze dock grinner had been telepathic after all not deadspeak which is private sleeping nathan had had little or no control over eavesdroppers the teeming dead knew that he had returned of course and despite having no great faith in him or perhaps because of it and trusting his necromancer brother even less they had listened to his conversation with the wolves in morbid fascination much as a bird watches a snake but one among them at least was vociferous nathan knew his voice of old why he even remembered a name jasef karis but not where he remembered it from some old dream out of the past jasef karis yes but a mere name did not give him rank or authority in such matters perhaps one day nathan would go to him personally if the rest of the szgany dead would let him for of all sunsides great majority jasef had always seemed to be on his side invariably to the consternation of his colleagues and so quietly not daring to speak or even think too clearly it was the necroscopes turn to eavesdrop and once again if misha had been awake she would have sensed her husband listening to something in fact to the furtive whispers of the dead back again doesnt sunsidestarside have enough of monsters bah you make me want to be sick the jot of you why for all that hes a youth and human the thyre revere him you have heard them their elders gone from them as we are gone from ours the way they speak of him nathans a hero to the dead of the thyre and to their living does it take unmen of the furnace deserts to recognize the saviour in our midst for believe me this one will be the saving of the szgany if youll let him how can you lie there and ignore him when your very children among the living are at risk he is your one hope the continuity of the szgany and the guardian of your graves those of you that have them nathan understood the last few words well enough since time immemorial the szgany had burned most of their dead certainly those killed by the wamphyri it was the only safe way but if a man or woman died in an accident or of sickness or old age or if they were revered among their people and it was deemed safe then they might be given a decent burial some tribes even had their own places of interment mounds tumuli or cavern systems unmarked graves out in the forests must be numerous and nathan wondered if jasef karis had his own place somewhere out there it seemed likely for where a majority of these dead voices were literally thin as air some were louder and even substantial the more recently dead more focused more together with their mortal remains and jasef although his was the voice of an old man was of the latter as for the more freshly dead such as those killed in the fighting at sanctuary rock as yet theyd be confused and unacquainted with their new dark incorporeal environment and so unable to speak out nathan hoped to have friends among them eventually when the truth of their situation had sunk in but for now he could only suffer the alienation of the great majority and suffer in silence covertly if he wished to listen to their conversations so much for the thyre one dead voice was saying now with an irritating air of assumed authority as false as his ingratiating tone we knew the desert folk all our lives yet did not know of their mentalism they kept that from us and doubtless other secrets too for what good reason so that we would continue to believe that they were ignorant desert trogs well and what is it theyve been hiding out there in the furnace deserts all this time eh and in how many other ways do they make fools of us answer me this why should we put our faith in the opinions of such deceivers as the thyre and if this nathan is a hero to them then be sure its to their benefit not ours and now it was jasefs turn again benefits you talk of benefits man were dead we derive no benefits the only ones who can win out of nathan championing them are the living your sons and their sons who gives a damn that the thyre are secretive and who cares what theyve got in their deserts theyre a race apart like the shambling trogs in their starside caverns and did you envy them their existence too well i say enough of this if nathan kijdu comes to me looking for answers for one shall supply them what why his mother cared for me all my days the last of my days anyway more care than i ever knew before what was in nona kiklu is in her son the lads a good un that is my opinion now the apparent spokesman for the dead his voice trembling in fury and perhaps something of fear too ware jasef karis or earn yourself the detestation of the great majority throughout the length and breadth of sunside do not defy us in this us but i hear only one voice yours and what of the rest of the dead or is it that youre all truly dead in your minds as well as your bodies and what will you do shun me if i speak to him damn me but that will hurt i cradled nathan kiklu as a child would you have me turn from him now but he talks to wolves jasef and they use deadspeak too for we can hear them what manner of a man may converse with a wolf and what manner of a wolf for that matter a man with the same blood jasef snapped his father was the necroscope and their father was the necroscopes son the dweller what could be more natural than that dont your nephews and nieces talk to each other wouldnt they talk to you if they could the selfappointed spokesman was on him in a flash werewolves he talks to werewolves the dweller their father was a vampire everyone the living and the dead alike knows it why those wolves are the dwellers bloodsons what and will you tell us theyre not vampires too and what about tomorrow wamphyri aye but now jasef was silent for the spokesman had found the weak spot in his argument or one of them at least and a second one was just around the corner whats more and far more to the point the spokesman continued sensing that the argument was won nathans brother is most certainly wamphyri and a necromancer to boot so what are we left with weve listened to your arguments jasef all the points in favour so be so good as to hear ours the points against one nathan has lived among the lying thyre and has doubtless learned their sneaky ways two he has even lived with the wamphyri and come through it unscathed three he came out of the cast on a vampire flyer and like the fools they are our living descendants accepted him back among them four his brother is a vampire lord and his nephews are werewolves five his wamphyri masters have followed him out of the east and now ravage on sunside among our children and is that last a coincidence i think not this nathan is the harbinger of doom silence from jasef but a thoughtful one and now the tremulous one again we cant take the risk we darent chance talking to him he will know us our whereabouts graves caskets and urns his brother is a necromancer well have to leave it at that for now later perhaps if it is seen that and so its decided the spokesman cut in with something of satisfaction jasef you will not talk to this nathan kiklu on penalty of on penalty of nothing jasef spat for now at last i know you you know me but the spokesman for the great majority didnt sound nearly so sure of himself now yet still he blustered what can you mean in what way do you know me and a sharp edge in jasef kariss voice as he answered i know you aye for i recognize your voice even as i knew it in life all those years ago arlek nunescu but i i a coward and a traitor in life and the same in death or so it seems whereve you been hiding arlek you arlek nunescu who would have sold his leader to shaithis of the wamphyri a lie the others deadspeak shout of denial the old fool lies old fool possibly so a good many folk believed anyway but a liar never and youre the one who would have sold lardis lidesci himself to shaithis i cannot be mistaken for the source by brian lumley roc books i was there cowardly wrongheaded powermad arlek nunescu i remember now you wanted lardis out of the way so you could lead the tribe and be a wamphyri supplicant whats more i saw how the lidesci dealt with your treachery but at least he put you out of your misery before tossing you on to the cleansing fire its not true arlek choked sobbed but it is and as you were a coward in life so youre a coward in death and would you still be a wamphyri supplicant arlek do you still give in so easily or is it that youd pay lardis back even after all this time would you see him destroyed and all the szgany with him because you were destroyed for your treachery and as arlek continued to sob so the tremulous one but not so tremulous now wanted to know how pay him back by keeping from us the only man who can save our children jasef thundered despite that he was less than a sigh by denying us access to the necroscope nathan nathan could hold himself back no longer jasef i thank you he spoke up and felt shockwaves ripple through the ranks of the dead i dont know you but i feel that i should just as soon as i get a chance ill come and introduce myself properly whatever it is you would tell me can keep till then by which time the dead may have learned to trust me some of us trust you now son a hitherto unheard voice spoke up but uncertain of itself unused to its circumstances those of us who were who were killed in the fighting its just that its taken a while to sink in thats all our situation i mean but we know that if youd been on hand a little earlier a few more of us might still be alive these others these what old timers theyve forgotten what they had in life and have come to accept what they have in death thats why theyre scared in case they lose that too but us recent ones we feel weve nothing left to lose well except contact with whats been left behind we certainly dont want to jose that and that why thats you nathan and from some little distance away but strong in the deadspeak aether as theyd always been in life aye and there are others nathan men who amounted to something wholl put their faith in you if youre good enough for wily old lardis lidesci then youre good enough for us for without you why who would there be to keep us up to date on the doings of andrei eh we dont know about these others but give us a chance to stay in touch with the living well take it whatever the cost it was the dead romani brothers ion and franci speaking to nathan from their cavetomb near settlement wed have spoken up earlier except what we heard made us sick but since youve now seen fit to talk to this rabble and make your presence known and answer their socalled charges well it seems only right that we should get a word in too were the romanis or we were and were with you by now the dead were in a tumult split into two camps by the various pressures within them even the ghosts of starside trogs joined in who in certain ways were more akin to men than the desertdwelling thyre a phlegmy grunt and a thousand sunups gone this nathans father and his brother the dweller called us up out of our cavern niches to fight for them our joints were made supple again and pur skin caused to bend without cracking but still there was a pain in it unlike the pain of living and a horror worse than the blackest nightmare i for one dont wish to know this nathan for to know his father was to love him and to love the necroscope was to do his bidding now im done with walking breathing and all such now im satisfied to cling to the earth and stiffen to a stone and dream my fading dreams but another trog voice had it that tells only the least of it a great many of us answered the necroscopes call and willingly what but wed been slaves to the wamphyri from teat to tomb and they had treated us cruelly they sent us against the dweller in his garden who could have punished us severely but he said stay with me and earn my protection then when the wamphyri came and we were dead when harry dwellersire and his changeling son said come up out of the earth and fight them that killed you you could not have held us back not only for the love of the necroscope and his son but for our pride our souls then there was pain aye but myself i say the pain was as nothing i would do it again today now the szgany call us unmen but when the necroscope called us up out of the earth to fight the wamphyri then we were men you trogs are men sure enough certainly you fought like men that time we had a common enemy the wamphyri and leaders in common too harry keogh and his changeling son now theres nathan another son of the necroscope whose enemy is the same as before well said nathan still dreaming thats true as far as it goes but this time its not just the wamphyri men have come out of a strange land into sunsidestarside some of whom are monsters no less than the vampire lords no not in their shape or form but in their minds ive been to that world of theirs and returned with some of their weapons though hardly sufficient to give me the upper hand and so my task is doubly difficult to clear our world of the wamphyri once and for all and to right certain wrongs done in another world and so make both places safer for our children now if theres that in my motives which you find questionable by all means continue to deny me access to the knowledge gone down into the earth with you but if you find justice in my actions then be my friends except i promise you this that whatever my father or the dweller did in the past and whatever my brother does now i shall never call you up out of the earth if ever you come to me it will be because you want to again a tumult of incorporeal voices most of them thin as air and far less substantial crowded into the void which nathans deadspeak had left behind but rising above the rest and filled with a new authority the tremulous one some chief or elder of forgotten times made himself heard nathan you have touched us it is one of the reasons we would have nothing to do with you because we knew we would be touched for you never knew the necroscope harry keogh despite that he sired you but we knew him and i can tell you this in the end he wasnt all warmth and light but you are warm and you are light a blanket on a cold night a candle in the darkness now leave us be for weve much to consider nathan like his father before him would never be one to defy the dead obediently he withdrew and the void behind him filled with fading deadspeak whispers time passed and nathan fell into a deep dreamless sleep this wasnt unusual he rarely dreamed in the true sense of the word but rather used the time to explore the problems of his waking hours and to listen to the whispers of the dead but not on this occasion for this was a sleep of exhaustion his numbers vortex shield was down a mere wisp or curl of ciphers as opposed to the accustomed whirlwind of esoteric formulae his mind was empty of deliberate thoughts and therefore receptive as a sponge he slept in the arms of his love like a dead man drawing strength from what food hed had at his mothers table and from the loving warmth of mishas body and being but along with the warmth was a cold too and while the former was an entirely natural thing the latter was something other a metaphysical cold a chill not only of the mind but of the soul or of soullessness telepathy of a sort yes and yet different not deadspeak which is the art of the necroscope but something in between a horror certainly but as much horrified as horrifying a creeping cold oozing in nathans subconscious awareness as pus in a running sore as if to cleanse itself by contact with the pure a malignancy which yet recognized its own nature and knew nathans as its opposite but remembered however vaguely remotely inaccurately a time or phase or circumstance other than the nightmare of now a place in the unknown past when things had been different and remembering it knew his mind so that however empty the feel of his mind galvanized activity in the all but erased echoing caverns of its own until yearning to fill the emptiness finally it she must know nathaaan a whisper at first a question uncertainty and again nathans attitude of listening of subconscious concentration rapt attention nathaaan he felt her probe knew her identity recognized the mutation that had occurred the nightmare metamorphosis knew too that he should not answer her should indeed shun her deny her the right to invade his thoughts but at the same time he knew the complications of her condition above and beyond which he of all people was aware of the curse of ostracism the desperate loneliness of the outsider of course because for a large part of his life nathan had been just such an outsider siggi siggi dam nathaaan ah no she snatched at him clung to him at once with a fierce energy not merely a vampire nathaaan wamphyyyri the cold was there the terrible burning cold of her condition which was in fact an alien heat for out in the spaces between the stars even a dead sun is hot and in the aching cold of undeath the heat of the blood is a roaring furnace siggi he said siggi im sorry why innocence in a vampire no not innocence but the lack of knowledge for her mind was as empty as his had been just a few moments ago except his had been the emptiness of exhaustion while hers was that of deprivation she had been deprived of her past fiercely eager she grasped upon that at once nathan do you know like deadspeak telepathy often conveys more than is said and yes nathan knew but how to explain it there are different kinds of vampire siggi he finally told her and i dont know which is the worst the one that got you the first one that got you in a place called perchorsk was a machine but without the men who built and used it the machine itself would be nothing i dont understaaand your your mind was sucked dry he could only tell it the way it was and you were thrown out of your own world into this one you survived except you survived in the worst possible way you are wamphyri perhaps something of it had come back to her partial recognition at least of the crawling horror of her existence washed over him and nathan felt siggis shudders of loathing and of ecstasy both racking him filling him with their freezing fire until a machine aye she finally said a vampire but the men who used it were worse then another thrill of horror as she added they stiji are nathan knew what she meant theyre here yes they have come for meeeee no he shook his head i should think the last person or the last aerie by brian lumley roc books thing turkur tzonov desires to see is you siggi you have no reason to fear him now he is only only a man and now she was the one to see his meaning and i am wamphyri yes canker will protect me when he is done with serenading the moon but until then im alone i am alone nathaaan for this place is not my place except with you out there i am not alone wrong you should fear me siggi as i must learn to fear you but we were friends you dont remember any of it no yes no perhaps did you love me in his sleep nathan smiled a sad smile no yes no perhaps he remembered something zek foener had once told him about his mother and harry keogh and like an echo out of the past forces beyond our control threw us together but yes we were friends however briefly then we still are for in this place i have no friends only food and theres no pleasure in food that screams with which the ice was back on nathans spine cold ice this time as he was reminded of who or what he was talking to and he knew who or what he should not be talking to friends then he answered even though it was a lie for as long as it lasts and finally now i rememmmbenr she said with some animation some excitement you escaped and i helped you yes he could only agree now i would escape from canker run from canker ah no for he loves me not from canker no but from this place this world which is not my world back to my memories anyway you cant kill him no man may kill the doglord no for hes the strong one nathaaan he adores me but i fear his strength i ear his ways and i must flee him out of here back to my memories confused she contradicted herself nathan was sad for her mad at himself hateful of turkur tzonov but he must try to make her understand siggi all of that is beyond you now theres no returning you are what you are men will not accept you you accepted me upon a time you were a beautiful woman i was a man you were innocent and afterwards your thoughts were warm you did not think of me as a sucking thing but now i am a sucking thing with which he knew that she was mad that the mazy corridors of siggis mind werent merely empty but bereft fear was the cause and fear the spur which prompted her to seek an out now but of what was she afraid he sensed nothing of fear for canker and as for her present circumstances they were all she had of memory she saw the question in his mind and answered he he has come for meeeee turkur and he saw from the way she cringed that he was right but youve nothing to fear from him not now not when canker is your protector canker nathans words had been like an invocation spawning an image and more than an image in her mind the moon music fades the doglord returns he must not find me speaking to another you shall be my secret and we shall be friends yes if theres a way take care nathaaan you too siggi and she was gone how very odd how very peculiar how very talented you are nathan said a deep dark gurgling deadspeak voice from the depths of his sleeping mind bubbling and festering there like a sucking swamp dont you find it odd my son that while i am able to eavesdrop on your conversations with things dead as i am dead your conversations with the jiving are quite beyond my range oh i hear what you have to say to them for despite that they are alive the thoughts that accompany your words are deadspeak youre the necroscope after all but i cannot hear their answers no for they exist in a different world now or rather i do peculiar aye and painful too that i who was once so very much a part of your world alive alive or undead at worst should now find myself excluded entirely from that oh so agreeable estate but death comes to all of us i suppose given time even a man such as i must stiffen to a stone and undeath turn to the true death except as you and i well know death is not always the end or it doesnt have to be eh nathan and when there are wrongs to be put to rights what then are we so different my son you who would avenge the deaths of so many szgany and i who would avenge my own you who would rid your world of all of the wamphyri forever and i who desire to destroy just two of them only call me up i shall be your most powerful ally and when its over ill go down again just a mound of bones in a refuse pit in madmanse in turgosheim just think of the benefits to fight fire with fear and destroy with a glance for you have my word nathan when eygor walks again called up by the necroscope yours shall be the power and none shall stand against my killing eye which i shall gift to you from the first word nathan had known who it was the only one it could be with his ghastly gurgling suggestive insinuating inveigling and very nearly hypnotic voice powerfully talented in death even as hed been in life eygor killglance of the wamphyri an exvampire lord reached out with his deadspeak across all the miles from turgosheim to offer again his terms as once before hed offered them in maglores promontory aerie runemanse because nathan was deeply asleep his mind was receptive if not to eygors unthinkable suggestions certainly to his insidious probe his evil presence and triggered by the others voice pictures were conjured to the mirror of nathans memory from another time a different dream of a nightmare thing in its madmanse pit it leaned or slumped against the wall like some strange stalagmite formation much like the creatures in the cave at the radujevac gate without their sheaths of glazed dripstone but its shape was much too irregular and its texture darker than the salty nitrestreaked natural stone wall it was that monstrous amalgam eygor killglance and even as the picture registered on the screen of nathans mind as his feverish gaze once more took in the things gigantic size freakish proportions and the grotesque almost enquiring angle of its head fused like a melted candle to the wall so the eyes in that head began to crack open and as before nathan could well understand and believe their power to kill at that nathan would have snatched himself awake but the hypnotic strength of eygors deadspeak his awesome mentalism was such as to paralyse and hold him rooted like a man on the edge of sleep who knows he should move but cannot not even to save his life and yet again as the clotted gurgle of eygors mind spanned all the miles between so the monster pleaded his position pressed his case and proposed his potentially lethal contract yes nathan my killing eye it can be yours do you remember in turgosheim how we discussed it ah you think you dont need me now nathan but you will just think the power of your mind the mind of the necroscope coupled to the seething searing energy of my eyes even the wamphyri would shrink to a stench would be blasted to shreds in the cleansing beams of your gaze cleansing nathan found his voice at last if not the strength of will to wake himself up your gaze cleansing as acid cleans maybe except it would sear my mind too no no no not my gaze yours and you would be using it only for well for good yes cant you see the wonderful irony in it isnt it what you want to destroy the wamphyri oh yes but not if i must make a monster of myself just look what your talent has done to you just see whats become of your eyes and flinching nathan looked again at that mindpicture of eygor killglance as hed seen him before let his gaze crawl slowly over all eighteen or more feet of that monstrous mummified anomaly of fused bone black corrugated flesh knobs of gristly cartilage and massive plates of bluegleaming chitin like the armour of insects but insects grown to tanks in the armouries of the notsoalien world beyond the starside gate anthropomorphic certainly which was all that could be said of eygors relationship to humanity for while men may have a similar shape they do not have additional mouths in various places but quite apart from the diseased overall design of this monster the most terrible thing was the knowledge that it was eygors own design this was how towards the end the loathsome thing in the pit had shaped himself those horny fossiled feet and shrivelled leathery thighs those withered arms that terminated in talons the arched back and those jutting shoulders and the misshapen screaming skull thrown back and fused to the wall by nitre jaws frozen in some everlasting rictus oh hed not wanted this desiccation this gradual deterioration this death never that but the rest of it was the very essence of eygor and finally those eyes now fully open exactly as the necroscope remembered them from a previous dream and remembering he heard again eygors words just as then indeed as eygor repeated them now only see how i cry nathan because my sons blinded me because my eyes are blind and white ah but upon a time the right one was filled with blood see and at once the right eye of the gargoyle dripped scarlet while the left was full of pus and now the left one turned yellow and swollen like a boil about to burst and nathan knew that if it did and the poison splashed him then hed be infected heir to the monsters powers and only call me up so that i may take revenge on my bastard bloodsons eygor begged him and the power can be yours as easily as that do it nathan do it now eygor was there in nathans head frantically seeking out the metaphysical mechanism the necroscopes esoteric art the power to cancel death and return him to undeath call me up nathan could do it he could call the dead this monster himself up out of the earth out of death and for the very first time he actually knew he could do it twice in the past he had done it but without knowing or perhaps on those occasions they had come of their own accord out of their love for him but this one did not love anyone or thing and so must be brought up by nathans art he must be brought up the massive weight of eygors mentalism his hypnotism his terrible eyes nathan tossed in his fever his mind burned in the depths of his mortal soul a darkness seethed but no no nathan it was as if with that cool but urgent thought a scented breeze a mental fragrance a waft of fresh air blew across his burning brain bearing away the stench of the thing in its madmanse pit in turgosheim and no came the thought again but sighing its relief now as the danger receded as nathan unfroze drove eygor out and the monsters raging voice echoed into a distant denial a sobbing curse a fading chittering hissss then he was gone and the timely intruder spoke again however severely nathan ah and didnt i warn you upon a time beware what you would call up to a semblance of life lest some things may prove harder to put down rogei thank god for you for it was rogei of the thyre of course that dead old man in the cavern of the ancients the first of the dead to recognize nathan and speak to him openly even to the extent of saving his life twice in fact then and now nathans thoughts were deadspeak and in answer the shake of an incorporeal head rogeis denial no the first time it was your life this time your soul possibly but did i hear you offer thanks to a god didnt your god die at the time of the white sun so you told me at least nathan was still shuddering from his encounter with eygor he didnt want to go into that now that the god he had called upon was an alien god and the phrase a frequent and frequently empty benediction from an alien world the thyre were far less familiar with their god but still maybe rogei would understand if he said perhaps i meant him who listens if that is permissible certainly for he listens to everyone and everywhere so maybe the wise old rogei had heard the necroscopes thoughts about an alien world after all as nathans nerves settled down he changed the subject why did you seek me out not that i dont appreciate it because i was concerned for long and long ever since the time you left us i searched for you with my deadspeak i knew that you were that you lived but it has grown to be a habit now that you are back despite that its unseemly still i search except perhaps its no longer unseemly for we all would know how you fare but all of that is a feeble excuse i had no right invaded your privacy forgive me forgive you rogei continue to seek me out and promise me that you will please do as you will nathaoan nathan yes nathan he started massively as he felt a hand on his shoulder tugging insistently who he sat up sprang upright from the waist in a tumble of furs and it was misha and he was drenched in sweat and she was wet too wet worried and hugeeyed where she stood beside their bed you were nightmaring she told him breathlessly but i was so tired i took a long time to wake up by then youd calmed down i got up heard sounds in the rock came to wake you nathan heard sounds too a stirring in the guts of sanctuary rock movement and an echoing voice that cried gather up your things whatever you will take with you were to move out within the hour lardiss orders so gather up your stuff for were on the move and from the far corners of the labyrinth other voices faintly echoing but crying the same sad message gather up your things your things things were moving out moving out out the szgany lidesci would be travellers again ill the return of vasagil the death of nana kiklu in wrathstack strange forces were in motion the doglord canker canison had blocked passageways leading up from mangemanse into nestor lichloathes suckscar and in suckscar nestors favourite flyer had apparently gone mad reduced to rubble the cartilage walls of its pen destroyed a launchingbays safety barrier and launched of its own accord all of this before the warriorlord vormulac unsleeps observation posts were in place so that the escaped flyer had gone undetected unmolested as it fled southwest by south for sunside also in suckscar nestors morbid mood was grown out of all proportion as if to encompass his entire manse and despite that wrathstack must soon come under siege there was an unaccustomed air of inactivity about suckscar a nameless sense of futility a breathless creeping expectancy with nestor himself a gaunt grey ghost listlessly issuing orders that carried little of their former authority neither weight of will nor terror of lord lichloathes necromancy for much like the master himself his lieutenants and thralls moved as if stricken with the same weird malaise on the other hand down below in the shadowy levels of guilesump gorvi the guile was anything but listless indeed his basement manse was witness to a frenzy of industry hitherto unknown complaining warriors were hauled prematurely from their vats cauldrons of urine and wastes were set above the many corbelchutes over the entrances spiked grilles were fitted to windows and bays and groundbased warriors stationed in the screecanyon gantlets where gorvi ordered them to hide and wait in ambush likewise in wran and spiros madmanse except here too a noticeable difference for the killglance brothers no longer worked in unison wrans forces defended the northand southeastern half of madmanse and spiros the western half and if it were not for the fact that at last vormulac had come out of the east then possibly theyd be at each others throats even now it had much to do with spiros killing eye the fact that he had it while wran did not for wran had always enjoyed playing big brother and spiro wasnt about to let him lord it any longer they were equals or they were nothing except they couldnt be equals for wran considered himself superior and spiro felt slighted for he was the one who had inherited his fathers killing eye from spiros point of view wran should now consider himself a junior partner for the boot was on the other foot and from wrans he remembered old eygor the way his cruelty had grown apace with his power and already spiro was full of a new confidence so that while wran was apprehensive about the fighting to come his brother seemed to welcome even to invite it naturally for it would give him the chance to exercise his heartbursting glance his killing eye ah but when the fighting was done however it went what then would history repeat itself wran wondered not if he could help it for hed felt the lash of his fathers glance once too often the first time he felt his brothers would be the last for spiro but it might not even come to that or it might come sooner than that and from now on spiro must never turn his back on wran the rage so much for madmanse while in wrathspire only the lady wratha remained unchanged only wratha the risen risen highest of them all was her own person and that was just as well for she had a war to plan and a war that she dared not lose indeed losing was an outcome she wouldnt even consider for then she knew what must next be considered and she remembered how nestors lovethrall glina had puffed into fire and smouldered in the seethe of the sun she had been a comparative newcomer but wratha even her bones would calcine in the suns blast and all her liquids steam away in a trice then wratha shuddered aye even wratha for she knew how vormulac would deal with her even as he had dealt with others before her lord unsleeps sigil said it all a hanging man or what remained of one a tarry skeleton wrapped in chains with rotting black flesh sliding from its bones but she must not dwell on that there was a war to plan the others would be waiting for her call to learn wrathas strategy or lack of one she felt momentary anger with herself that shed allowed her thoughts to stray when there was so much to do but these were strange times as well as dangerous ones and it took fortitude simply to stand up straight and bear the weight of things or did she mean the weight of years suddenly the lady knew how long she had lived and at once felt the angrysquirming of her leech a long time since that had happened it served to remind her and only just in time that she was wamphyri cunning tenacity longevity wamphyyyri what how long she had lived she was not old but young a mere girl and while there was blood she would always be young her leech settled down again and began pumping its vampire essence into her veins its host was strong it had nothing to fear the long red years stretched out before both of them and yet even as the lady began to make her plans still she found herself listening to the stack it sounded or felt all wrong her telepathic probe went out from her feeling feeling gorvi was a coward he sweated to block himself in without realizing that he also blocked his escape routes wran and spiros thoughts were hateful of each other as much as their enemies all previous slander to the contrary however the brothers were not mad except as berserks but as for the doglord in mangemanse canker and his infernal moon music that same simple szgany tune played over and over louder and ever louder on his instrument of bones oh he was mad and growing madder by the minute that clout he had taken seemed to have been the last straw to break a shads back or his brain and finally there was nestor but from neighbouring suckscars no longer handsome indeed scarcely visible young lord lichloathe behind his mummy or cerecloth wrappings only an echoing mental silence like a sullen veil over his thoughts a cloud of gloom that had nothing to do with the coming war perhaps it was his necromancy which gave him that doomful air but certainly the change in him was like night into day and for a single moment wratha felt some strange emotion or poignancy deep inside which she could not fathom regret perhaps that he was not the man shed thought him but of course he wasnt he was only a boy and as for his misha on sunside how quickly things could change wratha couldnt give a damn for this misha now nor for the lidescis as a whole time to rekindle that fire later if there should be a later when this rabble out of turgosheim had been dealt with except it would never be dealt with not if she failed to hold her war council enough she sent her familiar bats winging to call the others up into wrathspire travellers again it had been a while almost seventeen years in fact since lardis lidesci last sent his people out into the forest trails from settlement then it had been a precautionary meas ure the wamphyri under shaitan the unborn had returned out of the icelands and there had been danger but they never had raided on settlement not at that time anyway and while the szgany lidesci had scattered into the woods lardis and a small party of his senior men had gone to hold a war conference with harry keogh his son the dweller and the lady karen in a place called the garden but they had arrived at the garden too late karen and the necroscope were already at war and the dweller and his pack were only wolves but at least lardis andrei romani and a small handful of others had been there to see the end of it the brilliant flash of white light in the vicinity of the starside gate the mighty thunderclap that shook the mountains to their roots the weird lightnings and the roiling writhing mushroomcloud that spilled its hot red and yellow guts as it rose nodding to the sky and then the warm winds blowing through the passes out of starside bringing a creeping sickness and in some cases death a small price to pay in the end and it had signalled the end certainly of the wamphyri for they had been there the last of the vampire lords dead centre in the fireball when it blazed into life shaitan the unborn and shaithis his descendant survivors out of the icelands but survivors no more they and all of theirs had gone up in the sound and the fury until nothing was left of them alas or perhaps not harry and karen and the dweller too had gone with them and for fourteen joyous years the wamphyri were no more until wratha and her renegades had come raiding out of the east all of which was a story lardis had repeated yet again in the night to nathan and his helllander companions and to anyone else who would listen as the szgany lidesci trekked by the light of the stars along an old forest trail heading south and a little east from forsaken sanctuary rock and you were four then lardis told nathan after a long silence you and nestor my jason was somewhat younger and misha zanesti too you probably dont remember you should ask your mother i had split the tribe into small parties sent them out into the woods nana had an ablebodied man with her her sons that is you and nestor and old jasef karis the seer but it was the end of jasef that trip he was old and hed grown too soft in settlement in nanas care jasef karis and nathans dream came flooding back lardis he said in such a startled tone that the old lidesci at once drew to a halt as nathan grasped his arm if i tell you a name eh a name what name arlek nunescu hah and where did you hear that name i wonder arlek nunescu was a traitor he would have sold me us all of us to lord shaithis of the wamphyri but myself and jazz simmons we caught him out well in those days there was only one sort of justice rough arlek paid the price in full so what of him nothing nathan shook his head but it confirmed that his dream had been real all the same and this jasef karis he was in my mothers care you say aye jasef the old thoughtthief a seer and a mentalist he was perhaps there was something of the wamphyri in him but much watered down he died on the morning of the hellfires at the starside gate so why all these inquiries eh too much to explain now nathan told him and too many of lardiss men about who mightnt care to be reminded of nathans other talent that he talked to dead people even in his sleep not so bad that he could well go places in a single instant of time no for that was all to the good any fool could see the usefulness of that but this other thing he did was something else lardis looked at him in the forest gloom through wise old eyes well used to penetrating the sunside night and possi bly nathan thought something of the intricacies of a mans mind too but after a moment the old lidesci nodded albeit with a frown and said very well later perhaps where is my mother now nathan asked i think i might like to speak to her towards the rear of the column with misha and a bunch of the old uns lardis jerked a thumb over his shoulder i gave em a handful of good strong lads to haul their travois and such and nathan said ill catch up later then and stepped to one side letting the column pass him by then as the long line of travellers moved past him he stood with his back to a tree and tried to order his thoughts easier said than done for there was a lot on his mind weapons for one thing nathan seemed to have lost one of the special crossbows somewhere or other with all the action hed been engaged in that hardly surprised him it might turn up later as for the other five lardis and andrei had one each nathan had claimed another two more at least had been deposited somewhere along the trail from radujevac to sanctuary rock most probably in the cache of two bundles stashed in the boulder clump on the starside plain or perhaps in the bundle that he had hidden in the gorse atop the rock no cancel that last he couldnt remember any crossbows among that lot and since they hadnt been in the bundles from the cavern of the ancients they could only be out there on starsides boulder plains well and they could stay there with whatever other weapons had been in those temporarily abandoned bundles until morning even with his powers nathan wouldnt consider a mobiusjump into the immediate vicinity of a wounded warrior if the bundles had been out in the open maybe it would be worth a quick visit and snatch but not if it meant scrambling among the rocks for them then there was the rocketlauncher that had gone over the edge of the rock with him that must be written off shattered into bits without a doubt when it struck bottom which left one other launcher also in the boulder plains cache and atop the rock fragmentation grenades a lightweight flamethrower a machinepistol and ammo they too would have to wait at least till the moon was up nathan scarcely fancied stumbling about up there in the starlight he had seen what personal arms his party of helllanders carried john carling had a selfloading rifle the other cavers had machinepistols likewise trask chung and anna marie and most of them were now equipped with fragmentation grenades stuffed in their pockets lardis had also reequipped himself with grenades but no one else had been allowed to touch them the rest of the old lidescis senior men could wait until morning when nathan or one of the ebranch people might find the time to do a little rudimentary weapontraining but not much not while more than half of nathans arsenal was scattered in difficult or dangerous places in the shadow of his tree nathan gave a sharp nod that was as much planning as he could do for now either wait for full moonlight or sunup and then at his best opportunity recover the arms and in so doing make the szgany lidesci strong as never before but for how long the ammunition wasnt going to last forever by the time it came down to the real thing hopefully the two warring wamphyri factions would have already taken the best part of the job out of his hands that was about as much as he could hope for but at the same time nathan did have something of a plan albeit a dangerous one which might speed his task up somewhat some three and a half years ago hed accompanied lardis on what had then been an annual pilgrimage to the last aerie when hed visited not only karenstack but also seen the tumbled fireblackened remains of all the other aeries of the old wamphyri and seeing those fallen giants it had been easy to see what had brought them down explosions in the gasbeast pens and methane chambers and of course lardis had verified it often enough that the necroscope harry keogh had somehow sent the rays of the sun blasting in through windows bays and every crack and crevice into the heart of each stack in turn until theyd exploded in their lower levels like so many bombs well nathan held no great sway over the sun but he knew there were more ways than one to cause explosions dimi petrescus explosive powder gunpowder in fact but of a poor quality mightnt have the power of the real stuff but it would certainly cause a flash and a bang as would a couple of fragmentation grenades for that matter deprive wratha of her base at best shed be killed and at worst forced into a fight with vormulac and the others out of turgosheim nathan must give it some thought and thinking as his ideas gradually took shape and form he watched the seemingly endless lidesci line go by they were in small parties or packets a few caravans a great many travois family groups couples singles lowtalking women longstriding men and hushed children all wary sharpeyed in the mercifully cloudless night trekking under the cover of trees that leaned protectively over the ancient track but yet able to see in finefiltered starlight and beasts muzzled shads and yelloweyed wolves not grey brothers as such but brothers to the travellers certainly all well spaced out humans beasts watchdogs so that in the event of an attack each group might break for cover independent of the others about a halfmile of them mostly silent guarding even their thoughts in the treacherous night wheels travois poles pots and pans all muffled minds muffled too generally fearful in a way yet paradoxically strong strong under lardis lidesci a survivor in his way no less than the wamphyri or even more so which was the subject of a conversation even now about to take place forward of the line where anna marie english had joined ben trask in the gap left by nathan survivors anna marie said under her breath striding out with trask and david chung some few paces apart from lardiss party only a moment or two earlier trask had been talking in lowered tones to the old lidesci asking him i various questions why were the lidescis trekking in the night wasnt it dangerous yes but better than waiting for wratha to gather together her forces and launch an allout attack for she now knew the location of sanctuary rock where were they going were there other places of sanctu ary in the woods to the south there was a leper colony at the edge of the woods where the forest met the savanna fringe that extended south some miles to the furnace desert proper south was away from the wamphyri and towards the sun also the vampire lords feared leprosy a disease their metamorphism found imposs ible to handle the colony wasnt guaranteed to keep them j away not by any means wratha probably wasnt even aware of the existence of the place but it had been a lucky place in the past and hopefully its luck would still be holding what would they do there they would make camp close to the colony dig in build makeshift defences at sunup still some thirty or more hours away lardis would give a briefing then there would be weapontraining and an apportioning of the necroscopes amazing arms and ammunition but since the lad was himself a weapon lardis must wait and see what he had in mind indeed for to know him was to be certain that something was brewing in there but at the same time lardiss optimism following the battle at the rock seemed to have dissipated somewhat despite the advantages of the necroscopes weapons from another world and his recentlyacquired powers still the future looked grim for lardis knew the worst of it now nathan had told him that indeed vormulac and a mighty army out of turgosheim were here and the bloodwar already commenced now it would be as it had been in the old days as warring vampire factions depleted each other so they would refurbish themselves upon the travellers wanton indiscriminate destruction of human life or if not its destruction its hideous alteration to suit the requirements of the wamphyri then a mood had come over lardis and hed paced apart for a while and his silent men had let him be trask too moving apart to where anna marie english had fallen in beside him and just a moment ago muttered her oneword comment survivors trask glanced sideways at the ecopath and was at once arrested by something odd something new that he couldnt quite put his finger on starlight seemed to suit her in the night she looked almost attractive and it was that simply that the spring in her step her newly awakened what oie de vivre that trask found strange for it seemed that indeed sunsidestarside suited her nor were his thoughts deliberately unkind rather they were truthful for it was the nature of her talent that she should not be attractive but reflect the aura of her surroundings she was an ecopath the ecopath after all her nature or unnature was the nature of her environment on earth she had felt each new ecological disaster as a hammerblow to her psyche even to her physical being and yet here who survivors trask asked her the lidescis oh they are her silhouette nodded for theyre human we are survivors yes our race as a whole but i was talking about the wamphyri in fact i was thinking out loud one word trask answered survivors but enough to give me the impression that you admire them thats your talent she smiled you saw the truth in what i said for of course i admire them i admire their form their vitality their tenacity at least trask glanced at lardis some little way away its a good job he cant understand everything were saying she shrugged if lardis understood it fully i think you would find hed agree their form as a lifeforce albeit a force for evil has been very successful indeed admirable come again but the real survivor is this world you said has been trask was fascinated he knew that her talent could not be put aside lightly the wamphyri have been successful now what are you getting at and what do you mean this world is a survivor because its young its strong she said unlike the earth our earth sunsidestarside hasnt yet been poisoned to its core it can fight back for oh a long time yet the planet can fight back exactly it can recover i feel it will recover trask frowned from what she looked at him as if in surprise from the white sun or the grey hole that gave the moon its wobble changed the planets orbit disastrously created the barrier mountains furnace deserts and frozen icelands recover from the great red waste suppurating away like some gigantic sore far to the east which i can feel even from here and recover from the wamphyri he saw that he was right she nodded and said even from them its just a feeling i have ben just a feeling f its my talent i feel that that even without our intervention theyre on the decline her voice was a sigh the spring in your step he inclined his head questioningly because you feel the years dropping away you think it somehow signals the decline of the wamphyri like maybe they overstepped natures welcome survivors no more she shrugged and was her bonedry brittle self again well maybe its not as dramatic as all that and of course i could be wrong perhaps im simply feeling the raw youth of the place i suppose well just have to wait and see what but what he gasped as the night back along the trail was split by a flash of light and a sharp crack definitely an explosive bolt and the sound of panicked screaming came clear on the still night air what the hell trask had an electric torch using it to light the trail he went stumbling back the way theyd walked nathan was back there somewhere it could only have been him using his crossbow but on what he and she had witnessed the abortive battle at the rock and afterwards he had used superior mentalism to penetrate lardis lidescis triumphant and triumphantly open mind and so knew his thoughts that his people must now become travellers again then they had waited eventually they had seen the szgany lidesci leave their warren the direction in which they headed and by a circuitous route had gone ahead to lie in ambush and it had pleased him to know that he could achieve what wratha and the rest of her pack of dogs had failed to achieve to strike at the lidescis and feed on their good strong blood oh he had known whose blood he would prefer whose blood he must finally slake his vengeful burning thirst upon if only to satisfy a craving come into being some two and a half long years ago but that must wait on a more opportune time and for now be satisfied satisfied to take by stealth that which wratha and the others including wran the rage killglance which they had failed to take by force for he was that monstrous being called vasagi and his consort was the lady carmen whoshould notbe but who was and theirs was an errand of vengeance not against the szgany lidesci but wrathstack certain of whose inhabitants were shit in their eyes their mouths and their putrid hearts made yet more putrid by their loathing of them it was wran who was vasagis fixation his great hatred wran who had done his best or his worst to kill vasagi while paradoxically it was the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe who was the lady carmens paradoxically because it was nestor who had saved vasagis life that time in the sunside foothills but that was then and this was now and the dire privations of the years flown between had drawn these outcasts together in their common cause revenge for while lord vasagi and the lady carmen had suffered those others in wrathstack had lived life to the full without a thought for such as the oncesuck ruined in his body raped of his leech and pegged to a hillside as the sun came up and who had given a damn for carmen whom nestors grave errors of lust and gluttony had in the first instance elevated only so that he might later reduce her to a stain except she was not reduced but was carmen whoshouldnotbe and vasagi was vasagi so theyd waited on the woodland trail these two oh so long forgotten and oh so recently returned vasagi and carmen waited for the good strong blood which is the life and their sinister purpose was as much a matter of warped pride to do what wratha and the others had failed to do as for the rich red blood itself but it would be good that blood most certainly and sustain them while they saw j what was what and which way the wind blew and made their secret plans vasagi had waited on one side of the trail where the old track bottlenecked between closegrown stands of ironwoods on the other side in the utter dark of the trees carmen was as a statue carved of night and they had drawn down the shutters of their minds and reduced their movements even their heartbeats almost to nil their eyes were shuttered too shielding their telltale scarlet glow yet still they saw through the closed furry lids they breathed with the pores of their bodies but made no vampire mist lest their scent was in it they were not required to think or to probe each others thoughts for their plan was simple there was no need for repetition thus they were nearinvisible as one with the darkness of the woods it said a lot for vasagis metamorphic skill in which he was pastmaster and which hed taught to carmen they imitated the very night they were the forest and the writhing silvery ground mist they were the rich brown earth and damp swirling air they were not there the head of the column had passed them by then the silent shuffling column itself armed men had been present with every group or interspersed between groups guard wolves had come close sniffing in the trees but sniffing nothing for there was no szgany blood on vasagi and carmen not yet who had survived on the blood of trogs for long and long and finally the tailend of the column came into view a party of old ones mainly in the care of two women protected by three brawny but inexperienced youths and quite a gap between them and the party of mature armed men that had passed a short while earlier this final and most vulnerable group had fallen a little behind many of the old ones rode a creaking open cart hauled by a team of shads while assisted by the women the less fragile of the party walked or hobbled the youths grunted and sweated a good deal straining to drag heaped travois their crossbows dangled from their belts to vasagi and carmen whoshouldnotbe all of this looked very tempting very good too tempting too good and in unison without any command being given they came to life and it was as if the forest woke from a dream to a waking nightmare they vasagi and carmen were the nightmare the darkness under the trees on both sides of the trail pooled flowed into mobile swiftmoving stains formed a pair of redeyed fiends whose sinuous movements were fleet as wispy clouds against the stars rushing inwards upon the old ones nana and misha and the three young men the latter were the first because they had weapons and were young strong even as they sensed their danger cried warnings let go of travois poles and reached spastically for their crossbows so the vampire lord and lady fell upon them and it was slaughter pure and simple despite that vasagi and carmen wore no battle gauntlets they had formed their hands into talons with nails like sharpened chisels slicing her first target above his belt carmen cut the youth inches deep through his soft leather jacket and coarse shirt crying out trying to hold his guts in he fell gasping writhing to the ground and carmen kicked his weapon out of reach vasagi had meanwhile torn out the throat of a second youth so that his soontobe corpse sprayed red even as it vibrated in its death spasm and crumpled to the dark earth of the trail the third young man was backing stumblingly away slackjawed babbling he tried to load his weapon with fingers that shook like leaves in a gale but vasagi sent ah no directly into his mind flowed forward took the crossbow from him and tossed it aside quick as thought carmen joined him took the youths face into her hideous hands and breathed her essence into his gaping mouth as he collapsed paralysed with terror she caught him up and bore him away into the woods and vasagi sent after her drink deep and you my lord she answered flowing as darkness back into the dark woods with her prey and indeed he intended to but from which of these human vessels from whom all of this had taken but a moment many of the old ones looking the other way mumbling together or lolling sleepily on their cart werent even aware that anything was happening but nana and misha had seen for long wasted moments theyd clung together paralysed by the sheer shock of the attack but as vasagis scarlet eyes scanned and settled upon them so they were panicked into activity then screaming their loudest screaming not only their horror but an unmistakable warning they instinctively ran in different directions for they knew that the monster could not target both of them at once nana ran to one side skirted vasagi leapt nimbly forward along the trail misha threw herself under the cart and clung to the boards vasagi was undecided he could turn the cart over certainly it would be worth the effort aye for the girl was a beauty but so was the older woman and both of them full of rich red blood he made up his mind and pursued nana leaning forward and lowing in that sinuous gliding unnerving lope of the master vampire and breathing a mist and calling up a ground mist out of the shuddering earth he rapidly closed the gap between but at last in answer to nana and mishas piercing screams there sounded pounding footsteps the party of armed men was returning along the trail issuing from vasagis pores and from the earth alike his vampire mist was as good as any he ever made even as he caught at the fleeing womans hair jerking her to a halt and dragging her to her knees so his mist enveloped her clinging like damp cold sweat but coming the other way and almost colliding with vasagi where he snatched up the fainting woman into his arms an armed youth all wild and raggedlooking in his anxiety blueeyed and yellowhaired shinydamp with mist and the sweat of horror he gasped his shock and disbelief as he saw mother the youth cried snarling his hatred and swinging his weapon in vasagis direction but yet hesitating to pull the trigger if his crossbow had been of an orthodox kind he would have fired it certainly but vasagi wasnt aware of his good fortune dropping the woman and lashing out all in one smooth movement vasagi caught nathan a glancing blow but sufficient to send him flying and stooping over the fallen youth he glared into halfglazed startling blue eyes which at once snapped back into furious focus then vasagi reared back as the youths weaponhand and arm swung determinedly up from the earth to point his wetgleaming crossbow at him a second time only this time he fired it the bolt missed vasagi by a hairbreadth and went whirring off into the night ah but this one would never shoot at a lord of the wamphyri again be sure vasagi stooped to grasp the others throat fully intending to rip out the pups windpipe chords and flesh and adams apple all in a welter of spurting red only to release him in the next moment shocked rigid by a flash of light and shattering explosion from behind and somewhere overhead however momentarily the flash had lit the forest track with a dazzle of white fire leaving one of the lower branches of an ironwood splintered as if struck by lightning where nathans explosive bolt had shattered it some twenty feet above the ground and finally bending under its own weight with a tortured squeal of torn timber the weakened branch came crashing down the earth shook as the branch smashed down blocking the trail and beyond the dust and debris of its falling figures came running with flaring torches and sweeping beams of light like mirrored sunlight but in the dark of night it was all too much for vasagi snatching up the unconscious woman he left the trail and fled or flowed into the dark maze of the woods and followed carmens scent through the night but when he was well clear of the lidescis and when he came upon carmen waiting in a clearing where already shed com menced to slake her awful thirst at last it was time to take the edge off his own hunger of more than two long years for goatmeat and trogflesh will suffice when theres nothing else but theres no real substitute for the sweet red juice of humanity and carmen turning her scarletsmeared face away shuddering as the thing that was vasagi fed himself on the mercifully unfeeling figure the melting shape and finally the shrivelled corpse that was once nana kiklu the rending the grunting and slobbering the pinktinged steam that rose up from it misha witnessing the departure of carmen and vasagi had come out from under the cart and gone to nathan where he writhed on the misted trail clutching at his throat and choking the two youths who had pulled the travois were quite dead their colleague was missing as good as dead finally nathan could speak and croaked my mother he looked wildly all about through the clearing mist nana misha had no answer for him not even a shake of the head she knew that he wouldnt accept it even if she told him looking at her seeing the drained look on her face he got to his feet and automatically uselessly dusted himself down but in a little while stopped and reeled like a drunkard and nana he said again hopelessly suddenly there was no strength in him and he went to his knees crumpling to one side misha fell with him cradling his head with her breasts oh nathan my nathan nnnana it was a sob almost the wail of a lost child but in the next moment it was a choked outraged roar of sheerest rage madness motheeer nanaaaaa naaanaaaaaaa the party of armed men had arrived they saw the bloodied bodies guessed the rest and in a little while ben trask and david chung came running their torchbeams flashing and lardis lidesci not far behind cursing vividly nathan took mishas face tenderly in his hands unashamed tears washed his own gaunt visage as he begged her which way did you see his voice was the merest whisper she pointed into the woods then grasped his arm as his face twisted into a snarl and he seemed to lean that way as if tugged by invisible forces nathan no he got up again shakily but i have to i must and in his metaphysical mind nathaaan his sweet mother calling to him his poor brave nana unafraid even now and the awful truth like a hammerblow to his reeling mind that she spoke to him in his mind and the fact that it wasnt telepathy ma the word fell from his lips like an echo from long long ago when another necroscope had mourned his mother in a dim and distant world and now her words were warm and nanas smile was warm in the deadspeak aether nathan son try not to feel so torn for there was no pain none at all and even now weve not been put apart no for now im another voice to talk to in your pillow i always knew you were your fathers son nathan and what the necroscope harry keogh did you can do again aye for all of us the living and the dead alike look trask pointed high overhead and rising a pair of manta shapes pulsed through the sky wamphyri flyers scudding like clouds against the stars they were there and they were gone lost over the horizon of treetops nathan snarled stumbled a pace in the direction the flyers had taken he would conjure a mobius door leap into the sky go after them but no nathan not in haste or hatred that way youre fallible your father was fiery too sometimes but not when he made war then he was cold war nathan panted gritting his teeth aye and his empty blue eyes mirrored the icecold starlight and mustering all the strength of his blasted bereaved agonized mind he hurled a question a taunt and a challenge after the unknown wamphyri thief who had stolen that which was precious beyond words you bastard thing motherkiller who are you who is it i must seek out to kill eh came back a mental grunt perhaps surprised a szgany mentalist and powerful is it you freak blueeyes yellowhair i see that it is and she was your mother was she well and now were kin blueeyes for her blood runs in my veins too oh haha and so youd seek me out to kill me would you but thats been tried before there came a grim chuckle gradually fading and finally a hoarse chilling whisper very well if youre that tired of life then seek me out i look forward to our meeting but dont forget to ask for me by name by the name of vasagiiiii vasagi a name to ring raucous as a cracked bell in the necroscopes mind forever or if not forever for as long as it took to still it then to himself a promise vasagi you are doomed i swear it except it was not to himself for the necroscopes every thought was deadspeak and all in good time nana told him softly but first me you ma the anger fled out of him in a moment for the moment oh indeed for while im dead son we really have to be sure ill stay that way find me and give me to lardis hell know what to do nathan moaned staggered and finally resigned himself to it he stepped aside from the others conjured a door and followed nanas voice to where her body lay crumpled on the forest floor and when he saw her if he hadnt known that it was her then he never would have known he took her back to lardis handed her into the old part six battle stations lidescis arms and passed out cold under the glittering stars ben trask and misha caught him and lowered him on to one of the travois and thank god for that trask said misha looked at him until he explained where nathan is now theres no more pain not for a little while anyway lardis gave a grunt and said and no war either for a little while at least eh ben trask the other shook his head grimly not yet he answered but its as well to let him rest for the war will come soon enough you can be sure of that looking at the poor shrivelled thing in his arms then at the man on the travois his drained face for the moment drained whose looks were now more than ever harry keoghs lardis gave a nod of his gnarled old head oh yes he was as sure of that as hed ever been of anything i wrathas war counci the attack on the keep new arrivals lolling on the jolting bed of a travois with a skin tossed over him against the chill of the sunside night and his young wife misha walking alongside the necroscope slept a sleep of total exhaustion this time a far more emotional than physical fatigue finally burnedout if not actually bereft there was no room for dreams in the closeddown vaults of his mazed mind now or rather no energy for them neither dreams thoughts nor even esoteric whispered conversations nothing to disturb him this was a healing sleep for a wound as deep as the soul the great majority knew of course and were silent they had felt nathans grief their whispers no longer echoed in the deadspeak aether and for the first time in what seemed a very long time the necroscope was finally at peace but the rest of sunsidestarside was not out on the boulder plains vormulacs observation posts were being set up in agesfretted ossuary piles or the rubble of crumpled aeries wherever man and beast could find shelter from the grim grey light of the coming day it made little or no difference that the sun never shone on the boulder plains the mere proximity of that furnace orb was enough of a threat in itself when the barrier mountains turned golden in their peaks that would be the signal for the warriorlords creatures to cower down and sleep however uncomfortably irritably in whatever shade they could find it was the way of the vampire and far down the spine of the barrier range beyond the dogleg pass black boris pulsed east with his company of lieutenants thralls and warriors to make camp in the caverns of the trogs black boris at least was not too displeased with his lot while in the great pass itself lord unsleep and devetaki skullguise landed and hid away their flyers and crept silent as shadows to find an advantageous position from which to watch lord wamuss invasion of the gorges guardian keep and fifteen miles east of the pass a veritable swarm of vampires settling to what remained of wrathas stunned supplicant szgany tribes sacking raping and looting indiscriminately putting on fat and gathering provender against the coming day and all the bloody nights that were yet to be for in the final analysis the warriorlord had seen little or nothing to be gained out of the conservation of these snivelling supplicants since vormulac must in any event provision his army it were best done at wrathas expense moreover it pleased lord unsleep to know that in using up these people he destroyed in short order what must have cost wratha no small amount of time and effort to implement therefore all in all such slaughter seemed the logical decision or the logic of the wamphyri at least and in any event gratifying as for wratha herself even now in wrathspire that lady was making decisions of her own with the exception of canker canison wrathstacks lords had all come up to wrathas war council gorvi grudgingly the killglance brothers awkwardly distanced from each other by reason of spiros superior talent and lord nestor lichloathe gloomily as was his wont indeed such was the necromancers morbid fascination with death he now more than ever shrouded himself in cerecloth robes till even his eyes were scarcely visible in all the wadding patently his art had warped him irretrievably this was wrathas conclusion at least and despite that wrathstack had drawn first blood in the war with turgosheim namely the rout rack and ruin of lord shornskull and his party it was obvious to wratha that this was a desultory even dispirited gathering lacking canker canisons outrageous antics especially there was nothing to give it cohesion not even mutual irritation with a cursory wave of a slim hand she bade them welcome and be seated and inquired of no one in particular the doglord flown out said nestor lowvoiced i saw them from a window in my room of repose canker and his moon mistress heading south and a little west perhaps for the great pass wratha nodded and snapped well then it seems we must pray that cankers lieutenants are free of their masters burgeoning affliction my lords in case its escaped your notice we have an aerie to secure and defend against the hosts of vormulac no use to bare your fangs at us lady gorvi lashed out noticeably less unctuous than usual for we are here cankers the one whos absent all of them with the exception of nestor glared at one another but in that quiet way of his the necromancer merely said time is wasting and with a shrug if canker returns he returns and if he doesnt he doesnt what difference does it make his men are fierce fighters all again wrathas nod and her sigh as she let out something of her pent air very well then lets to it and as for canker i had nothing for him anyway now you see why i allotted him mangemanse in the first place its the least important of all the manses and central its the easiest to defend good spiro slapped the table his scowl like the blaze of hot coals then we can get on what do you have for me and mine wratha raised an eyebrow eager are you i have achieved my fathers killing eye spiro answered and i can feel its power growing even now time it was tested to the full he looked several inches taller and wore a dirty eyepatch over a bruised purpleblotched right eye and cheek swollen and discoloured his left eye was a redveined blob of sulphurous hate wratha stared at him a while and said your fathers eye spiro and so it would appear well and now you must use it to best effect wherever your manses defences are weakest there make yourself available and in the event of an attack unleash your scathing eye upon the raiders glare them from their saddles burst their hearts and obliterate them with a glance before they can so much as think of landing alas wran spoke up smiling sarcastically and plucking at his wen i am gifted with no such skills but merely rage a little will you also tell me my duties madame she nodded curtly your duty is the inspiration of your forces show them that your furious madness is not without purpose but directed at enemies who may not stand before the rage of wran her words prompted him to puff himself up a little but in a moment he scowled and asked is that all have you called us here to instruct us in the obvious in what is second nature to us if so it seems a great waste of time to me wrathas turn to scowl my but you lords are edgy now tell me have i led you astray so far are your manses full of good sunside stuff to withstand vormulacs siege or what and listen she put up a slender hand to a conchlike ear is that the wind or the ghost of laughing zack shornskull i hear now whose great works were these i wonder yours or mine wrans scowl became a snarl and do you also take credit for that fiasco at sanctuary rock and i would remind you zack shornskull was just one of vormulacs generals but what if hed sent ten lady i tell you we were lucky before wratha could spit an answer nestor sighed through his wrappings and said my lords lady do we really have time for these word games this carping wratha glared at him then snapped at wran of course i have other work for you but since your arrival here pale and shivering my first thought was to boost your flagging morale wrans jaw dropped he pushed back his chair and made as if to spring to his feet oh not just you wratha threw her arms wide but all of you utterly out of sorts worn down in spirit when by all rights you should be geared for war gorvi the socalled guile in a cold sweat his former cunning noticeable by its absence displaced by panic spiro killglance almost too eager for war which makes him irresponsible and easy prey to possibly fatal errors and nestor lichloathe as cold and quiet as one of his beloved corpses what a sorry bunch but you three is this that same band of renegades i led out of turgosheim that time oh it is be sure but grown fat and idle whats needed is more of the spirit you showed then what for then vormulac had every advantage where now he has only the weight of numbers we are the ones sitting pretty in a fortress impregnable so wake up rise up from this morbid mood in which you wallow so then wran huffed and puffed now everything comes clear we are to blame for this fix were in we are the ones at fault us lords fat idling cowards the lot of us dull dispirited dimwits and wratha the risen the only one capable of reasoned thought are these the insults we must suffer is that what youre saying lady she looked at him and lifted a knowing eyebrow and her look said it all ah but just listen to you raving as if it serves some purpose and in a while out loud and yet quietly remember those are your words wran killglance not mine and a little louder well then whats it to be do you hear me out or dont you wran glared at her for long silent moments but finally lowered his voice to growl go on then were listening wratha got up abruptly from her bonethrone strode to a window and beckoned the lords to follow and when they had joined her she pointed out and down at the starlit piles of the tumbled stacks of the old wamphyri strewn over the starside plain in all directions then aye she said turning her gaze on wran and indeed i do have work for you all to be attended to beore this war continues else it could be too late eh he frowned those fallen aeries all have one thing in common she went on one weakness which brought them down oh dont you see it that they are fallen certainly she shook her head that they were caused to fall ive known it since the day we arrived here and i should certainly think that you would know it too you and spiro of all people since youre living on hells very doorstep also i know that this stack is no different it has the same fault it too can be toppled brought down onto the boulder plains nestor stood apart from the others at another window but his strange quiet voice was magnetic and claimed their attention as he said wratha is right ive spoken to the liches of men who told me how it was that time but let her finish and then ill have my say the gasbeast pens said wratha which was explanation in itself but without waiting for comment she pressed on all of the pens on one level side by side with the methane storage chambers pens and chambers alike huddled together like chicks in a nest in one nest madmanse and in this instance wellnamed at that for upon a time these other gutted aeries of the old wamphyri were of a similar flawed design ah but only look at them now huh it scarcely takes a genius to fathom how they were brought down all the heat had passed out of wran in a moment looking to wratha for advice he said but what would you have me do we need the methane for the kitchens heating lighting she nodded by all means lets use this fire to warm our hands but i for one refuse to sit on it a moment longer not when it threatens to burn my tail two beasts in three must go leaving plenty of wellaired space between the remaining pens now tell me do i have it right are the chambers and pens all on the perimeter aye wran nodded worriedly of course to simplify the venting of excess gas then simply vent it she told him as much as may be spared and keeping only a handful of pens occupied drain the rest of the chambers and stave them in so that gas cant accidentally gather there finally until this war is over keep only sufficient beasts for minimal lighting heating cooking we see well enough and there are other ways to keep warm and burning meat for greedy thralls was always a luxury at best i should simply release my beasts and let them drift out on the air their function is to manufacture gas wratha answered thats all they do and when they stop they die you have no choice but to release them or would you rather have vormulac send in a suicide squad to fire them in their pens i can see it now each beast setting the next ablaze and the methane chambers popping one by one till all goes up in a titan blast and finally this last great aerie of the wamphyri left teetering on a central stem or slumping to a stump like these other toppled ruins and now nestors voice gloomy and quiet as ever your picture isnt a pretty one lady but it is accurate beyond a doubt moreover lord unsleep isnt the only one we need to worry about no for i know how it was that time and that even now events are swinging full circle history repeats explain she said sharply he went back to the table and sat down she and the others followed him waiting for him to continue and eventually i talk to liches as you know he said and from them and other sources ive learned something of the recent history of this place a thousand and more sunups ago there was a war but not between the old wamphyri no because for once they were united against a common enemy a very terrible enemy aye a sunside wizard and it was him who toppled the aeries one by one and laid them low on the boulder plains what gorvis eyes had narrowed to slits dyou mean a common man a sunsider szgany a man did all that how a man or men aye nestor nodded but common never havent i said they were wizards as to how they did it they caused the sun to shine on starside and guided its rays into the great stacks to the methane chambers and gasbeast pens then seeing wrathas puzzlement he paused a thousand sunups gone she queried him but what has that to do with here and now and what do you mean events are swinging full circle that wizard had sons said nestor one of whom inherited his powers much as spiro got his fathers killing eye and wratha prompted him the wizards son still lives nestor turned his head abruptly and stared at wratha through the slits in his wrappings you even saw him lady atop sanctuary rock why you knocked him from the rim which should have put an end to him but no he lives there still on sunside for a while he was elsewhere wherever wizards go dont ask me but now hes back and dangerous for long moments she gaped at him then slowly shook her head it seems to me your liches have lied or told you myths and legends men cant control the sun nestor that theres a spark of truth in it who knows maybe they massed an army in the mountains men with mirrors or weapons such as those the lidescis use and blasted the stacks with reflected sunlight but even then it seems farfetched to me nestor shrugged well ive warned you and i have something else for wran in their war against this sunside wizard that time the old wamphyri used gasbeasts as weapons exploding them in the faces of their enemies since vormulac unsleep has set up watchers on the plain and wran has beasts to lose i thought it was worth mentioning wran grinned and for once nodded appreciatively and one last thing said nestor but very quietly now oh wratha waited this wizards son he comes and goes nestor groaned flapping his bandaged hands uselessly he does what he he moves nestor cried he moves instantly from place to place even miles a great many miles in as little time as it takes to tell he flits like a thought but in body as well as mind and in a little while ah said gorvi breaking the sudden silence with his sigh and drily well there you have it didnt i always say that cankers condition was contagious nestor took no offence apparently he stood up staggered headed for the exit he would descend along a wellknown route into suckscar but at the archway exit as if remembering his manners he turned and looked back i take it you have nothing for me madame his voice was hoarse pained for a moment her heart went out to him handsome young lord nestor as had been she wondered what ailed him then put it aside at once whatever it was none of her concern she had problems of her own they all did nothing she said except you make your best preparations for war i am prepared he answered and left which leaves me said gorvi wratha got her thoughts together turned her gaze on the guile and in a moment said just you gorvi aye well you must guard your wells and ensure that the water is plentiful for theres nothing quite like boiling water for poaching the flesh from a wouldbe invaders bones we must all be thankful my siphoneers are in fine fettle and of course you must secure the bottoms only let a man of vormulacs in down there wed have kneblasch in the water for sure also i foresee a veritable rain of bodies into your territory men and beasts alike make sure your earthbound warriors know the difference between friend and foe should fighting men or creatures of wrathstack fall give them succour if you can and return them to the battle with all speed and our enemies but i need not tell you how to use them she looked from face to face as for myself my roof is wellguarded with warriors pitfalls traps my landingbays are gantlets for any brave fool who would try them my lieutenants and thralls will not fail me but fight to the death for should they fail to fight theyll die more terribly yet there now we must wait a while and see whats what with which the war council was over but the wars were only just beginning in the keep in the great pass bruno krasins nightguard had settled into their duties and were watchful trained soldiers they watched the ground for men and scanned the air for flying beasts but the keep was literally a fortress and in a world as primitive as this the weapons of earth were devastating so that despite the loss of tzonov and yefros of whom the common soldiers had known very little and understood even less krasins men felt strong capable and sure of themselves krasin himself felt sure of them indeed it said a lot for his faith in them that having witnessed the lady devetaki skullguises abduction of his leader still he could sleep in this place but krasin was as hard as they come he knew that his staying awake could not help matters far better to be up at the crack of dawn full of energy and clearheaded from a good nights sleep so he slept in the glow of a hearth fire and trusted the watchful men hed left awake if this were russia krasin knew he would feel secure in the knowledge that nothing could slip by them but this was not russia a corporal and a private soldier kept watch from their vantage point on the jutting balcony of a slateroofed turret halfway up the face of the keep located centrally between the yawning cavern entrance and the topmost watchtower the turret projected from the riddled face of the gorge like the beak of a bird of prey beneath the sloping slate canopy of the roof the men were the birds eyes their own eyes gleamed blue in starlight flowing down to them from the winding ribbon of glittering icechip stars overhead the men had been there for five hours now and were tired one more hour to go before handover of duties when they could go to their beds and sleep one hundred and fifty feet below the courtyard sprawled bluetinged and blackshadowed under its massive walls a cigarettes telltale glow lit the darkness where shadows gathered faint footsteps and a hoarsewhispered challenge echoed up from a prowlerguard making his rounds and a moment later a second glowworm cigarette joined the first the two seeming to flirt where the shadows pooled close to the keep gates the night was quiet from far away the occasional hoot of an owl now and then a redeyed moth half as big as a mans hand whirring in the darkness and staying close to the canyon wall to avoid the attention of bats a sentientseeming ground mist floating over the bed of the pass its hesitant tendrils writhing evaporating apparently repulsed by the gates of the keep then the owl falling silent the last moth whirring away in a fan of powdered wings the silence closing in more yet to break it the corporal in the turret shuffled and commented private bykov appears to be late with his signal he leaned out across the balcony craning his neck to stare up at the topmost tower aimed his torch at it and pressed its stud the beam reached out picked out a gaunt stone facade and inkblot windows but although the corporal waited there was no answering flash asleep his ic answered but do you blame him corporal zorin why secure in that high tower who can possibly threaten him the other answered with an irritable grunt switched off his torch i shall charge him anyway he wasnt put up there for his security nor even ours but for the safety of the whole keep from such a vantage point bykov can see everything the pass in both directions the approaches to the keep the courtyard and the movements of the prowlerguard everything or he would see it if he wasnt asleep as if to punctuate zorins words a pebble and some mortar or fine grit fell from on high clattered against a ledge went plummeting into the deeps but while the corporal gave a start his subordinate merely chuckled and said so hes not sleeping after all but merely distracted eh the corporal frowned distracted vasily bykov carves stone with that army knife of his the other explained its his hobby i would guess that hes just this minute brushed a handful of chips from that windowledge up there zorins frown deepened he should at least have seen my torchbeam and answered it a halfseen shrug from the darkness of the turret perhaps his batteries are faulty ive had to change mine twice there came a click and the turret was lit from within zorin glanced back from the balcony to where his subordinate aimed his beam into his own face making it look devilish but overhead where the beam played on ancient wooden beams and badly gapped heavy slate tiles just darkness no stars clouds zorin wondered but a moment ago he was sure hed seen stars through the gaps in those tiles and over the pass the sky seemed clear the sloping roof projected almost to the full extent of the balcony zorin leaned backwards stood on booted tiptoes aimed his torchbeam upwards along the slope of the roof and saw something stir it was as if the roof was furry inches deep in moss or lichen mobile as zorin moved his beam across it until he realized that it was mobile then he gave a gasp and reached for his machinepistol but far too late inverted on the roof headdown spreadeagled inching forward like some sentient slug on a rock lord wamus of the wamphyri formed a deadly living blanket but feeling the light of the corporals torch on him he lifted his head opened his scarlet eyes and hissed right into zorins face no more than fifteen inches separated them eye from eye zorins ic had heard his corporals gasp and seen his hand snatch at the machineguns strap across his shoulder now he saw something else something unbelievable that caused him to snarl his terror and grab with jelly fingers for his own gun a pair of huge flat webbed hands with long bony fingers and nails like fish hooks hands that reached out over the scalloped rim of the roof grasped zorins head and lifted him bodily from the turret his wildly kicking legs slid from view his chokedoff cry came burbling from above followed at once by his hurtling body tossed into the gorge and corporal zorins scream went on and on ohahaaaaah all the way down until he hit the bottom panting his terror alone now in the turret the private soldier used his gun to prod at a loose tile immediately overhead it shifted and went sliding into space and mercifully the stars were visible again in the gap it left or perhaps not so mercifully for the darkness was closing in even now the light from the starlit gorge was being shut out as if someone slowly drew a curtain the soldier held his breath and lowered his gaze towards the balcony where lord wamus had come into view headfirst arms reaching slithering like some rubbery jellyfish flowing over the rim of the roof into the turret upside down he gripped the scalloped rim with his great bats hands and unfurled himself to the floor and for a single moment a vampire lord crouched there with his hunched blackveined batcanopied back to the terrified soldier who finally pointed his gun and made to squeeze the trigger but a ragged leathery arm and hand reached down through the hole left by the slate to snatch the weapon from his palsied hands and up there another face like wamuss was glaring down meanwhile the vampire lord himself had turned inwards the soldier gazed into the nightmares furnace eyes felt the steamy coppertasting breath from its convoluted flattened batsnout and yawning redribbed cavern jaws and tried to will his nerveless legs to turn him around and run back into the core of the keep down through its endless stone stairwells to the courtyard out into the company of other men or better still into another world his own where he knew he would wake up at last for things like this only happened in bad dreams except and exactly like a bad dream his legs wouldnt move but felt nailed to the hewn rock floor wamus however suffered no such constraints he moved so swiftly and efficiently that the soldier never even saw the movement or knew what it signified down in the courtyard booted feet were running hoarse voices shouted torchbeams swept the bed of the pass north and south and reached up to scour the canyon face the looming facade of the keep the sky itself automatic weapons made their definitive and very threatening chching sounds as they were readied for action but against what where was the target where the enemy all movement ceased breathing stilled silence reigned a man lay dead crushed to the courtyards bedrock his blood and brains spattered outwards like a sticky halo round his head or a painted peacockstail design without its beauty without its life and in the higher watchtowers no slightest sign of movement or recognition of tragedy and in the courtyard no one so much as noticing the lichenlike patterning on the sheer walls or the sentient creep of certain surfaces then hurried movement in the interior of the keep the clattering of more booted feet bruno krasin and a handful of men appearing from the dark yawn of the entrance cavern like ants from the jaws of a picked skull pausing briefly to look about then hurrying down the exterior steps and a host of wideeyed faces peering from the lower balconies and windows what krasin shouted as he pushed the prowlerguard out of his way and looked down on the corpse of corporal zorin and again what he fell someone mumbled or he was thrown someone else choked out he screamed but it was i dont know the way he screamed he was terrified i guess but not just of falling shut up staffsergeant krasin rounded threateningly on the speaker although he suspected he was right and a moment later turning his gaunt face up to the night the platoon commander let loose with his bull voice now hear me were on intruder alert for the rest of the night right through till dawn if you want to live do exactly as i tell you if something moves and doesnt answer your challenge shoot it no second warnings any doubt whatsoever you shoot the bastard dead he aimed a powerful torch up the face of the keep you up there in the upper towers and turrets what the hell happened you raikin how did the corporal fall but there was no answer and somehow krasin hadnt expected one the third vantage point from the top was simply a natural cave fronted by a rough stone wall access was via a precarious exterior staircase carved from the rock inside at the back of the cave there was also a steep dark stairwell which in some other time must have connected up various parts of the keep it was choked now and impassable but pale in the glare of several torchbeams a pair of anxious faces could be seen peering down at krasin from behind the wall a flamethrower team positioned there so as to offer maximum protection from aerial attack well krasin yelled adding his beam to the crisscross pattern of moving light did you see anything except even as he shouted krasin himself saw something krasins eyes were as keen as his memory a true soldier only show him a battlezone and his mind would instantly instinctively lockon every detail recorded earlier he had committed the face of the keep to memory without even knowing hed done it but a moment ago as his beam swept the naked rock to light on those faces behind the balcony it had picked out however briefly a detail previously unseen ergo a new detail a large raised ragged patch of something that looked like moss or lichen close to the observation cave with the balcony and when he swept the beam back the other way to doublecheck then he gasped and narrowed his eyes hunched down and grabbed a rifle from one of his men and all torchbeams on the area around that cave he snapped for hed seen that the patch was closer still and closing bruno krasin was a marksman on a count of three he got off three shots all of them finding their target the first bullet hit wamus in the airfoil webbing between his left arm and side passing through the soft membrane of the webbing it splayed to a hot ragedged disc of metal against the rock on the rebound it did more damage tearing out a fistsized chunk of furry but mainly unfeeling flesh the second bullet slammed into wamuss thigh splintering and lodging its fragments deep in alveolar bone the third missed his spine by inches punctured his right lung and passed right through him it too ricocheted and wamus felt its burn against his right breast what result krasin had expected would be difficult to say he couldnt be sure what he was firing at might even be making a fool of himself it didnt matter he wasnt about to take a chance on losing any more of his men the bottom line was that their lives were his life in any case the result he got was astonishing wamus let out an earpiercing screech that took over from the echoes of krasins fusillade his nightmare shape detached itself from the sheer rock face kicked outwards formed arched wings and glided for the balcony his lashing tail acted like a rudder and seemed almost to propel him to his target a taloned hand closed over the head of one of the keeps defenders the man was dragged shrieking out across the balcony and dropped wamus sped out of the sweeping beams of light and was lost to sight the dropped soldier crashed down sickeningly and his screaming ceased krasin was shouting light up the keep the entire face of the fucking place we need to see what else is there anything that isnt right shoot the fucking thing and fifty yards away on the other side of the gorge where it bottlenecked devetaki and vormulac looked on watching the action from behind fallen rocks at the top of a scree jumble in the darkness with their wamphyri eyes they saw what krasin and his men could not hope to see the injured enraged wamus turning in a tight circle then speeding back to avenge himself and not only lord wamus but one of his bloodsons launching from a dark crevice stooping like some weird bird of prey to the cave where his father had suffered hurt and indignity but he was seen converging torchbeams picked him out as his wings arched and he hovered over the caves wall automatic gunfire sounded the surviving defender of the cave finally got his act together and lashed out with a gouting searing thirtyfoot blade of white and yellow fire which caught the batthing squarely and hurled it screaming out over the pass in a ball of scorched frantically lashing limbs and blazing membrane the volatile liquid stuck burned ate like acid into fur skin and metamorphic flesh the great bat uttered shriek after alien shriek as it flopped down the face of the cliff leaving a trail of fluid fire wherever it made contact and driving back the shadows to the corners of the courtyard as it crashed down but krasin and his men werent about to leave it at that forming a semicircle they pumped round after round into the roasting shrilling vampire and only stopped when it stopped jerking and twitching by which time wamus was back but bleeding copiously made erratic by his pain and fury lord wamuss return was illconceived in the face of odds and weapons such as these he appeared from the south out of the darkness of the pass and at once targeted a man on top of the courtyard wall where he watched the spectacle of wamuss burning bloodson the soldier sensed wamuss presence a moment too late horror fell out of the sky and folded him in and before he could cry out wamuss elongated jaws closed on the back of his neck and severed his spine but even as the vampire lord dropped his victim and relaunched he was seen alert a soldier in the courtyard cried a warning elevated his automatic weapon fired from the hip and loosed a stream of hot lead shuddering from a score of hits wamus was astonished to suddenly find himself weak drained of energy defiant intent upon scathing among his tormentors he swooped towards them and was literally hurled back by the weight of lead they poured into him which at once dragged him down and with his membranous webbing collapsing to rags he fell in a tangle a flamethrower team was now on hand they stepped forward one carrying a tank and the other operating the hose and wamus became an inferno but he was a lord and the thing inside wasnt going to capitulate that easily out of the fire and smoke tapering skyward a pale pulsing tentacle of leprous flesh quivered and shuddered where it formed another shot out sideways knocked a man from his feet and dragged him screaming towards the blazing mass but he was lucky even as his combatsuit trousers smoked and licked into blue flames the tentacle released him and his colleagues were able to haul him out of danger by then an entire nest of bluegrey appendages was lashing frantically in the roiling heat as the flamethrower team continued to hose searing death on the melting thing that had been wamus of the wamphyri finally the hideous commotion stopped the gouting chemical fire died to a flicker black stinking smoke sparks and sooty scraps gushed up into the night and the shadows began to creep again in the courtyard under the keep but from within the keep muffled automatic fire then screams and a flash of hot white light behind a windowspace preceding the coughing detonation of a grenade that shattered part of the keeps facade outwards in a shower of stone and rotten mortar lets have some light krasin roared and his men again turned their electric torchbeams on the face of the keep up there framed for a splitsecond in the eyesocket hole of a window the awesome silhouette of wamuss second bloodson the thing launched plummeted like a stone then released something that flailed and went ahaahaaah as it fell a third soldier sent plunging to his doom krasins men crouched low hurled lead into the sky tried to anticipate the flightpath of the batthing where it swooped only inches overhead then gained altitude as it headed for the wall of the keep close to the gates they saw its red swivelling eyes and heard its chittering laughter its vaguely human yet utterly inhuman laughter as it sped for the darkness of the pass and safety and didnt quite make it two figures two entirely human figures had entered through the keep gates down on one knee one of them aimed a rocketlauncher and at pointblank range squeezed the trigger a lance of yellow light and a ball of white fire the chittering laughter was drowned out in a deafening blast of sound greater than any gone before chunks of smoking meat and blazing membrane sprayed outwards and all around a warm red rain spattered black on the ancient stone after that it took a while for bruno krasin and his men to realize that it was over but it would take the rest of the night for their nerves to stop jumping as for their nightmares theyd retain those for however long they had left on the other side of the pass unseen a lord and a lady made flitting shadows among the darker shadows where they returned to their flyers the great grey vacantly nodding beasts were waiting under an overhang where a compacted screeslope made an ideal launchsite but before going to her flyer devetaki searched for a moment among a scattering of loose stones near a jutting weathered outcrop what is it vormulac enquired what are you looking for in the moment before my captive was taken he dropped his weapon here she informed him then stooping to pick something up ah good fortune at jast its still here and quickly joining vormulac observing him through hooded eyes as he checked his flyers trappings she gingerly hooked the machinepistol to her flyers saddle if only she were practised in the use of the thing but that was a thought she dared not even think glancing again at vormulac she saw that she need not concern herself the warriorlord was lost in thoughts of his own as they mounted up and launched he gloomily sent again i am depleted three good men gone the way of all flesh or most flesh at least his telepathic voice sounded very grim a low mental rumble darkly devetaki returned did you say good and men but they werent that good my lord as weve seen and as for men freaks at best but useful freaks they tested those weapons for you and youve seen with your own eyes the utter devastation they wreak huh he grunted and am i supposed to be reassured devastating is that how you describe that flamehurler awesome is the only word for it and if it were used on us to which she slyly replied ah but if it were used by us against wrathstack narroweyed he glanced at her sideways where they lifted up out of the pass another of your schemes devetaki perhaps rely too heavily upon your advice oh its no great burden and anyway what are friends for as for the keep and its defenders they can wait until morning morning sunup dyou mean but how may we work at sunup i have a prisoner an informant remember at the crack of dawn those fighting men will head for sunside but a mile down the pass our forces will be waiting it will be light but as yet therell be no sunlight those men will feel safe on the contrary theyll be ours and their weapons too good vormulacs sour grunt at last i gain something that makes a change i grow weary of the many ways in which my army gets thinned out to which she answered no my lord it gets weeded out which was surely your intention and after a while your intention perhaps he said but very quietly very ominously and in his secret mind except of course his mind was no secret to devetaki not with her superior mentalism but this time she knew better than to let him know shed heard him back in the courtyard of the keep bruno krasin had sent men to assess losses within the keep itself now he stood flanked by heavily armed corporals where he eyed the newcomers who had arrived in time to dispose of the third vampire their bearing suggested that they were military types but their toocasual toocivilianstyled uniforms placed them squarely in a paramilitary category im bruno krasin the russian introduced himself in english bluntly platoon commander krasin to these men i wasnt aware that your british ebranch had a paramilitary section it doesnt the senior man replied were cmi or we were were but even though krasin tried to maintain a cool unshakable attitude still his eyebrows had gone up at mention of cmi it was also news to him that this more mundane british intelligence agency had any knowledge of interest in or connection with sunsidestarside were yes the other nodded now were outcasts much like yourself i imagine what mercenaries you can only be from perchorsk turkur tzonovs men perhaps youd better take us to him but krasin slowly shook his head take you to tzonov i dont think you would want to go even if it were possible briefly he explained his meaning i see said the other quietly thoughtful when krasin was through a pity there was a time when tzonov and i would have had a great deal in common on the other hand i take it that youre in command now huh krasin grinned wryly humourlessly and offered a fiftyfifty shrug for as long as i last yes but since getting here weve seen some weird stuff so whats your next move sunside just as soon as its light can you use two more guns before krasin could answer a senior corporal appeared in the mouth of the cavern entrance to the keep and called down to him sergeant in the upper levels we found three more dead men sir six fatalities all told the night wasnt halfway through and krasin was down to seven men signalling a brief acknowledgement he turned to the newcomers and rasped two more guns i could use fifty and the funny thing was he really would be glad to have these two along in this alien world of vampires not only was their firepower a bonus but it was good to see a pair of genuinely human faces lets go inside he said shivering i have a fire and we can talk i need to know more about you anything you know about this place will probably be useful well have to pool everything we know they skirted the remains of the burning vampire where its stench continued to go up to the sky and made for the steps to the cavern entrance then pausing with his foot on the bottom step krasin asked whats your name anyway paxton said the other geoffrey paxton a big gun in combined military intelligence until recently when i found out about this place mainly about the gold now they can keep cmi all i want is to be rich in fact paxton wanted a whole lot more than that indeed he wanted everything hed lost and more yet and believed he knew how to get it and intended to get it on his own terms but as an explanation for being here what hed said to krasin must suffice for now the russian should understand greed well enough he would accept paxtons motives without hesitation which was just as well for he certainly wouldnt understand or accept the other ii at the leper colony the fall of sanctuary rock tzonov escape when devetaki and vormulac got back to the main camp on the lava falls it was only a few hours before midnight the warriorlords observation posts had been established out on the boulder plains his fighting contingents had returned replete from the massed sunside raids the armys provisioning was now complete there was sufficient good fresh flesh in storage to see men and beasts through the night and coming day and meat afoot to last another night at least along with vormulacs other generals zindevar cronesap made report the ladys familiar bats had returned out of the west with news of a large szgany encampment theyd seen fires and a great deal of human activity zindevars interpretation was that there had been a battle or if not war as such then violent bloodletting of one sort or another due to obvious limitations in communication she was able to supply only an approximate description and location for the site a massive outcropping boulder or knoll situated in the sunside foothills some eighty miles west of the great pass something less than two hours flying time away since the night was still young and vormulac edgy about things in general he decided to investigate for after all lord unsleep would not sleep not even come sunup and he and devetaki skullguise had already determined on a joint venture to explore the regions west of the pass this seemed as good a time as any it might serve to dispel vormulacs gloom and take his mind off things a while also it would let his generals see that he was an adventurous and innovative commander in the fullest sense of the word first however he must inform wamuss contingent of the loss of their leaders and invest them with a new one one of devetakis several senior lieutenants the lady had an abundance of them she herself had chosen the fledgling lord he already slept the sleep of change the fact that from now on wamuss contingent would have strong connections even affiliations with devetaki had not failed to impress itself upon vormulac it simply did not concern him he was commanderinchief the virgin grandam had merely taken on another secondary role that of weaning along a new lord thus ensuring that wamuss men and creatures continued as one body and remained intact as a fighting force so that while vormulac gathered information from the other lords and attended to the minutiae of command devetaki found herself free for an hour to inspect the progress and wellbeing of her own lieutenants and thralls and to visit her alien captives under guard in a crumbling secondary cone alexei yefros was still asleep he shuddered and moaned in red ravaging dreams he would wake up eventually entirely in thrall to his mistress devetaki turkur tzonov prowled to and fro a fur thrown across his shoulders his dark mind seething with plans of escape and the retention of his humanity ah he was devious this one well considering that as yet he was entirely human watching him from a distance devetaki smiled then putting on her smiling mask and taking tzonovs machinepistol with her she went to him there was that which she would discuss with him since he was so intent upon his freedom and his continuation as an entirely human being maybe they could come to some arrangement the virgin grandam would deny renege upon any such agreement of course but not until she had what she wanted or until she had disposed of what she did not want and from now on devetaki would keep the alien close beside her leashed and muzzled like some strange and vicious pet at least until the most opportune moment when with a flourish but yet again she must guard her thoughts for such as they were they could easily get her pegged out on a peak as the sun rose over sunside and steamed away in its cleansing glare or on the other hand they could win her a whole world or perhaps even two less than two hours later secure in the knowledge that wratha and her renegades were confined by siege to the last aerie of the old wamphyri devetaki vormulac and a dozen each of their lieutenants and men escorted by a pair of small powerful warriors throbbing on the flanks followed the spiky spine of the barrier mountains west keen eyes scanning for landmark sanctuary rock while seven miles south and a mile east where the forest gave way to savanna lardis lidesci and his travellers had come finally to the leper colony under the last great stand of ironwoods or rather theyd come to the place where the colony used to stand but where even the ironwoods stood no longer lardis couldnt believe it it wouldnt sink in his eyes refused to accept it the smell of death the devastation the sheer wanton destruction of it all but the evidence was unmistakable trampled underbrush all around crushed shrubbery and vegetable gardens where warriors had raged their hideous lingering stench and the simple most obvious and damning fact of all that the terrified inhabitants of this place had tried to flee the holocaust only to be herded or thrown back into the inferno for their grotesque blackened bodies many still burning were all lying close to the perimeter it was the work of the wamphyri certainly but how why what had induced them to come here risking infection from the one human disease that they feared there was just one survivor dying of his burns but while he lived lardis must talk to him and despite uruk piatras delirium of pain he desired to answer the old lidescis questions and tell of the part he had played in the downfall of at least one of the starside lords but first his own hoarse coughing question lardis tell me am i the last he had been blinded not by his disease but by the flames but lardis had made introduction and uruk had identified himself that last had been necessary there was no other way a man could know the lepers burns were terrific and he clung to life only by the strength of his will so that lardis found himself thinking uruk piatra aye uruk longlife they called you which you always cjaimed was a misnomer and yet here you are jast after all of you poor unfortunate lepers in this colony at least and out loud he confirmed it you are the last uruk aye however things go with the wamphyri ill not be beating the bounds out this way again it was your father built this place uruk reminded him the lidescis are blessed their stars are the warmest of all the stars in the cold cold sky and yet not all the lidescis are blessed perhaps he rambled not all of the lidescis were blessed what could uruk mean the lidescis as a family or as a tribe he could only mean the szgany lidesci or a member of the tribe for with jason gone the only true lidesci was lardis himself and lissa his wife of course through marriage fascinated lardis leaned forward a little the better to hear the others broken whisper say on uruk if you can what is it you would tell me are we alone they were out on the prairie a short distance from the still smouldering quarteracre of the colony where even the ironwoods had been reduced to blackened totems uruk had been found with his rags burned into his flesh sprawled in the muddied pool of the colonys spring wrapped in a blanket he had been carried out here where lardis had come to talk to him lardis nodded despite that uruk couldnt see him were alone my men are mazed they sit about the smoking ruins and feel the horror of it you people were helpless crippled dying you were dead or as good as corpses that yet walked or stumbled even without the wamphyri there was no hope for such as you so why did they do this what could they hope to gain from this they could not use you what reason could they have had or are the wamphyri utterly without reason not not they the merest twitch of uruk piatras blistered blackened head because he hadnt the strength to shake it not they lardis lidesci but he and aye we knew his motive well enough it was revenge then he told his story some nineteen twenty sunups ago a lone flyer crashing in the forest in the twilight before the night its rider was a vampire lord with tiny pellets of silver shot lodged in his ravaged face likewise his mount its face half blown away and hanging in shreds the work of a lidesci weapon no doubt for who else but lardiss people could boast these weapons out of an alien world hurled from his saddle the young lord had suffered in his fall through the trees any ordinary man would have been killed but this one was wamphyri and uruk longlife had seen a way to pay the szgany lidesci back for all the years theyd supported the colony and not only the lidescis but the szgany as a whole all of them would benefit from a simple yet extraordinary act of mercy but theres mercy and theres mercy and so the lepers had cared for this one who had crashed down into the forest they had cleansed his wounds balmed him teased the silver shot from the raw flesh of his face bandaged his sore bleeding places they had treated him as one of their own and with their nubs of hands and grey scale fingers had succoured him through the long night except he was not one of theirs but wamphyri and they were lepers and their kindness was in no way a kiss of life but a bane a blemish a blight when they coughed they did not avert their faces their breath went into his wounds the balms and ointments they used were theirs mixed with their hands they ladled the water he drank and prepared the soup he ate and generally did whatever they could for him glad in the knowledge that their mercy would kill him and knowing that it would kill him their way that they had made a pjaguebearer to carry their curse back into starside with him to the last great aerie of the wamphyri he had been feverish crying out in the night hed named himself as lord nestor of the wamphyri once nestor of the lidescis and at uruk piatras urging the young lord had spoken of deeds and named names there was this nathan among the lidescis nestors great enemy and this misha who had betrayed him but wratha the risen would make them all pay yes and so would nestor now that nathan was no more now that he had been sent to hell if he had been sent to hell then tossing and turning in his fever nestor had ranted and raved at someone called zahar making vile threats and constantly demanding reassurance that his orders had been carried out and this nathan hurled into hell so the night had passed and in the false dawn the young lords fever had broken hed woken up and gone blundering off into the grey misty forest if he died on sunside so what he died but if he made it back across the barrier mountains into starside who could say a plague of leprosy could not take all of the wamphyri it never had before but certainly they would be slowed down and the lidescis and travelling folk in general would earn something of a respite from them the one thing that uruk and his people hadnt taken into account was the possibility of nestors return for in all the long years of the colonys existence no vampire had ever come here of his own free will until now almost from the first few words lardis had known what was coming what twenty sunups ago the day of nathans marriage to misha the night of nestors attack on his brother when lardis himself had crippled that flyer with a load of silver shot and even got off a shot at nestor both of them good shots apparently well and now he knew the whole story also knew why it had been for his ears only because uruk longlife had not wanted it known that an exlidesci was the author of this deed tonight not that it was the fault of any human agency and certainly no man of the szgany lidesci was to blame but in any case lardis understood he nodded his head and whispered gruffly my thanks to you uruk piatra but now im at a loss for theres nothing i can do for you in return again that twitch of uruks scorched head and once more his tortured whisper there is something and lardis knew what it was but it seems too cruel he said to end it like that for one whose life has known hardship enough already would you make that ones death harder still i desire it lardis lidesci and by by your hand very well lardis could only agree afterwards well the others must burn those who are not burned already you know why uruk but i shall see to it that you are buried in a secret place out on the savanna ahhh uruk answered in a dying sigh the last living breathing sigh he would ever utter and with that the matter passed out of lardiss hands for which he was glad for long minutes lardis sat there before covering uruks face until suddenly he became aware of misha standing over him she hadnt been there for long he was sure shed heard nothing of his conversation with uruk her primary concern lay elsewhere unconscious under a fur on a szgany travois how is he lardis asked standing up and groaning as he felt his joints crack in a fever she told him im worried about him a fever lardis thought his brother too last time he was here one a ever of the body the other of the soul and when hes awake must tell him that nestor did this i suppose i must so that where the one has lost his jast vestige of humanity the other may put aside any last remaining thoughts of love pity and do what must be done brothers aye bloodbrothers from the same womb but different from the start and never more so than now while out loud he said take me to him ben trask and most of his helllander companions were there with nathan but no one more concerned about the youth than trask it can only be grief he stood up as lardis approached he loved his mother dearly grief passion fatigue you name it these last few days nathan has been through a hell of a lot and in more worlds than one now he needs care and attention then care for him lardis answered looking down on the necroscope where he moaned sweated shivered well aji have to take care of him for after all nathans your one hope of ever getting out of here and hes our one chance of ever living here and one way or the other im sure its close now i can feel it thickening like the air before a storm everything has a turning point and every war reaches a climax its coming i know it he turned away what will you do now trask called after him lardis looked back we have to make camp build shelters of sorts prepare defensive positions he shrugged we know how this isnt the first time and us care for yourselves and for nathan as best you can as the camp takes shape spread yourselves and your weapons of course around the perimeter then sleep as peacefully as you may i shall set a watch we wont be caught napping again not this night anyway the wamphyri have been here once tonight trask appeared doubtful he wasnt privy to lardiss knowledge about this most recent atrocity lardis nodded aye but you must let me be the authority on the wamphyri take it from me theyre not likely to return tonight on the other hand we wont be taking any chances as he went off to rouse his men and get them working a drizzling rain started to fall hissing among the last smouldering fires it had started to rain over the barrier mountains too where the warriorlord vormulac unsleep and devetaki skullguise gentled their manta flyers down out of a lowering sky and called down their lieutenants men and warriors to the rim of a scarp high over sanctuary rock then sniffing the damp air and scanning the dreary night with vampire eyes and senses this has to be the place vormulac grunted even up here i can smell the smoke of fires the reek of furious fighting the sweet scent of szgany blood zindevars familiar creatures were right down there was a battleground and recently he and devetaki sat in their saddles not far apart their voices echoing hollowly in the still damp darkness but hers was low and thoughtful as she answered your senses are acute as ever my lord but there is blood and blood myself i smell more than szgany blood oh men died down there tonight its true but so did vampires vormulac gazed redly across at her where she sat wreathed in mist and drizzle what do you think she glanced at him wrathas last throw at provisioning before we close our jaws on her and she had to fight to take her share he was puzzled how so when so far weve encountered only supplicants the men in the pass were not supplicants ahhh you think there are more of these weaponed humans down there now that you mention it lady you could be right for indeed i smell more than blood in the air a sulphur reek as when lord wamus fell at the keep in the pass the very same she nodded and turning she looked back into the grey penetrating calculating eyes of turkur tzonov where he sat at the rear of her long saddle but ive someone here who knows the truth of it who has told me how extremely unlikely it would be to meet up with such weapons here what do you suggest then for vormulac had indeed come to rely upon her far too heavily why that we go down and see whats to be seen for if theres been fighting patently there was resistance perhaps wratha has softened them up for us in which case we may profit from her losses good and do you care to lead the way devetaki laughed and launched and behind her turkur tzonov held tight to her waist and heard her whisper in his mind ah my pretty but those are good strong hands and is the rest of your body so strong perhaps we look into that jater ah do you trembje wejj then have no fear but be of stout heart for remember we have an understanding you and i in tune with tzonovs telepathic mind her words were for him alone on arched airtrap wings they floated stalling and gliding by stages descending through the mist and the night until the rock came more clearly into view losing altitude rapidly at first they then glided in a lazy spiral finally came down and landed in the lower foothills on sanctuary rocks approach routes and as the lord and lady their men and turkur tzonov dismounted from their flyers so the rumble and sputter of warrior propulsors died away and the pair of fighting beasts put down on top of the rock itself signs that others had been here before them were all too obvious despite lardis lidescis best efforts at cleaning up the lesser debris caused by nathans alien weapons was visible everywhere soggy scraps of iron and goldstudded leather a broken sandal and shattered gauntlet bloodspattered patches of gorse and heather and as the rain stopped and the writhing mists rose up the silence was almost a living thing that vormulac and devetaki probed with all of their vampire senses until no one here said vormulac shortly not now but devetaki shook her head and whispered they are artful these people they have retained what turgosheims szgany surrendered long ago their pride their individuality their skill in concealing themselves bodies and thoughts alike their freedom oh theyre here be sure of it hiding in that great rock there i sense them some of them at least and now i begin to see it as it must have been he glanced at her your female intuition if you will she tossed her head should i go on huh but he nodded his great head anyway and followed her where she made for sanctuary rock on foot herded along by lieutenants and thralls turkur tzonov went with them and stuck as close as he dared to devetaki his machinepistol swung from a strap across his shoulder but its magazine was hooked to devetakis belt wratha and her gang of renegades must have known that these people were here devetaki began to outline her theory ah but wratha also knew that they were fierce fighters well no matter as long as wratha had supplicant tribes in the east beyond the pass she need not attack the people of this great rock and risk expensive losses but eventually when she discovered that we were come out of the east then she must provision her aerie vormulac finished it for her and she did some of that provisioning here yes i see it and then more gloomily which means that were too late any good stuff has been stolen into starside to the last aerie but not all of it devetaki sniffed the air i tell you i sense them in there deep in the rock and now that they were closer to that massive boulder so do i vormulac had to agree but how many and more importantly what are we going up against sight unseen we devetaki looked at him sideways and shook her head what do we keep wolves and do our own howling we go against nothing my lord our men and monsters go up against whatever awaits them which by my reckoning isnt much wratha has worn them out which is why they hide in the rock see their traps are all sprung or burned up their defences are unmanned they wait like chickens in a coop to have their necks wrung they passed through the outer semicircle of warriortraps skirted the inner pits finally arrived at the drystone wall where lardiss makeshift rocketlaunching tubes stood empty and idle fronting the mighty cavern entrance or mouth of the rock and indeed it was not unlike a pockmarked face that huge skull of a boulder as the clouds began to break up its round window eyesockets gleamed blue in the iceshard starlight and its mouth wore a frozen yawn or grimace like a skull and dead as a skull no lights were visible anywhere the rock might well be deserted except there said devetaki did you not feel it a tremor of terror they watch us from those windowholes and theyre defenceless as newborn babes else by now theyd have fired a bolt or two at which vormulac immediately felt vulnerable and joined devetaki where she kneeled in the lee of the wall so then he said and to flush them out we send our lieutenants and men in aye she nodded but first and to ensure that were not sending them into an ambush she turned her burning gaze on the high rim of the rock and sent come my brave one for your mistress devetaki has work for you then from on high the answering roar of her warrior and the sounds of its propulsors sputtering into life a dark shape launching from the rocks rim and a second blasphemous outline close behind as lord taintspore followed suit and ordered down his own creature landing room between the defensive positions and the rock itself was limited both beasts came down clumsily they hissed and spat at each other jostling awhile until vormulac and devetaki intervened then turned hindon to the cavern they were ordered to prepare their most noxious gases for release under pressure within the rock poisonous fumes at once began to fill the labyrinth of tunnels and caves venting in steamy jets from several lower windows cracks and crevices and from within terrified thoughts the desire to run flee escape a great leaping a mad rout of thoughts this way and that panic devetakis superior mentalism picked up all of these emotions and knew them at once for lies ah and indeed these people were artful yes but this time they went too far what did they really think to play their games with the virgin grandam herself the very mistress of deception and she knew that there was nothing in the rock but death she knew it but on the other hand vormulac did not i hear them now he chortled his voice a clotted gurgle of anticipation and to his men spread out take them as they emerge ah no devetaki saw her chance theyre too proud for that my lord these people would rather die than surrender to a stench if we want them we must drive them out here let me send in half of my brave lads vormulac glared at her what would she upstage him to the last mine go first he cried yours may follow on and to his dozen lieutenants and thralls in and sort it out driving the warriors before them lord unsleeps dozen sprang to obey devetakis six followed them in but the rest stayed close to their lady and from within the rock was that a sigh the thrill of pleasurable anticipation the sure knowledge that a trap was about to be sprung devetaki knew that it was but vormulac had heard nothing the warriors were inside deep into the larger tunnels which would take their bulk the lieutenants and thralls were exploring lesser caves and burrows all well within the labyrinth there was no resistance because there was no one to flush out oh there had been men minds human lures within the rock whose function devetaki had read to perfection shed used no less a ploy herself but they were there no longer now they plunged along lardiss boltholes to secret exits where the steep slope of the foothills met the rocks wornsmooth stone and now they struck flints to send sparks flying into multiple trails of dimi petrescus powder trails that led sputteringly back into the heart of the rock whiteblazing hissing smoking fire ran like small bright rivers through claustrophobic confines and all of these eager almost sentient tongues of hungry flame licking their way back to an instantaneous feast of sudden explosive crushing death all of them eating distance and darkness as they raced to their targets the base of the rock was itself a massive mine there were sacks of dimis powder in cracks in the ceilings barrels of it in caves around the perimeter drifts of it in walledoff corners and niches in the narrow tunnels and now devetaki heard the exclamation in her mind and again now two separate but equally triumphant cries going up and although she couldnt foresee the outcome and wouldnt be able to understand it certainly not the mechanics of the thing still she found herself borne along on the waves of excitement generated by these mental declarations of victory so much so that she reiterated them now and waited to see what would be but shed been careless and vormulac had heard her eh scowling suspiciously the warriorlord turned goldflecked scarlet eyes on her now did you say now what but it wasnt devetaki who answered him it was as if sanctuary rock itself answered first with a series of lesser explosions then several colossal ones the earth shook a hot wind blew from the cavern mouth showering pebbles and grit everywhere lesser gusts hissed in pressured jets from windows and cracks the windows lit up as white and orange flames spilled out from them the grimace on the face of the skull became a rictus of agony or a snarl of vengeance as the porous chalky rock of the lower levels was fractured and blew outwards in crumbling chunks what vormulac stood up his bottom jaw falling open devetaki asked no questions but crept away calling her six remaining men after her turkur tzonov went with them cringing down into himself as sanctuary rock continued to erupt spouting smoke and fire as its innards were torn out gutted in its soft chalk underbelly it was finished and the last and biggest explosion of all saw the end of it at the outer row of pits devetaki stopped to look back vormulac came stumbling clutching his head bleeding from a cut where a flying rock had struck him he looked dazed disbelieving and behind him the rock went down a million tons of it settling into its own foundations tilting this way and that easing into the earth like a great egg tapped gently on a flat stone and left balancing there the rock went down and overhead a signal rocket went up high into the now cloudless night sky where it terminated in a great orange starburst what that last might signify the virgin grandam couldnt say unless it was the death of the rock one thing was certain it wasnt the end of death this night devetaki devetaki the warriorlord staggered closer my men my monsters and you knew and he would make her pay right now if that were possible but it wasnt my lord you have become a burden she told him with a sigh but ive no time for speeches or recriminations men come and men go and were keeping destiny waiting but dont be disappointed for even now i serve you well after all the long sleepless years that youve known finally the greatest longest sleep of all is upon you and so farewell putting on her smiling mask she glanced at tzonov meaningfully and tossed him his weapons magazine vormulac reached for her with hands that could tear her throat out bulgeeyed he stumbled towards her blood rained down his forehead and dripped from his hawks nose his moustaches hung heavy with blood and his grinding gash of a mouth was full of it he was almost upon her and devetaki standing there with one slender arm held out to keep him back as if it possibly could at the last moment she stepped back and tzonov stepped forward he aimed his weapon and drew back the cocking lever chching vormulac moved to brush him contemptuously aside and tzonov let fly with a dozen hammers of hot lead that thundered death and destruction where they ripped through the vampirelords armour into his chest hurling him back and down with his heart in pieces inside him vormulac unsleep lay on his back looked up at the stars and wondered what had happened he was still wondering as devetakis lieutenants fell on him with their murderous gauntlets and reduced his head to so much pulp but he was perhaps the greatest of the lords of the wamphyri and they knew it despite that vormulac was dead he was not nearly dead before the thing inside him could recover and activate itself in a final frenzy they dragged him to a firepit and toppled him in in the bottom of the pit embers were glowing still close to hand a small pile of lardiss tarred torches left unused after the fighting with wratha would soon bring the embers back to life vormulac went up in fire smoke and something less of a commotion than devetaki had expected nevertheless just to be absolutely certain she waited until it was finished then she looked for tzonov and at first failed to see him as her lieutenants had busied themselves with vormulac at the pit so the alien had taken his chance and slipped away then a thrall pointed him out scrambling up a slope towards a bluff or outcrop of solid rock where dark fissures showed in the cliff face devetaki saw his scheme at once tucked away in a crack or shallow cave he could take out her men one by one as often as she sent them in after him his devastating firepower would destroy them as easily as hed dealt with vormulac one of her more adventurous thralls was after him even now scrambling with a vampires strength and agility up the slope but at the top tzonov turned aimed and put two shots close together into his pursuers heart the thrall cried out threw up his arms and came tumbling head over heels down the steep slope in a rage devetaki looked all about and saw what was required a second pile of tarred faggots close to one of the pits she gave orders chose an easy route up the slope and sticking to the shadows went after tzonov and her fury was such that she even forgot to change her mask at the place at the southern edge of the forest where once a leper colony had huddled under the ironwoods a gauntfaced lardis lidesci had supervised the layout of his overnight camp before walking out under the stars to where uruk longlife lay wrapped in a blanket it had been lardiss intention to honour his promise and bury uruk with his own hands but having found a spot at the top of a low grassy hummock and before commencing to dig some strange premonition had caused lardis to look north and a moment ago hed seen the brilliant bombburst of the signal rocket over sanctuary rock the flareup had been dimmed by distance and a little moisture lingering in the air but the old lidesci knew that he couldnt be mistaken in corroboration a lookout on a low rocky outcrop close by hallooed down to him lardis the rock other lookouts up in the ironwoods around the camp must have seen it too lardis heard their shouts and set off back at the run uruk piatra would have to wait for his decent burial but lardis was sure he wouldnt mind that now he made for an awning under a tree on the camps perimeter where he knew that misha looked after nathan with trask and others of the necroscopes party in attendance high time the lad was back on his feet it wasnt that lardis considered he was being coddled but simply that his talents were needed lardis had friends back at sanctuary rock and he wasnt about to lose more good men to the vampires of starside especially not these men even as lardis arrived at the makeshift shelter nathan was stirring he had heard the disturbance in the camp sensed that something was afoot at first disorientated his strange blue eyes finally focused on misha and the first word on his lips was a name nana but a moment later he knew that it hadnt been a dream lad lardis couldnt wait a moment longer nathan he panted hoarsely theres trouble at the rock what nathan was on his feet now unsteady but rapidly gaining ground trouble he was wan and shaken but the heat of his fever had finally burned itself out andrei and kirk are back there lardis explained they volunteered and now theres been a signal rocket when we left the rock it was all primedup as a trap for wratha and her lot should they return well and it seems they have but those two brave lads are still back there and you are the only one who can bring them out now nathans mind focused he stood straighter and his resolve tightened to twin fists of iron in his guts and in his heart for a moment there was a brief surge of pain a wash of misery grief and then a greater surge of hatred for the wamphyri lardis saw his expression his attitude visibly changing but couldnt know what it meant time was of the essence the old lidesci grasped nathans arms and snarled through clenched yellow teeth lad do you know where you are have you understood what i said nathan shook him off glared at him yes i understand and now his turn to grab the old lidescis arms andrei and kirk where will they be the escape tunnels at the sides of the rock halfway up the slope where the trees begin nathan nodded pushed him away stepped free of the group and looked up at the stars they were his orientation now he knew where he was and hed known the rocks coordinates since childhood misha flew to him said nathan he kissed her and pushed her away but gently and said yes ill be careful trask said can i help listen why not take me with but nathan had already moved stepping forward into nothing into nowhere and into everywhere into the mobius continuum the source of the all which existed before anything else existed except perhaps the one whose mind it was he stepped into that space between spaces which is the junction of everywhere and when stepped in chose his coordinates and stepped out into the foothills over sanctuary rock down there smoke going up from several of the pits west of the rock one fire at least still burning and a heavy reek of sulphur rising on man or monstermade thermals but as for the rock itself it had settled boulders loosened by the massive convulsion of earth as the rocks lower levels concertinaed on themselves were still tumbling from the slopes all around and even up here in the foothills nathan could sense minute tremors of the earth but he could sense more than that extending a telepathic probe he found vampires wamphyri and human thoughts which was what he had hoped to find thoughts to home in on the difference was like night and day human thoughts were often light as thistledown floating but the thoughts of vampires seethed they were heavy clotted thick as tar both sorts were here kirk lisescus mind felt stunned and andreis was full of curses but their confusion following the devastation which theyd wrought on the rock had left them open not only to the necroscopes probe but also to the wamphyri whichever lord or lady was down there now they would be able to find andrei and kirk as easily as nathan had found them it galvanized him to activity focusing on andrei he entered the mobius continuum and went to him and emerged to the east of sanctuary rock in a tangle of bushes and gorse that threatened at any moment to go sliding right into a yawning grinding groaning black fissure left by the rocks settling andrei was cursing low but vividly clinging to the roots of gorse and shrubs his legs flailing uselessly in loose soil and unstable earth nathan had emerged a little above him in a patch of gorse which alone arrested what must otherwise be a fall and that was exactly how he would play it andrei he called down to the older man look here the other gasped looked said eh nathan let go nathan told him dont fight it go with me and without further explanation he himself let go and plunged down on andrei what let go the other couldnt believe it have you gone mad in these circumstances it was easy to forget just who he was speaking to but nathan crashed into him and tore him loose anyway and at once conjured a door beneath them and fell into it and out again east of the rock close to kirk lisescu this time the ground was firmer they emerged in a stand of trees andrei made an unintelligible sound sat down in a clump of brambles and stuck his hands deep into the soil and there was kirk a dark blot in the starlight panting and wideeyed already halfway out of the trees and scrambling madly up the sliding face of the slope until he recognized nathans voice calling kirk dont be afraid its me nathan then he came sliding back down into the trees where andrei and nathan grabbed at him what in the name of kirk whispered slackjawed how in but by now both he and andrei knew what in the name of and how and without pause nathan conjured a door and took them up into the foothills again for orientation and a breather except no sooner were they there gunfire from below the frenzied chatter of an automatic weapon but who whoever he was an entirely human being certainly nathan could try probing him except the time taken might prove to be the difference between life and death and wait for me he told the others as if there was anything else they could do and took the mobius route to the old traveller trails east of the rock where just fifty yards from the firepits he looked up at the lower escarpments as again the darkness was slashed by bright staccato flashes of light and the savage rrrrip of automatic fire up there the night seethed with the bloodlusting thoughts of vampires and even now a redflaring torch was bobbing among them igniting other torches but why what use did vampires have for torches darkness was better than daylight to them nathan mobiusjumped to the foot of the cliffs some hundred yards from the activity and now he knew the place as a child hed played with his brother nestor and with misha and jason lidesci in those selfsame caves and crevices where now someone had taken refuge the night was alight with the torches of vampires they were igniting them and throwing them into a certain narrownecked cave nathan knew it well he pictured it in his mind as hed known it all those years ago he was sure he had the coordinates he jumped and emerged in the interior of the cave where even now someone moved in the smoky darkness stamping out a torch whoever it was he sensed nathan in the moment he emerged and their eyes met in the flare of another blazing faggot where it landed at their feet their eyes met their minds locked and they both knew made aware alert as never before galvanized by terror tzonov moved like greased lightning grabbing nathans arm he rammed the hot muzzle of his weapon up into the soft flesh under nathans jaw and you he breathed for answer and however bitterly nathan said the first thing that came into his head i i came to rescue you to take you out of here because their eyes were still locked the russian knew exactly what he meant also that he could do it of course he could tzonov had seen him do it in perchorsk and if that wasnt proof enough well he was here wasnt he more torches were lobbed came hissing looping the loop bouncing and showering sparks figures moved furtively in the mouth of the cave just beyond the bottleneck tzonov coughed as acrid smoke snatched at his lungs and said very well do it get us out of here and hugged close to the russian with the hard hot muzzle of tzonovs machinepistol pressing up into his throat nathan had no choice he did it ill tzonov taken again misha made to understand to turkur tzonov the mobius continuum was much as it was to anyone else astonishing frightening an experience beyond experience bearing no comparison to anything gone before he was blind weightless lost in a darkness utter and yet for all his human ignorance there were things he felt things he knew instinctively that the continuum was infinite and that in a way beyond comprehension it was sentient and that he turkur tzonov had no right to be here only one human being had that right the necroscope himself and he had earned it anyone else was either a guest or a trespasser the continuum would expel him if it could or otherwise dispose of him lose him in places spaces undreamed of he knew it as surely as he knew his own name knew also that his one hope of survival was nathan keogh like others before him he clung to the necroscope and kept his machinepistol jammed up under his chin feeling the hard warm metal there nathan knew that any slight increase of pressure on the trigger would spread his brains across eternity he could do only as tzonov had ordered him to do take him out of there but to where to lardis lidesci trask and the others and risk tzonov killing one or all of them to some place in the sunside forest and leave andrei and kirk defenceless in the foothills wherever he took tzonov the russian had the upper hand he wasnt going to let go of nathan just yet an idea played in the necroscopes mind to conjure a door and step out and collapse it before tzonov could fully emerge and in the mundane world of sunside what would remain of turkur tzonov after that a weapon and a pair of arms and perhaps a lower leg sliced off above the knee and if in the moment of the deathdealing act there should occur one last nerveless twitch of the russians trigger finger all of this flashing through nathans metaphysical mind even his secret mind as he forgot a simple yet allimportant fact that in the immeasurable echo chamber of the mobius continuum even secret thoughts have weight and the russian was no mean mentalist in his own right just try it tzonovs own thoughts gonged viciously but youd better be sure that if im going to die youre coming with me necroscope andrei and kirk were waiting theirs was by no means a secure location nathan went to them knowing he would have to move on and that tzonov would know it too oh the russian might want to kill him but he wouldnt be able to do it just yet they emerged on the crest of a false plateau beneath the first real cliffs that went beetling up and finally reared into the barrier mountains and andrei and kirk were still there of course kneedeep in a writhing ground mist anxious for nathan until the moment of his return then yet more anxious when they saw his fix what the hell andrei started forward but nathan squirming in the russians iron grip waved him back no he said do nothing make no move this man will kill me if you push him too far hes a helllander but he isnt a friend lets see what he wants an esper tzonov understood almost everything of what had been said knew that for the moment he was in no great danger and now that he felt reasonably safe a plan took shape in his mind he knew that his men if any of them survived would still be trapped in the keep in the pass come daylight theyd strike out south and eventually emerge from the pass into sunside that would be the ideal place to link up with them again the necroscope could take him there a simple onetoone proposition and once they were there goodbye necroscope but if tzonov allowed these travellers to be taken along too they might fancy their chances during transit or immediately after and in any case tzonov couldnt let them live they knew him now as nathans enemy if circumstances were such that he was caused to stay in this world longer than he intended to and if he should bump into these men again they would want to know what had become of the necroscope they were the only witnesses that tzonov had ever been with nathan and knew the circumstances of their being together theyd name him as the necroscopes murderer which by then he most surely would be nathan was in the russians mind he saw the whole thing and knew what was coming all thoughts with regard to his own safety fled at once he knew that tzonov couldnt kill him yet not and get back down into sunside to wait for his men run he yelled at his friends now both of you the ground mist was swirling more yet and for the first time even as he shouted nathan became aware of the texture of that mist how it clung and felt against his skin and from deep inside a warning voice was telling him the russian isnt the only danger here tzonov shifted his grip to nathans throat his windpipe iron fingers dug in as the russian swung his weapons ugly muzzle after the ducking weaving figures of the travellers where they fled through the thickening mist but sensing the necroscopes sudden tension and feeling the spasm of fear which wasnt fear of tzonov that stiffened his body and limbs he glanced into nathans sapphireblue eyes at pointblank range which was the same as looking through a window into his mind but if nathans eyes were windows they were also mirrors nathan was thinking absolutely nothing however momentarily his mind had gone blank a wasteland of shock but his mirror eyes told the whole story riding that vampire mist and settling towards their target on arched airtrap wings behind tzonov a pair of wamphyri flyers had zeroed in on him and nathan their long necks were outstretched and their saucer eyes unblinking and their riders him a powerful vampire voice female echoed in the minjs of both men that one the hairless one and tzonov knew that telepathic voice as he would know a lovers kiss or an enemys hatred for he had known her and in both senses and this time it was no artful ploy of devetaki skullguise but the real thing siggi dam except the real thing was now just as deadly in its own right or considering the incredible being who was siggis escort it was a good deal worse he had no choice releasing nathan he whirled aboutface and brought up his gun the machinepistol jerked in his hands spitting fire and fury at the closest flyer and rider his best shots burned deep grooves along the flyers neck others expended themselves uselessly in the yawning pouch or chipped soft cartilage from the leadingedge of a wing the beasts rider who in tzonovs eyes looked like an intelligent upright wolf hauled on his reins and presented his mounts corrugated underbelly tzonov threw himself flat as the creatures pouch thrusters and belly passed harmlessly but too close overhead then got up on one knee and took aim at the second flyer and rider it was siggi but such a siggi as tzonov could never have expected to see wamphyri and beautiful horrifically beautiful beyond words yet even now was that fear he saw in her flaming scarlet eyes fear yes and loathing somehow she remembered him still well fear and loathing were emotions he could deal with her weakness gave him strength as she turned her mount aside tzonov gritted his perfect teeth narrowed his eyes and took careful aim and was hit from behind as the necroscope flew at him in a headlong dive why nathan would never be able to say but whatever she was now siggi dam had suffered enough at the hands of this man and anyway she considered nathan her friend and what the hell she had saved him upon a time hadnt she tzonov cursed and went flying but retained his gun and in the next moment he was back on his feet furious hed take any target he could get now and the necroscope himself was closest and most readily available grinning viciously tzonov grunted goodbye gypsy even as nathan conjured a door he knew he was too late so that what came next was almost an anticlimax a bolas of three eightinch razorsharp hooks came whirling out of the mist and wrapped itself around tzonovs upper body the russians weapon was jerked aside its shots deflected he screamed as the hooks skewered him through combatsuit flesh and muscle and screamed again louder more desperately yet as a thin line attached to the bolas tightened and he was drawn up into the air and from above canker canisons grunt of monstrous satisfaction in nathans mind got you my friend got you at last what and did you think to find my silver moon mistress steal her away and make her your own if so then now you have found her ah but youve found canker too tzonov dropped his gun howled his agony and clawed uselessly at the web of ropes that whirled him like a top as they unwound themselves he would try to unhook himself if he could which was about as possible as lifting himself by his own bootstraps suspended like an animal carcass on meathooks he was drawn up into the mist and vanished but his fading screams came back oh for a long time nathans door had collapsed he reached out a telepathic probe searched for vampires and found nothing but canker canisons rapidly evaporating mental aura and fading chuckle that and the lady siggis relief and the first faint glimmer of morbid excitement unthinkable anticipation in her changeling mind but of course for she was wamphyri then hallooing into the mist the darkness and the echoing night nathan called for andrei and kirk in a while they found courage to answer him he collected them and took them via the mobius route back to lardiss camp there on the rim of the savanna there were a good many people whom nathan must speak to first misha to tell her even to show her what must be made known to her for if he expected her understanding as well as her loyalty she must be given to understand that her husband was more than even she had suspected him to be and when that was done he must speak to lardis trask anyone else with wisdom enough to guide him in the ways he intended to use himself and finally last but not least he must speak to oh a great majority of others who were no longer so lively but first misha having delivered andrei and kirk safe into the arms of lardis and cutting all of the old lidesci and ben trasks questions short promising them that he would tell them all that had transpired at sanctuary rock just as soon as he possibly could nathan walked with misha out on to the prairie a little way the night was more than halfway through it had been a long long night for both of them nathans tiredness was now entirely physical and therefore something that he could fight misha on the other hand was sleepy beyond fighting she would gladly surrender herself into the necroscopes arms and fall asleep with him in the long grasses if he so desired it but that wasnt nathans plan despite that he loved her desperately he intended to make her more tired yet to make her head whirl to weary her emotionally as well as physically with feelings shed never before experienced and so be sure that she would sleep because he had work to do and his young wife couldnt be allowed to intrude while he did it also knowing what he was what he could do misha might rest peacefully in the knowledge that her man was truly invulnerable oh he wasnt but in a little while she would think he was and so hugging her close in the chill of the night in the light of a rising moon under iceblue stars as cold as their colour but warmer far here than in starside he turned to face north and looked back at the barrier mountains a scalloped rim on the horizon and at the northstar over wrathstack that star of illomen glittering there and said misha ive told you what i do but i havent shown you you of all people should know you have the right im not the boy the youth the man i was weve scarcely had time to know each other not the new people which weve become and i know how you have worried about me for far too long its time you stopped she smiled at him that elfin look from their childhood beguiling mischievous loving a little girl in the sparkling river shallows innocent in her nakedness teasing him to come to her in the water and later years later her hair dark as night velvet which in the light of the sun shone black as a ravens wing her eyes so huge and deeply brown under black expressive arching eyebrows that they too looked black her mouth small straight and sweet under a tiptilted nose which or all that it flared occasionally in true gypsy fashion had nothing hawkish or severe about it her ears a little pointed pale against the velvet of her hair where it fell in ringlets to her shoulders misha the girl who was now misha the woman and his wife the vision from the past faded and he saw her face as it was now mature lovely longing for peace for children for a chance hope against hope to live out her life to live out their lives in freedom side by side in a free world all of it was there in mishas look so that he didnt have to read her mind not that he ever had or ever would for in this respect he was wise beyond his talent and could gauge only too well the pitfalls of probing the thoughts of loved ones now tell me she said how am i to stop worrying about you will you ever be with me long enough that i can stop worrying he hugged her tighter still and said stumblingly misha listen im trying to tell you you have to understand that that we go against the wamphyri she offered a small frown shrugged and said but havent we always yes he was patient we always have but this time it has to be different this time all the vows we ever made all of the szgany since the beginning of what we call our history must be realized this time we fight them all the way until theyre finished forever we have to because i want what every man of the travellers ever wanted to be able to love his woman every night without hiding in a hole in the ground to watch my children grow up and know theyll be mine always not just future fodder for a vampire lord and his beasts or materials for his vats of metamorphism she nodded ive heard lardis say much the same thing often too often perhaps and yes he could see that misha needed convincing misha he said in that world beyond the starside gate which we called the helllands ben trask promised me a weapon to fight the wamphyri even as harry keogh and his son the dweller fought and destroyed them before we were born and he kept his word trask gave me that weapon now i must discover the best way to use it i have seen your weapons she said very impressive and very limited she was wise beyond her years but she had read only half of his meaning my love he said holding her by the shoulders looking deep into her eyes sending her a telepathic message that even a child or the least talented person in the world must surely hear the weapon im talking about is me what her gasp as her hand flew to her mouth nathan i heard you speak when you werent speaking but i was misha i have things to show you you have to know who am what i am i im talking to myself she said in my head but im not thinking my own thoughts he shook his head smiled and said no youre hearing me and i can hear your thoughts too if i so desire but i dont and i wont its part of the weapon which i am which ill use against the wamphyri do you want to see more at first she couldnt answer but then she nodded oh yes then close your eyes and keep them closed you know that i go places youve seen me but in between those places is a secret place a place inside and outside time and space you wont be frightened he conjured a mobius door not if im with you youll feel that youre floating like this he drew her through the door with him nathan i ahhhhh her voice gonged in the primal night of the mobius continuum but she kept her eyes tightly closed hush he told her in this place words are jike hammers and they hurt but thoughts are jike words which we can hear anyone could be a mentalist here except no one else can come here now imagine the deepest darkest cave you ever saw no jight at all no sound nothing and you are a moth floating in the dark do you have it yes i think so open your eyes ahhhhh its all right dont cling so hold my hand i have you there she was filled with wonder and her voice was the very smallest thing as she said this is a very strange place nathan an understatement but what else was she to say everything began here he told her this is what was left when time and space flew outwards in a way its the centre it seemed the simplest explanation the shake of her head i dont understand dont try to just believe he opened a pasttimedoor and held her on the threshold where their shimmering lifethreads of blue light uncoiled out of their bodies and went falling into the past back into what had been into the misty blue origin of human life and of life that was less or more than human for there were a good many crimson threads among the blue vampires of course misha saw him limned in the light of their lives and the misty blue pulse of the past and asked what is it what are we seeing where is it our past yours and mine he told her these blue threads they are us they were us i can follow my lifeline i think even to its source in my mothers womb but what is the use i cant materialize in the past only the dweller could do that this was to show you to try and explain what this place is now are you ready to look into the future she was eager now oh yes he closed the pasttimedoor and opened a door on the future it was different and it should have been glorious the expansion of mankind into an everbrightening future but it was saddening for the scarlet lines were there as before but closer than before encroaching on the blue and even as nathan and misha looked on many of the blue threads were blinking out of being snuffed like candles wrapped around and extinguished by the wamphyri misha read in nathans thoughts what it meant and sadly asked him can you go there too it seems to me a good place to avoid but if its the future how may we avoid it i think i can probably go there yes he told her except it would be dangerous for the futures a devious thing but in any case i cant materialize there so what would be the point what will be will be or as his father had used to say what will be has been but will it be like that thats how it must be how it is until we can put a stop to it i havent looked too far perhaps i havent dared but there is someone who might advise me maybe ill have to speak to him after all later and now the hardest part of all misha now im going to take you somewhere else out into the furnace desert we have friends there the thyre fine people he told her not at all like you might have imagined them to be he closed the futuretimedoor chose coordinates went out across the savanna and the furnace desert without crossing them to a certain canyon white in the light of a hurtling moon and as misha staggered where he gently set her down he spoke telepathically to that faithful one who he knew would be waiting and she told him yes certainly he could bring his lady there into the cavern of the ancients this time misha did stagger quite helplessly and would have fallen if nathan hadnt supported her and what she looked all about where a sacred place he told her where the thyre remember their dead for their dead are here the place was lit by candles a great many in the niches of the revered dead all around the walls and in the centre of the dusty floor atwei nathans thyre sister seated at a small table with the remains of a meal spread before her she came to her feet at once and almost ran to him then remembered she was thyre and came in less haste which was seemly nathan brother and she knew who of course for he had already spoken to her but it might seem unseemly to have spoken of another behind her back as it were especially this other nathans wife also atwei knew that the szgany were not as particular as the thyre about protecting their names that indeed casual introductions were quite in order or she would not have asked in the first place misha misha said however faintly her pretty jaw hanging slack as finally she found her feet and gazed about in open astonishment at the cavern of the ancients the domed ceiling of yellow sandstone with its catseye gash of white quartz crystal that let in the moonlight like a ghostly swath across the floor the crystal stalactites depending from the ceiling and dripstone humps of crystal like frozen men all seated in a circle and in niches carved out of the walls actual frozen men but frozen in the rigidity of death the mummied ancients of the thyre none of which was new to nathan who was eager to get on atwei excuse my impatience he said but will you speak to the elders for me i have a very great favour to ask of them and in her mind he showed her what that favour was of course i will speak to them she said for am i not one of them you he was taken aback but youre a girl he spoke in haste but intended no disrespect and she knew it she smiled and explained my status is a token of their respect for you are my brother necroscope it was no small compliment and he accepted it as gracefully as he knew how the thyre honour me but atwei i need to speak to my wife will you go now and see the elders personally of course she began to turn away then turned back i too have a favour to ask then ask it another time some time when there is time i would like you to meet my mate my husband alaia alayeeay it would be our pleasure to have you share food with us all four of us together nathan smiled and was glad for her and for a moment forgot the weight of two worlds pressing down on him but then i didnt even know he said and as his smile faded time yes only see how much of it has flown sister and how things have changed and there are a great many things still to be changed but yes when there is time then it would be our pleasure and an honour to eat with you and yours she was pleased and lowered her head then turned and ran from the cavern of the ancients in a little while they heard her feet pattering briefly in a tunnel that nathan knew descended to the first thyre colony hed ever visited called placeundertheyellowcliffs then misha looked at him and blinked brother nathan nodded and told her im honoured to be her szgany brother yes atwei is my thyre sister when the thyre found me dying she was the one who nursed me back to health again she staggered a little and said my head is reeling now see he steadied her ive shown you these things so that you wont worry about me when were apart as we must be apart if im to work against the wamphyri now that youve seen some of the things i can do and the power of those weapons out of the helllands but youre still only one man she cut him off and at once fell silent for she knew his purpose now also that she would never stop worrying about him not as long as there was danger in the vampire world and he knew that he must show her the rest it was why hed brought her here to the one place the one man who could do it for him or rather who would do it for him willingly and without question except like his father before him that wasnt nathans way the teeming dead were his friends he would never take from them or expect of them beyond that they give him their friendship and if what he wanted meant pain or even the smallest hurt then he simply wouldnt want it rogei knew his thoughts of course for they were dead speak no pain for me my son he said for i am beyond that now oh there is one who coujd hurt me its true you know him well enough but as for you it would be my pleasure yes i believe these ojd bones can be made to move again if only one last time nathan had walked misha towards a special niche with its dusty ledge and crumbling tenant rogei the first of all the dead to openly converse with him rogei the ancient in this his last resting place and placing a hand gently on rogeis fragile chest nathan told misha but i dont have to be just one man misha i have lardis and the szgany lidesci i have ben trask and his people and i have other friends up in the mountains youll be meeting them too in a little while if i so desire it i can even have an army but that last that last depends on them them she hugged close to him for suddenly shed sensed something different in his voice a strangeness a very uncharacteristic coldness certainly misha he continued theres something that only lardis and a few of the others know about me they know yet dont know because they cant know not with any real understanding they accept it and then they forget it and because im just a man they accept me without thinking about this other business thats because they dont want to think about it but you are my wife you should know because you must live with me she looked into his eyes this way and that as if to see if anything were hiding in them is it so very terrible this thing about you if so its strange i never noticed it before is it like your mentalism something new he shook his head no ive always had it ever since we were children i cant remember a time without it but you see i could hear them talking to each other even then and now they talk to me too them they your secret army he was so quiet and his eyes so strange nathan i think im a little frightened that broke his mood brought him out of it fear was the last thing he wanted not in misha if he showed her now she might think him a monster he would proceed more slowly take her to the barrier mountains introduce her to his wolves and let her see the rest of the strangeness first and save the strangest till last put it aside he said almost sighing his relief as he turned abruptly away from rogei but you said no let it be it can wait nathan she put her hands on her hips and shes right you know said rogei that extinct old man of the thyre right to be annoyed even as i am annoyed the last time you were on the run it was from life itself and this time its from truth what is she a weakling this woman of yours and are you a weakling too i think not show her my son or let me show her who are they who talk to you misha would not be moved not now nathan held out his arms helplessly them he said his eyes moving about the cavern its niches and ledges these these she looked these dead creatures the thyre he said not creatures but men oh different from the szgany i know but still men and starside trogs too and our own people i mean the dead of our people yes you talk to them dont ask me to prove it but let her ask you said rogei for you can prove it nathan i come on the necroscope said conjuring a door lets go and talk to some wolves of the wild my nephews perhaps if i can make you believe in that wolves your nephews nathan i he had moved her back to the centre of the cavern now he would take her into the mobius continuum again but as he made to do so nathan said rogei farewell but it was the way that he said it his deadspeak voice hoarse with some nameless emotion nathan looked back and mishas eyes followed suit glancing towards the source of some halfsensed movement the flickering light of the candles perhaps but no it wasnt that rogei the ancient lay in his niche as before except his skull head had turned to look at them through empty socket eyes and one slender skeleton hand was raised in a gesture of farewell it was the first time that nathan had seen it for himself but now he knew beyond any further doubt that it was true and misha she also understood as she collapsed with a sigh into his arms nathan told rogei i dont know if i should thank you or what nor do i i did what i thought was right his bony hand fell loosely to his side his head lolled on the crumbling column of his neck he was just a dead thing shell be all right nathan said the mountain air will revive her and anyway youre right she had to know was it unseemly nathan shook his head i cant believe you ever acted in an unseemly way in your whole life father he said and certainly not in death with which he carried misha through the waiting door and out again into the heights over old settlement but as she stirred in his arms he sent blaze where are you closer than you think uncle between settlement and twin fords that was in the heights with your nephew grinner where we rest a few miles which to you is as nothing and you know where i am indeed i know directions yes myself and my brothers we all know the directions nathan understood his nephews had the dog or wolf sense of direction but enhanced by the blood of the necroscope come down to them through the dweller from harry keogh hed sensed it in them before in their wolfequivalent of the numbers vortex where he had mastered metaphysical numbers the maths of space and time their expertise lay in orientation blaze had known instinctively where he was but his was a twoway talent blazes own coordinates stood out so clearly in nathans mind that he could pinpoint the wolfs location within inches wait he said and went there misha came to as he arrived and carried her into the moonand starlit saddle between peaks where blaze and grinner had met up to rest a while for they and their divided pack had been about their allotted duties keeping watch on the comings and goings of the wamphyri dock too beyond the great pass he had performed the same duties but closer to the temporary camp of the vampires out of turgosheim too close docks story was a sad one which nathan had still to learn nathan spread his jacket and sat the bemused misha down on a flattopped boulder it finally got through to her where she was and in whose company and she made to spring up again but nathan sat beside her put his arm around her and held her in position you have nothing to fear from them he said these have always been my wolves your wolves she glanced at him out of the corner of her eye and again but fearfully at the animals surrounding them i i always thought that was a false memory or a dream out of childhood i remember a strange rare time there was snow on the barrier mountains the wolves came down and you and nestor you played with them we were just children at play no one else saw when we went home and i told my father he laughed i didnt talk about it again and afterwards i thought it was a dream that it hadnt really happened also i seem to remember that you talked to them these are the same wolves he told her in this world theyre longlived not so in the helllands but here they have no natural enemies not in these heights which are their places but we have enemies now blaze told him padding closer and sitting facing him and these mountain places are no longer ours alone uncle dock is no more nathans jaw fell open what dock how grinner had come too he sat with his head cocked on one side grinning at misha in his fashion who crept closer into nathans arms and shivering she said you do talk to them shhh he hushed her this is important and to blaze what about dock he has the high ground beyond the pass am i right he had it aye a nod of that unmistakably wise wolf head with its blaze of frosted fur he watched the wamphyri their movements him and three of his best they watched close up too close uncle nathan felt sick such losses were too great to bear his mother nana whom he loved so dearly and now this faithful one dock with his bristly stump of a tail gone forever but not too far uncle docks deadspeak voice in nathans mind for a moment it stunned even the necroscope but why blaze inquired how else could we have known he is our brother he is our brother uncle just as your mother is your mother and he is right they are not gone too far away of course for as nathan should know only too well death isnt like that misha had stopped trembling she looked at them all the grey brothers all ringed about the rock where she and nathan sat and he was talking to them to these two leaders anyway and grinner with his head cocked and that sly slavery look on his face that almost human look until suddenly she remembered a myth or legend from her childhood perhaps more than a legend for lardis lidesci had mentioned it time and time over again but then again lardis was full of stories about the dweller in his garden over starside a man a helllander who had become a wolf indeed a werewolf more than that hed been wamphyri a creature with nathans powers a mentalist a teleport a wolf a vampire and these wolves of the wild the dwellers children she gasped aloud nathan looked at her where she clung to his arm and saw what flashed across her mind and they saw it reflected in his own mind too like a question there but such a question that he scarcely dared to ask blaze answered it anyway we are not wamphyri something of them is in us perhaps as it is in most of the szgany of sunside but the essence that which makes them what they are is not in us the dweller our father was wamphyri but he was different he kept that of the wolf and that of the man but nothing of the vampire not after his change or if he was wamphyri nothing of it got into us we had it from our mother that he would not bring vampires into the world but only wolves and grinner said your mate fears me and all i have is an itch behind my ear and all i want is that she scratch it almost absentmindedly nathan reached out to scratch the place behind grinners ear and misha watched in amazement a wild wolf she said nathan nodded but with a mind clever as a mans and stranger than you could ever guess then to blaze as misha gingerly fondled grinners head i cant tell you how sorry i am about dock i mean i know hes still here but he isnt here we know blaze acknowledged his grief and in a moment would you know about the wamphyri that wasnt why nathan had come here but knowledge was always useful what of them they have places out on the plain of boulders from which they spy on the last aerie but as yet their main force is in the east for they have not crossed the pass not in any great numbers and those that did cross have gone back we think they will wait out tomorrow in caves and at sundown spread out all along the ridge of the mountains then all of the grey brothers will be in trouble with nowhere safe for us unless we flee far into the west or down into sunsides forests and the travelling folk will have problems of their own if you come into lidesci territory men wont hunt you i can promise you that we know it uncle suddenly the pack was restless the grey brothers and sisters stirred as one blaze and grinner stood up however reluctantly and time we were on our way said grinner now we must hunt to live and nathan nodded grimly so must i he said but in his mind for them alone but mainly i hunt to kill they understood good hunting then blaze bared his fangs and turned away they melted into the shadows were gone into the crags and gulleys in a moment a few heads turned triangular eyes flared in the darkness and blinked out it was as if theyd never been there at all but from far away one last thing uncle it was dock his deadspeak the wamphyri of the last aerie kept supplicant szgany in sunsides forests east of the pass suppose you knew that yes nathan sent traitors to their own kind what of them the army out of the east descended on them destroyed them in great numbers they are no more those who survived are fled deep into the woods then they got their just deserts nathan could find little of pity for them indeed they did dock barked but what happened to me and mine was unjust i make no complaint for myself but my bitch goes without a mate you said you woujd hunt yes then hunt some for me in the place of the lava river east of the great pass for that is where the wamphyri butchered us and ate the smelting hearts of me and my bravest and ill hunt them there nathan promised him with his eyes closed and his teeth clenched be sure that i will iv a plan of campaign final arrivals dead allies back at the temporary camp misha was so weary that she could barely find strength to curl up under the stretched skin of an upturned travois and go to sleep nathan marked well her exact location then sought out ben trask and lardis lidesci they were seated round a campfire with david chung anna marie english andrei romani and the caver john carling at first nathan wondered about the advisability of the fire but since the gutted heart of the old leper colony was still smouldering less than a hundred yards away and sending up columns of dense black smoke into the night air lardis saw no harm in allowing one or two rather more friendly fires also the old lidesci felt a lot more secure with the helllanders around their extraordinary weapons had given him heart nathan sat down with them and at once opened with its time we struck back i think i have something of a plan but i need to know what you think of it this was what ben trask had been waiting for trask had known from the moment of nana kiklus death that it was coming and soon now seeing the grim set of nathans jaw in the firelight a look which reminded him more than ever of the necroscope harry keogh he knew that it was here and so lets hear whats on your mind he said were well through midnight fast heading for morning nathan answered the wamphyri know that too indeed theyre more surely aware of it than we are they can feel the steady motion of the sun its gradual climb even beyond the horizon and through the heart of the planet so there isnt likely to be much activity for the rest of the night and i have it on good authority that the army out of turgosheim is making camp for the coming day in dead volcanoes and caverns east of the pass oh lardis grunted on whose authority exactly but nathan looked at him in that certain way and lardis shrugged and immediately fell silent this wasnt just any man who was talking i also have it nathan continued that the last aerie is in siege wratha the risen is confined to wrathstack vormulac unsleep has watchers positioned on the boulder plains to report on her movements if she or any of hers takes leave of the stack theyll be set upon and destroyed at once therell be no more excursions out of wrathstack not without someone suffering the consequences the necroscope didnt yet know that vormulac was dead but in any case what he had said was still correct in its essentials huh lardis grunted this warriorlord out of the east has cut off her supplies she cant get at us without fighting him but if he is the greater of the two evils how does that benefit us nathans turn to shrug at least while theyre standing each other off they wont have quite so much time to hunt for us and come daylight both parties will be in siege pinned down by the sun but we wont be and well have to use every scrap of daylight to our best advantage the sun is the single tried and true weapon which has never let us down as for vormulac i fancy the warriorlord has made a big mistake how so lardis frowned the old lidesci would give anything to know where the necroscope had been and how hed come by his knowledge but it was sufficient that he had it and quite obviously nathan wanted to get on there were still things he would attend to this night the turgosheim army is huge nathan must rely on what hed learned from his wolves in order to fuel it through the night and coming day vormulac has decimated wrathas supplicant tribes east of the pass just how huge is this army lardis was cautious hundreds strong nathan told him all of our hellland weapons together wont nearly be enough lardiss face fell further yet and vormulacs error his gluttony nathan answered with a shudder the rest of the tribes east of the pass will be scattered and in hiding by now no more easy pickings for vormulac but he still has to feed his army ben trask cut in so whats your plan first to get those weapons all together nathan told him for which ill need both you and david you know exactly where you put those guns in that clump of boulders close to the gate once were finished talking ill go back and check that its safe and then were with you david chung spoke up we can be in and out in a few moments nathan nodded if the way is clear yes then ill need andrei and possibly kirk they know sanctuary rock better than anyone else the rock is still stable i hope i left a fair cache of weapons up there on the dome of the rock hopefully they suffered no damage when the rock sank down on itself that must have been a sight to see lardis breathed t should have been there andrei has talked about it but to have seen it and trask said andrei has also mentioned this er helllander you tangled with from his description it could only be turkur tzonov and now nathans face was grimmer yet it could only have been him yes he answered andreis turn to speak up it was canker kirk and me we saw some of it the doglords got him aye but the necroscope shook his head no it was canker who took him but its a lady who has him now the lady siggi dam he looked at trask knowing what tzonov has done and for all that i know hes evil i couldnt have wished worse on him but lardis grunted an enemy is an enemy as always the old lidesci was iron whats done is done now we get on with whats still to be done and nathan agreed with him the rest of tonight when i have the weapons we go to work on the wamphyri and again it will be me ben david and perhaps you john carling he nodded to indicate the caver that is if youd like to be in on it i can only use men who are familiar with these weapons now chung frowned we are going to attack the wamphyri right hit and run nathan told him guerilla warfare i saw film of it at ebranch hq in london he explained his intentions and trask excitedly said that would work it would certainly confuse the hell out of them chung agreed thats my intention yes nathan said to confuse them and also to kill the blackhearted bastards he showed his teeth as many as possible and then more calmly for you see i i gave my word to someone that i would kill a few of them for him at least but the idea will be to use our weapons as sparingly yet effectively as possible very well trask nodded its a plan of sorts anyway and it will certainly show these monsters that theyre not invulnerable or even safe from attack in fact it will probably come as a hell of a shock to them but suppose we get through the rest of the night intact what then tomorrow morning we we practise a game nathan answered the szgany lidesci all of us a very special game oh lardis grunted well have time for playing games will we what like children dyou mean hide and seek exactly like that nathan nodded hide and seek yes so that when next the wamphyri come hunting theyll find nothing absolutely nothing explain lardis demanded i cant nathan answered not without breaking a trust and anyway i dont know if my plan will be accepted by certain others but it may be and so if the time should come we must be ready which is why in the morning well play this game of mine like children yes like all the children and for the children and for the future of all of the szgany if they are to have a future it was all beyond lardis but he didnt press it nathan was their one hope now especially since sanctuary rock was no more and so they must play it his way including his mysterious game nathan looked at trask and chung how long to get ready the two glanced at each other and trask said i suppose were as ready as well ever be right now give us a moment to check our weapons and no weapons nathan shook his head not going out anyway but coming back with any luck youll have a lot more than you can handle trask nodded licked his lips and said then were ready when you are nathan stood up stepped away from the fire and glanced at the sky the stars in their eternal wheel and give me a few moments he said which was as long as it took him to make a mobius jump out on to the plain of boulders close but not too close to the gate yet close enough that he felt its repulsion a weird deflection even within the mobius continuum which caused his exit door to warp and waver as he stepped through it onto starside and a moment more to clamber up onto a natural causeway of boulders and scan the land all about for the wamphyri or their creatures shielding his eyes against the neardistant glare of the gate he looked north and believed he saw was that a manta shape pulsing against the weave of the northern auroras perhaps but if so it was at least a mile away or even more so much for eyesight but there were other senses too nathan put out a telepathic probe and felt something no nothing not of the wamphyri anyway not nearby he was edgy that was all but certainly the psychic aether was alive with their echoes their afterimages the slimetrails of their having been here the taint of their existence faint thoughts reached him from far across the boulder plains others from the mountains east of the pass and again that sensation of of what held breath or was it simply him nathan himself holding his breath he checked his location he wasnt too far from the clump of boulders where trask and chung had taken refuge and stashed their weapons then there had been an injured warrior to contend with but no sign of that creature now he climbed back down from the rocks ran halfway towards the clump brought a halt and conjured a door this time it was more stable but still it trembled a little nathan decided to try a little experiment and turned the door in the direction of the gate its trembling increased and he could feel the gates resistance the way it pushed at his door it was like the nervous fluttering activity of a small magnet with its like pole too close to the like pole of a large magnet the big one would turn it around if it could then suck it in but if it couldnt turn it around it would simply repulse it shoot it away like a bullet from a gun into unknown places in ebranch hq nathan had read the keogh files he knew that his father had done just that conjured a door too close to the perchorsk gate and been hurled into space and he wondered if a door was big enough strong enough and the mind that made it was powerful enough which would give way first the metaphysical mobius continuum and the mind that controlled it or the hyperspatial transdimensional gate almost automatically instinctively he began to study the maths of the problem until he realized what he was doing and knew that he didnt have the time for it and that anyway there was no requirement then he collapsed his door and moved a few paces farther away from the gate where he paused to scan the sky again the flyer was still there but if anything the distance had increased there was no danger that he could see and so he returned to the camp on sunside held his new door steady as he guided trask and chung inside and so transferred them to starside there when theyd recovered from their momentary disorientation he led the way to the clump of boulders where all three men saw what had happened to gorvi the guiles warrior its awful debris was strewn across the uneven ground bloodied bluegrey chitin scales as big as dinner plates were scattered everywhere gnawed cartilage grooved whitegleaming bone and the churned darkstained earth a great many creatures had disposed of the one in a mighty and monstrous provisioning they walked among the remains of the thing with the starlit silence of starside pressing down on them until trask whispered god what a nightmarish place lets collect the guns and get out of here we must consider ourselves lucky nathan told him the guns might easily have been discovered but even beastminders would have kept well out of it while a frenzy such as that was in progress then as the three approached the entrance gap into the clump something suddenly appeared there two of them ben trask started and cried out chung too even the necroscope felt his blood run cold and in the next moment warm as finally he recognized the voice figure and telepathic aura of zek foener and understood what hed sensed when last he was here what or who it was that had held its psychic breath zek foener and lan goodly she literally flew into bens arms and the spindly cadaverous precog wasnt far behind first clutching trasks hand then grasping chung to him in an entirely uncharacteristic hug thank god goodly piped thank god its you nathan was the only one to keep a level head the guns he reminded them get the weapons and while trask and chung entered the clump and reemerged he gave zek a hug and clasped hands with goodly then all four linked arms holding tight to the necroscope as he conjured a door guided them through its invisible portal and took them back to the sunside camp between them zek and goodly told their story how gustav turchin had let them use the perchorsk gate to come through into starside it had been zeks intention to contact nathan telepathically as soon as they emerged on to the plain of boulders but the sight of a flyer in the alien sky of the vampire world had changed her mind she hadnt dared use her mentalism until she could be sure that the necroscope alone would hear her and as the flyer had passed overhead heading out across the boulder plains zek and the precog had taken refuge in the nest of leaning boulders where they had stumbled across ben trasks cache of weapons at that they had known that if nathan lived he must return here sooner or later but theyd scarcely expected it to be so soon also and where weapons were concerned there was now a new cache which nathan would have to recover at some time in the future for zek and goodly had come through the white tunnel from perchorsk aboard a batterypowered cart or buggy one of three that perchorsks scientists used to trundle heavy instruments from place to place around the core still aboard were two russianbuilt machinepistols and a small wooden box of one hundred and twenty golfballsize grenades buggy and weapons had come courtesy of gustav turchin the location of the cache inside the starside gate zek and goodly had dismounted well within the tunnel and had left the cart in neutral at the other end of a length of nylon rope the last six inches of which protruded from the hemisphere of white light they had done this because goodlys talent had foreseen some small problem on the boulder plains the lone flyer which both nathan and the newcomers had seen in the aurorashot distance and so as soon as nathan wanted to do it he could take someone back there to the gate haul the cart through and recover the weapons but something was obviously puzzling him and now he gave it voice weve always known that the gates were oneway systems he said but now we know something else about them oh trask waited for him to continue nathan nodded obviously they can be used more than once but only in the same direction zek has been through the perchorsk gate twice absolutely right zek put in excitedly for a while we thought that lan might have to come through on his own or maybe with other espers from ebranch but lans a precog and he had seen both of us coming through from perchorsk as soon as we got out there from london i knew he was correct close up i could actually feej the pull of that white monster no repulsion whatsoever it seems it was something that harry himself didnt know that while you cant return through the same gate you can use that gate more than once its like the circulatory system of the heart with oneway valves to stop blood flowing downhill between beats the blood circulates time and time over but cant backup on itself so if i wanted to i could use the lower starside gate to go to romania and the perchorsk gate to come through into starside over and over again but said trask looking thoughtful doesnt that mean that if you had used both gates to get here youd probably be stuck here forever zek foener are you trying to tell me that you were willing to consider that risk she hugged his arm not really ben remember the romanian gate is temporarily out of action we couldnt have used it anyway so i suppose what im telling you is that i trust lans talent and that he hadnt foreseen that kind of disaster then what kind of disaster has he foreseen trask glanced at goodly the precog shrugged looked uncomfortable ive only covered what had to be covered he piped ive never trusted the future and dont intend to start now dont ask me to look ben and especially not in this place but when im needed then youll know you can rely on me trask continued to look thoughtful so that time when harry keogh used the gate at perchorsk to escape from us or rather when he removed his potential plague from our world in fact he could have used the romanian gate a second time yes zek told him trask nodded and said then i think perhaps he did know about it but he was wamphyri and he was just cussed enough to want to do it his way despite or because of all the odds against him to go out in a blaze of glory on a big motorcycle shouting to hell with you at the whole damn world and huh lardis lidesci grunted appreciatively that sounds exactly like harry helllander to me til tell you what really sounds like him trask continued if harry did know about the gates if he suspected deep down inside with that intuitive grasp of his then what he did to use both gates and so get himself stuck here would be the perfect way to ensure that he could never bring the plague of vampirism back into our earth that would be exactly harrys kind of sacrifice after a moment goodly said was that how the dweller did it do you think came and went between here and our world on a regular basis no nathan shook his head the dweller found sunside starside came here lived here before the perchorsk gate came into being the dweller was very special thats all in the mobius continuum he he knew the directions of places even of parallel universes he looked at zek and goodly and almost accusingly asked why did you come it could cause i dont know complications goodly explained why and there were several reasons for one he had seen that they would come two theyd desired to use their knowledge and talents in the fight against the wamphyri also theyd come to bring their weapons and a warning that turchin would close perchorsk permanently in just two and a half to three sunside days time and finally a second warning different but no less important certainly no less ominous that geoffrey paxton had followed nathan and the others through into sunsidestarside where he planned to regain his stolen telepathy except its the way we think hell try to get it back goodly gloomed for you see we didnt tell turchin our worst fear that perhaps paxton desires to be wamphyri he shrugged helplessly but thats what were obliged to believe we had an empath go over paxtons place get a picture of his psychological profile and quite simply paxton is keoghcrazy in a way he hates the very thought of harry and anything or anyone to do with him for what harry did to him but in another way he loves the idea of the necroscopes power harry keogh was a telepath a teleport finally a vampire paxton will try to do it in reverse become a vampire regain his telepathy use nathan to discover the mobius continuum its his obsession powermad trask nodded he always was right from the start and thats before hes wamphyri just think of it if he actually got those things he craves and then took them back to our world earth would have a scarlet emperor and god help us but if thats what he wants he can certainly find it here hes a madman nathan summed it up you just dont get to be a lord of the wamphyri as easily as that but its a very simple thing to get drained eaten enthralled or changed utterly into something else anyway lets forget him for now theres still a lot to be done and time is wasting then he quickly went on to detail most of what had transpired during the course of just one night since his return to the vampire world he finished with turkur tzonov how the russian esper had been taken by canker canison and siggi dam and concluded i think we can safely say that tzonov is no longer a problem for all that hes an evil resourceful man theres no coming back from where he is now i was privy to something of what siggi was thinking when canker snatched him frankly i wish i hadnt been and after a moments silence as for paxton well face that problem when or if it comes up but nothing else has changed except we now have two extra weapons to add to our list i mean zek and lan of course and now lardis lidesci was finally over the fact that zek foener was here again back in the vampire world later he would introduce her to lissa and if it wasnt too painful they might even talk about jazz the dweller harry helllander the old times but all of that must wait until sunup for there was still work to be done tonight now the necroscope nathan keogh was looking at lardis in that new grim way of his looking at him and agreeing with him now we carry on with what we were doing after that a trip to the dome of sanctuary rock with kirk and andrei to collect the remainder of the hellland weapons and finally it was time to wage war long ago in the halfmythical crimson history of sunsidestarside the lords of the wamphyri had christened their interaerie feuds bloodwars now nathan intended to give that word new meaning except he would not be taking and using blood but spilling it wasting it the blood of vampires wamphyri blood first however there were those he must speak to and to him it was like going to church to offer up a prayer except of course he had no church but only a private shrine with a secret door the legend carved upon that door was deadspeak and the necroscope held the one and only key but knowing how the great majority value their privacy he took the mobius route out into the desert and chose a lonely place under the stars where any intercourse with the dead would not be disturbed by the tumult of the living and where before indeed for all of his young life nathan had been shunned by the teeming dead at last he found them to be his wholehearted allies for recently one had come among them who would have it no other way and nana kiklu had always been and in death as in life would continue to be a force to be reckoned with when nanas voice had been added to those of her sons friends among the dead and when she had argued on his behalf then any last trace of opposition had finally crumbled away now the dead could talk to him and he could ask them for their blessing on the bloodwars to come he wanted nothing more for now but that they think it over and seek in their memories even their racial memories for anything which might be of assistance in the crusade against the wamphyri for the necroscope knew that all of sunside starsides knowledge lay buried in the ground or blowing in the wind dust to dust or ashes to ashes and that the soil and the sky knew all that had been and of course there were those who would speak to him at once urgently now whom he could only thank and promise that he would indeed speak to them as soon as possible but for the moment must use his resources especially his time to best advantage for the nighttime had always belonged to the wamphyri and now he intended to take it back from them how many times on how many nights of terror had that warning cry rung out in the camps of sunsides szgany wamphyri wamphyri a cry of warning aye but also the battlecry of the vampires themselves except to call it a battlecry was to glorify it where in fact thered been no glory in it at all a cry of slaughter more like battles oh there had been a few but in the main at least until the old lidescis time the only course of survival had been flight and so one way or the other tonight would be a night to remember for the szgany and the wamphyri both a night when the travellers did not flee but came killed melted away and came again the great majority were taken with nathans vision and in their way they cheered him on he got their blessing and their deadspeak promise both that if the time came when he required their assistance then that he need only ask it was everything that hed wanted and with that nathan would have taken his leave of them but still there were those among them who insisted that he listen to them if only briefly jasef karis was one there was that which he must speak of a secret out of the past and perhaps important but jasef understood nathans eagerness to be off on his mission to claim back a little of the enormous debt owed by the wamphyri and so his scrap of secret knowledge must keep for now even as hed kept it for all of seventeen long years then there was the thyre ancient thikkoul the stargazer if only nathan would take him out again under the stars if only he could see the stars again through the eyes of the necroscope thikkoul felt sure that the future could be made to reveal itself and nathan would know the way to go except both of them knew that the future isnt like that immutable as the past it may not be changed or even tampered with but will be as it will be and the way it will be is best left unknown for as had been proved time and time again tomorrow is a devious place after thikkoul the leper uruk piatra had spoken to nathan but this time the necroscope had been especially attentive uruks burned crumbling shell of a body still lay unburied on the sandy mound where the old lidesci had left it but because uruk had a plan the teeming dead ignored the miles between in order to introduce him to nathan and the lepers plan was simple once not so long ago hed tried to use the disease which plagued the people of his colony as a weapon against the wamphyri now he would do it again a matter of personal sacrifice but one whose cause was just and because uruk would brook no argument in the end nathan could only bow to his wishes it would be as the leper wished it and finally there was a new deadspeak voice but previously unheard it was a voice so dour melancholy and doomfraught that it hushed all the others to silence in a moment its timbre texture and evil resonance were such that the necroscope could not mistake their source neither nathan nor the great majority with him which was why they had fallen silent for this was the voice of a vampire indeed wamphyri nathan would not talk to him not in this place where he had spoken to the decently dead and gone but yet felt that he should speak to him if only to know what was on the monsters mind to that end he excused himself and followed the voice to its source the place where its owner had died in a firepit at sanctuary rock necroscope i learned of you through the dead who did not deign to speak to me hah i eavesdropped on them anyway and discovered their deadspeak whispers to be full of the necroscope nathan keogh a man who talks to the dead even to vormulac taintspore called unsleep who once was undead but now is truly dead and sleeps only too well of secret skills and talents i thought id seen them all but this is something new a man who brings comfort to crumbling bones in rotting shrouds and lifeless dust in old clay bottles even to an ancient evil thing like me im not here to comfort you vormulac nathan told him indeed i would not be here at all except you said you wanted revenge on your own kind the wamphyri and especially on that one called devetaki skullguise a lady well and so do i want revenge on the wamphyri for all the szgany they ever killed or changed and forever in fact i desire to destroy them all so any advice or knowledge you impart that gives me an advantage it will be more than welcome even though you yourself are not nathan said the other thoughtfully and you speak without fear as if you were used to conversing with one such as i not merely a dead man but a vampire lord hmmm nathan now say have not heard that name before can you use your deadspeak perhaps to show yourself to me the necroscope saw no harm in it and so showed himself to vormulac i am that one yes he said who was the seerlord maglores socalled familiar in runemanse ah vormulac responded i remember you stole a flyer and fled back into sunside or west as it now appears and you are the necroscope eh but it would break old maglores black heart to know what he let slip through his fingers even if i had not remembered you still i would know you from the ring in your ear maglores sigil why i myself wore just such a twisted loop which the seerlord gave to me in friendship at which nathan gave a start for he remembered something that david chung had said to him and i ask a favour of you he said in the next moment what you ask a boon of me you desired to speak to me didnt you indeed i did ask away i showed myself to you now show yourself to me vormulac did as requested and nathan saw the very duplicate of his earring in the lobe of the dead vampires conchlike ear that makes twice youve started necroscope lord unsleep pointed out curiously now say what is it that concerns you only that hes made fools of both of us nathan answered grimly he maglore the same thats not merely the seerlords sigil but his shewstone which we have worn like fools only inches from the cores of our brains what we have seen so has maglore what we have thought he was privy to but to what end in order to watch over us and know what is become thats one way to put it yes nathan answered but far more to the point to spy on us and know our every move he is wamphyri after all and so no better or worse than any of you for long moments vormulacs deadspeak presence his wamphyri aura was gloomier than ever then hah and i left him to his own devices in turgosheim an error as it would seem i see it all now by now the gorge entire belongs to maglore and his sigil no goodluck piece but a traitor to sit in my ear and listen to my thoughts upon my return if i returned that wily old runemage would know my every move and counter it with maximum efficiency bah is there nothing of honour at which nathan gave a snort of his own what are you playing word games with me vormulac a lord of the wamphyri asking a question like that honour indeed and yet i promise you this maglore wields a twoedged sword eh how so because hes not the only mentalist in starside thats how so would you see the shape of turgosheim now because deadspeak often conveys more than is said vormulac knew his meaning indeed i would so be it and nathan concentrated on the warped shape of the loop of gold in his ear and hurled a telepathic probe east far to the east across all of starside and the great red waste to turgosheim at the end of the world and maglore in his apartments in promontory runemanse nathan whispered secure in his triumph and open in his thoughts for who remains to spy on them now no one for lord taintspore and his generals are off on a mighty crusade against wratha the risen in the west the seerlord gazes out from his window and youre right vormulac turgosheim is his entirely maglore the mage is master now he commands his forces are taking all of the great aeries spires and manses his sigil flutters everywhere from the walls of the lowliest hovel in the bed of the gorge even to the frowning heights of melancholy no vormspire itself yes as for masquemanse devetakis place is now a vast scar on the face of the gorge maglore has settled a few old scores with her be sure little i care for that vormulac grunted indeed i welcome the news it is something to thank the seerlord for at least but vormspire ah vormspire and angrily do you seek deliberately to torment me necroscope yes nathan said again without hesitation how do know youre not lying obviously maglore instructed you well why i believe you could play word games with the best of us how is it that you read him so well and over such a distance while he reads nothing of you i was his one great failure the necroscope answered my mentalism was better than his it was ever the same even in runemanse he would attempt to read my mind only to have me read his he read my dreams instead but found little of use in them i hid my telepathy from him and my deadspeak hid itself if maglore had once suspected my talents he would never have let me go he jet you go nathan nodded as i now realize to be his shewstone in the west even as you have been his shewstone if only i could live again vormulac moaned then ah to know what i know now and live again devetaki skullguise the socalled virgin grandam i would line up my lads to have her one by one id melt her leaden masks and pour the liquid down her lying throat virgin i would know where to drive the longest stake of all and let her writhe upright on an ironwood prick and steam to a stain as the sun rose over sunside and as for maglore i would drench him in oil weight him with stones and hurl him from turgosheims rim and set a torch to him to light his shrieking descent but alas the fury went out of his voice in a moment which sobbed now and moaned as before my life is done and all hope of revenge dead with me not necessarily nathan told him you asked me to come here for a reason but i cannot linger for time is wasting so now advise me however you will or say nothing ever again but whichever you do do it quickly youll help me to redress what was done to me help me take my revenge even from beyond the grave no lord taintspore my revenge not yours but if you can find pleasure in that i suppose it must suffice very well listen devetaki is treacherous ive given it some thought it must be her plan to murder all of my generals one by one and so command my army out of turgosheim that sounds like a good plan to me are you always so cold is there no humour in you this from you your very deadspeak is ice maglore told me about you even vormspire was a living tomb a mausoleum to a lost love and if you lived as long again do you suppose it would change you in turgosheim you were a great shroud covering the gorge with your misery so dont not if you tell it over again to those generals whom the lady would destroy for then theyd turn on her at once tell it to them how its dangerous enough to play word games with the dead of the wamphyri such as yourself but utterly impossible with the living or the undead i was fortunate that time with maglore what do you suggest that i seek audience with these leaderless lords to inform them of devetakis treachery his deadspeak voice dripped sarcasm audience vormulac grunted no scarcely that oh theyd see you all right and eat your heart before you uttered a word but you are a mentalist necroscope and theres something of that in all of them it was an idea at least to use his telepathy to create dissension and cause insurgency in the ranks of the wamphyri to get them fighting each other even as they now fought with the last aerie which since war and territorialism were in any case second nature to them shouldnt be too hard nathan gave it a moments thought then nodded grimly perhaps ill be able to work something out after all so what else do you suggest vormulacs deadspeak shrug let me think and after a moment do you know that devetaki used weird weapons to kill me are you aware of their source are you nathan countered a force of strange and powerful szgany or perhaps not szgany but men anyway in the keep in the great pass devetaki has already used one such man and weapon against me to destroy me and i fancy that shell try to take and use the others too i know about these strange men nathan answered also about their weapons but i have weapons of my own now that the strangers are without leaders i may be able to wnere t shall be waiting to meet them oh but youre careless with your plans necroscope does it not trouble you that i know them nathans cold smile and who will you tell them to you have no friends or allies now vormulac you have nothing and no one except me and when our business is done you wont even have that for i have better things to do than waste my time with such as you then be about your work for i am done with you let me simply wish you luck and get yourself gone but nathan shook his head hed give no jot of satisfaction to a vampire nor accept any offer of alleged friendship its not that you wish me luck he said but that you wish evil on all of them who have survived you you see me as the great destroyer that you wish you still were worse you hope that when my work is done i shall be destroyed too he was right but vormulac was finished and would say no more nevertheless before nathan returned to lardiss camp he thought to hear one last sigh from the deadspeak aether it was lord unsleep his final sentiment that perhaps now he really would sleep but he hoped that he wouldnt dream part seven settling scores further skirmishes dreams and dooms i nathans guerillas seeds of suspicion when lardis lidesci saw the necroscope walk out onto the savanna where uruk piatra lay wrapped in his blanket he followed after him and caught up as the youth took up the lifeless body into his arms and after nathan had explained but is this what uruk wants even the hardened lardis was shocked by the necroscopes explanation it will be no bad thing nathan answered to know that in life he was helpless but in death a deadly weapon its the way of the dead lardis what they did in life they continue to do after death albeit to no effect except through me there is an effect and uruk wanted to see the wamphyri lords destroyed for you and the lidescis lardis who all these years have provided for uruk and his people in their sickness and seclusion and for every traveller everywhere it is what he wants yes youre certain nathan sighed i have spoken to him and he to me uruk wants to do this for the reasons ive given and i want to be his instrument in this sacrifice for my own reasons because a kiklu did this thing lardis knew how nathan was torn and yet again he was reminded that this was no ordinary man but the son of the necroscope harry keogh which was why he stood back and said then speak to uruk again for me and tell him i never knew the better man leper or no in any other world this might seem a very dubious compliment but not here nathan did as lardis asked however silently then carried uruk with him through a mobius door and out again on to the boulder plains halfway to the last aerie dark and dreadful wrathstack glooming there some miles away in bluelit starlight silhouetted against its eerie backdrop of a writhing auroral curtain and are we there uruk inquired no but i know the way nathan told him for ive been here before with lardis on his treks he used to come here in the old times the good times there be good times again i pray you are right but let me look and listen there may be vampires here watchers from the army out of the east the necroscope put out probes from his metaphysical mind and at once sensed siggi dam and others in wrathstack and more vampires on the plain of boulders hiding there but none in the immediate vicinity he made a second mobiusjump this time to a cluster of ruins the stump of a toppled aerie only a mile from the broad base of wrathstack again his probe went out and discovered one of gorvi the guiles ground warriors and a lieutenant and a handful of thralls deep down in the ruins basement an ambush for devetakis army should any of its elements venture this way he couldnt linger not here nathan knew the layout of a stack the design of all the aeries would be much the same here as in turgosheim but even a simpleton would know that the only possible place for a well is in the earth in the very bowels of the stack gorvi the guiles domain except where exactly no good to materialize in darkness or a place of deadly danger he mentioned the problem to uruk and of course his deadspeak went out across all of starside and was heard nathaaan and the necroscope gasped for he would know that sighing deadspeak voice immediately anywhere despite that three and a half years had passed since the last time he saw its owner on the night of wrathas initial attack on settlement jason lidesci lardiss son with whom nathan had grown up jason he said where are you close but weve been closer i woujd have spoken beore but to what good end now is different for at least i can give you some advice my body rests in a crevice in the earth where gorvi put me one night after i after i had spoken with your brother nestor who is now beyond redemption im down in the earth nathan where i belong as all vampire things belong slowly stiffening to a stone among stones aye but dont feel sorry for me for i am glad that im here now better here than in guilesump the place is not far from the starside gate but do not seek me out im one with the dark and the cold and the earth jason i but there was nothing no words to express the way the necroscope felt since deadspeak conveys more than is said however it was in any case unnecessary hush said the other and listen upon a time i was gorvis man but for a thrall i was rebellious to punish me he put me to work tending the wells no man knows the guts of guilesump better than i do now look upon my mind and see the secrets of the sump nathan looked saw and felt horror creep again upon his spine even as it had crept in promontory runemanse except the seerlord maglores runemanse had known something of light at least while the nether pits of guilesump were entirely lightless it made no difference nathan saw with a vampires eyes the dead eyes but living memory of jason lidesci saw the siphontubes hollow bones like pipes descending from the low ceiling to the dark water letting down the jellylike veins which they contained human veins the necroscope knew of some monstrously metamorphosed siphoneer high overhead in wrathspires attic into the water to soak it up he saw the mindless swimmers flat and fanshaped like lichen spores grown huge their countless cilia flickering to propel them through the water cleansing it of microbes scum dust fallen spider and flyspecks and foulness in general and he saw the ledges where once jason had worked removing cobwebs sweeping dust and scraping slimy cavern growths from walls and ceilings but the last aerie was under siege and there were no thralls here now gorvi had other work for them perfect he said and took the coordinates direct from jasons mind and because he could feel the stirring of thralls and monsters in the roots of the fallen aerie whose ruins gave him shelter he lingered no longer but conjured a mobius door into wrathstack into the subterranean cave of gorvi the guiles wells and without pause despite that he was blind here he knew precisely where to spill uruk piatras corpse into the dark water after that a moment to say his farewell conjure another door and return to sunside where trask and chung waited for him nathan had been right devetaki skullguise now commanded vormulac taintspores army out of turgosheim in gloomy trog caverns at the eastern tip of the barrier mountains black boris was the only lord who was not aware that lord unsleep slept at last neither him nor a handful of watchers out on the boulder plains but the rest of them knew that vormulac had lived and died a true warrior in a massive battle with a savage szgany tribe west of the great pass hed killed fifty before he himself was overwhelmed staked and beheaded and even then the liveliness within him was not finished thered never been such an eruption of evil as when vormulac went up in flames but as finally the szgany savages were driven off vormulacs last message had passed from his mind into devetakis his plea that she take command of his army and tame these terrible heathen regions thus he had given this great task and the taking of the last aerie into her hands and after all it was only right for by now hers was the greatest of all the contingents consisting of her own forces and lord wamuss which shed commandeered and now vormulacs otherwise leaderless force which had been a small army in its own right so the vampire lords had finally succumbed to the virgin grandams leadership zindevar was with her now and devetaki had just this moment finished explaining to that lady her plan a female conspiracy to remove all power from the lords and rule as a matriarchy the ladies would have it their way for once and for always ursula torspawn might perhaps rule in turgosheim zindevar could choose between eastern sunsidestarside from the trog caverns in the east to the great pass or the as yet mainly unexplored territory west of the pass devetaki would be happy to take the other half you have no preference things had swung round so rapidly that zindevar was still suspicious the land is vast devetaki shrugged but who knows in a hundred years time we might argue over it it will take that long at least to explore and tame it zindevar saw the logic of that and laughed and was serious in a moment devetaki you have a deal but some of these men may prove hard nuts to crack however and since it appears youve already cracked the hardest and gazing at the virgin grandam zindevars eyes were hooded devetaki ignored the remark apparently but putting on her frowning mask she looked out across starside i can smell morning she said oh sunup is way off as yet but its coming and theres work for you tomorrow eh for me for you and yours aye devetaki looked at her there are men in the pass with strange weapons they are a superior breed of szgany who were exploring starside when we came from the east knowing that we would pick them off in the open they took refuge in an ancient keep in the pass vormulac gave wamus the task of clearing them out but the batlord failed and paid the price he and his bloodsons with him now zindevars suspicions ran rampant oh and is it that i should pay the price too not a bit of it i took one of these men prisoner and so know their plans come sunup theyll head south for sunside and safety ah but the pass is as a dogleg this side is darkness and that side is light youll ambush them there take them for your own grow mighty with their weapons zindevar was astonished you do this for me why not take the men their weapons the pass for yourself this is the sign of our pact said devetaki i make it willingly so that you can see im genuine now listen there are only a handful of these men but their weapons are mighty however a crafty ambush should do the job and there are none so crafty as zindevar of cronespire whats more when you take them you take the pass itself from that time forward it shall be zindevars pass and the keep shall be croneskeep you would make me strong zindevars gasp said much for her mixed emotions but exactly said devetaki how can we hope to hold a world if were weak wheres the profit in a weak alliance while in her secret mind whichever way it goes you and yours will be reduced in the fighting i shall see to that nor is your contingent the strongest by any means what a handful of hairy women lieutenants and a bunch of cringing eunuchs ill be waiting as you come out of the pass when you are at your weakest zindevar heard none of this she saw only that devetaki had removed her frowning mask replacing it with the one that smiled having eaten and rested a while nathan trask and chung were ready and armed dressed in typical szgany garb dark browns greens but mainly greys to blend with the volcanic colours of the mountains their shadowy crags and slopes and with their cheeks foreheads hands daubed in the stain of plants and soot of fires they appeared as desperate a trio as lardis ever saw looking at the necroscopes guerillas from some short distance away the old lidesci folded his hands over his chest and thought aye best look out all you lords and ladies for here comes hell all of lardiss people knew about the necroscopes weird powers now and most of them were there to see the heroes off they formed a silent ring about a central fire but stood well back allowing plenty of room so that when nathan formed his mobius door it would not suck them in this was a fable spread by lardis to allow the necroscope his privacy too many people were aware of him wanted to talk to him touch him the saviour of the szgany possibly he was definitely becoming a legend among lardiss people no less than he was among the thyre nathan stood with head down eyes closed in conversation with grinner east of the pass docks survivors kept watch on the wamphyri grinner had joined them in the last seven hours he had crossed the pass climbed into the heights taken temporary command a massive effort the army out of the east had settled in now sunup was less than twenty hours away apart from a handful of marauders from various contingents who had gone down into the east of sunside to forage for flesh in the forests the main body of vampire invaders was here through grinner nathan had passed on his requirements to docks vengeful grey brothers noting his needs theyd chosen various vantage points grinner passed the coordinates which entered nathans metaphysical mind clear as a picture so that he knew he could home in on them with the directional instinct of why of a wolf of course and ready he said at last as he formed his door trask and chung moved closer formed a triangle with him then the darkness weightlessness and even temperature of the continuum and a moment later the cold and starlit heights over starside simultaneously trask and chung drew breath in twin gasps aimed their weapons but the necroscope at once cautioned them no trask however had already blocked chungs aim with his own body hed read the truth of the situation that this was an ally for there on a bluff high over starside it was only the evil visage of grinner who greeted them and silently whiningly with his head cocked on one side and fangs showing the wild wolf passed on more details of the vampire encampments to his blooduncle nathan keogh the party farthest to the east camped under a slope of sliding shale only a handful of pines and an outcropping boulder or two protect them from a mighty avalanche if you and your strange new weapons were able to bring down sanctuary rock youll have no trouble causing havoc there also the lord who killed dock that one is located behind a fall in the frozen lava river where he will keep his men and creatures from the dawns sunlight but we have discovered a blowhole into which you can pour your liquid fire from above marvellously intelligent grinner had read the nature of nathans weapons right out of his mind nodding grimly the necroscope noted the coordinates of an ancient fumarole over a lava cliff and in the caves below a large body of men and monsters smiling however coldly nathan glanced at the compact flamethrower slung over david chungs shoulder anything else not for now in and out uncle do not overstretch yourself these are vampires and react with speed that was docks mistake and we have lost enough of kin good advice especially from a wily wolf nathan explained the task to his colleagues then said first the avalanche grenades i think we simply roll them down the slope ill drop you off first ben then david and take my own position at the end of the line spaced out fifty yards apart that will make a line one hundred yards long and everything beneath us will be swept down onto starsides foothills let devetaki skullguise pick the bones out of that the necroscopes phrasing was perhaps unfortunate trask thought it seemed to him not at all unlikely that indeed the lady would pick the bones out of that nor would she let the meat go to waste afterwards nathan continued til pick you up and we move to location number two he explained what was required and without further ado they made the jump and emerged at grinners precise coordinates above them the gaunt grey crags escarpments peaks solid ground all of it but below them exactly as grinner had foretold a steep surface of sliding shale built up over many years and only held back from sweeping down on to starside by a narrow band of pines a compacted scree barrier and jagged outcrops which were the volcanic stuff of the mountains themselves and beneath that in a thicker band of trees and under the protective cover of shallow ledges the movements of men and beasts the mewling of complaining warriors a flyer launching even now the starlit glint of armour nathan dropped off trask then chung made another jump and looked back and signalled as their pins were pulled the grenades made a triple chching almost but not quite an innocent sound in the still of the starside night and drawn by gravity the deadly eggs were lobbed and went bouncing downhill as the necroscope collected chung and paused at trasks location to watch the outcome which was devastating the first two grenades went off almost together right in the mass of compacted scree and a splitsecond later the third exploded just beyond the precarious barrier not only the concussion of the triple blasts but also their reverberating detonations rang out and echoed back to shake the mountainside and the entire surface of the slope immediately beneath the three men at once began to move they scrambled hurriedly backwards away from the sliding ground to the solid rock above where they sat with jaws hanging open very nearly appalled by what they had done the mountain commenced rumbling fifty yards west and a hundred and fifty east the mountainside was on the move the scree barrier caved in before a wave of cascading rocks dirt and shale and the line of scraggy trees was uprooted without pause or mercy the piled debris of the heights undisturbed for decades by anything louder than the mournful howling of a wolf or the pull of an eccentric moon now found itself stampeded by an uproar manufactured in another world avalanche and it was all that the necroscope had hoped it would be it wiped the side of the mountain clean right down to solid bedrock the stand of pines stood no more but was swept away the vampire encampment ceased to be was caught up rolled under hurled down and buried men and beasts uttered startled cries but only a few found time to scream mewl or rumble a second flyer riderless lofted itself out of danger but more from astonishment or instinct than fear for there had scarcely been time for fear to register in a way it had been merciful more than they deserved nathan told no one in particular then because he had learned something about himself he stiffened his resolve for the next attack this one would not be so merciful they emerged from the mobius continuum at dinners precise coordinates and went straight into action david chung loped to the grotesque moltencandle rim of a fumarole some eighteen inches in diameter unslung his flamethrower primed the pilot light and laid the deadly cylinder aside then pulled pins and dropped two grenades one after the other right down the throat of the blowhole and taking up the flamethrower even as the first muffled detonation sounded he sent liquid fire roaring straight down into the unseen caverns beneath nathan and trask had stepped cautiously to the edge of the falls a weathered cliff of lava and waited there with their weapons at the ready they felt the volcanic rock under their feet shudder twice and in another moment smoke and fumes came pouring from the dripped candlefat curtain of the falls fifteen feet below screams sounded a hideous bellowing and the pitiful mewling of flyers but somewhere in there deep in the suddenly chaotic darkness docks murderers who had eaten him might survive still and nathan felt no pity an eruption of smoke and sulphur stench from breaks in the curtain and a spew of monstrous life emerged human torches blazed as vampire thralls beat at themselves to put out the flames and spilled breakneck down the course of the solidified lava river a small warrior came coughing into view puffed up confused furious and perhaps even a little frightened it fired its propulsors to get aloft but its aerial gasbladers were on fire exploding one by one they blew the creature to and fro in midair until suddenly it lost its balance capsized and went crashing down among the howling men to add to the confusion nathan and trask tossed grenades into the mefee then as chung continued to pour fire down the blowhole a trio of bulky scorched shouting lieutenants came scrambling into view there could be no mistaking such as these for common thralls they were huge men they wore leather armour studded with gold wargauntlets swung from their belts and their eyes were feral yellow cored with red while they were not yet wamphyri the time would come when they might be if they survived but nathan didnt intend that they should at the necroscopes signal ben trask opened up with his machinepistol his fire scythed among the disorientated vampires two were cut down and were back on their feet almost as quickly with such as these simple bullets wouldnt get it done but nathans vendetta especially with these vampires was a personal thing and his weapon was something special as the three lieutenants limped to the side of the lava falls and came scrambling one lurching up a moonscape jumble of rocks towards their attackers nathan took careful aim and fired his first bolt it took his target through breastplate sheathing muscle and ribs and knocked him backwards on to the man immediately behind him a splitsecond later the detonation of the explosive bolt killed both of them while the third was drenched in their blood and draped in red and black shreds of gristle before he could recover trask lobbed a grenade by the time the flash had burned itself out on their retinae and the detonation had stopped echoing off the mountains nathans guerillas saw only a grotesque disassembly a crumpled torso and a tangle of meat barely identifiable as the innards of a man steaming on the rocks but some fifty yards away at the eastern end of the lava falls other men and monsters were now streaming like hornets from a broken hive out of caverns unaffected by david chungs firestorm even as trask opened up again with his gun a small warrior fired its propulsors and throbbed aloft and a lieutenant leaped to grab his flyers trappings as the beast skittered skywards it seemed a good time for the guerillas to make an exit except who what how a vampire lord appeared from the wreck and reek of the cavern immediately below their vantage point and probed the night with senses more than the usual five he must have been in a partitioned private area that hadnt suffered chungs cleansing fire and this was the one the man himself that nathan wanted he knew him at once eighteen months ago in runemanse in turgosheim nathan had been present at a meeting of maglore and lord grigor hakson of gauntmanse grigors luck in the draw for the getout of sunside had been bad for a long time his tokens brought him no girls the seerlord had ample females and grigor wanted to trade young males maglore needed men for work he was carrying out in runemanse the excavation of living and workareas and grigor wanted the girls for his own purposes they didnt call him grigor the lech for nothing this was the selfsame lord grigor the lech tall thin slategrey shifty and slanteyed his black topknot shiny with grease human fat as nathan well knew a loathsome lord of the wamphyri but more than that this was the creature or the master of creatures who had killed dock for food he was naked he carried a young woman obviously szgany she was naked too and recently dead her suffering rang in the necroscopes metaphysical mind the deadspeak aether shuddered with it she wasnt hurting now but the torture she had known would burn in her memory for a long time perhaps forever hush now nathan told her let it go for aji of thats behind you now and youre not ajone wait and see only jet them in and youll have friends galore i for one would consider it an honour afraid for now the girl couldnt answer but she had heard and would remember the sheer power of nathans emotional sending was such however that she wasnt the only one who heard grigor could not know what the psychic disturbance signified but his vampire probe tracked its source instantly his greygleaming head jerked up his scarlet eyes swivelled like some weird chameleons to light on nathan and the others at the rim of the lava falls then he glanced at the girl in his arms a lifeless rag thing a mere distraction and tossed her down she went slipping and sliding down the stone river gathering speed until she hurtled over a lesser rim and plunged from view with a little luck no creature would find and devour her and eh grigor grunted what men as if they could not possibly be the source of this disaster nathan had reloaded his crossbow now without knowing why or without consciously thinking it in a moment of red rage he cried aye men szgany szgaaany and feeling his passion ben trask and david chung joined him szgany szgany lieutenants and thralls had meanwhile climbed up onto the far lip of the falls and came running crouching small warriors were in flight circling a flyer and rider came swooping setting the night thrumming with vibrating airtrap wings nathan got off a shot at grigor but his hands were shaking with rage and the bolt flew wide by inches striking rock it was deflected into the air and there detonated with a blinding flash and loud report it was enough for grigor the lech he took cover at once trask opened up on the oncoming vampires scything their legs from under them and chung torched the air above driving the flyer offcourse but theyd done all they could here and knew it as grigor stuck his head out from behind an outcrop nathan would make one last effort to get him a grenade he cried huskily give me a grenade im out said trask and chung as one man weve used them all and trask added nathan those warriors are descending the necroscope groaned his frustration and grew calm in a moment then aiming his telepathic thoughts direct into grigors mind he sent we go now but well be back tonight maybe tomorrow and tomorrow certainly ajways and despite that his mentalism surprised grigor still he sent back bastard szgany dogs you are dead men you and whoever you serve oh nathan returned no you are wrong vormujac was the one to die and if devetaki has her way the rest of you lords will be next warrior stench was falling all around a monstrous shadow came sputtering across the lava falls nathan conjured a door guided trask and chung inside and out again at the sunside camp his exit area was in a ropedoff clump of trees a cry went up and lardis lidesci came running how did it go then he stepped back a pace for hed smelled warrior it went well nathan answered steadying his colleagues where they swayed and staggered the mobius route was dizzying even to esper minds and before lardis could question further where are zek lan goodly andrei romani several of lardiss men had followed him he sent one of them to find andrei and the two latest arrivals in sunside and while the necroscope waited he told trask and chung get what rest you can dont worry about me ill be resting too as soon as i have a chance but not until ive caused a deal more havoc what do you want with zek trask was worried for her she and goodly left weapons at the starside gate mainly grenades nathan answered were running low and should try to recover them while we can just the one jump ben and then zek is out of it i wont use her again if i can avoid it but she and i are both telepaths we can stay in contact with each other while simultaneously watching the boulder plains remember i cant get too close to the gate personally not and use the mobius continuum but in any event i wont take zek along if lan says its going to be in any way dangerous okay trask nodded look after her thats all misha came and nathan walked aside with her a little way tomorrow morning youre all mine she said hero or not necroscope or whateveryoull lie with me out on the savanna in the clean sunlight and sweet long grass and like it ill love it he told her huskily hugging her close but the night isnt over yet and you still have work i know how is it going on the starside slopes of the barrier mountains we spilled a deal of wamphyri blood and more to spill a lot of it where next after ive recovered a new cache of weapons the last aerie wrathstack her jaw fell open nathan thats dangerous living here is dangerous but ive seen a free world misha or almost free and i want the same for us while wrathstack and the barrier mountains turgosheim and starside remain safe habitat for vampires that free world simply cant be weve been their sustenance for far too long and now its our turn so while i may ill strike at them again and again she kissed his mouth to a standstill breathlessly said whatever you say but tomorrow youre mine but not in the long grass where then in a place you wont believe that place she meant the mobius continuum and looked wary uncertain but he smiled and told her no but well use it to get there unless you like the idea of a long long walk across the furnace desert at which point the timely arrival of zek goodly and andrei romani saved him from further questions the recovery of the weapons at the gate went without incident out on the boulder plains to the northeast there were signs of some activity strange shapes in the sky and what sounded like the echo of a distant explosion but nothing in the immediate vicinity nathan stood off from the gate with zek and let the other men drag the buggy out on to the crater rim and collect the weapons when they were through they toppled the buggy down on to the faintly phosphorescent plain wheeled it into a small clump of rocks and did their best to disguise it then they rejoined zek and nathan and he took all three back to camp the russianmade handgrenades proved simple things to use they were armed by twisting small projecting fins until the internal mechanism began to tick like a clock then for best effect a count of three before hurling nathan let lardis test just one it caused a flash made a loud noise felled a small tree the old lidesci was satisfied he and his senior men the cavers and nathans party received four each of these deadly eggs which used up half of them the rest of them were to be treated like gold or on sunside like silver the remaining ammunition explosive bolts and bullets of various calibre was shared out between the men with hellland weapons david chung had proved himself more than proficient with a flamethrower and retained it the other torch went to one of carlings cavers nathan ordered the remaining rocketlauncher wrapped up in an oiled skin along with its warheads if the time should come he would use it himself and so finally the weapons had been apportioned then trask took nathan aside and said why so keen to get these arms distributed nathan looked at him was it that obvious to me it was if anything happens to you you want to be sure these weapons will be put to the best possible use nathan nodded im going into wrathstack again he said oh ill be in and out as quickly as possible but accidents sometimes happen you are going in trask repeated him with the emphasis on you on your own why that nightmarish place again nathans shrug was perhaps fatalistic but in no way careless im going in alone because i cant risk taking anyone with me he said i have to be able to get out fast as for why im doing it well weve given the army out of the east something to worry about so now i want to even up the score a bit but didnt you do that with uruk piatra lardis told us all about it yes but wratha and the others in the last aerie dont know about uruk not yet i want to do something thats a lot more immediate dramatic something theyll remember to play on their nerves and throw them offbalance while he spoke he pocketed extra grenades youll be careful of course nathan nodded the worst thing about it is ill have to use zek again i know i promised not to but i need a lookout shell be on the boulder plains in a safe place just watching or rather listening out for me and if something goes wrong she could be trapped there is that why you wanted me to get some sleep you know it isnt i hadnt thought it out thats all and of course trask knew it was the truth then im glad i didnt sleep he said because im coming with you nathan couldnt deny him they went and found zek out on the boulder plain the necroscope found a suitable place to leave the two the vacant ruins of a toppled stack on the very fringe of the mileswide cluster of ancient wamphyri tumuli and went on alone keeping well clear of gorvis ambush party he emerged several hundred yards away from wrathstacks scree and rubblebedded base and moved quickly into the shadow of a massive boulder the numbers vortex swirled in his metaphysical mind shielding it and ready at a moments notice to conjure an escape route but with less than seventeen hours to sunup he should be comparatively safe in wrathstack and wherever gorvis groundbased creatures lurked now the vampires would sense dawns approach from personal experience in turgosheim nathan knew that the lords and ladies and common vampires alike normally took to their beds in the hours before sunup maglore himself had been a rare exception but in the last aerie the barrier mountains turgosheim and wherever vampires were to be found theyd be sleepy now indeed the necroscope knew they were their thoughts were vague disjointed and fragmentary where he probed them with a light telepathic touch but perhaps not all of them there were rather more active minds wellguarded on the other side of the stack in any case satisfied he contacted zek alls well yes and it was time ii assault on wrathstack the doglords dire predictions nathan used deadspeak to contact jason lidesci jason how is the stack arranged not guilesump but the rest of the levels where are the gasbeasts situated jason came back at once in madmanse the killglance brothers have control of gas production they have the levels over gorvis youll recognize the gasbeast pens from their round windows not windows at ajj but vents they surround madmanse in an almost complete circle like a ring that dips from south to north and follows the slant of the rock strata this effect is most pronounced in suckscar named first after vasagi the suck then for the sloping scars where soft rock has weathered out the rock of the gasbeast level in madmanse has to be soft too for the vents are far too regular to be natural they were tunnelled in ages past by the wamphyri nathan could see the ring of circular openings that banded wrathstack like a bracelet the pens were on the perimeter and so there must be access to them from within and as he now saw from without for looking closer in the bluetinged starlight he could make out ledges and bone and cartilage scaffolding on the stacks exterior for maintenance of course it was all he needed to know except vasagi the suck he sent his deadspeak hoarse as a snarl he dwells up there near the top of the stack where its sides are worn into scars ah no no longer suckscar was vasagis place but now it belongs to another vasagi was usurped there was something here that nathan couldnt understand usurped no he was killed by wran the rage and suckscar went to your brother the necromancer nestor lichloathe but that cant be nathan said why this very night vasagi has murdered my mother nona kiklu in sunside i can only report what ive heard from the dead of wrathstack jason answered for i was already dead when vasagi and wran duelled on sunside two flew out but only wran returned nathan would like to explore the riddle further but must let it go for now in any case the dead of wrathstack would be vampires in death as in life they would be liars perhaps they had lied to jason too jason had heard his thoughts of course quietly he said i know that you dont incjude me in that no of course i dont nathan told him the others deadspeak sigh my thanks jason nathan sent and jumped to within two hundred yards of the base of wrathstack now the last aerie of the wamphyri towered over him like some monstrous menhir a dizzy pile rising up and up taller than the mightiest building of trasks earth and broader at its base than three city blocks but nathan had precious little time to feel awed or even afraid a moment for orientation and he jumped up onto a high ledge in the face of madmanse close to the wide rim or sill of one of the vents which was all of seven feet in diameter from within nothing no sound nor even the noxious smell of a gasbeast the chamber was empty disappointed the necroscope crouched down and hurried along the ledge which was precarious in places where it narrowed or sloped towards the sighing gulf of air forty paces took him to a second gas vent likewise innocent of sounds or smells here the ledge tapered out and he must clamber down onto a flexible walkway of cartilage vertigo did not concern him he knew that even if he fell it would be through a door into the mobius continuum but still he proceeded cautiously to the third circular shaft where the night air shimmered with expelled methane and the reek of a gasbeast was all too evident from within soft sighing sounds nathan fingered the grenades in his pockets and was tempted but knew now that his original plan wouldnt work he had wanted to emulate his father harry keogh and cause a devastating simultaneous or chainreactive explosion that would bring down the stack in its entirety but wrathstack wasnt right for it even if all the gasbeast chambers had been occupied still the sheer girth of the stack would have protected it the outer caverns would be blown away most certainly but ninety per cent of the stem would be left intact for it had been more than any merely explosive force that the original necroscope had used it had been the almost nuclear power of the furnace sun itself which had instantly eaten into the rock of the many fallen aeries like some vengeful cleansing acid and so it seemed a lesser plan was now in order any action was better than none beyond the occupied gasbeast chamber the cartilage catwalk spanned the mouth of a landingbay camouflaged with hanging nets of woven rope nathan felt sure that even this close to sunup there were bound to be watchers just inside he made a mobiusjump across the gap which set the catwalk swaying a little on the other side as it took his sudden weight balancing himself without further pause he went on to the next vent this chamber was also occupied which decided nathan upon his course of action grenades into each of the two loaded chambers and two more into the landingbay itself anyone within the bay would see him in the moment that he tossed his grenades and then they wouldnt see him if there were survivors let them worry about that if there were none so much the better still the rest of wrathstacks monstrous inhabitants would be inconvenienced and more than a little concerned over what had happened here the unfortunate but mainly insensitive gasbeasts would surely be destroyed and their chambers reduced to rubble with a bit of luck the landingbay itself would suffer damage and even destruction nathan knew the coordinates of the first occupied chamber and the landingbay and he had been here long enough but first a quick probe in zeks direction is all well yes and almost immediately with a thrill of horror no look he read it in her mind knew where to look then saw it for himself coming out from behind wrathstack at his own level but some threequarters of a kilometre away a fantastic sight a gasbeast swollen with its own gases puffed up and grotesque a living balloon in tow behind a pair of lieutenants mounted on straining flyers their necks outstretched with effort while in the necroscopes mind zek shouted and behind you he looked the other way to where a second beast was now hauled into view from behind the eastern flank of the stack for an anxious moment nathan thought that the appearance of these creatures must have to do with his presence here but in the next moment he knew it wasnt so it was just a coincidence and as his nerves settled down again he shrank back into a crevice in the aeries wall and remembered those mysterious explosions hed heard out on the boulder plains now he knew or strongly suspected what they had been he had likened the floating gasbeasts to weird balloons in fact they were bombs and his mind went back to the stories lardis used to tell of the battle at the dwellers garden when the wamphyri had used just such tactics against harry and the dweller now peering from his hiding place nathan could see the payloads at the end of long taut lines where they hung from the flyers saddles bundles of hooks weighted with large stones flintstones the necroscope was sure and pictured on the screen of his mind the rest of it was clear the beast would be towed to its target then cut free to drift lower as it descended the flyer would sweep overhead raking the living bomb with razorsharp hooks the clatter and clash of metal and flints against metamorphic flesh a tearing of bloated leather and simultaneous striking of sparks the sudden hiss of pressured gases then the deafening searing blast and outrageous rush of heat and stench the picture faded in nathans mind but not before it had reminded him of why he was here the flyers riders and their grotesque cargoes were heading south one a little to the west of south the other a little to the east their target destination vormulacs observation posts of course it explained why so many methane chambers were empty and soon two more would be empty if they existed at all he took a grenade twisted the fins listened to the ominous ticking start and without pause hurled the deadly egg right into the vent then without waiting a mobiusjump back to the first occupied vent and the second grenade was on its way into the stack another jump to a spot central on the cartilage catwalk in front of the camouflaged landingbay two more grenades armed and lobbed one after the other through the mesh of the hanging nets just inside the mouth of the bay there was movement in there and nathan opened his mind to let in the startled thoughts of those who guarded the way astonishment shock outrage bjoodjust fear yes because for all these thralls knew nathan might be only the first of a huge invading taskforce which had somehow managed to creep up on them unseen but of course he couldnt stay here he backflipped from the catwalk into empty air flattened his body conjured a door and hurtled through it found his coordinates and stepped back into normal space where zek and trask were waiting and watch he breathed which was about as much as he had time for four bright flashes lit the southfacing wall of the last aerie a third of the way up from the explosions on the flanks came stabbing gouts of fire secondary flashes hurtling chunks of rock and clouds of smoke and rubble centrally twin bursts of light and fire shook down an avalanche of loose debris from above and both sides of the landingbay fragile walkways went plummeting fractured slabs of rock teetered outwards falling in a deceptive distancewrought slowmotion into space then came the cracks of the detonations sharp as knives in the silence echoing out over starside to the barrier mountains and back again and the rubble blasted out or shaken free of the stack was still falling bringing down a tangle of flying buttresses from lower levels more walkways various ramps and manmade staging areas all going down in a mighty roiling of dust and a rumble like thunder onto the scree slopes at the foot of the stack it went on for a long time when it was over the landingbay was a gaping hole twice what it had been the ruptured vents on both sides were black and issued twin columns of smoke onesixth part of the southfacing wall had been wiped clean of all artificiality natural rock remained showing a uniform grey among a variety of dull ochres greens blacks and yellows it served to show how the outer sheath of that great fang had been changed and festooned by its vampire tenants over the long centuries of their habitation likewise its interior carved hollowed and whittled out like an old branch full of earwigs a rotten old branch yes and nathan found himself thinking yet again if old dimi petrescus powder common gunpowder in copious amounts could sink sanctuary rock and if i knew exactly where to locate it in wrathstack for maximum effect but his thoughts were suddenly interrupted as trask said maybe we can capitalize on the situation he was armed with a selfloading rifle and sniperscope which he aimed into the sky at some twenty degrees without looking nathan knew what trasks target would be reaching up he pulled the barrel of the gun out of alignment no he said glancing at the triangle of flyers and gasbeast maybe a mile away and drawing closer by the moment let them go it suits our purpose to let them reach their destination theyre on their way to bomb devetakis observers probably a suicide mission im not against these monsters killing each other and anyway it saves ammunition trask nodded however reluctantly and said as you will so whats next im tired said nathan and trask saw it in his face it was going to take a long time for the necroscopes system to catch up on all the energy hed expended one or two days even sunside days wouldnt do it i want to get some sleep nathan went on normal undisturbed sleep with my wife in my arms and nothing to think about or worry over i need oh i dont know eight hours at least after that sunup will be so close that we can guarantee the vampires will be at their lowest ebb thats when well hit them again and with that they returned to the camp of the lidescis apart from the night watch the camp at the edge of the savanna slept but in the last aerie despite that a perhaps imagined stain of light was already washing the southern horizon lying like a luminous mist between the peaks wratha and the vampire lords were still awake time enough for sleeping when the peaks themselves turned from wolfgrey to gold but for now there was much to occupy them or to occupy their evil minds at least wratha was on the roof of wrathspire attended by a small personal warrior a bodyguard which kept itself mainly to the shadows she paced to and fro wandering aimlessly in and out of the battlements towers and turrets pausing now and then to gaze south and wonder what the army out of turgosheim was up to now and what its next move would be but quite apart from the constant nagging worry of the bloodwar the fact that wrathstack was under siege and not only that but actually coming under a form of attack if the inexplicable explosions in madmanse were anything to go by there were other more personal matters to concern her for her vampire instinct told her that all was not well with wratha herself except she knew that it was more than mere instinct beside a semicircular stone structure on the southfacing rim of the sloping plateau where an ironwood gantry and hoist stood to one side its dangling chains clanking in a breeze off the icelands she paused at a door to peer inside in there a grim reminder of the history of this place a massive cage of deadly silver all tarnished and darkstained its bars were an inch thick welded reinforced with iron the effort of some szgany metalworker long gone into air or earth or the belly of a beast or the vats of its wamphyri master how many enemies or victims wratha wondered had some agesforgotten lord locked in that cage hoisted on high and swung out over the rim of the stack to await the dawn it had been vormulac taintspores wont in the past to do much the same thing and in the future but she must not dwell on such things and so put it aside for now what had been had been and no man or woman knew the future the present had surprises enough and terrors too terror in the black heart of a vampire it seemed strange to wratha wrong somehow that she should feel afraid but not of men not of the army out of turgosheim not of anything outside her own body afraid of something within it wratha bathed frequently and recently everincreasingly it wasnt that she was unclean but that she felt unclean and all because of a blemish or two or three persistent blemishes that her vampire leech couldnt shift that her metamorphic flesh couldnt deal with let her will the the marks away and they would be back in a matter of hours let her scrub the silvery scales from her forearms and calves until her flesh was red under the clean pink of a young girl and they would return just as soon as wrathas leech repaired her skin yes she could scrub till her flesh was numb except it was growing hard to tell when it wasnt numb in those certain areas under her left breast the fingers of her right hand her right thigh where it curved into a oncesmooth buttock and all of this dating from a time the start of it all just four sunups ago but her forearms the lady wratha had prided herself on her young girls arms and now she wore pale cream gloves to her elbows thin leather trogskin peeled from living arms softened and bleached in urine and scented with oil of roses it was infuriating and it was worrying so that on occasion wratha had wondered if but that was impossible shed had no contact with there had been no sign of infection in in all wrathstack nestor she put the thought aside like so many others a niggling doubt that was all if only he wouldnt wrap himself up so it was his art she knew nestor talked to the dead and imitated their cerements but the original thought would not stay put aside he too hid his flesh but she had seen his body his beautiful body she had even loved it frequently she had rubbed his liquids into her skin sipped them from his jerking shaft but love had died as all things must finally shed stopped seeing him shortly after his brief sojourn in sunside no he had stopped seeing her but why had he stopped seeing her when his just had been such a fire in him he had sensed her dwindling desire for him that was it except it had not dwindled until recently the bloodwar had intervened that too was a recent thing it was the nature of vampires to love and leave and was it also the doglords nature to build a wall of stone between himself and his oncegreat friend never a word of explanation out of canker who now went about his business with such a hangdog expression and in suckscar all of nestors thralls creeping like ghouls the general air of infirmity about the place the sense of descending doom my lady wratha gave a massive start and spun cursing on her heel it was a thrall come up out of wrathspire to find her his eyes were full of some strange terror but not of his mistress and he brought a message from gorvi the guile following which wrathas eyes were filled with the same dark dread the lords and lady flew down into guilesump all were there except nestor who had retired to bed early leaving instructions that he was not to be disturbed the lady siggi was likewise missing but her absence was excusable siggi had not as yet ascended in the fullest sense of the word as the doglords mistress her role was in any case secondary her conversation was limited and not entirely well sensible also she was grown very beautiful no extremely beautiful so that wratha didnt want her there anyway wratha the doglord wran the rage and spiro killglance were met by one of gorvis lieutenants just inside a landingbay in guilesumps central level a hundred and fifty feet over the sloping scree jumbles debris from the madmanse explosions was still being cleared from the entrance flanking platforms and stanchions were no longer in evidence other external fixtures sagged and looked ready to tumble into space at any moment as yelloweyed thralls manoeuvred their flyers aside and tethered them gorvis man took the four callers to his master in an openroofed annexe to one side of the landingbay where the guile stood well back and watched others of his men burning corpses the stinking black smoke went up roiling under a domed ceiling until it was sucked out around a tangle of wreckage into the night huh said the gauntvisaged gorvi as he turned and saw his visitors this is where i boil up lead water piss and fats with which to repel invaders he waved a skeletal hand at a row of fireblackened cauldrons lining a wall then indicated the roof once there was a crack in the ceiling a natural chimney now a gash and dangerous why all that scrap scaffolding up there could fall in at any time the poisonous glance he cast at the killglance brothers said it all that in his opinion they should bear the blame for what had happened to the methane chambers it was the guiles way of distracting from his own possible negligence not only an oily bastard but a cheeky one wran snapped and spiro glared through eyes which were now thoroughly dissimilar canker seemed subdued however and wratha even more so when she said those burning bodies your message said there was a dead leper in the wells one dead leper but i see three corpses gorvi shrugged just the one leper aye but it took a pair of clean thralls to carry him up here or should i say onceclean what should i let them infect the entire stack idiot wran shouted what difference does it make how many thralls you burn now the stacks water is infected and that means the whole damned aerie wrathstack in its entirety is infected to hell with wrathstack wratha thought numbly but kept the thought wellguarded wratha herself is infected nestor too indeed nestor was the first yet how can it be and out loud frowningly gorvi how frequently do you inspect the wells a prowlerguard looks in on the wells every two to three hours he answered breathlessly normally id have a man or men down there all the time to keep the place immaculate but these are not normal times and i must man the gantlets slowly but surely wratha was growing angry now that the shock the fact of her condition was known to her beyond any further doubt she could begin to react to it this gorvi ah what a great liar every two to three hours but lord lichloathe had been suffering for oh a good threemonth since first he began to wrap himself in rags three months the stack must be steeped in plague wrathas reaction typical of her leech was beginning to make itself plain in her face form and voice as she hissed how is it then that i seem to recall and not so very long ago advising you to watch your wells most diligently did i not say that given half a chance our enemies would poison the wells with kneblasch well and it appears i was wrong for they have poisoned them with the body of a dead leper her voice had risen to a shrill of impotent fury or perhaps not impotent for gorvi was here within arms reach the guile would answer but couldnt seem to find the right words they were all against him spiro with his deadly killing eye the rabid canker wran with his rage mounting in him even now and wratha whose own furies made strong men whimper gorvi the guileless that lady stormed grown very tall and thin with her skin wrinkled and crimson eyes bulging hideously and are you also gutless i seem to remember the necromacer nestor lichloathe calling you that upon a time are you so weak you cant admit the truth even when it is known to everyone around you gorvi you have neglected your wells in these most difficult of times you may well have poisoned us all including myself he panted backed up against the wall as they turned on him in a body is it likely think what you are saying wratha think all of you would i knowingly or even negligently allow the wells to be poisoned and then bring it to your attention and did wran and spiro bomb their own gasbeasts too but isnt it obvious we are all the victims of some weird warfare and this time the truth was obvious wran saw it at once and however reluctantly said hes right the pens and chambers might possibly have been an accident only just possibly but the landingbay there was no gas in the landingbay but wratha snarled a moment ago gorvi would have given you the blame in order to lessen his own neglect and canker shook his head and growled we are at war indeed besieged yet here you stand bickering among yourselves hah and you dare to call me mad well make up your minds and decide what if anything is to be done and then let me know meanwhile im through wasting my time here my instrument of bones is finished perfected at last and i want to try it out before sunup he shook his head again worriedly slapped ineffectively at his ear whined his frustration and headed for the exit spiro killglance followed him snarling extra vigilance who or whatevers to blame for these affairs we must catch him out and punish him give him to me to blast with my eye vigilance with regard to this this pestilence too wratha was quick to call after them look for the signs and if you so much as suspect leprosy but deep inside she shuddered wran pointed his finger straight at gorvis nose and said gorvi this isnt finished you have been saved by circumstances alone the fact that madmanse has likewise suffered a weird and inexplicable attack but how can there be any excuse for a leprous body in the wells so be advised that when this bloodwar is over however it goes my war and yours begins you and i shall see it out together on sunside wran left and gorvi stood alone with a furious wratha to her he said lady i am not at fault and in all honesty despite her rage she couldnt see how he could be calming herself a little and shrinking back to a girl she said is it possible that this body has been there a long time might it have got stuck under a ledge out of sight only recently floating into view wratha he flapped his hands i have swimmers they are fit and well even now that corpse was put there deliberately and recently within the last three hours and nestor she thought again but how could he fit into this and anyway she wasnt even sure that he was a leper but she knew who would be sure except how could she inquire of the doglord without explaining her suspicions if canker canison had wanted to say something hed have said it by now but no hed left this place in short order eager to be out of it he was loyal as a pup that one to nestor so why not ask nestor himself direct and if he said yes then kill the bastard gorvi broke into her thoughts wran intends to kill me he rages she answered as is his wont we all rage as if someone had planned it so maybe youre right gorvi and an alien force is at work anyway lets leave it at that for now its all we can do but from now on no more errors i swear im not to blame he called after her as she in turn left a little later canker played moon music nestor heard him took a flyer and went down to the northfacing wall of mangemanse where it was pitted into great bays and windows like the bones of some ancient skull or toothless jaw since it was not his intention to land he caused his mount to form airtrap wings and hovering on a wind rising in the north he gazed on canker across a gulf of air where the doglord worked his baffles to make the bones of monsters sound and fill the aerie with his music as always it was a cacophony there might be something of a tune in it though far more a dirge than the original szgany love song and nestor thought i gave him this tune why is it the wamphyri murder everything there was nothing of humour in his inwardsdirected question in a little while canker saw him and sent well and do i make progress his thoughts had been morose they brightened a very little at sight of nestor for as long as the necromancer could remember the doglord had been his one friend the only creature he could truly trust indeed canker had been far more friend to him than he to canker for on occasion nestor had considered a time when canker would play the part of a mere lieutenant to himself but that was all in the past now there would be no such time no future at all not for nestor lichloathe anyway he would not hurt the doglord now not by word or deed your music is excellent he answered with a talent such as yours no wonder youve called maidens down from the moon except aye i didnt come to listen to your music if so i could do it from a window in suckscar canker nodded continued to work his baffles create his awesome noise i know why you came because you could not come down into guilesump i theyd seen you there it might all connect as you have connected it guilesump no but the rest it wasnt hard i pity you my friend and i have wept that we can no more run on sunside together like foxes among the chickens well it was all coming to an end anyway oh again cankers nod i scry the future in dreams nestor as well you know and for us there is no future for us you and i the wamphyri canker barked its finished all of it how soon soon myself nothing specific dont ask for you cant change it anyway im not always right youll tell me nothing more about the future no his music soared and the aerie shuddered the very air seemed to vibrate dust came trembling from the high ledges then tell me about this bane which burns like a cold fire in me devouring me as a fire devours the forest why have they called it the hundred year death when its spread is so swift and wicked canker kept on playing but between the notes nestor could hear his sobbing in some its a slow thing the doglord said but in others lightning fast its as if it were waiting to be triggered like a bolt in a szgany crossbow and in you the bolt is shot theres nothing i can do how may i advise you finally canker stopped playing his great wolfs eyes were wild wet red his muzzle quivered with some strange emotion what words can i say when my father knew the end was close he shagged his bitches one by one saddled a flyer and made for the sun myself i shall head for the moon to do battle with its puny priests for the love of its maidens but you youre you nestor and i may not advise you maybe youll be killed anyway in the bloodwar but out on the gulf of air nestor shook his head if im to die itll be my way oh all of this stems from one act one deed one betrayal that old itch on sunside the same your great enemy my brother aye he comes and goes he was even here what canker came to the rim of the bay and leaned out in madmanse nestor told him the gasbeasts and methane chambers that was him and in guilesump of course he was in guilesump i burned the leper colony on sunside what happened in guilesump was his reply i cannot be mistaken i have felt his numbers he he comes and goes everything that has happened to me all that is wrong in my life i can trace it back to him and canker he knows everything about me more far more than i do i have to kill him my blood brother and question him with my necromancy so that i too may know everything and again canker thought they call me mad but loving nestor lichloathe he did his best to keep the thought to himself so what will you do find him and kill him as ive said in sunside nestor nodded he has a day to live or i have your own brother your blood brother he was my brother now im wamphyri and he is my great enemy for a moment a great wave of sadness washed out from the doglord on the rim of the landingbay then a second wash of pain his ear his aching head the thing that ate into his brain it too came and went and as canker slapped at the side of his head nestor said were a mess you and i aye canker agreed but you are right its as well to end things as they have been to die as we have lived all my life i have worshipped my silver mistress moon now ill go to her and join the great ranks of wild wolves and dogs and foxes gone before me you have loathed for long and long which is a disease in itself well at least thats something you can cure i wish you good hunting r nestor said no more for there was nothing more to say he reined back sought a rising thermal and went up and up into suckscar and in a little while from below the sounds of the doglords moon music sounded again wratha had eavesdropped on all theyd said initially their thoughts had been loud to compensate for cankers music but theyd both appreciated the danger in that after a while however they hadnt much cared a sad conversation between genuine friends apart from devetaki wratha had never had a friend in a way she was jealous of the situation while in another she was afraid of it it might even seem to defy logic except her wamphyri logic had already defined it as the loyalty that a dog gives to his man but canker was only partdog and all wamphyri wherefore his own safety had been paramount finally he had wavered and built his wall now that she knew the whole truth wratha was surprised to discover so little of anger in herself not towards nestor anyway and wryly she queried the logic of that too what was it then the boundless love that exists between a bitch and her man scarcely but even lacking the human ability to understand it at least she could appreciate the facts in the case that as soon as nestor was sure of his condition hed stopped seeing her and he had been careful to keep himself apart from all of the others too unlike some wratha could name the necromancer had not deliberately tried to spread his curse abroad as for this great enemy of his well and perhaps even in this he was right weird warfare gorvi had called it a special talent according to nestor of a man who could move instantly from one place to another even miles apart without covering the distance between how else might one explain the damage to a madmanse landingbay or a leprous cadaver in gorvis wells so maybe wratha wouldnt kill lord lichloathe after all if this great enemy of his was real perhaps nestor should be allowed to deal with him in his own fashion and at the same time perform a great service for wrathstack anyway there was enough dissension in the aerie as it was and what would wrathas excuse be if she did kill nestor and what if his condition should be seen before she could dispose of his corpse it was general knowledge that theyd been lovers she remembered a legend of old turgosheim the story of lord kalk ingrison kalk had been shunned as a leper for more than one hundred and forty years and for that same period of time had used his amazing metamorphism to hold the disease at bay for kalk the blood really was the life he had required it by the gallon to fuel his metamorphism but following the introduction of an early form of the tithe system his plasma intake had been so reduced that it was the end of him in the space of a single night hed withered to a husk and crumbled into pieces and his very leech had been discovered riddled with leprosy ah but he had survived for a hundred and forty years and if kalk ingrison could do it so could wratha except first she must survive a bloodwar well only time would tell about that as for nestor if he survived his rendezvous with this nameless enemy his socalled blood brother but that too must be left to fate and time as for now wratha could hear the sighing of the sun even through a thousand miles of planets rock and she was certain that the southern sky was lightening by the minute if she was to be strong enough to repel the invaders out of the east she must have rest likewise her leech in order to find strength to defend her from the thing in her blood she took to her bed where she tossed and turned for long and long aware of all the evil of forgotten millenia it was in the very rock a cement of horror that held the last aerie erect against gravity time and all the immemorial hatred of sunsides szgany but for how much longer the doglords predictions seemed ominous an end to all this well forewarned is forearmed but how may one forearm oneself against the very end or was the knowledge simply there to be used as a last resort by someone wise enough to accept its inevitability once again only time would tell uppermost in turkur tzonovs mazed mind was a memory so monstrous it could only be a nightmare a bad dream which might yet be in progress he remembered a place of dusty gloom and creeping jeweleyed evil held down by men with the strength of giants and watched over by a woman with eyes red as a desert sunset hed suffered the bites a great many bites of creatures he could no longer bear to think about and all of this in addition to the agony indeed the delirium of pain from his torn body since when this dreary bleary malaise this sinister state of being of body and mind from which try as he might he could not raise himself up he floated light as a feather yet heavy as lead in a material void whose only substance was the disjointed fuzzy imagery of his own mind or rather such had been its substance until recently someone elses mind had impinged in itself this wasnt strange tzonov was a telepath he had experienced the thoughts of others they were usually accompanied by fear great fear of himself yet now he was the one who was afraid he had thought it was the darkness for the unknown dark is a fearsome place but the owner of the curiously naive yet intrusive mind had lit a candle following which shed been a stranger no longer for then looking into eyes that bored into his own like crimson drills tzonovs telepathy if very little else had sprung alive at which the oddly deficient yet malevolent and vindictive mind behind the crimson eyes had at once made itself known as that of siggi dam and everything had come flooding back to fill the dull unfeeling void with unbearable truth the truth of his situation but only the incomplete truth as he understood it that hed been poisoned by the paralysing bite of great spiders and was now in a weird halfcomatose condition cocooned and stored by those same creatures against an uncertain future a time of need when he would become their food and at that precise moment as suddenly tzonov knew that this was not a nightmare but a reality the here and now ah no siggi told him smiling like a shark to display her white needle teeth and scarlet gums not their food turkur but nourishment for their young their their young the thought floated out from his frozen brain encased in ice and in return she sent him an even colder picture which showed him exactly how it was and how it would be then as his mental screaming commenced and went on and on climbing ever higher along the scales of madness the lady siggi snuffed the candle and floated away into darkness leaving him with this one last thought you are their incubator turkur even though you cannot feel them they are in you even now so save your screams for later when you really will feel them and all too keenly following which he was alone with the dark and the numbness and the madness and siggis laughter slowly fading but not really alone for an alien multitude was right there with him ill devetaki quells the lords nathan further visitations in the camps of devetakis generals on the northfacing slopes of the barrier mountains there was trouble certainly there would be trouble if zindevar cronesap ursula torspawn and the virgin grandam herself were not there to face it down for the mood among the lesser lords was one of insurgency and devetaki scarcely required her superior mentalism to sense it which was why she now addressed a meeting of all her generals within the natural amphitheatre formed by an extinct volcanic cone close to her own headquarters the principal troublemaker was lord grigor hakson called the lech who in answer to devetakis ostensibly innocent air of surprised inquiry in the face of this undeserved hostility was first to voice his concern but there was little or nothing of lechery in grigor now only a righteous fury we had an army his voice rang out from the central area of the cone where he stood ringed about by restless scowling contemporaries we flew out of turgosheim under the banners of a mighty army where is it now and where are our successes by way of trade for these considerable losses if vormulac unsleep were here he would answer for these several failures but vormulac is not here nor is he anywhere no he is simply another casualty of his own poor planning and utterly ineffectual command you devetaki were his righthand man or woman indeed his adviser and you madame chose to take upon your shoulders the glory and responsibility of leadership well so be it now perhaps youd care to explain our ingloriously diminishing rank and file and the apparent lack of leadership up on the rim of the cone devetaki and the other ladies formed a matriarchal trio whose elevation in rank seemed emphasized by the terrain they stood high above lesser personages devetaki had been wearing her frowning mask a bad enough sign in itself but now before answering the lechs rabblerousing queries she removed her mask and scanned the assembly with a coldly horrific visage this unmasking of her flensed face was a sure sign of her vast displeasure so that she was not required to raise her voice as she answered so grigor we have a bloodwar and the first time youre blooded you squeal well i suppose it was only to be expected when a man gives up so much of his time and energy to wenching he cannot have a great deal left to devote to fighting indeed i have it on good authority that at the time of the attack you were astride some traveller whore stolen out of sunside is it not so grigor looked astonished he opened and closed his mouth then drew himself up to his full height we were told to make camp for the coming day naturally i took this to mean that the activities of the night were finished now tell me since when is it unlawful to use a woman out of sunside and anyway what has that to do with our armys failure to make inroads on wratha the risen in her aerie or the weird dangerous inhabitants of the lands south of these mountains devetaki sighed before repeating him so you took it to mean and here she paused but did you not also take it to mean that you should post a watch also just how many of these weird and dangerous szgany attackers set upon you in your camp a hundred fifty a dozen just what sort of a mighty horde was it that caused such devastation in the camp of grigor the lech grigor fumed they had the advantage of surprise and superior weaponry and they had taken up an inaccessible strategic position from which to launch their attack inaccessible she contrived to look puzzled but what of your flyers warriors lieutenants thralls are you saying that you could not bring a single one of your men or creatures to bear against these vile murderous attackers or is it that you were simply unprepared or perhaps your men and beasts were all well should we say otherwise engaged as you yourself grigor and for a second time inaccessible what like wratha in her soaring aerie do you mean but out in the open on the lava slopes again i ask just how many of these dangerous incredibly vicious travellers were there er three is the number which i have heard bruited but of course i know that this must be a joke what three common men out of sunside szgany against the might of grigor hakson grigor sputtered but giving him no time to recover devetaki went on as for their inaccessible position i take it you mean that this overwhelming force of three wild and heavily weaponed supermen had discovered the weakness of your defensive positions that is assuming that you had planned to man such positions also assuming that youd checked to see if such positions existed in the first place and if so that they couldnt possibly become available to an enemy and that somehow despite all of your most sensible precautions the barbarians were nevertheless able to use them to their own advantage grigor was now genuinely furious his face had turned a purplish grey his chest heaved his eyes were wide and wild and he had difficulty speaking i had camped my men and creatures beneath the frozen lava flow to provide protection from tomorrows sunlight but do you speak of defensive positions now tell me lady since when have the wamphyri required to so much as consider defensive positions since now devetaki remained calm but her voice had hardened since my lord vormulac is no more murdered by the very szgany who attacked you or if not by them by others of the same blood what are we incapable of learning a simple lesson and grigor do not pretend that you would question vormulac in this fashion why the mere suggestion would find you fed balls first to his favourite warrior as well you know ah but its easy to be brave after the fact and grigor try not to splutter so it only serves to illustrate your dismal inefficiency for if you cant even defend yourself verbally quite obviously you would be easy prey to far more physical attacks as you have been physical attacks he blurted the words slurring from his mouth in an almost drunken fashion lady ive had more than enough of a tonguelashing from you and if its a physical attack youd like to see he came striding thrusting through the ranks of lords and senior lieutenants to a place directly below devetaki and the other two ladies but when it seemed he was about to climb up hold said devetaki while in her mind she called out come my darlings and her darlings came devetakis camp was in the immediate vicinity when she had heard the first rumbles of trouble shed been wise enough to call her generals here and not go to them while they were a fine body of lords still they were mainly on their own supported by only a small handful of lieutenants but the virgin grandam was not on her own there came warning grunts and a nervous throb of propulsors a clatter of chitin scales and a thudding on the shallow outer walls of the fretted cone behind devetaki zindevar and ursula and to left and right of them ugly snouts were pushed up into view a pair of small warriors reared to look down on the gathering with suspicious swivelling eyes flanking them a large body of minders lieutenants and thralls came scrambling ringing the cone about there were men of vormulacs contingent among them seconded now to devetaki also there were her own lieutenants several of wamuss and ursula torspawns men even a handful of zindevars ferocious women and devetaki knew that if she wanted to she could do away with a majority of these lords right here right now and never be concerned with them again and she would have except she needed them to fight the bloodwar she looked down on them lord eran painscar with the ribs and flesh of his left side laid open displaying his pulsing organs encased in bags of metamorphic skin lord eran had kept this hideous wound or trophy to remind him of the even greater pain of his enemy whom he had killed by cutting out his spine entire hesta the hermaphrodite whose liquid features alternated between a demure eyefluttering pout and a bestial snarl and whose hands were slim and manicured at the ends of arms like a bear lord tangiru the grunt who swore that hed never told a lie in his life well and it was true one does not say much of anything without a tongue lorn halfstruck the dwarf whose arms were long to compensate for his shortness of leg he had hands like clubs of knotty ironwood and a great passion for striking detractors in their most delicate parts three times when he had considered himself insulted lorn had reached out and castrated the offenders with his bare hands devetaki looked down on all of these lords and twenty or so more but not nearly as many as before in turgosheim there had been some thirtysix lords now they were down to what twentyeight of course maglore was not here and black boris was in the trog caverns in the east but there had also been a good many real however contrived fatalities wamus for example laughing zack shornskull vormulac himself gone the way of all or most flesh and others lost crossing the great red waste and several more from internal feuding or other causes most recently lord zun of zunspire swept to oblivion with most of his men and creatures in a great avalanche whose dust had not yet settled which was rumoured to be the work of these same guerilla travel lers aye it all added up to a very satisfying situation in devetakis eyes well with certain reservations a shame she had a bloodwar on her hands that was all else now she might achieve her lifes ambition all in one fell swoop and in those dangerous moments while devetaki gazed down on the restless lords there was a sombre silence broken only by the hot snort of one of her warriors until putting on her scowling mask finally the virgin grandam ordered her creatures down from the wall but stay close to hand she sent for i may yet need you unlikely now but as well to let these cowed lords know what was what well shed done that all right like chastised children they were surly but silent they knew their place in the scheme of things now it seemed a good time to make her peace with them starting with grigor hakson very well she said staring straight down at him we know where we stand and you believe that ive made a fool of you but you are wrong for i am in total agreement with you ah surprise on your face grigor but why for the only mistake you made was to blame me and that out of frustration i know i was vormulacs adviser indeed i was but think how many losses had we suffered if i had not been even the best adviser may only guide a fool and before he could speak as for the rest of it youre right mistakes have been made but didnt you ask it yourself since when do the wamphyri require defensive positions its in our attitude grigor dont you see for while in turgosheim we were the masters wamphyri whose word was law here we are only enemies and not only to wratha but to sunsiders who have learned to fight back oh she had tamed a few of them hah a precious few and made them her supplicants which we were unlucky enough to discover from the onset unlucky how so devetaki lifted her crimson gaze from grigor to sweep it over all the assembled lords and answered because from that time forward we knew it would be easy and we were wrong for while a supplicant is easy meat here as in turgosheim the rest of these western szgany are fierce fighters all if we had come up against the fighters first then wed have been on guard as we will be from this time forward but now let me tell you how else it will be from this time forward tomorrow night we go against wrathstack and from the lords what the last aerie and wrathstack that impregnable place until someone called out as laughing zack shornskull went against it dyou mean oh and wheres zack now eh devetaki gave a shrug the choice is yours to sit here and starve or to go against wrathstack now listen the supplicants are gone used up and only the fighters remain also were no longer a surprise theyre ready for us now at the moment were wellfed and our fighting beasts are fuelled we are fit for war and provided we keep a watch during the coming day on wrathstack to hold it in siege and on our own flanks to keep them safe tomorrow night will be our first and best opportunity to take the last aerie and make it ours so how do we go about it and before they could answer let me tell you devetaki continued but first do not speak to me of laughing zack shornskull he was a madman what one lord against an entire aerie he deserved to die a shame he took so many good men and creatures with him thats all but tomorrow night i devetaki skullguise personally guarantee that tomorrow night will be different i guarantee it for then youll not only be fighting for your lives for revenge and for glory but for profit for territory for the last aerie itself what said grigor frowning what are you saying im talking about the last aerie devetaki insisted a single mighty stack whose capacity is almost as great as turgosheim in its entirety and if no when we have conquered it whose shall it be eh grigor the lech was not alone in his amaze a good many jaws had fallen open this was something new that hadnt yet dawned or it had but mainly on devetaki herself a nearperfect example of how turgosheims immemorial constraints had stunted natural wamphyri instincts that the question of spoils of ownership of territory had not previously arisen my proposal said devetaki while still their horizons expanded that you lords band yourselves your men and beasts together into five or six invincible groups divide the stack between you choose your target levels and have at it and whosoever survives to take this or that level or levels keeps them grigor gasped indeed said devetaki just and welldeserved rewards for a fight wellfought and a bloodwar wellwon just think of it for when its over therell be vampire flesh enough to fill your bellies and your vats and furnish your new manses richer far than anything you had in turgosheim a growled grunted but mainly appreciative murmur went up from almost every quarter except and your part lady one voice rang out where shall you be in this great and bloody melee and what shall be your reward i have already chosen my target devetaki replied the topmost levels and spire itself for thats where ill find wratha that is unless you would care to face that lady but there was no answer at first devetaki continued til stand off observe command free of the fighting my eyes shall see what you have missed and my mentalism will reach out and guide all of you in your endeavours in this respect i shall watch over my children like the very virgin grandam that youve named me but then as the fighting moves within the stack and so beyond my range and control i shall join my troops in the loftiest of all levels and so be in the thick of it my reward shall be skullmanse at the head of the stack where else there arose an immediate babble of protest which devetaki cut short at once with see here the great battle is not yet begun and yet youre arguing already now listen and mark my words when all of this is over we shall do as wratha tried to do first recruit szgany supplicants then tame sunside a task that will take years our bloodchildren will fly back to turgosheim to care for our manses in our absence and insure they do not fall into foreign hands our holdings will be vast and all the resources of this brand new sunside ours and in those early years why therell be no time for feuding among ourselves what with all the works well undertake the hunting and taming the titheroutes to set up and manage and all the lesser stumps of stacks around going wanting for masters each one of them greater than many a socalled manse in turgosheim territory galore and all for the taking devetaki had the lords now and knew it she had painted them a glorious picture and it lured them like stinkgnats to foulsmelling snapper plants but she knew that even now theyd be able to see at least one major loophole and so continued men will die of course oh yes some of you lords will die but isnt that always the way of it only the strongest survive ah but think of the profits to those survivors masters not only of their own manses in turgosheim but every one of them shall also be the victorious lord of a level or two of that mighty stack out there on the boulder plains she threw a dramatic arm and hand to the north which a host of scarlet eyes greedily followed until she continued so how will you name your fine aeries eh eranscar trollsump gruntmanse and finally gazing on grigor again and deliberately donning her smiling mask lechlodge but he was already hooked and wouldnt rise to any more baiting except to say very well devetaki and so much for the last aerie wamphyri against wamphyri we know how to fight that war but what of these strange sunsiders and their even weirder weapons i saw the three who caused me such grief and they were like no other szgany ive ever seen now how do we fight such as them when they come and go like shadows she narrowed her eyes here they come and go like shadows she said here in these barrier mountains where they know all the trails and hideyholes but do you think they are likely to come adventuring across the boulder plains to the last aerie itself also ive taken one of them prisoner and he has told me things she shrugged they have a leader these irritating sunsiders but my captive now my true thrall and disciple knows where to find him always he has a talent you see this new thrall of mine he sniffs men out and when wrathstack is fallen then hell sniff out the leader of these guerillas you have it all worked out said grigor however grudgingly indeed said devetaki but isnt that what a leader is for and to the rest of them post guards lets make sure we suffer no more incursions no more losses this night likewise tomorrow for we must always remember daytime is their time thats it then a long day lies ahead get your rest while you may my lords but save the best of your provisions till next the sun sets for then with wellfuelled men and beasts we ride on wrathstack as the lords departed back to their camps some of them eager and excited and others muttering zindevar told devetaki do you know you almost had me convinced too and ursula torspawn slight as a szgany girl and even dressed like one but wamphyri all the way said some will survive of course but greatly weakened devetaki answered and by then if all works out well have control of some of these weapons that grigor mentioned which i have seen in use for before we attack wrathstack zindevar here will have secured the pass and what it contains remember i have a man the same captive i spoke of who understands those weapons still her lady colleagues looked uncertain until the virgin grandam sighed and said try to see the whole picture the great pass secured ours a number of superior szgany thralls recruited their weapons in our hands wrathstack taken and only a handful of lords surviving for a while the bulk of our army out of turgosheim say half of it intact its men and beasts at our command the fighting just over and the bloodwar won but do we stop there no we sweep on sweep over the last of the lords and finally the apportioning zindevar weve spoken before you and i concerning territories now i have a new proposal for you which i think youll like zindevar narrowed her eyes and grunted oh do you think so then say on the great pass shall be yours to take and keep as previously agreed devetaki nodded but in addition what say you have all these barrier mountains east to west to explore carve out inhabit why it should keep you busy for a century zindevar made no reply for she was struck dumb ursula on the other hand was not so taken with things it seems i have happened late upon these discussions these plans of yours ah no ursula said devetaki do not be mistaken or feel in any way slighted you were taken into account from the start zindevar is here to corroborate it when i tell you that we had already apportioned turgosheim to you in its entirety every stack stump and manse the whole gorge myself i shall have the last aerie and all the stumps of fallen stacks around for we are equals even sisters of sorts after all and so the grand triumvirate lives on but as a matriarchy now hah and why not the lords have lorded it long enough their talks were at an end the sky over the barrier mountains was definitely brightening zindevar and ursula returned to their individual camps watching them go devetaki thought fools greedy fools but she kept the thought to herself then gazing west she sought out a distancemisted glimmer where the foothills met the barren boulder plains a pale luminosity that lay like a glowworm in the night the starside gate for despite the alleged greediness of her sisters devetakis ambitions were greater far than theirs why be satisfied with a mere stack a mountain range a piddling gorge when she could have a world entire and why be satisfied with one world when she could have two her smiling mask glinted leadgrey and shimmery blue in the gradually dimming light of the stars but the eyes behind the mask were red as ever even as red as lust and as red as blood of course it was five hours before the dawn when nathan woke up misha had crept out of his arms some two hours earlier but she had let him sleep on indeed when the others would have woken him up she insisted that he sleep on hes taking it as the dry earth takes rain shed told them because its required i dont want my husband to crack like the earth also if he wants to find fault that he wasnt awakened he can find it with me so dont worry and when lardis lidesci had stomped forward and told her youre coming between him and a bloodwar good shed snapped back now go away and he had done just that muttering huh so she takes over where his mother left off hard women are the poor lads lot it would seem but in fact mishas instinct had been right in more ways than one for even now as nathan slept things were shaping the dreams of the necroscope were never as those of ordinary men at first sensing as misha sensed how much nathan needed his sleep a sleep of recuperation of physical and mental revitalization of recovery from his efforts and his losses both of adjustment to reassert the balance of his being the living and the teeming dead alike had granted him the peace he so desired but nathan had asked a favour of the desertdwelling thyre which they had considered and now would answer the grey brothers of the wild were watchful on his behalf and they had news for him and there was a restless handful among the dead too who were no longer willing to be kept waiting they must speak to him and now nathaaan it was the voice of thikkoul the longdead thyre stargazer who read the future in the eternal stars hed read nathans future for him too upon a time so that the necroscope was wary of him or if not of thikkoul of his talent and of the future itself which had proved as immutable as the past with or without the stars and those who might try to read them the future was a devious thing it had its own way of being as it would be and nathan said thikkoul your mind was a void so that i knew you slept well and deep but now as you grow stronger your numbers vortex swirls as before i know that you receive me and we must speak since your waking hours are filled with works i come as before in my dreams nathan answered him yes i hear you and you know why ive come to show me the future yes even though we cant change it thikkoul seemed breathless now nathan recently there have been portents i too dream but i dont understand what i see you can be my eyes and show me the stars again wherein the secrets may be fathomed you think its that important oh indeed then ill come to you and if i may i shall bring someone with me oh a friend i take it and one with a wonderful talent for like you thikkoul he sees into the future something of it at least but he cant read the stars and in any case our stars are alien to him but the two of you together it may be that well get a truer picture then i look forward to meeting your friend but when soon nathan promised thikkouls deadspeak carrier faded but there was another to replace it nathan if you would visit this thyre stargazer surely you must come and see me for the past is at least as important as the future or if we may not meet well on my own ground as it were then let me tell you what i know here and now it makes no difference to me but it might make a great deal of difference to you and the lidescis indeed to all the szgany you too jasef nathan told him as soon as i can ill attend you but first i have work to do in the barrier mountains very well but dont leave it too long necroscope the deadspeak aether cleared and the dried leaves whispers of the teeming dead faded to make room for the telepathic sendings of the living the wag of a familiar tail and a low growl in nathans metaphysical mind it was grinner who also knew deadspeak and had listened to the necroscopes conversation with jasef uncle a word of warning you succeeded too well in these barrier mountains best to put back your plans a while you may not come here now not if you would live another day where are you nathan was eager to talk to this one we spy on the wamphyri as you ordered grinner told him in the mountains east of the great pass as before but these are worried creatures uncle they take no chances over each of their camps they have set a watch and warriors are hidden in the crags and crevices even with your talents you may not come among them unobserved also they have onewhoscans we have sensed him his probe he knows you knows where you are a locator it could only be alexei yefros and nathan wondered how many others of tzonovs party had been taken maybe he should speak to zek and trask knowing that he was asleep he willed himself to remember all that was being communicated to him when finally he woke up what else do you have for me nothing apart from the watchers the vampires prepare for sunup they are hidden away they will sleep in the shadows of the mountains my thanks grinner nathan told him but its hard to take your advice i have scores to settle we know but they wont be settled if you become a victim be as a wolf uncle creep up on your prey and strike him when he least expects it not when hes prepared nathan nodded youre right of course then you wont put yourself in jeopardy no not yet at least anyway there are a great many other things that i must see to tomorrow perhaps in the daylight when the lords lie sleeping good grinner barked his telepathic probe fading but only to be replaced by another the necroscopes thyre sister atwei nathan can you speak to me to you any time good news she told him the elders of the thyre are in agreement if sunside is threatened then even the furnace deserts come under threat and the thyre themselves wherefore you need no longer hold yourself to old pledges if you would bring your people to us if you need to use thyre colonies as safe temporary harbours so be it we place our faith in you nathan you have our blessing tomorrow nathan answered unable to hold back his sigh of relief i practise my people tomorrow all of them her voice echoed her amazement you can bring all of them i can only try tomorrow but where will i see you where are you in the cavern of the ancients then you wont see me but you can pass on my message some small sadness before she answered of course at sunup ill take my people to crater lake its a trial thats all ill take them then return them to their forests in a moment a reception isnt necessary and it shall be as if we were never there i only mention it as a courtesy and do you know how to find crater lake oh yes a very beautiful place which i remember well i only have to close my eyes and i can see it like yesterday and i know the coordinates he sensed her nod i will pass on your message farewell nathan farewell atwei my sister at this point nathan rolled over in his sleep and his arm fell across the empty space where misha had lain however vaguely her absence registered in his sleeping mind causing him to question it and increasing his awareness his thoughts went out searching but they didnt find misha instead they found someone else who by now was practised in the invasion of the necroscopes secret mind nathan recognized him at once and despite that he was still asleep conjured the vortex to cloak his thoughts in numbers which was where he gained the upper hand in turgosheim this had always been the way of it that his telepathy was superior to maglores it was why he continued to wear his golden earring because where certain areas of his mind were forbidden to maglore nothing of maglores was forbidden to him and now nathan gazed on the seerlords innermost secrets and saw how utterly the gorge of turgosheim had fallen into his grasp except for one part one place madmanse that sinister gloomy ghostridden mausoleum of a dwelling like a hollow pedestal supporting maglores own promontory runemanse and nathan read in the seerlords mind how his failure to annexe and inhabit madmanse irritated him it was not that the place was uninhabitable rather that it was already inhabited by the undead spirit of eygor killglance and for all that maglore was the selfstyled mage he could neither exorcise the thing nor bear to be near it quite obviously eygor must have been a monster among monsters that not even others of the wamphyri could abide to dwell where he had dwelled but that was nothing new nathan knew what eygor had been but now perhaps maglore sensed that he was discovered or about to be in any case his probe withdrew was drawn back across all the miles to runemanse on the craggy rim of turgosheim and in its turn was replaced by the monster of monsters himself you are unkind eygors deadspeak crawled like a slug in nathans dreams such thoughts do you no credit necroscope do i come in sijence furtive as a thief in the night creeping in the corridors of your secret mind like the seerlord no for i am open in my approach wellmannered and never a sign of menace why i would not be here even now except i sensed maglores probe go out and desired to know what he was about and so he spies on you eh ah and he knows your powers nathan and would destroy you if he could you should fear him necroscope for hes sly that one but in you i have nothing to fear eh eygor nathan made no attempt to hide his sarcasm his disgust you are innocent as a child right he sensed the others deadspeak shrug weve had this conversation before very well you dont want to speak to someone whose only desire is to help you someone who brings words of wisdom and a warning a warning however convoluted eygors wamphyri conversation his word games might prove to be any information had to be better than none nathans thoughts were deadspeak and indeed eygor agreed yet plainly you would prefer that i leave you to your own devices very well i get me wait the necroscope stopped him even as he pretended to withdraw except i would remind you eygor that the last time we spoke you tried to lure me into calling you up that sort of thing wont work a second time be sure then youre a fool for i would be your ultimate weapon i would be a fool certainly if i believed you enough i dont know why i put myself to the effort now do you want to hear what i have to tell you or not if there are no strings then ill listen there are many new arrivals among the dead of turgosheim killed defending their manses against the incursions of maglore of runemanse they at least are not above speaking to me and their message is simple maglore would make himself master here of all turgosheim nathans turn to shrug hes that already it was always his plan now tell me something i dont know ah but youre not as clever as you make out necroscope or maybe you are so tell me what will be maglores next move i havent given it much thought time for that when ive time for maglore himself but arent you the socalled saviour of your people cant you see that once maglore has filled the gorge with fighting beasts then he must feed them or is it that your duties dont extend so far as turgosheim only your western szgany are worthy of your protection eh now nathan saw the others meaning that in order to keep turgosheim for himself maglore must begin to raid in force on turgosheims sunside no more tithe system which had been bad enough in itself but a monstrous bloodbath he is not so stupid he gasped what but he could decimate the eastern szgany oh haha no magjore is not stupid at all and yet he will decimate them at jeast until he can be certain that vormulacs army is crushed or otherwise incapacitated and will not return only then will he endeavour to maintain a balance and let the sunsiders live and multiply in order that he may live but beore then even tomorrow night the blood is the life nathan could scarcely control his anger why do you tell me these things eygor to torment me i cant contain whats happening here let alone in turgosheim you know theres no way i can stop him eygors deadspeak nod and his phlegmy grunt of scarcely concealed anticipation exactly you cant stop him but i can if youll only call me up that again nathans voice hardened all a subterfuge to get you up out of your pit to work on your behalf liar no vampire ever worked for another to take revenge on a certain scrawny old bastard in runemanse then eygor howled who all these years has threatened to annexe madmanse and make it his own but nathan shook his head think again eygor he said oh i dont doubt that you would kill maglore and anyone else you could lay your hands on but when last we spoke your only desire was to murder your bloodsons wran and spiro you are as changeable as the wind except you blow to suit the situation nothing strange in that youre wamphyri for long moments there was silence until finally eygors gurgling even suppurating deadspeak voice sounded again saying necroscope you are an infuriating man i have offered you the greatest weapon ever in your fight against my own kind and all i ask is to be up and about in the land of the living again however briefly to right the many wrongs which were done me in life now tell me what is it you fear do you fear for the szgany but there is nothing of humanity left in turgosheim only maglore whom i would destroy and your bloodsons if they should return yes nathan nodded if and when they return and if i survive what is yet to be then it might be time to talk again meanwhile ive given you enough of my time also the dead have only recently seen fit to talk to me i cant jeopardize their faith in me by having to do with such as you leave it at that then said eygor sighing but ive seen inside your head necroscope and know it can be done there is such a power of mind in you only accept my gift my talent would be yours in a moment to use for the good of all the szgany and you would be up again in the land of the living only until you willed me down how can i be sure of that what but yours is the power necroscope power over the dead and what am i but a crumbling old dead thing eh a vampire thing said nathan aye and one who feels the rising sun even now and so i get me back into madmanse in turgosheim nathan felt eygors presence shrinking the foul fog of his thoughts rolling back the final echo of his voice like a shudder in the deadspeak aether coming from a long way away until we speak again nathaaan stirring under the canopy of his makeshift shelter under the trees nathan opened an eye then both of them his dreams were already fading so that he wondered which if any had been real and which had been dreams rolling over he scanned through the forest across the prairie to the furnace desert and then he knew that the last of them at least had been real for eygor was right the sun was rising however slowly a pale stain was spreading on the far horizon and the familiar starclusters in the sky were just a little dimmer the camp was coming awake a member of the watch went by yawning grinning at nathan where he lay it was andrei romani how goes it necroscope call me nathan he answered with a smile nothing has changed let it be just like before andrei shrugged the other has a ring to it its like a title aye said a gruff voice from the side but theres only one title that counts round here and im it it was lardis seated on a treestump unnoticed lardis who for all his pretended pride was armed to the teeth alert the very embodiment of a guardian angel sitting where hed sat out the hours since misha left nathans bed watching over the sleeping form of well of the necroscope aye nathan sat up yawned in answer to andreis yawn asked is the camp awake i mean all of it most said lardis except you and your people from the helllands mainly they said you should sleep then used it as an excuse to get their own heads down nathan yawned again they do right for theyre going to be busy enough from now on no more trouble in the night none nathan stood up then lets have them all awake lardis for its time they learned this new game for the moment well call it going places but if or when the wamphyri lords ever come looking for us then well call it hide and seek games lardis grunted and wondered why the necroscope looked at him and grinned that way but before he could ask wheres lan goodly nathan was serious again while you are mustering the camp ive somewhere to go something to do he glanced at the sky with the tall gaunt one who scries on future times him and one other nathan nodded and i can only do it while the stars are still clear over sunside and this other you dont know him nathan said hes thyre and hes dead lardis opened his mouth but said nothing lan goodly was already coming making his way through the trees but then he would be of course iv out of the future out of the past going places trouble in the pass nathan took goodly to meet thikkoul of the thyre literally a meeting of minds if nothing else and even then the precog must take nathans word for it as for thikkoul himself he was little more than a bundle of venerable rags in a niche lit by a single constantly flickering candle in a subterranean mausoleum tended by respectful thyre descendants the inhabitants of rivers rush though the thyre colony was two thousand miles east of lidesci territory and twenty miles into the desert beyond the savanna the distance was of no concern the journey instantaneous nathan did not go directly to the hall of endless hours such an abrupt intrusion would have been unseemly and anyway he knew that the thyre of rivers rush would probably make a great fuss of him it wasnt that he was above their devotion or above returning it but simply a matter of time the days when he could linger in the thyre colonies for endless hours were long since over but there was a place in the desert where hed once lain out under the night sky and spoken to thikkoul via deadspeak so that the astrologer had seen through his eyes and read his future in the stars that was where he took goodly and where the mind of thikkoul was waiting for him i knew you would come necroscope thikkoul was eager to make his presence known thikkoul said nathan i have my friend with me of whom weve spoken he is here to corroborate and perhaps explain the things that i might see i remember yes but how is he to know what i see without deadspeak smiling nathan answered not only shall i be your eyes thikkoul but also your voice he lay down on the slope of a dune and indicated that goodly should seat himself alongside and out loud he said now what of your premonitions what have you felt that so disturbs you all my life i loved the stars thikkoul answered allowing time for nathan to repeat his words in a whisper for the precogs benefit the moon the sun the stars all of the phenomena of the heavens were as a plan to me the plan of what has been and what is to be as a boy i thought i merely remembered the past but when certain of the things i saw came to pass then i knew that in fact i read the future in the night underground in one of the colonies even in a closed darkened room i could feel the moon and stars above me i sensed how the moon was lured in her orbit by the bulk of our planet also by a stranger force whose focus lies beyond the barrier mountains in starside and as the moon was lured so was my mind but by all of the heavenly bodies so that even when i could not see them still i could feel their great wheel and whirl and ever aware of their presence even though they were frequently invisible to me still i could read something of their awesome portents as it was in life so in death for as you know well enow necroscope the passions of our lives go on even into the ultimate darkness and now that i am dead still i can feel something of the things that will be in the wheel of the stars as thikkoul paused so nathan translated and then inquired again what is it that you feel the strangest thing the other answered his deadspeak so faint and shivery that nathans flesh prickled for instead of the stars in their eternal revolutions i feel this very earth itself moving leaning towards the sun the weight of the moon is felt as always and likewise that of the alien force beyond the barrier mountains but now a third irresistible force is present which even a world entire must answer nathan was baffled and goodly awed by the thought of what he was listening to the words of a dead man but mainly by a thrill of cognizance that ran through his body and brain as thikkouls words registered to conjure a previously unrecognized stream of coconscious thought the fact that he too had felt or precognized just such a movement of the earth the necroscope saw something in goodlys face and was at once concerned what is it just that i know what he means the other answered for ive felt it too except i didnt know it until now what that the earth is turning no goodly shook his head that it will turn but what can it mean still speaking out loud nathan returned to his deadspeak thikkoul do you have any idea what it means perhaps if i could see it in the stars very well but i warn you that theyre fading now thats when i liked them best in the twilight before the dawn nathan looked on the stars and his metaphysical mind was one with thikkouls for a moment until his head reeled and he drew apart in something of shock and there said thikkoul you felt it too the turning of the world but did you also see it see what nathan felt a strange dizziness quite unlike any sensation hed ever known before the stars moving in the night sky from south to north as the earth turned thikkouls deadspeak was full of wonder nathan shook his head no i saw nothing but was it the future something of the future the other groaned but this time i dont know what as to your future the future of the szgany in general i saw nothing this other thing is too great it intrudes obscures overwhelms so that the rest is as nothing by comparison and goodly was equally at a loss the whole thing had taken minutes lardis would scarcely have had time to muster the entire camp there was time for another visit this time nathan had no coordinates and so must inquire asef where are you the answer was a place in the forest the woods west of settlement where a glade formed the southernmost point of an equilateral triangle with the abandoned lidesci town to the northeast and sanctuary rock in the northwest this was the spot where jasef karis had died of a heart attack when nathan and nestor were only four years old and it was also the spot where nana kiklu had buried him not only that jasefs spirit husked as nathan and lan goodly emerged from the mobius continuum into the glade but its also the place where i witnessed a wonder a thing known only to me all these long years but youre a man now aye and your fathers son to boot and its high time you knew you would have known before but they darent let me speak to you the great majority i mean well you cant really blame them for that for harry helllander was a necromancer in the end and it appears that nestor takes after him they had to be sure that you werent the same thats all nathan and goodly sat down in the faintest flush of dawn light on the fallen branch of a dead ivyclad tree the necroscope was alert intense and goodly mystified but the precog knew enough to stay silent and let nathan get on with whatever he was doing and using deadspeak now nathan inquired of old jasef karis what was it fasef that its been on your mind so long it was a strange morning that one jasef answered i had been sick for some time even years but what is sickness when youre on the run from the wamphyri anyway we all sicken and die sometime so it was a strange morning aye but before the morning id had an even stranger dream during the night except it was so real i was sure it wasnt just a dream tejj me about it said nathan jasefs deadspeak nod in my own time my own way now jet me think and in a moment i remember coming awake thinking this could be the last time ill ever wake up for something was very wrong my arms pained me as if in some great cramp and my chest hurt as if it were crushed by boulders why it was all i could do to open my eyes above me was the oiled skin that nona had draped over low branches to keep the rain off but id rolled aside and lay uncovered drenched and shivering i was hot on the inside cold out yet sweating from the pain in my chest i thought it was probably the end of me as ive said but i didnt have to be a seer to know that except i knew i must tell someone about my dream and i knew it must be nona of course my dream of of a corpse smouldering its fireblackened arms flung wide and steaming head thrown back lifeless tumbling end over end into a darkness shot through with brilliant ribbons of blue and green and red light indeed descending or retreating into this tunnel of twining streamers a tortured thing but no longer suffering unknowable as the weird things of dream so often are and yet there was something vaguely familiar about it about him then as my dream drifted me closer finally i knew who and what he was and nathan said my father harry keogh how do you know did i make it so obvious the shake of nathans head no but ive seen it before is there more jasef didnt question what nathan had said but went on harry helllanders spinning descent into into what eternity speeded up and left me behind but in the moment after his corpse had sped away and disappeared an explosion of golden light the necroscope gasped this time out loud which caused goodly to start and a rush of golden splinters like living darts hurtling in a hundred different directions and blinking out escaping into into other places but if you know this much perhaps you know it all no nathan answered but ive a feeling that this is the part i must know so please tell it well i was still dreaming jasef continued but now in a moment the scene had changed to nona kiklus fouryearold twins in a blanket under a tree to you nathan you and your brother nestor and suddenly appearing out of nowhere one of the golden darts which hovered first over one sleeping child then the other the pair of them stirred in their sleep at which the dart stopped hovering there were two little sleeping heads in that blanket one dark and the other blond and the dart seemed to have made up its mind it lanced down it entered a small head but there was no scream no scar no blood nothing but a smile on the face of that sleeping innocent the blond head nathan nodded my head yes it must have been i was asleep and in any case too small to know or remember but that was only the first time it happened since then theres been another time in the helllands beyond the starside gate now it starts to make sense those darts have been my protection oh said jasef quietly are you sure but if that were the case i neednt feel concerned for it would explain everything it would even explain you what worries me is that its not the case it stopped nathan dead in his tracks what that golden dart entered into nestor nathan that fragment of your father went to him nathan felt dizzy disorientated a different sensation again to the one he had known in rivers rush when hed felt the turning of the world but how is it then that things have worked out this way he asked for i know now that my father was good anything of harry keogh that went to nestor it could only be good which might explain something of the fears of the great majority said jasef for what you got from your father naturally as a child inherits bones colour shape was good yes undeniably so but what nestor got all that was bad in the necroscope is that what youre saying all that was brewing in him at the end possibly no i cant believe that nathan shook his head those golden shards ive seen them they werent evil they were harry one of them entered into me too and gave me the solution to the greatest problem of my life then perhaps the darts were simply forces or powers and the way they would develop was in you and nestor yourselves if that is correct well we have seen how it developed in him its just that i wanted you to know in the final battle and you know what that must be its as well that youre aware of what you are up against for the one thing you do have whether you get it from your father or not is your compassion necroscope its your greatest strength but it could be your greatest weakness too jasef was finished and having nothing more to say he fell silent but nathan continued to ponder his words was it possible that nestor had got all the evil in harry the dark instincts of the uncontrollable thing within and might it not explain his lifelong predilection an apparently morbid yearning or inclination towards the wamphyri if so it would seem that nestor had been doomed from the beginning but still nathan couldnt believe it back at the camp lardis wasnt quite ready for nathans game nathan used the extra time to explain what hed learned to ben trask trask if anyone would know the truth of it but after hed heard it trask could only shake his head if you tell me the truth of something ill know it at once he said also if you tell me a lie but youre only guessing and so im at a loss the same as you they left it at that the game was a simple thing on flat ground a little way out on the savanna nathan formed the lidesci tribe up into a fairly tightpacked circle two to three figures deep the ring was maybe fifteen paces across family groups stayed together likewise couples and friends as best possible a long rope was passed around the circle so that everyone could take hold of it and then nathan explained if ever were threatened by the wamphyri as soon as we have the first warning we hurry here and take up this rope so remember your positions now this rope is your lifeline dont let go of it as he stepped to the centre of the circle where all could see him mothers took up their children and husbands held onto the rope and wives both you may have heard something of what i can do nathan said some of you maybe a lot of you have even seen it and a few have gone with me into another place but its a very dark place and doesnt feel the same as here it feels like you are falling but youre not so in this other place its best to keep your eyes closed also its best not to talk and not even to think close your eyes and keep silent now they did so and he said now this time is just a trial when i join the circle and pull on the rope i want to see how fast you can walk dont run towards me he did so and just like trusting children the lidescis followed his instructions to the letter as they passed him he tapped their arms saying good thats fine just keep going thats very good until they stood clustered together in a group with their eyes still closed holding onto the rope open your eyes said nathan now im going to position men and women among you who have been in my secret place before you as you see theyre not afraid neither must you be the party from earth took their places in the new circle likewise lardis andrei kirk and misha and nathan said this time its no practice but the real thing and believe me youre going to a wonderful place just hold onto the rope and remember what i told you that you may feel like youre floating or falling but youre not and its only for a few moments nathan conjured a door and guided them through it it took no more than fortyfive seconds maximum the savanna was empty and nathan followed his charges into the mobius continuum and led them out again into a wonderful place misha gasped one of the first out she had opened her eyes at once of the rest of the lidescis a good many had sat down abruptly as the return of gravity unbalanced them others staggered a little blinking their eyes in the unexpected light all clung to the rope some of them a small handful and mainly curious children had in fact opened their eyes within the mobius continuum nathan had heard their gasps of awe even terror these were the ones who clung more tightly yet to the rope and plumped down that much more abruptly as gravity returned several little ones cried their shock their alarm shortly turning to cries of wonder in turn rising to a swelling babble as the lidescis gazed all about they stood on the fertile rim of crater lake rising like a false plateau from the surface of the furnace desert all of a mile across with a raised inner caldera the place was most probably an old meteoric crater to the west a river entered through caverns in the base of the crater wall formed a great blue lake within the basin emptied through a gap in the reeflike central node and so down into the earth again it was the great dark river which during his travels among the thyre nathan had followed even beyond this place under the sprawling great red waste and so into turgosheims sunside now he calmed his charges a thyre place he said and the thyre are remarkable people soon theyll be up and about out of their deep caverns working in the oases now ill tell you whats so wonderful about it its because let me guess misha stopped him its because on the edge of the forest we were in darkness the twilight before the dawn while here now we stand in sunlight sunup yes and the dazzling southern horizon as fiery as a perfect spiral nebula viewed edgeon whose golden central blister threatened to supernova at any moment and burn an entire galaxy but it was a false impression for as ever this would be a long tortuously slow rising and the slower the better for the longer the day nathan smiled and nodded exactly right for were a good many miles south of where we were even at night even if the wamphyri knew where we were they probably wouldnt follow us here south is towards the sun and therefore dangerous but as close as this to sunup theyd never chance it looking all around he saw the children going down to the waters rim and said a wonderful place yes but dont let the little ones stray too far for we cant stay the thyre have done us a favour we have the use of this place in time of danger so lets not abuse their hospitality this time was simply a visit an opportunity to try out our escape route in case the time should come when we have to use it in earnest he neednt have worried about the children for anna marie was with them indeed it seemed she couldnt be separated from them especially the orphans lardis called them all together again anyway and formed them up they played the necroscopes wonderful game again nathan returned them to the temporary camp at the edge of the forest wolf zek foener cried out her hands flying to her temples an amazed expression on her face nathan had been momentarily distracted surrounded by lardis and his senior men who seemed intent on pounding his back to a pulp their way of congratulating him on his new and apparently foolproof safeguard against the wamphyri but within a few seconds of emerging from the mobius continuum zek was on duty scanning the area telepathically to ensure that nothing had changed during their short absence now nathan stepped quickly to her side touched her and was at once in contact with her telepathic probe it was grinner trying to contact nathan not zek uncle necroscope im trapped zek reeled and cried again wolf for a moment i i thought it was my wolf except hes dead in another world no nathan told her not your wolf mine grinner yes in trouble with the wamphyri on starside he read the coordinates right out of dinners mind but before he could act on them picked up a second probe trying to make contact with him it was jasef kariss deadspeak nathan there are newcomers among the teeming dead men some of them in the great pass a battle the great pass turkur tzonovs men it could only be nathan had intended to meet them in a few hours time at the sunside end of the pass now on the gloomy winding floor of the canyon they must be under attack from devetakis forces her final throw before sunup a wolf of the wild on the one hand and human beings on the other yet nathan didnt hesitate or only for a moment to speak to lardis get some men ready eight of them with hellland weapons wait here then he loaded his own crossbow with a now precious exploding bolt conjured a door and was gone to a place in the barrier mountains on starside it took just a moment for the picture to sink in but it was a nearfatal moment a lieutenant and a senior thrall one redeyed and the other feral both gauntleted closing in on grinner where he stood stifflegged on the rim of a sheer cliff that fell away for hundreds of feet the intention of the vampires was clear this wolf of the wild was prey whether he fell to his doom or they hacked him to death made no difference wolfheart was a delicacy and meat is meat whatever its source nathan had emerged from the continuum just a few paces to one side of the tableau the lieutenant immediately sensed him crouched low swung towards him and lifted his gauntlet defensively simultaneously the thrall edged closer to the snarling wolf at the edge of the cliff but grinner was wounded panting his pain his side torn and bloody his energy was about used up he had strength for a final leap perhaps into eternity a rock jutted on the rim almost teetering there nathan was separated from grinner by this volcanic node also by the lieutenant who now took two swift paces towards him nathan swung his crossbow to and fro shoot at the thrall and he himself would be at the mercy of the lieutenant fire at the lieutenant and it might be too late for grinner he sent a mental picture of his intentions and an urgent question have you the strength yes grinner answered and acted he leaped for the rock bounding to its uneven apex the thrall swung his gauntleted fist while grinner was in midair but nathan had already triggered his bolt passing close to the lieutenant it struck the thrall in his shoulder and threw him offbalance the crossbow thrummed empty in nathans hand and the lieutenant laughed in his face showing the great gape of his jaws he reached out to grab the necroscope by the throat drawing his gauntlet back to strike a killing blow but now nathan sent the bolt in the thralls shoulder exploded cut short his agonized mewling sent a spray of scarlet up into the startled air grinner made his second leap struck both nathan and the lieutenant squareon so that all three fell in a tangle over the rim the intended blow never fell on nathan the lieutenants scarlet eyes bulged and he tried to grab the cliff face with his gauntleted hand briefly he clung then slipped but nathan and the wolf had already fallen away from him through a mobius door before the door collapsed behind them they heard the lieutenants shriek dwindle to a flutter of air and angrily nathan asked how i failed to take my own advice grinner answered i told you to hold back and myself went forward three grey brothers were with me but when the vampires appeared i played the lure and separated myself from the rest i was trying to spy out a few of their hiding places for you for the morning those two followed after me was just a wolf and they would try to take me the lieutenant was lucky enough to strike me with his weaponed hand finally exhausted i called for help and you heard me no someone else heard you nathan answered and you were lucky too for shes known wolves before that one but grinner didnt answer or only with an awed silence as he experienced the mobius continuum and held fast in nathans arms the great wolf whined growled finally panted uncle directions what i sense them here everywhere ive ever known all the time i have lived and times as yet unlived this place is all places all times directions yes this place is everywhere my fathers world and yours and others they are here too and forces that fight with the moon and powers that were born in the stars directions nathan would know more but had no time for it not now he returned to the camp emerged from the continuum and at once put grinner down and to zek and misha as they stepped anxiously forward see to him hes not that badly hurt lardis and his men were ready among them trask chung carling andrei and kirk trouble in the pass nathan told them breathlessly as he reloaded his crossbow men against monsters but be careful we might yet find problems with both sides remember these were tzonovs men he took them to the pass where as yet dawns light crept slowly from the south at the southern end of the pass where it opened into sunside no sign of trouble nathan made a second jump deeper into darkness and as his party emerged a powerful reek of gunpowder drifting white smoke and a stumbling sobbing figure moving towards them through a pale writhing ground mist a survivor human but in the broad ribbon of sky overhead where the walls of the pass went up there were things that were not human two manta shapes wamphyri flyers pulsed against the thin and weary stars one of them had no rider it listed and the webbing of its wings seemed patterned with spangles where starlight gleamed fleetingly through tattered membrane the other creature was a little lower and carried two riders one of whom was female seated forward of the long saddle wearing armour and a halfmask of lead she was obviously a lady of the wamphyri behind her the slighter male figure held on as best he could the halfmask told nathan the ladys identity quick as thought he fell to one knee aimed his weapon at the swooping manta shape as it slipped north into the shadows of the pass but too late for shed gone and disgusted with himself that hed let the chance slip devetaki nathan grunted he cast a telepathic probe caught only her anger as she shielded her mind but her passenger wasnt as adept as devetaki nathan could hear him as clear as day telling her that was him down there on the bed of the pass the one that tzonov and i told you about now youve seen for yourself how he can simply appear like that you can forget those weapons devetaki for with the necroscope and his fighters down there but be quiet fool she cut him off cant you heed your own warnings he listens with his mind then the silence was shattered as several of nathans colleagues opened up with their automatic weapons sending a stream of bullets uselessly after devetaki and another into the sky where the halfcrippled flyer gained altitude higher still two more flyers appeared in the ribbon of sky wheeled on the wind and sped north lieutenants of devetaki probably hold your fire ben trask shouted over the din its a waste of ammunition the firing ceased and its echoes came bouncing back from the canyon walls like a gradually receding drum roll trask went to talk to the sole survivor and nathan took andrei and kirk forward with him into what had been the battlezone a short jump of a hundred and fifty yards down the pass to a misty depression just a quartermile south of the dogleg bend and there they found the ugly debris of war there too they stood still in the thin swirling mist while the necroscope listened in his fashion nothing lived here that he could tell not any longer at least there were no thoughts to detect with his telepathy but the deadspeak aether was alive with fear and bewilderment that was always the way of it and it would be no use trying to talk to these recently dead they would be confused for some time to come burning flyers and a small aerial warrior lay crumpled where theyd fallen or been blasted to a standstill and hosed with liquid fire their smoke drifted up making the air vile several small craters still issued wisps of smoke where grenades had exploded the rocks were spattered red the faces of the men where they had faces were filled with frozen terror the bodies were terrible and some of them might even be dangerous not the men no not the human corpses but some of the fallen lieutenants had been vampires for oh a long time it surprised nathan to find more females than males then looking at them it dawned on him who or what these evillooking women had been zindevars creatures aye the necroscope remembered her reputation from his turgosheim days and proving it was simple the one or two men were eunuchs meanwhile the remainder of his party with the exception of trask and lardis had arrived theres work for you here nathan told them all of these bodies must be burned but be careful and dont touch the vampires or their creatures he let andrei romani and kirk lisescu show them how to pile pine branches fallen from the heights against the corpses and as they saw to it went back to trask and lardis the single human survivor of the fight a slim nervouslooking cmi operative was talking so thats what it was all about greed a chance for promotion but mainly stupidity looking back on it well i wasnt the only one paxton fooled just about everyone in his command even the people above him i was close to him i admit it as close as anyone but i didnt realize how badly gone he was how obsessed until the cavern of the gate at the refuge how did paxton and his team get there so quickly trask wanted to know the operative looked at him shrugged he knew that an enemy he called him an alien had defected to ebranch from somewhere in the urals and that he would be heading for the refuge at radujevac borders dont count for a lot these days as you know and cmi had safehouses in bucharest belgrade other places paxton had been out there for some time just waiting for it to happen but no one in his command his select group as he called us knew just what he was up to or how far he would go he did initially have orders to stop this alien returning to wherever again his shrug this place i suppose but after we had taken the refuge the orders were suddenly rescinded trask nodded but that didnt stop him no where the way was blocked he blasted his way through he found spare airtanks inflatables everything we needed in the refuge he took his entire team up the river to the shining gate thing and that was when when i found out that he was raving but too late by then he was so i dont know plausible he looked sane he told the men they were going through into another world and that theyd come back rich except they had probably seen through him by then they werent much interested in rich they had wives children homes lives to live when they got awkward he he simply shot them all of them except me but i knew id be next if i gave him any kind of argument i didnt know why hed spared me until i saw starside then i knew it isnt the kind of place youd want to be alone in lardis called nathan to one side and whispered this one isnt a survivor oh see how he rubs his neck he has punctures there beginning to fester hes been bitten by some lieutenant during the fighting hell be just another plaguebearer if we allow it but of course we cant nathan nodded but said let trask finish questioning him and when you do it be merciful dont let him know its coming he isnt to blame none of us are said lardis showing him the hilt of a razorsharp machete in his belt dont worry he wont feel a thing does trask know i dont think so or he wouldnt sit so close thats odd trask usually knows the truth of things the truth is that this one is not yet a vampire lardis answered but he will be when next he wakes up if he were to wake up except he wont he has no idea what that bite means then no of course he doesnt else trask would know lardis nodded hes an innocent poor bastard but hes strong too else that bite would have put him down its the worst possible combination a strong physique and a vampires bite he would be a menace then let me know when youre ready and ill call trask away again lardiss nod meanwhile trask had asked wheres paxton now dead said the cmi man i dont know what his game was but after the fighting started he took off after the leader of those nightmarish women him and bruno krasin tzonovs ic they chased her into a cave back there there were a couple of explosions grenades i suppose and the cave came down on them nothing could live through that youve been lucky trask nodded and for the first time noticed how the man kept rubbing at his neck the ugly craters there so maybe he hadnt been so lucky after all slowly then trask stood up and moved apart and lardis gave nathan a certain look ben nathan called out can i speak to you a moment trask went to him and they turned away but before nathan could speak trask said that man i think i know what you think nathan cut him short grabbed his arm from behind came the chopping sound of a meat cleaver and a short gurgling cry then silence as geoffrey paxton surfaced through the dark choking flotsam of unconsciousness he studied the various pieces floating by scraps of memory bits of the past all leading to his present situation he was aware of an urgency in himself without knowing what it signified in the misty and mainly unexplored zone which lies between the alpha and omega states of consciousness that area between vacancy and tenancy of mind he yet felt impelled to advance his rate of ascent like a scuba diver short on air and in fact he was short on air and even shorter on time as an entirely human being and so he lay in the rubble of fallen rocks dirt dust in the back of the cave and dreamed his past or fragments of it his childhood when he was ever aware of his developing telepathy and increasingly aware of the hypocrisy all around him his failure to understand that the world doesnt turn on what is thought but what is said and done his gradual opposition to mankind a turning inwards an acceleration of selfappreciation egotism knowing that he was talented and his search for a royal road to power his time with ebranch and his eventual rejection by the branch coming hot on the heels of the war with the necroscope harry keogh paxtons part in that war his telepathy against the awesome powers of keoghs metaphysical mind and the fact that he hadnt stood a chance and afterwards the knowledge that hed stood face to face with just such a power as he sought an even greater power than any hed ever imagined and from then on his lust for that power but how to achieve it the necroscope had stolen or switched off his telepathy the necroscope a man a monster a vampire yet weak in that hed allowed his enemies to banish him from his own world or one which he could have made his own if paxton had been in his position he would not have been banished by now the world would be his it would be his and so the plan forming and finally the chance hed been waiting for to restore his telepathy reverse his misfortunes the coming of the son of the necroscope between times paxton had worked elevated himself in the world of men but that was as nothing now while his dream his grand plan was everything keogh had been allpowerful but didnt know how to control his talents they controlled him so it seemed to paxton but this time it would be different if he were a vampire he would know how to control it how to get back his telepathy stolen by a vampire how to extract the necessary knowledge from nathan keogh to make himself a necroscope his coming here to sunsidestarside and his subsequent search for an instrument of change to bring about his own metamorphosis into that most powerful of creatures wamphyri the attack in the pass he could have been killed and all schemes at an end but no thered been a warning flyers glimpsed in the sky immediately before the attack and that had struck him as strange that they would give themselves away like that or had they underestimated the alien weapons or had they simply been betrayed whichever forewarned is forearmed when the vampires had sprung from ambush krasins men had excelled in accounting for themselves oh they had died but they had accounted for themselves then in the battle the moment paxton had waited for a female hideous obviously wamphyri had her manta mount blown from under her he had seen her crawl into a cave but so had bruno krasin and paxton had known that krasin would kill her well so would he but theres killing and killing not all of her must die something of her of her inner species must live in paxton but in the cave before he could act that idiot krasin tossing a grenade paxton had barely managed to dive behind a shielding hump of rock and as hed stood up in the smoke and stink of the explosion krasin had pulled the pin on a second grenade paxton had seen his one great opportunity disappearing before his eyes at which his outrage and his weapon had spoken for him tossed back against the wall of the cave his uniform tunic gouged crimson in a dozen places krasins arms were flung wide the grenade went bounding toward the narrow entrance an uproar and darkness out of which paxton the great survivor now clawed himself inch by monotonously slow inch towards the present the here and now the one proof positive of continuing sentience and life consciousness consciousness he woke up and coughed in the sulphur and cordite stench the claustrophobic confines of the collapsed cave he felt the weight of rocks and dirt pinning him down the multiple hurts of cuts and bruises the whirling of his scattered senses but more than anything else the darkness and so he knew that he was still in the cave while his pain told him that he was still alive he moved and the rubble moved with him the dust rose up making him cough some more he used hands crusted with blood to pick rocks off his chest and body laying them aside he lifted his head felt nauseous and laid it down and in a little while lifted it again airlessness was that why he couldnt breathe properly or was it just the weight of the mountain pressing on him and the darkness paxton put aside more rocks sat up freed his limbs and felt them in turn nothing broken just cuts and bruises and a bump like a hens egg on the back of his head he remembered a pencil torch in his pocket god please let it be undamaged and in a moment a smoky beam of light lancing through wreathing cordite stink and trickles of dust from overhead the interior of the cave was intact only the entrance had been brought down close to the wall of the cave bruno krasins uniformed legs and lower trunk stuck out from beneath ten tons of large rocks his legs and a dark wet stain well the russian had been dead anyway but what of the woman or the lady whom theyd chased in here paxton searched for his weapon gone lost under all this debris stooping stumbling careful of his aching head he moved further into the cave his torchbeam flickering before him picking out the way and there there she was except she had no head that was missing her right arm and flabby right breast too and the cave wall close to where she lay was spattered red dead paxton knew as much as most men about the wamphyri but not everything by any means and just like most men he knew and remembered the myths better than the facts he had wanted her alive to bargain for her life he had wanted her to give him what he needed to be wamphyri little chance of that now he sat down on a rock to rest a while and think the beam of his torch roved over zindevar the tattered stump of her fat neck and he saw it move he swung the beam back again held it still with a hand that refused to be still but shook as in a palsy zindevars neck was pulsing throbbing expanding as something struggled to find its way out and suddenly paxton wasnt so sure about what he wanted or even why hed wanted it in the first place and there in the cramped confines of the cave zindevars vampire leech emerged that blind cobrahooded thing trailing mucus from the bloody red tunnel of her neck she was dead but life went on the vampire is tenacious the thing sensed him and came crawling undulating and paxton was sure now what he did not want oh and however briefly he was as sane as the sanest of men as he drew a long knife from its sheath in his belt he jammed his torch in a crack pointing at the horror took his knife and pinned the leech to the dirt floor which only served to accelerate the process the leech whipped to and fro as he jerked back away from it it issued its egg which came skittering out of the torchbeam into darkness that pearly flickering oversized planktonic thing no bigger than his fingernail but quite deadly somewhere in the dark with paxton sobbing he scrambled for the torch and knocked it flying its beam went out and something cold crept on his hand flowed up his right arm inside his shirt went from his armpit across his nipple to his neck it moved like lightning he slapped at it at himself futilely it was on it was in his ear pain agony to make him dance scream slapping madly at the side of his head again and again bounding this way and that someone was pouring acid into his ear his brain melting his head away he stumbled this way and that howling his torment until once again his head made contact with something something mercifully hard darkness again v dreams of the dead ethjois symbols terror in turgosheim it was the dawning of a new day and conceived perhaps out of urgency and frustration in the face of a period of impending inactivity a new idea had likewise dawned nathans original plan had been to wreak maximum havoc in the vampire camps during the long daylight hours but according to grinner who while recuperating continued to relay periodic reports from blaze and others of the grey brothers in the mountains thus keeping nathan updated on wamphyri activity this was now out of the question starside of the high passes and peaks in the permanent shadow of the barrier range the lords of turgosheim had trebled their pickets and despite that it was day were alert as never before devetaki had seen for herself something of the fantastic talents of her szgany foe a man alexei yefros had called the necroscope and had taken appropriate measures further forays against the camps at this time would be sheerest folly if not actually suicidal thus nathan found himself stalemated by his own success and only two days left before gustav turchin would close trask and his colleagues escape route to perchorsk these were sunside days of course which relieved some of the urgency if not the frustration and if it came down to it in the face of some insurmountable difficulty nathan could always transport trask zek and the others to within an ace of the starside gate wish them luck and see them on their way that would mean the end of their obligations to him yes and vice versa but the necroscopes emotions were very mixed on the subject friends like these would be hard to come by in any world he didnt look forward to it following which and if matters were not resolved by the time they left the rest would be in his hands entirely but for now there was a new day and nathan must dream up some new ideas he asked grinner to relay amended orders to all of his grey brothers and withdrew them to safe positions from which to keep a wary eye on the wamphyri without putting themselves at further risk then considered other options and objectives such as wrathstack but here too he was disadvantaged twice he had struck at the last aerie whose inhabitants were not fools to go against the stack again would be to take an enormous risk only emerge from the continuum in the wrong place at the wrong time disaster and in any case nathan actually desired that wratha and the others should not be utterly disadvantaged when it came to the allout war which must ensue at nightfall the more evenly matched the opposing sides the more damage theyd be able to inflict on one another which meant that since he dare not attack his single alternative course of action action of a sort at least was to take defensive measures and he had the full span of a sunside day in which to perfect and complete them dressed in the best szgany clothing he could beg or borrow and accompanied by misha all scrubbed and attired in her finest he set out to visit the thyre to explain and explore the feasibility of his plan which was far simpler in outline than it would be in execution but if it were at all possible then before the onset of night in some one hundred hours time nathan intended to move not just one tribe into the comparative safety of the thyre colonies but as many surviving traveller pockets as he could locate except he knew that he should first have the blessing of the thyre themselves before leaving the temporary camp he explained his mission to lardis and the others then leaving zek and chung with work to do work which only they were equipped to carry out the locating of other traveller groups in the forests to east and west he conjured the first of several mobius doors starting at placeundertheyellowcliffs the closest of all the thyre colonies misha and nathan commenced visiting a long itinerary of suitable refuges contacted by nathan in advance atwei was there to meet them in the deep sandstone gorge where the necroscope had first conversed with the philosopher rogei then the gorge had been a dry inhospitable place now it was very different on nathans last visit when he had brought members of his party here after their arrival through the starside gate he had not stepped outside the mausoleum except through a mobius door this time atwei had begged him to come to the gorge itself because she wanted him to see it her reason was simple against its rear wall the gorge was now a small but flourishing oasis full of shrubs flowers bees hives and honey all thanks to nathan and to the artisan shaeken and the gardener tharkel upon a time the necroscope had relayed the words and works of these two thyre ancients to their living descendants with the result that shaekens water ram was now operational pumping lifegiving water up from the great dark river and tharkels gardening and beekeeping theories and skills had not been lost beyond the barrier of his last long sleep but the water ram keeps breaking down atwei told her visitors and so the people of placeundertheyellowcliffs are working on shaekens hydraulic hoist she shrugged her thin brown shoulders alas that the things that men make break and that when they do theres nothing for it but that we use muscle and put machines aside it is very hard to keep the oasis going at which nathan remembered something it had seemed a big important thing when first he saw it in trasks world but now seemed dwarfed to insignificance by the events of the long night anyway it would be something by way of repayment for the very great favours he must ask of the thyre standing some way apart from the oasis seeing movement in the greenery he turned to atwei and asked her are any of the elders in the oasis the other elders i mean petals grandson of rogei is there she answered petals who was so hard on you when first you came among us will you speak to him he would be honoured he became my friend in the end nathan smiled bring him here into the sunlight if you will for i have something to show him ill be back and to misha it will only take a moment before they could query him he conjured a door and disappeared into thin air and was back again by the time petais had been introduced to misha nathan had brought with him a small box whose location he had marked among the ammunition boxes in the temporary camp now if the boxs contents had come through undamaged they had a tiny brass model steamengine with a shining steel flywheel and a chain drivebelt and a square magnifying glass in a frame it took only a moment to fill the boiler with water from petaiss waterskin then nathan placed the engine on a block of sandstone and positioned the glass against a pebble where its lens trapped the sun and focused it on the boiler the sun was very hot in a little while the safetyvalve began to whistle nathan barely touched the flywheel and the engine chugged into life the piston hammered to and fro and the spokes of the flywheel became a blur and to petais a little water and sunlight of which you have ample equals energy this is only a small thing a model but with a big one coupled to shaekens hoist he glanced at atwei and smiled no more aching muscles we have not the skills petais protested thyre understanding of metalworking would not run to this but the szgany do have such skills nathan answered and you can avail yourselves of them with thyre mirrors to focus the sunlight and engines like this in caverns in the ground the desert could be made to bloom petaiss jaw had fallen open for once he had no words and so said nothing the visit went well with all of the remaining elders of placeundertheyellowcliffs agreeing to a man that the new oasis in the gorge would make an ideal harbour area for threatened travellers it was by now generally accepted that the threat to the szgany was also a threat to sunside in its entirety including the people of the furnace deserts nathan thanked them humbly and asked permission to visit the cavern of the ancients he would speak to shaeken and tharkel and let them know how their visions had come to fruition also to show them the steamengine he would keep his visit as brief as possible permission was granted of course but in the cavern of the ancients nathan strange times said shaeken and tharkel together almost talking over the top of each other for we have dreamed weird dreams which wasnt in itself peculiar nathan knew that the dead grow weary much like the living and that they sleep too and dream much as they did in life you too still he was mystified yet perhaps shouldnt be too surprised these were strange times and when better for portents to have power what are these things youve dreamed his reasons for being here to tell them about the oasis and the steamengine were temporarily forgotten i have dreamed of water said shaeken and so have i said the other breathlessly water to turn the desert green now nathan remembered why he was here but you must know that these werent just dreams he said water was your lifelong fascination both of you you shaeken in that you were a visionary and saw the importance of the great dark river under the desert its bounty if it could be brought to the surface and you tharkel because you were a gardener who explored the nature of growing things in a way you worked towards the same end and your obsessions stayed with you in death as in life what you have dreamed is what you felt an oasis that flourishes even now in the gorge beyond the cliffs which house this mausoleum and now he told them his news but that is all exciting said tharkel except it does jittje to explain our dreams yes our obsession was with water and perhaps the water flowing in the oasis pumped up by shaekens ram has shaken his old bones and stimulated his mind but my dream was of a world of water with the desert itself pushed back for mile upon mile why i even dreamed of a fountain but isnt that the same obsession said nathan with a deadspeak shrug water springing from the dry earth oh said tharkel from the dry dead earth do you mean aye for the fountain i dreamed was on starside where it was lit by a soft white light and shaeken said also i dreamed of thunderclouds in the sky over the desert and great rains which seemed to me to corroborate tharkels dreams yet neither one of us can reason it out we do not know what these things mean nathan shook his head frowned and said i dont understand either are you trying to tell me youve seen into some kind of future if i had heard it from thikkoul thikkoul they both cried at once but we have spoken to thikkoul and shaeken explained you must remember necroscope that the thyre are telepaths in life and this too continues after death all of the ancients of the thyre are now more frequently in contact than ever before and practice as they say makes perfect what is more all of the thyre dead seem filled with visions and portents oh yes we have spoken to thikkoul and recently and you are right it appears our talents complement each other how so we spoke of water shaeken answered and thikkoul spoke of a great turning of the world tharkel took it up it was almost as though it was as if we animated each other as if we were linked up dead mind to dead mind each vision building upon the one gone before as if our total shaeken went on was greater than the sum of our parts nathan was surprised to hear such an expression do you know he said but that sounds like ethloi the mathematician speaking i talked to him in opentothesky in the cavern of long dreams that was oh a long time ago ethloi who knows numbers shaeken said of course for i was the one who sent you to him you should speak to him again for those were ethlois words that i spoke oh is he in on this too and are his dreams filled with visions and portents indeed and we know that he desires to talk to you he hasnt said as much hes a humble man ethlois numbers are humble and yours are legendary also there were a great many who would speak to you first nathan he did not wish to waste your time with his puny symbols he said that yes symbols not numbers symbols water symbols the waters that flow between the worlds thats what he said then i shall be with him shortly for opentothesky is next on my list when will you go there now if youll excuse me of course tharkel and shaeken told him in unison and may the one who listens go with you nathan and misha returned to the lidesci camp it was to have been a brief visit to check on zek and chungs progress before continuing with their round of thyre colonies except there had actually been a deal of progress and nathan must look into it namely zek had picked up human thoughts in the forests to the east near the ruined deserted town of twin fords david chung had felt something too and after lardis had sketched a rough map of the area chung was able to pinpoint the source it can only be karl zestos lardis grunted or his survivors if karls dead the last i heard karl led a small band of twin fords folk sometimes they lie low in cliff caverns at others they hide out in the woods by day they travel and scavenge of course their thoughts were very well guarded zek said rightly so nathan told her if it had been night you would have had your work cut out to find them at all and lardis asked will you go to them at once if only to take karl a little cheer i like him he asked me to join him upon a time but now he might be a bit suspicious i mean its a strange thing that ill be showing him take me with you said lardis nodding if karl should find something suspicious about me ill box his ears i can remember when his father bela was boss taking chung lardis and andrei with him nathan made a jump seven miles east from where chung was able to narrow the location of the camp down a little nathans second jump took them to within one hundred yards of their target then lardis and andrei went off on their own through the bushes and finally hallooed for nathan and chung to join them karl zestos was just as nathan remembered him longhaired jutjawed blackeyed and thin as a pole but strong which was just as well in the years flown between even the strongest of men had fallen i would know you anywhere karl said locking forearms with the necroscope with your blond hair a little grey now i note and your blue eyes there cant be a great many like you theres none like this one lardis told him hes harry helllanders son and he has his fathers talents the legend of the original necroscope was known far and wide throughout all of sunside after that the easiest way to explain their presence here was for nathan to give a practical demonstration he issued the usual cautions told karl to close his eyes ignore any dizziness keep still and after the other had followed his instructions took his arm and walked him two paces forward and two thousand miles east and sixty south it was crater lake but nathan couldnt stay he returned with karl to lardis and the others and waited until karl had taken several deep breaths and adjusted to events finally the truth of it sank in and the necessary arrangements were completed it had been karls intention that towards night his people should make for caves in the cliffs behind twin fords now they would wait here for nathan there were perhaps a dozen szgany zestos in the small camp mainly women and a handful of children the rest the ablebodied men were out hunting how many people nathan wanted to know karls mouth turned down we were a town upon a time he said and when the truth of that registered in their memories now there are thirtytwo of us all told the dozen or so that you see here and the rest out earning their keep i can move you all in a single trip nathan said and i will tonight not as far as crater lake maybe crackintherocks ill keep crater lake as a refuge of last resort as for tonight i calculate that for the first half of the night at least the wamphyri will be occupied with their bloodwar after that theyll need to replenish to restock what theyve lost or destroyed refill their temporary camps with thralls and flesh if wratha and the others in wrathstack survive they will be in the same position theyll require to refuel except they wont discover anything of nourishment in sunside not tonight karl passed on information of other survivors to the east and then nathan transported lardis and the others back to camp the necroscopes last words to karl before leaving were these be ready when i come there may not be much time with misha nathan visited opentothesky they received the customary thyre welcome and in a little while misha became the first and probably the last szgany woman to enter the cavern of long dreams indeed of all the szgany the necroscope himself was the only one who had been there before her while misha sat quietly and experienced the mystical atmosphere of the mausoleum nathan conversed with ethloi who told him you could have spoken to me from afar necroscope that wasnt my fathers way nathan answered and except that it cant be helped it wont be mine here i am close to you thats how friends should talk but time is short and i have heard that you have something to tell me i shall value your advice even as i valued your teaching that time my teaching my numbers hah the other brushed the compliment aside but i have seen yours nathan in fact i was the student never the teacher except i had not the wit to understand the lessons ridiculous nathan answered and anyway my numbers were born in me while yours came from learning but ive been told your dreams are diverse and that currently these are not numbers that youve dreamed symbols aye ethloi whispered like and yet unlike the symbols you once showed to me in your vortex if there is meaning in them you might know it if not perhaps i am wasting your time but as you know we ancients share our thoughts and our knowledge puts on growth like dripstone on a skeletal stalactite nathan was fascinated show me these symbols and this is what ethloi showed him but before nathan could comment ethloi continued which in my dreams always seems to go hand in hand with this now nathan said i know that one at least it is myself or the symbol by which i know myself but the other i cant say he shook his head the wavy lines look like water ethlois deadspeak nod and i have dreamed of rivers that flow between the worlds there are no such rivers i know for the moment at least it was all beyond the necroscope frustrating beyond reason if ethlois symbols were numbers it might be puzzled out but there were no numbers here just circles arrows water you could have picked up this water theme from tharkel and shaeken yes but i dont think so and that design could it be a machine it somehow reminds me of the steamengine it has a feeling of pistons pressure movement power ethloi showed him the symbols again with the mobius strip laid over or intertwining with them the mobius strip like the symbol for eternity like the mobius continuum itself a joining in the fabric of everywhere and when where all other places and times come together a junction of worlds or indeed of universes but rivers that flow between worlds it was on the edge of the necroscopes mind like a familiar word that teeters unspoken on the tongue for a moment his metaphysical mind appeared to grasp it then let go and as it slipped away dissolving to nothing he sensed all of the same old frustrations mounting until he felt he must shout strike out physically shake them off the feeling passed and ill think on what youve shown me he said slowly presently it was time to go so the day passed together with misha nathan visited as many of the thyre colonies as were suitable as temporary szgany refuges and not one turned him down it was time that men got to know the ways and customs of their desert brothers and learned to appreciate them and vice versa and the best friends are those who make themselves available in time of need from this time forward there would always be a much closer liaison between szgany and thyre an era was over the time when the thyre of the desert were considered unmen was past and the necroscope was as good as his word in the night misha had told him that tomorrow she would lie out in the sun with him in the long prairie grass but he had told her there was a better place and there was the place where he and she had crept into each others arms just five months ago on the day they were married one third of the way through the morning nathan called a break and carried misha there via the continuum to the spot east of sanctuary rock where their nuptial trek had taken them and as before in a sea of bracken he threw a skin over the bole of a fallen tree and made it fast to projecting branches to keep the sun off and they took their fill of love drank wine and ate bread and cheese just like before but before they slept she took his head on her breasts and cradling him said didnt i say youd remember our first little house for the rest of your days didnt i tell you that i would see to it it seemed a long time ago but nathan remembered it well you did and you did he answered dreamily and i did and i always will then they slept and the necroscope came awake with something someone oozing in his mind he knew him at once and felt him withdrew like a snake slithering between stones but by now he knew that hed had enough of this one without waking misha he stole a short distance apart from her through the bracken put up his hand to the twisted loop of gold in his ear and sent a thought winging for turgosheim maglore i know you who else could it be of all the wamphyri on the prowl when the sun is up you kept strange habits for the beastthing that you are for a moment there was no answer but then the other put aside all pretence and said and so we have made fools of each other you of me in turgosheim when you hid from me your true nature your powers and me of you ever since that night when you thought that you fled from me but i will admit nathan that was the bigger fool for there was that in you which i should have seen and explored when had the chance oh nathan answered and have you seen enough now youll agree that ive given you plenty of time surely for you see you didnt make that much of a fool of me maglore ive known about you for some time and you have only seen what i wanted to show you the other was silent and nathan continued anyway its over now from now on youll get as little from me as you do from vormulac which is to say nothing except where vormulac is dead i am very much alive and now maglore hit back sneering ah ungrateful creature i know well enough that youre alive and just how much ahve you are his mental chuckle was black as pitch ask yourself this who was it sent his jovethralj to you in order to instruct you you virgin you innocent you have that to thank me for at least but now something youll never thank me for think on this nathan i was with you the night you were wed and again just an hour or so ago oh i have not enjoyed your woman your misha i have not known her with my own member no but i have enjoyed you enjoying her since the game was up the seerlord would let his spiteful nature hold full sway whatever he had put over on the necroscope he would now use it to belittle him it was the way of the wamphyri if they could not torture their victims physically they would do it mentally this time however his mockery went too far nathan was no longer a shivering thrall in promontory runemanse but his own free man and a power listen to me he said so you have enjoyed spying on me from afar youve enjoyed my pleasures and hope that by telling me about it theyll be reduced but youre like a spoiled child maglore because you cannot have all your own way you seek to subtract from the lives of others hah and youre the one who counted yourself superior to the other lords aye and i remember your silly model of turgosheim its spires and manses how you would hurl your socalled spells and imprecations against the houses of your betters when you thought that they had slighted you but in fact they never had slighted you indeed they rarely so much as noticed you what doddering old maglore who sent young men to service his wenches because he was way past doing it for himself well at least those young men were men by comparison scum of the earth indeed vampires aye but men next to you maglore men next to you the part about maglores impotency was a lie of course but that too was the way of the vampire and perfectly acceptable in their taunting and wordgames and the necroscope had always been good at matching taunts maglore was furious his telepathic aura seethed with his hatred if i could if i could but reach out across all of the miles between he choked the thought out ware how you threaten maglore nathan too was enraged but somehow managed to control it his telepathic voice was a hiss as if spoken through clenched teeth for youre impotent in more ways than one no you cant reach out and theres no tool of yours can harm me here but as for me eh the other gasped sensing a threat and quietly now i go where i will nathan told him and indeed i do reach out at will i speak to the dead who listen to me but im sure you know all this by now except do you know it all how little do you know maglore and again eh but whats to know oh you long suspected that i conferred with some other in turgosheim but has it not dawned on you with whom i conferred no you may not reach out and strike at me but i come and go as i will i talk to the dead who advise me through me they seek revenge on the living yet how may the dead harm the living or is there something more do you remember maglore how you told me that runemanse was haunted runemanse the other gasped haunted or if not runemanse itself nathan went on then gloomy shadowed madmanse in the levels below no you may not strike at me nor even reach out to touch me from this time forward look there and will you read me now well good luck to you may the stinkgnats entertain you you have comparable minds after all and so im free of you maglore but are you free free the other gibbered why i rule now in turgosheim all is mine what do i care for madmanse care ah no but fear ah yes theres nothing to fear in madmanse just an old and crumbling dead thing eygor may not harm me really nathans voice was a sly whisper can you be sure well we shall see maglore pulled himself together and snarled when next we meet nathan seersthrall you are a dead man or a man changed forever into something hideous but i doubt that we shall ever meet nathan told him i doubt that i shall ever speak to you again not in this world nor am i your thrall but you may one day be mine for after all i converse with the dead nathan i farewell maglore i leave your sigil your shewstone where it and where you belong in the shit of a beast spy on that if you will he withdrew his probe and the telepathic aether fell silent on the instant the sunside day was a long one worth more than four of parallel earths days but the time was not wasted there was good genuinely restful sleep to be had there were visits and arrangements to be made there was a handful of teeming dead whom the necroscope must speak to not least his mother nana who considered herself the most fortunate of all the teeming dead in that she still had her son and through nathan sunside and the szgany through his wolves in the heights nathan kept a watchful wary eye on the wamphyri through deadspeak contacts such as jason lidesci he updated himself on the necrology of men and monsters alike and through the talents of zek foener and david chung he was able to locate advise and make arrangements for the safety of a good many more travellers survivors of tireni scarp and mirlu township were discovered in the west and told to prepare for evacuation others to the east fell in with nathans plans the necroscope was relieved to discover large numbers of travellers in the woods even though the majority of them trusted only to themselves and kept hidden away but that was probably as well after all it would be impossible to move all of them to safety still it was heartening to note that while wratha and the others had been resident in starside for three and a half years a period of prolonged wamphyri depredations still the tribes flourished and on that theme the theme of burgeoning against all odds something else had become very noticeable not only to nathan but to everyone who had previous knowledge of it what do you make of it ben trask asked nathan at lardiss camp the necroscope smiled and shrugged well its plain to see what andrei romani makes of it at least but then andrei doesnt know her as we do the subject of trasks inquiry was anna marie english the previously wilting ecopath in tune with the earth to such an extent that her own physical wellbeing was governed by her unique talent an incredible metamorphosis now seemed to be at work in her she was growing younger previously drab arthritic stumbling and blearyeyed in short grown old before her time now the years seemed to be falling off her during the night trask said no one noticed her she was with us that was all and now because theyll see her as she is now in the morning light this is how theyll think of her from now on they wont realize that theres been a change in her but back on earth a week ago well you saw how she was she never would have made last nights trek a few miles would have been enough to cripple her but take a look at her now nathan looked according to trask during other conversations when the ecopath had been twentyfour shed looked fifty when nathan had first met her just a few months ago shed been forty but still looked fifty it had seemed to say a great deal for her home world that after years of ecological depredations mother earth was struggling to be back on her feet a fact that seemed mirrored in anna maries vitality the abeyance of her physical decline it had meant that men were learning to abide by rules of ecological conservation and sensible husbandry of a planets resources albeit the parallel planet beyond the gate so what was going on here anna marie was fortyone but looked thirtyfive she had put aside her thicklensed spectacles and hearingaid her eyes and hair shone her liver spots were little more than freckles she who had limped now held herself upright her head high and the defect in her hip was barely noticeable her movements were flowing her limbs seemed supple and her hair bounced when she smiled her teeth gleamed anna marie wasnt beautiful but she was undeniably attractive certainly andrei romani was attracted he stood watching while she taught a small group of orphaned children a game out of the helllands ringaring oroses children had been anna maries life ever since the romanian refuge which reminded the necroscope of someone else who had loved children in turgosheims sunside so she had told him anyway orlea maglores lovethrall in runemanse for a time she had been nathans lover albeit wrapped and gifted to him by maglore a gift he darent refuse at first until in a while he hadnt wanted to it had lasted for a time until the seerlord had put a stop to it just part of the evil old bastards game his plan to corrupt nathan subvert him to his cause well said trask umm oh what do i make of it nathan came back to the present well this is a young world an unspoiled world at least ignore the wamphyri and the nature of this world is healthy however briefly anna marie is now part of sunsidestarside and so reflects its quality trask nodded i thought that might be your solution but it feels wrong to me it could be wishful thinking of course but i would like to think she reflects whats still to come only time will tell nathans shrug was perhaps a little careless which was hardly intentional but as trask was suddenly aware the necroscopes mind was on other things the worst of it was nathan couldnt tell anyone where he planned to go or what he would do there but subconsciously orleas plight her situation in runemanse as maglores companion had bothered the necroscope for a long time the seerlord had not changed her for he had valued her humanity with orlea as with nathan he had been assured of his own superiority but orleas story had warmed nathan in soulless runemanse he still remembered the way she had asked after sunsides children and suspected that shed mourned the warmth and light of times forever past well and if what he planned worked out but even if it failed to work out why should she suffer the the hospitality of that loathsome lord of the wamphyri a moment longer shed told nathan she loved maglore that time but he had suspected it was a love born out of madness or of the fact that the seerlord was her only protection in a place void of the light and love of humanity well now there was a choice something other than maglores dubious protection if orlea would only avail herself of it wherefore in the afternoon after eating and sleeping nathan made sure he was up before misha in the camp at the edge of the forest this was deliberate he couldnt tell her his mission for obvious reasons she wouldnt understand his motives or might think she understood them too well he didnt want to deceive her but neither could he hurt her if he could get orlea out of runemanse he would place her in a small thyre colony until later he could move her back into turgosheims sunside all of this kept secret of course but it was all hit and miss all ifs and buts for example if ought should happen to him orlea would be stuck with the thyre but even then would that be any worse than a life of everincreasing morbidity and madness in promontory runemanse no of course not nor could nathan mention his mission to trask or lardis so much as hint at it they would try to dissuade him rightly so for if anything were to happen to him what price then lardiss dreams his hopes and what of trasks chance of returning home nathan supposed he was being selfish but how if he worked for the wellbeing of another also he remembered orlea so well she had been like a breath of fresh air in the otherwise vile atmosphere of runemanse it was even possible shed saved his sanity so that the very thought of her still trapped there was abhorrent to him and so saying nothing to anyone he walked out a little way on to the prairie conjured a door and moved to the rim of turgosheim within the fortifications of the roof of the rearing turret that was runemanse it was past noon but the sun was still high in the southern sky its rays burned on the upper ramparts the hour was such that in most of the conquered manses a majority of men and monsters alike would be sleeping yet still nathan guarded his secret mind shrouding it in numbers as he moved swiftly to the low parapet wall leaned across it and looked down on gloomy smoking vapourwreathed turgosheim he knew that he had the coordinates and could find his way directly into orleas locked room it was simply a matter of familiarity and certainly he had been familiar enough with that room in his time but what of maglore even the seerlord must sleep at times and midday was as good a time as any also when maglore had when he had wanted orlea he had used to call for her her room had been hers alone where shed known complete privacy a singularly rare thing in runemanse nathan dared not probe telepathically but neither could he stand here wavering on the rim like a boy desperate to swim who fancies the water is too cold he made up his mind made to conjure a door too and in that selfsame moment saw them maglore and orlea together on the lowwalled platform of a balcony one tier down from his own position gazing out over turgosheim he saw them and they sensed him his surprise had served to focus his thoughts upon them as their presence had registered in nathans mind so had his in theirs galvanized their heads cranked back their widening eyes swivelled up to glare the shock of recognition into his own you maglores mental croak rumbled in nathans head and nathaaan orlea hissed her eyes like lanterns in the balconys shade flaring to match the seerlords own gasping his horror nathan thought i should have known it she was here too long she was maglores for far too jong and the lady orlea looking at him with uniformly scarlet eyes her ruby lips slowly forming into a smile that displayed eyeteeth like small curved knives and the seerlord pointing a taloned hand snarling see now didnt i tell you he comes and goes like a ghost except the necroscope knew that maglores spoken words were merely a subterfuge a ruse a cover for his unspoken query and command where are you dull and stupid beasts socajled guardians of the roof my enemy is upon me even now come see to him destroy him this had always been nathans main advantage over maglore his ability to read the mages thoughts while guarding his own but even if he had not heard maglores command he most certainly would have heard the grunts of startled inquiry and scrabbling of horny feet on the vast flat roof so that turning from the rim he saw his second error that hed failed to credit the oh so clever maglore with even a modicum of intelligence or if not that then that he had started to put too much faith in his own powers until he believed theyd made him invincible what but naturally maglore would post guards here even in his great triumph he would know better than to leave unguarded a possible route of entry into runemanse doubtless these creatures of maglores had been stationed in the squat turrets that knobbed the wall at the rear of the promontory where it bottlenecked into a mighty bridge of rock the wall with its turret battlements and the precipitous gulf itself kept runemanse safe from attack from the great plateau that sprawled for seven miles to the south before sloping down into the wooded foothills of turgosheims sunside the guardians had been keeping watch outside the wall and to the south on the lookout for any creeping incursion but nathan had arrived here instantly north of the wall and within its demarcation wherefore the guardians in tune with their lords mind had been unaware of the necroscopes presence until the moment maglore himself sensed it they were not warriors so much as personal guards produce of maglores vats but of recent construction and utterly nightmarish aspect and vampires of course the necroscope had never seen anything quite like them before so that for a moment they unmanned him they were spidery things manyarmed and legged but their limbs were those of men with grapples and pincers in place of hands and feet ravenously hungry they came scuttling at great speed and in redeyed rage from the shadowy doorways of their turret observation posts nathan gathered his wits conjured a door glanced down at maglore one last time and called out enjoy your triumph while you may maglore of runemanse for it wont last long but as the roofs grotesque guardians came scurrying like great grey spiders he stepped back from the rim and in through his mobius door and without pause collapsed it behind him and as he returned to the temporary camp of the lidescis in his own sunside those thousands of miles to the west he could scarcely help but view his threat with dismay aye for with all turgosheim and its conquered denizens at maglores command the seerlords triumph might easily last a very long time indeed soured by what he had seen saddened by orleas conversion to vampirism the necroscope must leave it at that for now at least part eight bloodwars i timescan two fly out stormclouds on starside nathan had no choice but to forget about orlea just as hed been obliged to forget about siggi dam his interest had lain in setting them free but they were beyond that now they had become irretrievably part of the vampire world they were vampires and he was sworn to destroy them for the first twothirds of a long but less then interminable afternoon he was quiet to the point of withdrawn but as the sun dawdled east on its low slow trajectory almost imperceptibly losing height he gradually came out of it and if his moods were noticed and people wondered about them nothing was said for after all the necroscope had many problems but moods or none he worked because he had to chosen men were trained in the use of alien arms and transported via the mobius continuum into the several camps of traveller groups who could not bring themselves to trust or accept nathans invitation as support teams these trained men would add firepower to szgany determination helping the loner parties to withstand whatever the coming night might have in store through grinner nathan was kept updated on affairs in the barrier mountains on the boulder plains and starside in general despite that it was sunup there had been some movement devetaki had replaced the observation posts destroyed by wran the rages bombardiers and shed also dispatched men and creatures into selected areas west of the great pass flying low over the plain of boulders and safe in the constant shade of the mountains they had established a number of camps in trog caverns behind the starside foothills it was all part of the continuing containment of wratha in the last aerie of course but the necroscope was more concerned about the gate he worried about the proximity of the vampire camps to that allimportant portal finally he took trask aside to tell him ben i dont see how you can help any more it might be a good idea to get you out of here while we still can i can have grinner send a wolf or two to check on movement near the gate then if the way is clear i can get you zek and the others as close as possible and from then on youre on your own trask nodded and you nathan wont you be on your own too but we have two whole days sunside days before we have to get back before turchin brings the weight of the mountains down on that place in perchorsk and the longer the better if zek and lan are to use the romanian route two days less travelling time nathan answered through the gate i mean provided of course that the route to the gate isnt blocked what your way blocked trask cocked his head are you joking i can only get so close nathan reminded him but devetakis creatures dont suffer the same restrictions now more than ever the necroscope was aware of the constant danger he was in he knew that the lords and ladies were aware of him trask shook his head weve talked about it and were all of the same mind while you can use us we want to stay and by we i do mean all of us im including john carling jim bentley and orson sangster theyre good men and they can handle guns they no nathan shook his head cut trask short least of all those three they didnt come of their well i hate to sound like a vampire but they arent here of their own free will they got caught up in things thats all and now well they at least are leaving and no argument trask set his jaw stubbornly dont think youll shake me and zek that easily or chung and goodly or even anna marie for that matter were espers and you need us we were a team on earth our earth when you helped us out with that problem in the nightmare zone so well continue to be a team here were staying until we have to go even until its too late if it comes to it yes but i dont think it will youre harry keoghs son nathan is that a recommendation you put faith in that do you the wamphyri killed him in the end and again nathan thought of just how close he too had come and how recently simple carelessness but on sunsidestarside that was all it took zek was looking for them she saw them where they stood at the camp perimeter under mighty ironwoods and came hurrying she looked lovely as ever but they saw that she held a hand to her temple where the corners of her eyes were creased in a frown david chung was right behind her nathan she said closing with the pair you are being watched david chung joined them and said shes right i picked up a locating probe one that id know anywhere the last time i came up against him was west of the urals when we snatched nathan from the russians its alexei yefros nathan nodded in thrall to devetaki yes it hardly surprises me we saw them together in the pass chung nodded but his talent is that much better now he can switch it on and off like a light ive fancied there was a locator at work for some time but hes been dodging me hes a vampire nathan pointed out the obvious even as alowly thrall his talent has been enhanced again chungs nod and youre the one hes on to his probe is a carrier for devetaki zek finished it and again her hand went to her temple shes powerful stop it nathan told her at once reaching for her hand dragging it from her face dont interfere with that one devetakis the leader of the turgosheim army and that speaks for itself shell know it immediately if you break into her probe and then shell try to hurt you he had seen enough women hurt and worse than hurt murdered and worse than murdered he looked around wheres lan goodly they found goodly nathan came straight to the point and the precog agreed with him the cavers are out of it he was matteroffact about it i dont see them here from now on is that all nathan asked and goodly frowned its all vague he said it doesnt firm up until its closer closer in time i mean but im going with you to the gate oh and grinner too you see that yes and im ready which meant they were going now zek went off to tell carling and the other cavers to get ready and nathan called for grinner the great wolf came tongue lolling why me he wanted to know its foreseen nathan could only shrug good for i wanted to see that place again the starside gate yes but also the other place the between place the mdbius continuum why to smell the directions wolf mindpictures were weird full of scents and sensations spacial and even temporal currents but there was little or nothing of numbers in it and whatever else it was the necroscope had neither a nose for it nor the mental compass required to understand it the thought did cross his mind however that the senses of a homing pigeon must be somewhat similar to those of a wolf minus the hunting instinct of course waiting for the cavers to get ready nathan made a quick jump to a spot just one hundred yards west of the glaring hemisphere gate he felt its strange repulsive forces acting on his door which was beginning to warp even as he exited but he was there for the merest moment sufficient to scan the plains in all directions and send tentative telepathic probes inwards to the barrier mountains and the great pass and eastwards to the petrified lava camps of the wamphyri before conjuring a second fragile door and getting out again he had detected the wamphyri everywhere but none of them close enough to cause any real concern he knew however that things could change in very short order so couldnt delay the departure of the cavers a moment longer zek had fashioned a rope collar and lead for grinner who hated it but it was the easiest way nathan took the wolfs lead in one hand and guided grinner and the triplelinked men carling bentley and sangster with goodly bringing up the rear through his entirely invisible door to starside the men were used to it now if not nathans nephew wolf coming out of the mobius door almost at the run john carling and company went loping with their packs bouncing to the low crater wall helped each other up paused for a moment in the sighing white illumination of the gate to look back its glare was such that the necroscope and goodly saw the three as dark silhouettes that waved turned away and were gone they had their instructions to tell turchin and ebranch that others could soon be coming through both in perchorsk and in romania on their way home nathan sighed and glanced at goodly but the precog was staggering which wasnt an aftereffect of their brief mobius trip what is it nathan was at once solicitous goodly straightened up steadied himself shook his head it will keep he said until we get back grinner had noticed nothing he was still fascinated by the gate the fact that the three men had vanished within it he stared at it with his ears pricked up his head cocked curiously to one side gone he said to the world of my fathers father except there are other ways than this nathan was interested in that but we cant stay here any longer he told the wolf the onewhoscans will find me if we do and the wamphyri will know my business thats something i can do without nathaaaaan there were other voices invading his mind now the voices of thyre ancients speaking out from their tombs in the burning deserts he knew the first of them at once tharkel the gardener but excited as never before nathan i was dreaming again and you were there yes he answered i am here no no tharkel shook his head i mean you were there at the place of the fountain a fountain of light the starside gate was that what this was all about but before nathan could ask or comment necroscope and this was ethloi equally excited forget about tharkels fountain for the moment unless its significant of a spring for you are standing at the very source the source of what where youre standing now right now at this very moment is the shore of a lake and at your feet i see a sea of stars and in their centre a brilliant sunburst a sunburst nathan repeated him out loud a lake a sea of stars and yes said goodly reeling again the answers could be sought later right now nathan had to get his charges out of here conjuring a door he led man and wolf through it and made to return to sunside but on the way there uncle grinners telepathic voice was a hushed whimper what now nathan asked dont you feel them the directions directions to where to other places but one place especially your fathers world nathan the world of harry dwellersire it might make sense at that for after all grinner was a child of the dweller he and blaze and poor dock too and the dweller had travelled between worlds without using the gates at perchorsk and radujevac indeed thered been no gate at perchorsk at that time and the one underground in romania was still undiscovered so had grinner inherited something of his werewolf fathers metaphysical talents or was it simply his wolfs or dogs sense of well direction or a combination of both nathan knew that he had to look into it but he would drop lan goodly off first he did so then at once returned with grinner into the mobius continuum but it was a fruitless exercise grinner had something of his father in him certainly but he didnt have his metaphysical maths and wolf numbers just werent sufficient i can feel the way he growled in nathans mind but i dont know how to go there there is no way to walk to run no way to smell the trail no spoor to follow am lost here nathan tried scanning grinners mind more deeply his sensations rather than his thoughts but it didnt work out there was a peculiar feeling of sorrow or anxiety for the loss of the mountains the moon and stars the trees of the timberline the rearing crags and moonsilvered passes namely all of the familiar points of reference by virtue of which a wolf of the wild is a wolf and also an awareness that was totally unwolflike but never a hint of the real direction of parallel earth you cant show me the way but i can grinner protested its there it was as if he pointed but there was nothing there just the emptiness of the continuum except theres no way to get to it now his anxiety and discomfort were such that he was beginning to pant and whine nathan knew the others frustration and sensed there was no answer for it not yet at least regretfully but unwilling to prolong grinners distress he conveyed him back to the camp where goodly was waiting giving grinner into the hands of misha to care for him nathan asked the precog what was it all about i mean what was it you felt back there on starside what did you feel goodly countered are you so afraid of the future that you cant answer a simple question nathans frustrations were starting to spill over yes goodly answered sometimes i am its not knowing what might come about that worries me its understanding it nathan had heard all this before but you did see something of the future i saw and felt something strange the world turning the wild rush of water like a river between the worlds gardens in the desert all of those things yes yet nothing definite the only sure thing is this you wont be moving any more of us back to the gate not until the end anyway how do you know that because i saw it and its the only thing i know for certain at the end were all in it together goodlys eyes had a faraway look they were hazy as a river with the morning sun on it unblinking as if gazing on the unknown and unknowable when the necroscope could feel the short hairs rising at the back of his neck soon said goodly was it dark or light day or night it was night goodly answered with a sigh and yet it was it was morning too his eyes cleared and he shook his head nathan he said when he could properly focus again i know this is difficult for you but youll just have to believe me when i tell you that that you really shouldnt fool with the future now it was nathans turn to be stubborn im not going to call you a coward he said but there are some things we have to know and ive been putting it off just like you and for the same reason tutting it off what we cant put off the necroscope answered not any more for its creeping up on us even now but me i believe in forewarned forearmed you can help me youre about the only one who can help me or you can step aside its up to you youll go there the cadaverous gauntfaced precog backed off a pace and id like you to go with me nathan nodded i dont know what ill see or even if ill understand it but you and the future well theres something between you so maybe i dont know said goodly and anyway what good will it do you cant materialize there cant experience it you can only travel through it as far as it goes yes again nathans nod but a curt one this time and decisive the meaning was obvious and if it doesnt go far then ill know its all for nothing anyway but it wont matter for ill have nothing to lose goodly relaxed shrugged said then ill go with you and he sighed adding you dont know how much of a temptation its been or how hard ive had to fight not to ask you nathan was astonished what but arent you the one who always yes goodly cut him short even so we have a saying better the devil you know and if i had been able to go there instead of having to wait for it to come to me they both felt something of trepidation then as the necroscope made ready to conjure a door which was when ben trask came over whats happening he asked conver sationally his face wide open until he saw their looks and knew that something really was happening were going to have a look at something nathan answered before goodly could speak but glancing from man to man trask knew the truth of it anyway is it wise he said no they both shook their heads and nathan added but we have to know and the fact of it was trask wanted to know too in the continuum goodly had second thoughts knew a moments panic when he felt motion and knew that nathan was heading for a futuretime door it was strange in ordinary spacetime he could sense the future but here so close to it he couldnt because this place was the future the present too and the past a junction of all times and places and he wanted to know how do we get back we have blue lifethreads in effect lifelines they are us when weve seen what we want to see if theres anything to see we follow them back you you can do that yes i fee that can else wouldnt go and i can do it just keep a good hold on me nathan told him where they stood framed in the blue light from the threshold of the door and jook there it is all of it going on forever all we have to do is find out how long we go on despite that the light from the door was blue it was warm not physically warm just warm and goodly knew why it was the light of human life for even as he stood or floated there in the metaphysical void a blue thread of light like a living neon filament a weird ectoplasmic extension of himself issued endlessly out of him and another out of nathan seeming to unwind indefinitely into the future beyond that timedoor was the future a chaos of hundreds of thousands of blue threads all heading for the ever expanding hazyblue and endless horizons of tomorrow and even in the mobius continuum human eyes could not gaze on that scene without human ears hearing a sound that was not there but born of the awesome immensity of the vision an angelic chorus an orchestrated interminable ahhhhhhhh but not everything was angelic beyond the door there were scarlet threads too among the neon blue for this was sunsidestarsides future and it seemed the vampires had a future too wamphyri goodly said clinging fast to nathan as the necroscope launched himself into the future those red threads are vampires yes nathan answered the greens are trogs and the golden ones must be thyre of course for our futures are mingling even now they sped down the timestream blue threads grew dim and blinked out as men died or were changed and yet there was hope too as other threads burst from nothing into brilliant blue life as people were born red threads approached veered off came again none of it made any sense except it told of struggles to come scarlet threads clustered close a horde of them they fell back blinking out of existence by the handful but then nathan jerked to a halt and goodly almost fell out of his grasp almost fell into the future there somewhere in not too distant timetocome they pinwheeled like twin spiders on neonblue threads or fallen mountaineers on their ropes except it could be seen that all of the strength was in goodlys rope in the precogs lifethread for where it blazed on into an undetermined but everexpanding future nathans had come to an end behind them their threads both of them went winding back to the present before them only goodlys thread went on seeming to beckon him but now to him its twining looked sinister where it merged into the distant haze the feeling of hanging from ropes was so real that goodly cried out dont let go his words gonged awesomely mentally in the metaphysical void but nathan said its not a question of jetting go i i cant let go for the thread is me and this is where it ends for a moment goodly was silent while they spun there turning endlessly at nathans end then lets get out of here he said quietly back at the temporary campsite nathan was more withdrawn than ever misha could get nothing out of him nor could any of the others but as the shadows grew longer and the sun sank ever lower until the gap between its rim and the horizon was only a little greater than its diameter again he snapped out of it meanwhile he conversed however briefly with thikkoul the thyre stargazer and was reminded yet again were only given to see what will be not how it will come about or what comes after hope springs eternal something of it anyway even if the necroscope could not save himself he had his friends to think of his loved ones the szgany as a race also his nephew wolf grinner had come to him and reported the wamphyri are stirring in the barrier mountains even before the last gold has slipped from the peaks the bloodwar will be on in earnest it was time now to move the travellers to safety it must be now for nathan could not say how much time there would be later or even if there would be a later the task took longer than hed thought but when he was done all of the szgany who would go were in the safekeeping of the thyre in the barrier mountains only the peaks were gold now and the gold was swiftly fading nathan would like to move his alien friends too if they would go but as he had suspected with one exception the espers were all of a single stubborn mind they would stay with the necroscope and see it out anna marie english was the exception at andrei romanis request shed gone with him to a thyre sanctuary there are so many children with no one hed told her you are gentle and can tend their needs his words were valid enough even though theyd conveyed something else entirely the fact that he wouldnt be the one to complain if she tended to his needs too and she had known it that for the first time in her life someone wanted her and misha had complained bitterly tearfully but not until the others had gone the necroscope had moved her last after explaining that if there was danger her presence would only place him in greater jeopardy after that nathan trask zek chung and goodly and grinner of course had been alone in the camp in the twilight before the night then for a while weary from all his works and alone with his thoughts nathan had sat apart from the others but shortly zek came to him and said you probably know it already nathan but ill remind you anyway harry keogh inspired just such loyalty in his time and your brother the dweller their friends couldnt be persuaded to leave them either and they won their battles perhaps it bodes well right but zek had missed the point for they had lost their last battle and of course she hadnt seen what the future had shown to him he said nothing but looked at the sky in which the first stars were beginning to glitter over starside and the biggest of them was the iceshard northstar star of illomen like an evil eye watching over wrathstack just seeing it there its cold blue radiance was like an invocation grinner coughed once low in his throat lay back his head and howled a moment then waited for an answering howl to come echoing through the woods and others from further afield they carried his message even to the barrier mountains that the night would soon be here and all of its dangers and back from the mountains came another message but this time carried on the telepathic aether the wamphyri lords under devetald prepare to launch against the last aerie nathan had heard it too so that grinners confirmation was scarcely necessary when he said uncle it begins an hour earlier wran and nestor had departed wrathstack on a southwesterly course behind them they towed gasbeasts ostensibly to bomb the most westerly of devetakis observer posts on the boulder plains and indeed they would bomb it but that was only part of their overall and individual schemes each of them suspected the others true motives and finally as their target became visible up ahead youre fleeing right said wran nestor shook his mental head im taking my last chance to settle an old old score on sunside of all people you wran should understand my position in your time youve settled scores of your own it is oh a question of honour i suppose i was betrayed and if im now to die i want to know that he dies first he glanced across the gulf of air but on the other hand i think that you are truly fleeing which isnt like you what cowardice from wran the rage i might expect such from gorvi but you the others shrug as youre surely aware im no coward nestor lichloathe but neither am i a fool nor despite rumour am i entirely insane but my brother is along with his power his madness waxes whatever is to befall the last aerie sooner or later spiro will turn on me aye and that murderous eye of his can blind maim kill so what will you do i wont be the first lord of the wamphyri to strike out on his own the land west of here is unknown unexplored by vampires at least ill lie low till things cool down then see how the land lies maybe spiro will get himself killed i hope so for it will save me the trouble talking of trouble nestor answered theres just such up ahead ive seen it said wran are you ready for answer nestor swung a bolas of flints and iron the trouble was a small warrior propulsors blasting even now spurting aloft from a craterlike depression in the boulder plains only two miles short of the starside foothills down there the handful of members of a thrall observer group gesticulated stabbed pointing fingers at the oncoming flyers and gasbeasts then took cover or scrambled for flyers the warrior was up without pause it blasted for wran in the lead towing a gasbeast it was hard for wran to manoeuvre still he managed to turn his straining mount on its side as the warrior sped by its spines tearing holes in the membrane webbing of a manta wing but neither was wran idle even tilting dangerously in his saddle he swung a bolas of hooks that got caught up in the warriors bladders ripping two of them wide open on its left flank bravo nestor grunted hurling his own bolas seeing it fly true and turning his face away the stricken warrior throbbed where it redistributed gases to maintain its balance but as escaping gas mingled with air to form methane so nestors bolas hit home and struck sparks there came the great whuuump of ignition as the warrior burst into flame from stem to stern roaring its pain its fury the thing angled anal propulsors keeled over came headlong in an inverted suicidedive to batter its tormentors from the sky before it could reach them more bladders exploded it tilted towards the ground its roaring became a whine of frustrated lunacy as with all propulsors blasting it smashed down in flames from three hundred feet and burst apart in steaming chunks and a crimson spray after that it was easy two mounted flyers were off and running and another panicked had launched without a rider both escaping riders were thralls not even lieutenants they wouldnt have stood a chance against true lords and knew it good luck to them nestor commented cutting loose his gasbeast which joined wrans in settling towards the earth down below a lone flyer hauled halfheartedly on its tether in a nearby clump of boulders in the centre of the depression skins had been stretched over a framework of ancient bones to form the posts accommodation presumably there were at least two more thralls cowering inside but their lucks out wran grunted paying out a line weighted with a net of hooks and flints and raking the gasbeasts until they screamed and split open from internal pressure twin blasts followed and the lords were glad of their elevation as smokerings hurtled up on superheated thermals down below the scoops of a freshly gouged doublecrater issued smoke a handful of smouldering scraps drifted on the turbulent air a shattered blazing flyer crumpled down into its funeral pyre there were no signs of survivors nestor and wran split up west for me said wran but i wont forget you who could have foreseen all this that time i brought you out of sunside it was my intention to kill you nestor answered coldly for the way you initiated me oh i know that wran tossed his head well who can say theres always tomorrow and tomorrow but not for me said nestor then ill not wish you luck of course not why lie now wran laughed and sped away you did well nestor for a barearsed whelp out of sunside nestor made no answer but set his course for the heights over settlement wrans mount had suffered damage in the brush with the aerial warrior they werent serious injuries but bad enough that he would like to examine them perhaps apply spittle to the torn areas of membrane wing and rest the flyer for an hour or two before continuing his flight west preoccupied knowing that the bloodwar was behind him and all the forces of the opposed wamphyri factions concentrated at wrathstack he saw nothing of danger in landing in the barrier mountains ten miles west of settlement but it was a mistake it was also a fortuitous event if not for wran for in a cavern in the crags close by someone had made his temporary home an awesome someone a someone who hated wran with an allconsuming passion in fact there were two of them male and female but his was the driving force and the undying force that drove him was revenge it was a coincidence then a trick of fate wrans landing here yet something which had been bound to happen sooner or later one way or the other for if he had not strayed into the territory of his enemy be sure that his enemy would have come for him and in a while as wran sat with his back to an outcropping rock and let his thoughts drift perhaps dwelling on future problems a far more immediate problem crept up on him vasagi scarcely dared believe his luck if a state of grace exists for vampires then that was what he felt it was every dream hed dreamed for two and a half long years every morbid desire hed conceived since his fateful duel with wran on sunside and now it was his to savour to the full and with all the powers of his mentalism restored blocking the lustful outflow of his thoughts to less than the flutter of a moth he moved in the shadows and was a shadow until he stood close to wran but still unseen unsuspected in the dark then unshielding his mind ah see he said youve learned nothing a skilful creature may still creep up on you unseen even to within striking distance except this time theres no foolish szgany youth to give warning through his clumsiness perhaps wran had been asleep or drifting with his private thoughts dozing whichever it took only a moment for the oily oozing message to sink in when it did he snatched for his belt his gauntlet which wasnt there it was hanging from the saddle of his snoring flyer he went to spring to his feet but a great taloned hand came down on his shoulder holding him effortlessly in place and eyes but such eyes gazed down on him red and rapacious from under a cowl black and blacker than night again he would stand up but a second shadow had appeared out of nowhere and stood at his right his salivating elongating bottom jaw fell open he croaked what who but he already knew who knew too that it was impossible yet real knew that this one was dead the true death yet stood here cowled and smiling with his mind at least for his face was invisible and his smile was so monstrous it put even the worst of nightmares to flight and vasagi wran answered his own question in the moment before the female brought a large stone crashing down with all her might onto the crown of his head devetaki launched her forces in two great waves with only ten minutes between them but as for the contingents shed sent out along the spine of the mountains they remained at their posts for theirs was a different role to be determined later at the direction of the locator alexei yefros bone horns blared drummers beat on the sounding membrane of wattles along the sides of their flyers outstretched necks causing their mounts to stutter and honk pacemakers for their own pulsing manta wings pennants streamed out from the spined backs of aerial warriors bringing up the rear and the throb of their propulsors was like thunder in the settling dusk way out in front three miles or more in advance of the leading wave a lone flyer and thrall rider sped to the fore the rider carried a slender lance at its tip a pennant displayed clasped hands the sign of truce or conference the last aerie was no longer disguised as an uninhabited shell wrathstack displayed the sigils of its tenants and its levels were alive with lights its chimneys roaring with fire smoke and stench aerial warriors waited to launch from all of the major bays flyers and riders were likewise positioned in lesser launchingbays and heavily defended ledges the glint of battlegauntlets and sheen of polished leather armour was visible in every nook and cranny of the gaunt rearing face of the stack devetakis parleythrall came on his mount arched manta wings rose up on winds off the icelands a mote against wrathstack and the writhing of northern auroras it flew on a level with the sunbleached turrets of wrathspire gradually descending in a zigzag to and fro across the face of the last aerie wratha herself came out on a jutting balcony and called you why are you so eager to die you have me wrong lady devetaki has sent me to talk my pennant flies the truce we for what its worth and however brief a time but i may not sit here a day an army waits on your word if devetaki would tak wratha answered then let her present herself let her come of her own free will to my roof she knows me and that my word is good but the thrall shook his head it is not the custom for a conqueror to talk to the conquered devetaki waits to see what wij be her get for letting you and yours jive bah said wratha but without malice your virgin grandam would have me surrender then cut off my head and melt my body she seeks to spare herself the bothersome ritual turmoil of the fray and all of the losses which must surely result indeed she seeks to spare herself not me for my forces and position are superior wherefore if devetaki skulfguise has the heart for it let her come on for i am secure in wrathspire the thralls careful shrug and his not so careful answer but you are only one of several rebels lady and i must speak with the rest sideslipping his flyer descended until it was level with suckscar wratha had seen nestor fly out with wran and knew he would not be back but she wondered if lord lichloathe had left his manse as best possible defended he had for now devetakis messenger called loudly across the gulf of air to nestors righthand man zahar where he stood framed in a broad window you there lieutenant i would speak with your lord and master on behalf of the commander of an army from the east her name is devetaki skullguise which im sure youll recognize a lady zahar called back but you must bring her on at once my lord lichloathe a mighty necromancer loves only one thing better than a corpse and thats a good fuck moreover lady commanders have always been one of his preferences alas then hes out of luck the thrall answered back more at ease than when conversing with a true lord devetaki isnt called the virgin grandam for nothing depending on lord lichloathes other preferences however she might well consider finding him a wellgreased lance to sit upon upright of course begone zahar told him haughtily i watch the skies for enemies not stinkgnats surrender your manse and live offered the thrall on your way wretch growled zahar less than a mile and a half away now dark stormclouds were gathering in the south except wratha knew they were not clouds but simply a crowded sky and from where she stood on a flexing cartilage gantry to one side of her main landingbay the curving double fronts looked like a scythe blurred from the speed of its approach meanwhile the parleythrall had sideslipped down to madmanse and now called on spiro in the yawning funnel of a bay my lord the lady devetaki calls on you to surrender give up your manse and retain your miserable life successful so far he was now full of himself or as full as he ever would be does your lady have contact spiro sent directly into the thralls vampire mind is she touching you even now indeed lord the other answered why she directs me then tell her this spiro snarled that spiro killgjance is heir to his fathers eye and if she doubts me heres the proof he crouched down in the mouth of the bay glared hatred and pus and murder and shit and sheer disruptive corruption from his terrible eyes and the thrall and his flyer scarcely knew what hit them the flyer crumpled disintegrated flew apart in tatters and the parleythrall burst open as if sliced by a sharp knife from crotch to mouth so that his guts bloomed on the air even as his riven corpse commenced to fall and up in wrathspire wratha sighed and thought well thats that now for the nights real business ii the whelming of the stack vasagis story desertion and just deserts devetaki stood off and directed the righting her flyer was a huge construct fashioned of several men stretched and warped metamorphosed and reshaped redesigned in the soup of a masquemanse vat in turgosheim it was the same beast which had borne her safely over the great red waste seated in a natural saddle formed of cartilage flanges where an elongated manyknuckled neck met shoulders that curved into mighty manta wings insectlike the body was formed of a trio of stretched torsos joined end to end with three massive hearts to circulate the thin blood specially designed to glide the wings had an enormous span with the oncenormal skeleton of arms legs and grotesquely extended fingers and toes showing through the sheathing greygleaming membrane the creature was all heart muscle alveolate bone and flexible cartilage but mainly wing behind devetaki alexei yefros clung like a leech to the long horny saddle which he gripped with knees and heels while aiming his vampireenhanced locator probe at wrathstack to seek out its principal centres of activity and its largest fiercest bodies of fighting men and monsters thus by a process of elimination the russians scrying was an invaluable part of devetakis intelligence while she used her mentalism to direct the battle and read the thoughts of the aeries defenders yefros channelled his skills to discover the stacks weak spots and there were weak spots certainly devetaki had been quick to detect a lack of morale in the defenders of suckscar nor had she found any truly powerful mind there the penultimate level obviously lacked a lord just as she had suspected when her parleythrall had spoken with a mere lieutenant and so this alleged necromancer lord lichloathe was either a figment of wild imagination or he was himself a lich dead and departed similarly the men of the basement levels seemed singularly lacking in guts and the sump was extremely illdefended the various gantlets cut through scree and rubble were not so much traps for invaders as for defenders devetaki had tangiru the grunt land his mightiest warriors on the piled ramps at the sides of the gantlets where their sheer mass was sufficient to collapse the walls inwards smothering who or whatever waited in ambush and effectively blocking any possible future escape route she couldnt know it but gorvi the guile had already made his escape along a subterranean watercourse which hed discovered during his very first night of occupation three and a half years ago no doubt the tunnel had been excavated in the olden times as a bolthole for some previous tenant this wasnt the first bloodwar on starside not by a long shot gorvi had resurfaced something more than a mile and a half northeast of wrathstack amid the rubble and in the shadows of a toppled aerie where he kept a wellfuelled flyer tethered and waiting now keeping low the guile was already speeding east out of trouble intending to return to the gorge of turgosheim to see how things stood there as for the rest of the rebels wrans thoughts were noticeable by their absence as was the rage himself but his loathsome brother more than covered for wrans desertion spiro killglances evil eye was devastating and madmanse was left pretty much alone while the rest of the manses attracted a maximum of attention as previously reported by the parleythrall wratha was in residence in the topmost levels she wasnt remiss in sending out a continuous stream of vitriolic taunts mainly directed at devetaki also in the third manse down that matchless hound that inimitable lunatic canker canison at first hed been plainly visible in his main landingbay fighting off invading forces alongside the best of his pups but at the rising of a tumbling moon hed made an exit from the fray immediately thereafter and no doubt inspired by the frenzy of a sudden thunderous uproar of crazed sounds from the rear of the stack cankers defenders had redoubled their efforts their ferocity was such that devetaki felt obliged to forecast heavy losses in that arena so then lieutenants galore thralls warriors and an apparently endless stream of flyers and riders issuing out of the many bays like hornets from a nest but a dearth of true vampire masters the wamphyri themselves well they were fled and that was all there was to it all to the good it made the virgin grandams task that much easier obviously the deserted lesser denizens of the various manses were already much demoralized with no one to whip them on it wouldnt be long before they began reckoning the value of their undead skins meanwhile the bloodwar was in full swing the defences of certain levels and manses would soon be swept away crumbling to nothing while others were as yet best avoided take guilesump and work up into madmanse take suckscar and work down into mangemanse and finally take wrathspire itself up from suckscar and down from the plateau roof until last but certainly not least the very prize herself wratha so devetaki rode the thermals high above the fighting and considered her options and pointed out the way for her troops but as for her own everexpanding contingent theyd been kept back they now circled and protected her in the sky where she performed lazy drifting spirals round the great fang of wrathstack with all the action clearly visible below the minutiae of the battle however were neither visible nor known for there was just too much going on for instance down on the sprawling boulder plains where they extended from the foot of the stack gorvis groundbased warriors had long since given up trying to distinguish friend from foe now if it fell out of the sky it was an enemy their thrall minders were either fled into guilesump or dead from all the snapping and snarling the plain was littered with all the gory debris of the undead now truly dead it was as if a mad painter had taken up a giant brush and daubed the grey and barren boulder plains scarlet and across this landscape of death the warriors rumbled glutted yet still killing and feasting bloated but never satisfied and ever lusting and no one to say them nay and the dumb beasts themselves too frenzied to know when to stop still the sky rained mauled and mangled horror bleating flyers with broken wings crashed down their thrall and lieutenant riders were tossed or leaped from their saddles only to be maimed and devoured by lunging bloodcrazed beasts aerial warriors with blazing gasbladders went sputtering and shrieking across the sky like semisentient shooting stars now and then they would careen to earth in mewling red and black tangles adding to the turmoil but the gantlets had been breached tangiru the grunt and lord eran painscar led a surface attack on guilesump and despite a molten machicolation from the corbels fought through to the interior up into the stack they struck and down into the bowels of the place to the sump itself and the aeries wells devetaki skullguise had warned them to leave the wells alone but the lords were on the sack now and what they couldnt take theyd destroy they sliced through a hanging garden of siphons poisoned the wells with piss kneblasch and silver dust and generally made a shambles of the place but expensively eran painscar was gutted by a warrior and all tangirus bones were broken in a boobytrap it was a pitfall and the things in the pit made small work of him their passing was scarcely mourned their lieutenants fought more viciously yet in the knowledge that two at least would ascend to lords but first must face a bloody ascent through the basement levels of guilesump higher suckscar was taken zahar grig and two lesser lieutenants gave way under the simultaneous assault of half a dozen great warriors that perched in bays and windows to fire their propulsors into the manse burned or poisoned nestors demoralized thralls succumbed in droves to hesta the herm lom halfstruck and grigor the lech where they secured the landingbays landed a squadron of flyers and fighting men and commenced slaughtering the sick and mazed defenders out of hand alas for grigor on his way to inspect his get in women he met up with a child of vasagis vats and stepped on a carpet which was not instantly enveloped by the thing and drenched in digestive acids he was badly eaten into by the time he managed to hack himself free only to be snapped up by the monsters twin finally this latter creature was dispatched by others of suckscars invaders when they opened it up grigor was discovered a jumble of clattering bones so much for the lech later when devetaki heard the news of his demise she would don her smiling mask however briefly the roof of the last great aerie of the wamphyri was now a bloody battlefield even wrathspires sloping plateau issuing smoke and jets of flame from burning creatures awash in blood guts and urine as wrathas men and beasts and ursula torspawns invading forces saw it out hand to hand the stack had its limitations and was less than impregnable after all exits from wrathspire onto the roof were few wratha had difficulty resupplying her fighters there and when finally it came to retreating many of them died in the crush on the few steep stairwells the roof was taken and in part secured but ursulas troops had been reduced to a handful which devetaki thoughtfully replaced with her own people only then landing on the roof herself in a corner free of fighting she dined on the hearts of three freshlyslaughtered captive defenders fed and rested her great flyer transferred to a second mount and was soon airborne again but during her short visit to the roof devetaki had not failed to notice the silver cage and its hoisting gear which shed found most appropriate while down below in the sixth hour of the night guilesump was finally taken at which a lesser struggle at once broke out between rival lieutenants over who should now ascend in place of lords eran and tangiru but in the next manse up spiro killglance had already had enough he was mad aye but not that mad his power was waning with each withering blast from his killing eye he knew by now that wran would not be back his brother was dead or fled and spiro suspected the latter but spiro was only one lord and madmanse was vast he couldnt be everywhere at once the more he used his eye the less destructive the result he wasted his inheritance here and would be wise to seek a new and glorious future in fields afar for by now wran was well on his way back to turgosheim to reestablish himself in advance of any return by other survivors well and spiro would soon be hot on his tail to punish him aye for cowardice in the face of an enemy and foul desertion of duty so thinking and while the battle raged on spiro rested his eyes for an hour then saddled his best flyer and a spare and flew out on the night wind by now suckscar had been secured lom and hesta had commandeered new flyers and reentered the fray raging around wrathstacks exterior seeing and recognizing spiro they zeroed in on him devetaki saw them go and knew their danger and gave no warning both of them were freaks and had always irritated her half a dozen other lesser lords joined them where they ringed spiro in each whirling a bolas of glittering hooks spiro gathered his nightmare energies to him and located them behind his vengeful eyes he ducked low in his saddle as whirling death whistled overhead and at once leaned forward as it sliced the air close behind but sooner or later theyd get him hed be pierced through and through dragged from his saddle and dropped enough he hunched astride his mount like a monstrous toad settled his gaze on lorn the dwarf and fixed him with his eyes as in the sights of a weapon lorn sat rigid as a rod and couldnt look away spiros eyes were magnetic and drew his gaze they issued a seething mental bile that sped down spiros line of sight like a hawk stooping to its prey and lorn burst like a bomb scarlet froth flew every which way as his guts escaped at once from every exit and in all directions it was as if hed been a bubble of blood in a vacuum whose skin had dissolved in a single moment letting the void suck him apart hah cried spiro and rapidly reduced two lesser lords and their mounts to shreds then hesta the herm wheeled into view and it was his or her turn ho great halfandhajling spiro called out with his mentalism and do you have any last words you you bully hesta pouted but was unable to look away do your worst and spiro did he flicked his head forward as if to lend his mindbolt greater velocity speeding it on its way for a long moment hestas eyes stood out from hisher skull and heshe screamed sp just sp before dying but the way of it hestas manicured hands and female feet shot from their limbs while hisher head blew off at the neck and the grotesque corpse sat still awhile then toppled from its saddle and cartwheeled down the night spraying red from all five stumps spiro stood tall shook a great fist glared threateningly all about but the others had had enough he laughed long and loud then headed east and no one else got in his way or even considered doing so not for many a mile anyway and behind him its thunder dwindling the bloodwar for madmanse mangemanse and wrathspire raged furious as in a collapsed cave twothirds of the way through the pass to sunside geoffrey paxton worked like a madman at a great wall of boulders where they blocked his way to freedom hands bleeding nails broken and clothing torn he wondered why he wasnt exhausted also wondered why he wasnt blind in the pitchdarkness in fact he knew why for there was a weird hunger on him and an even weirder thirst which wasnt for ordinary sustenance but the human part of his mind continued to query such seeming anomalies well he supposed he would get used to most of them soon enough if not to the hunger of course if he were to get too hungry there was always the headless body of zindevar where she lay crumpled in the rear of the cave or the crushed corpse of bruno krasin but paxton wasnt that hungry not yet and then there were other hungers for life for power and definitely for revenge as for life he clung to it with the tenacity of the vampire revenge well as far as he knew the son of harry keogh was still alive and so revenge was by no means impossible power that would come when he had his telepathy back he was a step closer in that direction at least and this had always been his plan after all one step at a time again he attacked the wall of boulders hurling rubble to the rear of the cave as he burrowed his way towards the night and freedom and destiny for somewhere out there in sunsidestarside he knew that he could satisfy all of his hungers in one and the same throw and that after that then that there probably wouldnt be any satisfying him ever again to give him credit vasagi had been very patient in one way hed been patient at least but in another he had acted hastily because he had many things to do and wran the rage was only one of them but vasagi and carmen had dined royally and their meal had been of the essence or flavoured with it of everything dearest to a vampires stomach namely the blood of another vampire in fact wrans blood and especially that of his leech and since cutting his parasite out of him would probably have sufficed to render him once more unconscious vasagi had not delayed the meal but performed the required butchery while wran still lay in a heap with his head all dented from carmens blow which was also the reason why it had taken him so long to wake up the damaged head the loss of so much blood and of course the removal and wringingout of his leech much like squeezing oranges except oranges dont writhe and slither and try to escape but despite that his leech was gone its essence remained in his blood as it had always been and being wamphyri he was not yet dead indeed and if there were someone to care for him he might even survive though much reduced in spirit and no longer a lord as such so that as wran groaned and awakened and opened eyes as scarlet as ever if lacking in intensity vasagi could sympathize with him in part though only in a very small part for vasagi knew how wran felt indeed upon a time hed felt much the same and worse and in similar circumstances can you speak vasagi spoke with his mind as always with elegant weavings of his fingers and hands for empha sis in the long ago this mode of speech had become necessary after vasagi had extruded the diseased teeth and bones of his lower jaw replacing them with a sleevelike proboscis or siphon tipped with a fine retractable hollow probe an excellent weapon or tool for feeding but useless for common speech that proboscis was no more severed by wran during their sunside duel it had been reduced to a redrimmed hole in the exsucks face and looking up at his dark silhouette against the wheel of the stars the glowing fire of his eyes which was all that wran could make out he wondered what sort of face was there now in the seething darkness under his cowl and because vasagi had asked it wran also wondered if he could speak but his mouth was dry as old bones his tongue was glued to the roof of his mouth he was barely strong enough to give his head a trembling shake and even that was an agony he would not have believed which threatened for a moment to sink him once more into oblivion his back his ravaged spine out of which vasagi had torn his leech to devour its juices good said vasagi i dont require you to speak only to jisten for ive a story to tell a tale of trial and now of tribulation and who better to tell it to than a principal character who featured at the tales beginning and as we now see has stayed to its end indeed to his end and sitting down almost within reach of wran who had not the strength to reach and gazing out over starside reflectively in the manner of the storyteller while close by carmen fed gorseflowers honey and possibly the crushed empty sack of wrans leech to a pair of tethered flyers vasagi began there was a duel on sunside to the death of course and only one could survive and return home in triumph to the last great aerie of the wamphyri the combatants were wran the rage killglance a wretched creature of little or no refinement and the noble vasagi called the suck the outcome should have been certain would have been but for a trick of fate the intervention of a callow szgany youth who seriously disturbed the balance of events so much so that the noble vasagi was defeated and not only defeated but disfigured defaced that were a shameful thing to be deprived of ones very face and by refuse such as wran well one would think that the maiming of vasagi and his grotesque disfigurement would be enough oh he must also die of course but surely in a manner worthy of his status his place in the scheme of things put him down by all means but let him keep what little was left of his dignity the wamphyri are after all regal creatures some of us anyway but wran was not is not one of them nor will he be until relieved of the monstrous burden of his flesh soon ah soon however so vasagi was raped of his leech and the leech milked of its egg and with a grand sense of the comical wran the rage bequeathed this noble seed to that same callow youth who however inadvertently had saved his miserable life enough now vasagi can be allowed to die in whatever is left to him of peace wran will take his head in one clean stroke and that will be that oh really but no wran pegged him down on a hillside to await the rising sun to melt there in its poison ray and fled back to starside before the dawn except what fate gives fate ofttimes takes away and that same szgany youth tore out vasagis pegs from the earth and set him free so now you know how it came to pass that vasagi survived and i can be sharp about the rest of my tale vasagi crawled into a deep cave and stayed there all the hours of day with night he killed a small creature and ah the agony of eating and through that loathsome hole in his face after so many years of drinking but at least he was strengthened and all through the night he climbed the mountains only sleeping when exhaustion overcame him and eating what and when he could but the starside night is a long one and vasagi was determined and one thought and only one kept him going as it has done ever since that wran the rage still lived before the dawn he came through a high pass discovered a deep crevice in the rocks crawled inside to sleep except his sleep was disturbed even as the sun crept higher a flyer landed and a thrall pegged out a woman much as vasagi had been pegged out but when the lieutenant departed then vasagi cut her free and found her to be one of his own carmen out of suckscar it was as if wran and the others would eradicate every trace of him and his he rescued the woman to be his companion saw that she would be a lady and in the next sundown commenced the long trek west for the noble vasagi knew what he was about and that all was not yet lost far from it the trek took long and long the way was hard only the flesh of trogs sustained them vasagi was without his metamorphism which had been fabled retaining only his tenacity but his tenacity was enough finally they came to the vampire swamps far to the west of the barrier mountains and vasagi cultivated black and especially ugly mushrooms until they were ripe and released their spores which he breathed he already had vampire flesh of course which would resist the spores if it could and it did for long and long but finally a spore took it must be strong indeed vasagi felt its strength and rejoiced he fed it the blood of beasts and of his consort carmen until finally he felt his metamorphism flow back into him ah but it was a long time in the coming and hardships all the way aye and more to come during the long trek home then in the western foothills of starside a rare thing vasagi came across a starving flyer a vampire creature loose in the wild and left to its own devices and intelligent aye vasagi fed the beast returned it to full health why he even learned its name oh yes for it had a name which it remembered from when it was a man karz biteri fled from runemanse in turgosheim and from his master maglore the mage so much the noble vasagi learned and no more but from now on he had a beast to share his and carmens burden albeit a very weird beast which refused the blood of men and trogs and only ate the flesh of animals gorseflowers and wild honey well their relationship was a strange thing scarcely that of beast and master at all for this creature had a mind of his own but companionship and need drew him to vasagi and the exsucks need drew him to the flyer but their understanding was simple they were their own men and whatever came of their partnership when it was done it was done so by stages vasagi and the lady carmen and karz the flyer came back to this central region of sunsidestarside and when they were here they found a place to live just a cave but it was enough and vasagi waited and watched to see what would be for olden enemies were on their way from turgosheim in the east and the outcome would be interesting but meanwhile vasagi reached out with his restored mentalism to the last great aerie of the wamphyri to suckscar and certain of its creatures among them a flyer but just a flyer and not like karz at all upon a time however this had been an exceptional beast in its own right and faithful the very mount that vasagi had flown to sunside the night of his duel with wran and it was still faithful when vasagi called it broke out of its pen and hurried to be with him so that now both vasagi and his lady had mounts to ride into sunside and prey upon the szgany as of old which brings us to the present meanwhile vasagis lady had done with feeding the flyers and came to where her lord sat with the broken ravaged wran she carried lengths of thin cutting nearunbreakable szgany twine spun from kursgrass one of which had a noose that she placed over wrans head winding the rest of its length about the outcrop until it was firmly anchored sick from pain and made impotent by weakness wran could only watch as she wrapped his feet with another length which she made fast to the saddle of vasagis flyer and in a little while vasagi continued upon a time the lords and the lady too of wrathstack had poked fun at vasagi naming him a freak because his face and voice his elegant and dexterous mode of communication were so radically different from theirs but none of them had laughed louder than wran and as stated wran was responsible for reducing vasagi to a genuine freak with only a hole for a face well since vasagi had been named for a freak and also since hed never much cared for physical looks one way or the other deeming it a vanity in creatures who have the power to change their looks so easily he now determined to become a freak and none had been more gifted in the metamorphic arts than vasagi he stood up stood tall and gazed down on wran my tale is told and its a true one of which am the living proof the wamphyri have long made creatures in their own image but vasagi have gone one better and made myself in the image of one of my creatures behold and know that i am vasagi of the wamphyri now lord vasagi the gape he opened his cloak then opened his body wrans agony was all but forgotten in those astonishing moments of revelation not the revealing of vasagis identity for of course that was already known but the limitlessness of wamphyri metamorphism now taken to the limits and when wran saw vasagi he knew that he was not merely the very master of metamorphism but also that he had passed beyond the limits of sanity itself and because wran knew there can be no reasoning with madness he didnt even try but merely lay there staring with eyes that scarcely believed and his jaws distended in a rictus of awe vasagi had said that he had made himself in the image of one of his own creatures now wran knew what he meant upon a time hed gone down into suckscar with spiro the doglord canker canison and nestor lichloathe and had seen one of vasagis guardians of the stairwells and vasagi was similar under the hood of his cloak thrown back now vasagi had eyes but nothing else of a face for beneath the shinyblack utterly flat nostrilslitted flange of a nose a fatmuscled neck flowed like a column directly into the chest but central between the nipples and from there down to the crotch which was merely a junction for the legs and no longer housed genitalia great rubbery vertical lips opened like a door displaying vasagis pulsing innards at the back sheathed in muscle his ribs must be hinged to the spine but at the front they formed meshing teeth that drooled and snapped at wran and ahhh said the monster i could eat your face eat all of you but i wont what when theres the sweet fresh dung of a beast going stale under my flyers tail or i might peg you out to await the dawn except it is too far off also i was pegged out upon a time carmen too so that we know its not necessarily fatal but that rope around your neck is without another word vasagi closed his cloak put up the hood turned and took carmen on his arm and walked her to the waiting flyers wran thought to struggle against his bonds and was at once stilled by a thousand small knives in his back the severed nerveendings where vasagi had cut out his leech the pair mounted up and launched something bounded and spurted red against the rocks then lay still and in a while vasagi used a knife to cut the line and sent wrans headless body spinning and done he said his voice a sigh in carmens mind you but not me she answered no for a certain callow szgany youth made me a lady and then would deny and destroy me well and youve had your revenge my lord aye he nodded in her mind and ah it was sweet but i take your point so lets seek out this nestor shall we and climbing on the night wind they made for sunside meanwhile gorvi the guile rejoiced that he was off and running nothing behind him but a great many empty miles and nothing ahead but a last crumbling knuckle in the kinked spine of the barrier mountains the great red waste and eventually a mainly vacated gulf of turgosheim back in the last aerie wratha and the others would probably believe he was dead and devoured and his bones littering the boulder plains if so good but he was fairly sure that none had seen him make his escape and he was certain no one else knew of his bolthole escape route and anyway it seemed unlikely theyd send a posse all the way back to turgosheim just for one man therefore as the last crags fell away and the mountains flattened to earth when all that should lie ahead was emptiness the seething red wastelands and their reek it came as no small surprise when gorvi saw in the sky another flyer and heard the gleeful mental chuckle of its rider ho gorvi well and wouldnt we know it gorvi the guile fugitive all on his ownsome and on the run his head full of thoughts of dear old turgosheim what homesick are you our bloodwar was a bit too much for you eh all that nasty fighting and such gorvi did some very quick thinking and in another moment the bloodwars over boris he answered and im the only survivor of any importance there may be others come straggling eventually thralls and a lieutenant or two but thats all the two sides were too evenly matched you see and wiped each other out really said boris assuming the gawp of an idiot then the gawp slipped from his face yet a moment ago why id have sworn you were wondering if theyd send anyone after you to settle the score in turgosheim gorvi knew the game was up he whirled a bolas of vicious hooks and released them towards boris his target hunched down in the saddle caused his mount to swerve gave way and with a snarled obscenity the guile shot through the breach and headed directly out across the great red waste glancing back over his shoulder he was surprised to see black boris smiling a knowing smile until he sensed a mental command shoot skywards hes all yours bring him down gorvi didnt look but leaned far forward along his mounts straining neck and commanded it fly fly as never before but a mile or two out over the great red waste when at last he heard the rumble of propulsors growing louder then he had to look there were two of them two small highly manoeuvrable aerial warriors one fell like a stone directly towards him the other in a steep spiral holding back a little to see which way hed jump it would make little or no difference anyway however he jumped theyd be too fast for him indeed and by the time hed thought it they were already on him the torpedo went straight through his mounts left wing leaving it singed and fraying the other flattened its spiral got beneath gorvi raised erectile spines along its back and sliced his flyer open the full length of its belly that was more than enough and down they went and gorvis staggering stumbling mind wondering how this could possibly be happening to him he was still wondering when they splashed down in a smoking searing acid pool but even if hed had the time to form an airfoil and leap free thered be nowhere to fly he stood on his flyers back as it boiled bubbled and sank and tried to figure it out but with all the guile in the world thered be no getting out of this he knew it and at the end as his mount slipped under he reached down to grasp the saddle and went down with it in a little while his parasite rebelled causing gorvi to relax his grip or perhaps it wasnt so much his leechs tenacity as the powerful corrosive action of the acid the fact that his fingers were dissolving to slime knuckle by knuckle and detaching themselves from his hands whichever very little of him made it back to the surface and what little there was didnt last too long resupplied from suckscar devetakis forces attempted an invasion downwards into mangemanse only to find the way blocked and like the rest of the manse impregnable in the shortterm all of cankers defenders in whichever quarter fought as mad dogs for the time being the doglord was safe not so wratha routes from suckscar up into the ultimate manse were plentiful as were landingbays and windows for access and stairwells and passages within under attack from both suckscar and the roof wrathspire was eminently accessible to the invaders wrathas forces were confined compressed within while she herself was slowly but surely floated up towards the roof on the froth of battle down below madmanse fell the desertion of both of the lords killglance had utterly demoralized their thralls they had continued to fight however halfheartedly because there was no alternative probably doomed to end their days as warrior meal it would be as well to die gutted in handtohand combat as in some creatures guts or soup in a vat of metamorphism thus only mangemanse and wrathspire remained with both canker canison and wratha the risen in residence and the rest of the last aerie was now devetakis her forces had suffered losses of course but she was glad of them keeping her generals in the front of the fighting she had seen the bulk of them go down never again to rise the handful of surviving lords were of little consequence theyd be like pet dogs following her to heel fighting for the crumbs she dropped now in the fifteenth hour of the night she gathered her forces out of the sacked fallen manses and concentrated them on wrathspire but she left one bolthole to the roof clear and kept back her troops from a certain turret where shed been informed of a lone flyer saddled and ready for flight and as fire and the occasional screaming thrall gouted from wrathspires windows and roiling black smoke poured from every exit devetaki landed there gave alexei yefros into the care of thrall bodyguards stationed herself close to wrathas flyer but out of sight and waited and eventually wratha came she came panting scurrying through the battling crush and in her urgency to be away never once paused to wonder why she wasnt recognized or stopped she had been recognized of course but devetakis orders were plain and simple and left no room for errors wratha the risen must not be harmed she is mine and now she truly was as wratha entered the turret she saw her flyer stretched there leaking life from a throat slit to the spine all flopping and gurgly and definitely finished with things and she also saw devetaki wrathas gauntlet clogged with flesh was on her hand strapped to her arm but in another moment so were two of devetakis strongest lieutenants one to each arm and a third man behind her with a sharp ironwood stake in the small of her back devetaki stepped forward and quickly took the kneblasch dispenser which she had known would be hidden in wrathas robe and so the lady was disarmed and despite that she was thwarted and her plans in ruins for the first time in wrathas life there was no wrath left in her the glow beneath the cartilage scarp on her brow was grown dim and her flesh had lost much of its customary youthful lustre devetaki found it odd that even in defeat a women such as wratha should be so subdued and said as much then as if remembering the gorge of turgosheim the fact that they had been friends there upon a time well friends of sorts within limits wratha looked at her and quietly said so i look down in the mouth do i she shrugged and in a while continued well thats how it is one day up and the next day down and now a grim cold smile this is a down day thats all true devetaki answered but the last of them i fear and putting a leatherclad arm around wrathas shoulders as if to hold her up she walked with her towards the rim of the high plateau roof wratha was wan she slumped down into herself and seemed very fragile devetaki was not deceived and her men stayed close to hand but the worst of the fighting was over now and the victors mopped up devetaki knew she was secure and wratha at her mercy of which there was very little eventually they came to the open turret that housed wrathas silver cage then seeing where the virgin grandam had taken her wratha started and made to draw away but devetakis men took her and when their mistress nodded put her in the cage fastened its door and made to hoist her aloft at which wratha cried out devetaki we were friends you and i i even admired you and tried to pattern myself after you i still admire you you are the winner after all of everything its true devetaki put on her smiling mask but whats this do you seek to plead with me you were the rebel wratha you are the one who caused all this wratha shook her head no i wont plead my time is up and i know it but i want you to know devetaki that i wont hold anything against you devetaki nodded you are pleading then in your subtle fashion again wratha shook her head no its just that all my life i have hated one thing or another and now that its over i wish there had been more love in it thats all love devetaki raised an eyebrow true love you mean as the szgany know it among vampires is there such a thing we were szgany upon a time wratha answered sadly that time is past devetaki smiled kiss me once through these bars wratha begged then they can hang me up to wait for the sun eh despite that devetaki was wearing her smiling mask she frowned a kiss a fond farewell said wratha if nothing else it will show that we can die with a flourish flamboyant as our lives her voice was choked but with the phlegm not from emotion or a cold cold emotion at best the virgin grandam cocked her head i think i like that aye so be it and stepping to the cage avoiding the silver bars she pressed her mouth to wrathas who quick as thought straightened up caught devetaki through the bars and spurted phlegm into her convulsing throat then as devetaki choked and struggled wratha massaged her throat until the loathsome stuff was down finally biting her mouth and tonguing the wound and as devetaki jerked free wratha threw off her robe to display her nakedness and a great deal more than nakedness the signs of her curse were plain devetaki saw them and her eyes stood out she pointed gabbled something unintelligible turned aside and hurled the contents of her stomach into a corner of the turret and finally hang the hag she cried in her fury her fear as tears dripped from her eyes and bile from her mouth hang the plagueridden bitch on high to wait for the rising sun and sucking furiously on her torn lips she spat the contaminated blood away then cleanse me she commanded her shuddering vampire willing it to be so though whether it would be remained to be seen then shutting out wrathas shrieking cackling laughter where she was hoisted up and swung out under the gantry devetaki swept regally away and stumbled only a very little later when devetaki had regained her composure and called her generals to her she saw that ursula torspawn was missing her first thought was that ursula must have gone down in the fighting but one of that ladys lieutenants assured her it was not the case her flyer suffered some injury he reported that was what she told me as she limped off south south devetaki was suspicious thered been times recently when ursula had given her some funny little looks what lies south except the barrier mountains did she have a fresh mount back there why didnt she land on the roof ursulas lieutenant looked blank or perhaps surprised by devetakis outburst the roof was awash with blood and fighting he answered of which my lady had done her share but in the sky i have no doubt shell be back immediately huh devetaki breathed heavily well and perhaps she will well have to wait and see then she set about to detail her plans concerning in part an indefinite siege on mangemanse but mainly the saturation and subjugation of sunside by vampire forces for now that wrathstack had all but fallen the locator alexei yefros had come up with a scheme to bring this guerilla the socalled necroscope nathan keogh out of hiding crossing the barrier mountains a little west of the great pass ursula torspawn was glad that shed deserted a pity she hadnt thought to do it earlier thats all when there was still time to fly back across the great red waste and return to turgosheim all in the one night for in tormanse in turgosheim shed left sufficient of thralls and creatures behind that she could start up again and be a power while here she was devoid of power and at the mercy of devetaki hah small mercy there but cunning aye and ursula cursed herself that shed watched it all happening without seeing anything until devetaki herself had let it be known what she was about the elevation of the ladies a grand matriarchy hah no such thing she would be empress where was zindevar cronesap now and what of ursula torspawn now that her contingent was reduced to a handful oh yes shed be next on devetakis list be sure except when the powercrazed slut looked around for her shed be nowhere to be found ursulas plan was simple since she couldnt make it back to turgosheim tonight shed use the night to hole up to feed and rest herself and her flyer then wait out tomorrow in some dark and bitter crevice of a place further east and tomorrow night skirting black boris at the eastern extreme of the barrier mountains shed get a good start back home after that all would be in the hands of fate but right now at the back of her saddle was a bundle of clothes ursula had always affected szgany looks and ways had kept her girlish shape and gypsy mannerisms let her get out of this battlegear and into her patterned skirt forestgreen blouse and crudelyfashioned shadleather boots shake down her black hair shape her flattened vampire nose a little and quench the fire of her eyes she felt certain she could go among them like a genuine waif of the woods all unnoticed well except by the men easy to lure a couple of likely lads into the darkness refuel herself and carve a little fresh meat for the return trip that was all there was to it risky well perhaps but not as risky as staying with devetaki that one would not stop now until she had it all and what she couldnt have shed destroy ursula could only hope that when she failed to return to the fighting devetaki would assume her dead of an accident or misadventure at which the virgin grandam would most likely rejoice ill nona nestor nathan confrontation earlier unobserved the necroscope and his party had followed the ebb and flow of the bloodwar in and around wrathstack to any outsider they must seem a singularly disparate team a lightskinned blueeyed man of sunside four psychically talented people out of a weird parallel world and a starside wolf of the wild but nathan trask zek chung and goodly and grinner of course were a team and there was this mainly unspoken but sensed camaraderie between them nathan had stuck close to ben trask lan goodly and david chung had passed the time in lowtoned conversation zeks apparently inseparable companion had been grinner for in the devillishlooking wolfs own words as conveyed to nathan this one knows the grey brothers she knows how to be with a wolf it was a compliment of course their vantage point or observation post had been a room in the stump of a collapsed stack whose jumble lay a mile and a half northwest of the last aerie open on two sides and minus its ceiling or roof still the remaining walls were massive and the one that faced wrathstack had a vast window that provided an excellent view of the battle nathan would rather have been elsewhere of course but his reason for being on starside was simple to watch the fighting as best he might and determine the next phase of his campaign against whichever side was the winner after nine hours it had been obvious which side that must be wrathstack was issuing fire and smoke from most of its levels and the shattered debris of battle was beginning to strew itself across the boulder plains even as far as the ruins from which the necroscopes party kept score of the fighting several injured riderlesss flyers had already crashed down within a one hundred yards radius of their hideaway finally one such creature had fluttered to earth with a lieutenant still rocking in the saddle mazed and stumbling the man had made it a short distance away from his crumpled mount before himself collapsing facedown in the dust the fact that hed made it there at all seemed a sure signal to the huddle of humans that they should now move on via the mobius continuum nathan had then taken his party up onto a plateau in the barrier mountains midway between twin fords and settlement where zek and david chung employed their talents to scan along the range and try to find out what was going on the enemy was camped there for certain from the lava falls beyond the great pass even to a point some miles west of settlement they were scattered in a dozen or more secure locations in small but by no means negligible parties grinners fleetfooted nightprowling pack of covert observers and that of his brother blaze had already confirmed this fact also that for the moment the vampires were keeping a low profile and seemed unaccountably immobile inactive as if they waited for something but for what perhaps devetaki had kept them in reserve for use in the event that the bloodwar against wrathstack went wrong or took longer than she expected maybe they would form a blockade if wratha should attempt to resupply herself out of sunside but nathan didnt think so there was something very ominous about them still and silent in the night with their seething minds all guarded from telepathic intrusion and their senses alert for any sign of attack upon themselves that last might be a clue in itself for of course they were aware of the necroscope now and knew him for a powerful destructive force in his own right that they would come after him and clash with him sooner or later was a bygone conclusion indeed a foreseen conclusion as nathan had seen it during his brief trip with lan goodly into the future except he didnt much care to speculate what that conclusion would involve the word itself conveyed a termination but of what his life so it had appeared when he and goodly had been left spinning in time at the end of his tether the blue lifethread that literally tethered him to a physical existence finally unsettled anxious and frustrated as ever nathan had returned his party to the now deserted camp at the edge of the forest where they would sleep and take it in turn to keep watch nathan himself teamed up with trask had taken the first threehour watch while the others slept the pair had also taken the opportunity to talk we seem a long way from and a long time since earth trask had opened my earth i mean and in fact we have come oh a very long way an entire universe but on the other hand the whole thing has taken little more than a night and a day your time so paradoxically i suppose we might say that time has flown nathan had nodded and a phrase remembered from trasks world which hadnt made much sense to him then had suddenly sprung to mind doesnt time fly when youre having fun he said however drily but now the phrase was entirely appropriate especially the way hed used it in fact and as he now saw that was the entire point of the thing so maybe the sarcasm of their two worlds at least wasnt that dissimilar trasks turn to nod and to grin but he quickly sobered and followed up with you havent said a lot about your trip with lan goodly was it really that bad nathan looked at him with that disconcerting blueeyed gaze of his open as the sky and thought carefully before he answered because in the moment of trasks question hed realized that he had been thinking carefully about that trip ever since returning from it it was i dont know a dead end it seemed to be anyway but i cant be sure and of course i dont want to be sure after all ive been shown the future before and by an expert and he was wrong trask remembered the story from the necroscopes debrief at ebranch hq london england earth some five months ago thikkoul the thyre stargazer nathan glanced at the icechip stars and said the same thikkoul saw me disappearing through a great glaring door in the blink of an eye and ill never be able to forget the tone of his deadspeak voice when he said then you are gone but you werent but i was gone out of this world into yours through the starside gate but you werent gone trask insisted you lived on it was just that you were no longer here thats right said nathan and thats why i cant be sure and why im glad im not sure about what we saw in future time if thikkoul could get it wrong so can i oh he saw the future all right but not the way the future saw it so maybe lan goodly is right about the future being sentient certainly it appears to protect itself its jealous of being known it does come to pass of course it does and must but in its own way what will be has been that too nathan answered but were not allowed to know it we were fashioned to be of three and only three dimensions the fourth does its damnedest to keep it that way so people like thikkoul goodly and myself were kept guessing and its done so expertly so deviously that were even a little and sometimes a lot afraid of it as you are now as im trying not to be like your saying hope springs eternal but does it really for myself yes lets face it if i didnt believe id come through this what would be the point but for you i dont know ill be glad when youve all had enough and i can take you out of here but you must know we have to see it through it isnt just your world nathan but ours too when if we get back to our own place well have to report on things here and if our report isnt just exactly so then the bloodwar youve seen so far wont even nearly match the one thats to come nathan stared at him you think so but how so surely gustav turchin will close the perchorsk gate and you espers will continue to guard the one at radujevac wont that suffice then trask told him about the chernobyl sarcophagus how a nuclear curse had been visited on earth by mans stupidity so they built a wall round it and a roof over it he went on thick enough to keep all of that weird heat in it was quite a while ago but just containing it wasnt enough they still had to know what was going on inside that nothing else was going to escape so every now and then they open the wall and go back in they have to be sure you see and it will be precisely the same with sunsidestarside except while a meltdown cant think for itself the wamphyri can and do and while the nuclear monster in that sarcophagus cant deliberately try to break out he paused but he had made his point in that event this whole world will suffer it would be ruined trask corrected him as you know rightly or wrongly we used nuclear weapons to bring one of our own wars to an end from time to time theres been the threat of such usage ever since but men have to live on the planet and finally theyre seeing sense good news for my world yes but this one the men of my world dont have to live here to them this is an alien place and if some of them knew what we already know i dont think theyd even wait to see how it works out and honestly i cant say i blame them thats another reason why were staying to see it through with you and to know how to report at the end of it if you get back were putting our faith in you nathan waved his hands helplessly but i cant work miracles now despite himself and the mood of their conversation trask did grin and broadly oh really he said i think some of us might disagree with you then he stopped smiling and sighed but if you really cant work a miracle then well simply have to trust to luck or to the future in the necroscopes mind the subject had become depressing and so he changed it what do you make of this he asked and taking a sliver of charcoal from their small fire he drew ethlois engine as he had come to think of it on the pale inner wall of a piece of bark what am i supposed to think of it trask asked what is it anyway thats what i hoped youd tell me nathan gloomily answered and he attempted to explain the inexplicable the hidden meaning in the thing which all the thyre ancients had been trying to get over to him without understanding it themselves i had hoped that if anyone would recognize it you would that id know the truth of it why not because you dont know it trask answered and because they dont know it show me an algebraic equation with two solutions one right and one wrong and ill choose the right one tell me what this is and ill know at once if youre lying to me but when you dont know yourself why im not even sure if this diagram is a question or the answer to one nathan was disappointed but understood trasks explanation of his inability and it dawned on him of course trask didnt know this thing was of the future and the future was devious and deliberately obscure again they changed the subject and for long hours talked of other things their watch passed quickly on starside the bloodwar had been raging for a little over thirteen hours before sleeping nathan made a quick mobiusjump to see how things stood it was much the same as before except the fighting now seemed to be concentrated around the aeries summit and the stacks central levels it would be another two to three hours before devetaki caught wratha locked her in the silver cage and hoisted her on high nathan returned to camp but was unable to sleep he found himself torn two ways he hadnt seen enough of misha could never see enough of her yet spent the night separated from her and no way to tell how many nights were left to them but devetaki skullguise had a locator whose special assignment was the whereabouts of the necroscope nathan keogh if he went into the desert to misha in the new oasis at placeundertheyellowcliffs yefros might locate him there all of the bestkept secrets of the thyre would then be in jeopardy their intelligence and the location of their colonies their vulnerability and their availability previously the wamphyri had considered the thyre no better than desert trogs inferior creatures scarcely fit for consumption only let them discover the truth of it it might well mean a disaster the dull trogs of starside caverns were left mainly to their own devices because they were dull unfeeling incapable of resistance what use to torture creatures who couldnt appreciate the pain where the pleasure in hunting beings who didnt have the sense or opportunity to hide why fuel oneself on trog blood when there was always the sweet flesh of higher human beings and as for trog women well there had never been a great many vampires of black boriss persuasions but only let them get to know the thyre it was unthinkable but indeed thinking about it and between times turning over and over in his head the puzzles and enigmas posed by the esoteric dreaming of dead thyre ancients finally the necroscope drifted into a deep sleep and stayed that way for three solid hours and because his friends among the not too distant thyre knew that he needed his sleep they made no unseemly intrusions through the medium of their mentalism and it was a credit to sunsides great majority that they didnt disturb him either despite that one of their number and a special one at that was herself disturbed almost to distraction close to a deserted szgany trail through the forest not many miles from the camp nana kiklu had a visitor at the low mound of earth where lardis had dug a hole and burned her then buried her ashes her visitors predicament and nanas that she couldnt hug him comfort him hold his head to her breast brought her to incorporeal tears that she somehow kept from spilling into the deadspeak aether but she could feel him or his presence certainly and knew the feeling for a sign of his power and a symptom of his predicament both for despite that he was able to speak to her using his own morbid version of deadspeak and that she felt his presence there was no warmth in him and he was not a necroscope the next best thing then or the worst possible thing and mother he said wonderingly in his breathless whisper of a deadspeak voice where he stood at her grave did you did you call out to me wonderingly aye for none of the dead had ever done that before and through all nanas tears shed for him he knew that she had and that he lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri had heard her it was why he was here for in fact hed been on his way to find and kill nathan when her crying had drawn him down out of the sky whats more he had found his brother and had known that nathan lay sleeping only a handful of miles away so why hed answered nanas cry at all was something of a mystery to him which nestor couldnt fathom because the humanity was flown out of him and he was wamphyri then when she was able nana told nestor the story of his life which no necromancers threats might ever have wrung from her and slowly but surely the gaps in his damaged memory began to fill themselves in except it would make no real difference to him for the baby boy and young man hed once been were alien to him now even different identities and he was the lord nestor of the wamphyri so nestor stood then sat and listened while out of the cold cold earth something of warmth struggled to find its way into him as nana tried to warm him with memories that were no longer his his mothers purpose a delaying tactic was apparent even transparent yet there was more to it than that for nana had never been one for deceit and was beyond it now that she knew the truth of the grave yet still the necromancer sat there like a small but very dreadful boy at his mothers knee and while the greater part of him rejected her other parts soaked up her words like rust loosened by oil as the ghosts of memorys faded pictures were retouched with living colour and texture on the screen of his mind and perhaps somewhere deep inside the dry cogs of forgotten intelligence mental machinery began to mesh at last and wheels creakingly to turn thus nathan slept on through the night and for the moment knew nothing of nestor at nanas graveside while in starside only mangemanse continued to hold out with any measure of success throbbing with cankers moonmusic and his singing and defended by beasts lieutenants and thralls mangemanse seemed impregnable but on high wratha the risen who also had been known to use the word impregnable from time to time cackled like a madwoman behind silver bars and set her cage to rocking and wrathspire itself seemed all set to fall to the invaders from the east while in the east where the jagged spine of the barrier mountains broke into spurs sank to earth and buried itself at last spiro killglance flew towards the last jumble of tumbled rocks that marked the eastern extreme of the range dressed in his customary rags with the tails of a bloodspattered headband streaming out behind him he thought little or nothing a wingspan to his left his spare flyer glided effortlessly on breezes out of the north and lulled by the interminable throb of powerful manta wings spiros powercrazed mind was for the moment weary and blank likewise black boriss mind blank except he deliberately contrived to keep it so in order to take spiro by surprise even as hed taken gorvi for having received warning of spiros approach from desmodus bats recruited in the trog caverns as familiar creatures boris and a lieutenant were hiding in the last of the crags crouched there astride flyers that hovered on the turbulent updrafts while high overhead obscured by a scud of clouds a keeneyed warrior floated on fullyinflated bladders shadowing them and monitoring spiros progress only one warrior this time aye for following the attack on gorvi boris was satisfied that one was enough and indeed spiro was surprised no less than gorvi before him when boris and his man drifted free of the crags directly to the fore blocking his way and facing him headon and what have we here black boris called out gleefully with his mentalism when the fugitive was still some distance apart from him but i do believe its spiro killglance my how you rebels flee the fighting like bats from a leaking aerie but spiro had quickly recovered and at once returned or female trogs from a cavern when black boris drops his pants boriss turn to be surprised this was a spiro he had not seen before obviously the years flown between had given him a little selfconfidence something must have for sure why it appears youve been spying on me boris chuckled as spiro sped closer anyway its a real treat to see that youve developed a sense of humour at jast though much too late im sorry to say but at least you can die laughing i intend to spiro was now close enough to shout well smiling at least and his bloodshot deepsunken eyes turned skywards as he heard the warriors propulsors start into life then as the thing came squirting out of the clouds into view spiro saw what a monster it was albeit of the smaller variety it was viciously equipped a real test at last for his freshforged weapon and are you still smiling black boris laughed over the throb and sputter of the warriors discharge oh there are smiles and smiles spiro answered gathering his alien energies as the warrior came curving down on him from the starsplashed sky now boris was close enough to see spiros face more especially his eyes and to know where he had seen such before in the face of spiros father the abominable eygor killglance but that had been long and long ago and surely surely i have inherited them at last spiro snarled hunching down in his saddle the warrior was closing with him zeroing in its many eyes were fixed on him then fixed on his eyes it could not look away and aye come and get it spiro thought the while wondering if he really had the measure of this nightmare thing spiro was in the middle boris and his lieutenant to the fore and the warrior curving down out of the sky to the rear issuing mental commands and reinforcing them by hauling on his reins and turning his mount sideways on spiro never once took his eyes off the descending monster levelling out of its dive it sped towards him spiro was its target and it was his as spiros eyes underwent a weird and hideous metamorphosis one eye bulged crimson the other narrowed to a sulphurdripping slit then he let go his energies all in one massive blast spiros mindbolt was not visible but its effect was the warrior opened its cavern jaws as if to snap him from the sky but its jaws kept on opening the flesh stripped back from its face its flanks back and belly erectile spines detached from the creatures true spine and flew like darts in all directions gasbladders exploded outwards from under chitin scales and went flapping away like torn sails the alveolar bone and cartilage skeleton began to buckle as its musculature was stripped away and breaking in pieces it flew past a triumphant spiro in a hail of black excrement and crimson plasma flew past him directly into boris and his man boris avoided the worst of it but his lieutenant was less fortunate sliced open by freeflying scything teeth and whirling spines and knocked out of his saddle he went twirling down the night his flyer ripped in its membrane wings body and neck limped away towards the tumbling crags which left spiro and his spare flyer and black boris of course alone in the sky and there are smiles and there are smiles spiros mental voice was a sinister rumble now in boriss mind where the trogfancier sat blood and shitstreaked astride his startled mount boris would turn aside but couldnt spiros eyes held him like a fly in a spiders web spspiro boris managed to send at last i z was onjy carrying out my duties but did you have to enjoy them so i enough im in a hurry he hurled his second bolt and it was as if boris and his mount had run full tilt into a mountainside they crumpled up and their debris went fluttering to earth in rags and ruin and east spiro commanded his beasts without pause east and turgosheim for ive a gorge to populate and rule and whosoever thought eygor killgjance was a power well just wait until he sees spiro far to the west and on sunside nana and nestor sensed nathans gradual awakening nestor felt the strengthening whirl of his brothers numbers vortex and nana simply knew yet both of them held back from any sort of action nana from warning the necroscope because that could only accelerate the inevitable confrontation and nestor because he wanted to hear his story out in full the twin beliefs that formed nestors single obsession and major misconception that nathan was a great enemy from years long forgotten and that the woman misha zanesti had betrayed nestor to be with him were so deeply ingrained in his scarred mind that hearing the truth from nana was much like listening to a pack of lies which made it hard to explain why he continued to listen but he did perhaps it was the weird calming effect of her voice the same in death as in life which more than anything else stirred memories in him or perhaps he was simply tired drained by the disease that even now burned the life out of him whichever nestor sat still and listened as his mother expanded her story into a genuine delaying tactic now that she knew her other son was awake so both of them kept their thoughts to themselves excluding the living and the dead alike silent and secretive as lovers whispering in the sunside night coming more fully awake nathan sniffed suspiciously at the air typical of his szgany background this action served to remind him who and what he was originally oh he was the son of the necroscope harry keogh but he was also szgany a man of sunside all of his old feelings of alienage in his own land were gone now trask and the others were the aliens here but they were also his friends and allies nathan yawned and looked around a small clearing lit by flickering yellow firelight then threw back the cured skin that was his blanket stood up and glanced into a clear night sky the position of the stars told him the hour of the night and that hed slept his three hours to the full although it wasnt much for the first time in a long time he felt that hed actually had some rest lan goodly david chung and grinner had taken over the watch the former sat close to the fire with a wolf of the wild sprawled at his feet chung stretched his legs at the edge of the clearing zek slept on and trask had just settled to sleep close by nathan stepped to goodly and said im going to see how things are going at the last aerie ill be as long as it takes a few minutes at most the precog looked up and nodded in the ruddy firelight halfshadowed his face looked even more skulllike then we can talk he said in that way of his and nathan knew that they would indeed be talking and that therefore he was safe to make his jump he went out onto starside to a different location this time scanned the last aerie and saw that things had changed there was no fighting in the uppermost levels and most of the fires were out smokeblackened landingbays windows various cracks and crevices transformed the head of the stack into a pitted skull the plateau roof was alive with massed movement but no sign of hostilities these men and creatures were obviously the victors and wrathspire the vanquished centrally however mangemanse continued to hold out several airborne warriors held the manse in siege cruising to and fro or standing off and hovering on grotesquely inflated bladders and in the levels immediately above and especially below that obstinate manse there was still a deal of warlike activity where internal fires burned behind windows like eyes and smoke poured from scorched slitlike nostrils best evidence that mangemanse continued defiant came in the form of canker canisons moon music an uproar of nerveshredding proportions a cacophony that swelled on the bitter wind from the north and poured out from the rear of the stack as from a hundred lunatic organists it reached out to nathan more than a mile away passed over him and rebounded from the astonished barrier mountains themselves unbeknown to the necroscope this was the doglords prelude to flight when canker would launch for the moon to do mortal battle with its priests for all of the silver goddesses which he knew hed find there what nathan did know or suspect was that by now siggi dam and the rest of cankers people must be stonedeaf or at least as mad as their lord nathan had seen enough and returned to sunside he took with him a picture in his mind of all those men and monsters milling on the roof of the last aerie and wondered what devetaki skullguises next move would be indeed he knew what it must be but refused to dwell upon it best to answer it when it came back at camp he sat by the fire and spoke to the locator chung when i woke up i thought i sensed something north of here how about you chung shrugged but not negligently yes and no i keep getting a feeling that someone is out there and once or twice ive seemed to detect mindsmog but it could be nerves this is some nervy place anyway it was nothing substantial nathan nodded and turned to goodly what do you see the precog looked at him ahead of us something so big it wont register thats as much as i can say that could mean anything thats the way it is the future can be anything especially here oh it feels all wrong it is all wrong what is nathan was interested it was a rare thing to see lan goodly agitated as he was now this world the other threw up his hands i mean this parallel place the sun moon and stars in my own world i did a little amateur astronomy not a lot but enough to know that this place is all wrong we dont see nearly enough of the sun yet the days are longer than the nights and the moon tumbles which means it has an eccentric orbit or rotation or both also ive watched the stars which move quickly then slowly or we do nathan nodded ive always known these things every traveller has without knowing what they mean but now i think i do remember we had little or no science then in your world i took in a lot of learning in a short time and certain things stuck in my mind the thing is ive never had my fathers instinct for these things most of what i know came from my studies on earth or from the dead or from harrys dart in your world i had the time but i didnt have the maths for it now i have the maths but i dont have the time but as i said i think i do understand certain things go on said goodly the starside gate the original gate at the bottom of the crater was a black hole that went wrong when it fell on this world it created havoc did a lot of damage changing from a black to a grey hole it had a new kind of gravity a special gravity that becomes apparent and intrudes when i try to form a msbius door too close to the centre anyway the gates gravity and that of this planet hold each other like balls on a bolas at the opposite ends of a rope the true gravity of the planet has been interfered with which causes its eccentricity when i was at ebranch someone showed me how to make what he called a mexican jumping bean a tube of silver foil around a small ballbearing with the ends sealed off when you roll it lengthwise it wobbles goes fast then slow because its centre of gravity is changing this isnt a precise what analogy because the opposed centres of gravity of sunsidestarside are fixed which is to say the rope between the balls on the bolas isnt a rope at all but an unbreakable unbendable bar of invisible supermetal thats why the balance is all wrong there is no flexibility goodly gave a nod of partial understanding at least to cut it short during daylight hours the world is turning more slowly nathan finished it for him and the days are longer thats why the stars seem to move so queerly and it also accounts for the moons tumbling the moon is just like the ballbearing in the mexican jumping bean trapped in the silver foil of a complicated gravita he cut it short as david chung suddenly jerked alert and came to his feet ohoh he said and grinner likewise gave a start as nathan and goodly quickly stood up chung followed up with hes back nathan and fixing a powerful probe on you nathan sent a telepathic thought winging and immediately made contact he knew the other at once and his location gasping he reached for a machinepistol hanging by its strap from the bough of a fallen tree but goodly said no youre going to need that and pointed to the loaded rocketlauncher in its oiled skin the precog was trembling like a leaf his eyes wide and wild zek and trask had come awake trask wearily mumbled eh what but nathan had no time for explanations his brother nestor was at nana kiklus grave and nestor was a necromancer it was the last throw of nestors parasite a final attempt by his weakened leprosyinfected leech to regain ascendancy the denial of nana kiklus truth when nana had reached that point in her story where it became clear that misha zanesti had been nathans woman right from the start and never nestors everything his evil wamphyri nature was based upon had seemed set to crumble and nestor himself to admit the error of his ways like a child confessing a small crime except in him the crime would have been enormous his life dedicated to a lie but the vampire is tenacious nestor must be made to cling to his beliefs for his power was tied to them and the vampire is jealous possessive territorial if he once gives up something which is his where will it end must he then relinquish everything and the vampire is the ultimate liar to whom the truth is anathema for the one great truth is that the host is not master of his own destiny but the puppet of his leech and dances to the tune of an alien intruder and above all the vampire is evil and must oppose good as surely as black challenges white day night the sun the stars so that when nana had told him you cant put them apart not even by killing them especially not by killing them love will out even in death for as i know as well and better than most what we did in life we continue to do in death and they will be lovers to the end even as i love you with a mothers love for her son then his leech its essence the chemical governor of his blood his brain and every enhanced wamphyri emotion had fought back no no no and at last his cry out loud nooooooof and the deliberate opening of his mind the pouring forth of venom into the mental aether the unutterable stench of pus and poison in his vampire probe where it sped direct to the source of the cursed numbers vortex nathan in the campclearing only a few miles away and nanas incorporeal tears at last spilling over uncaring now except for her boys for the love of both of them despite that one was grown to a monster this was what nathan had heard or sensed through two simultaneous media his brothers rage and his mothers anguish with the result that he had jumped to a logical but incorrect conclusion that even now nestor rooted like a pig in the damp earth and ashes of nanas shallow plot torturing her for esoteric knowledge exactly what the necromancer had desired him to think the hunt was over for nathan would now come to him and nathan did come with a rocketlauncher seated on his shoulder nestor was surprised at the speed of nathans reaction despite that he knew his brother had the power to come and go nathans almost instantaneous appearance in that small clearing in the cold blue light of the stars astonished him where he came slowly to his feet and at his feet nanas grave all undisturbed so that nathan knew hed been fooled into coming here but with the launcher on his shoulder and his finger on its trigger maybe he wasnt such a fool after all they faced each other across nanas mound blood brothers but as different more different than any brothers before them nathan was a little over six feet tall but his brother could give him ten inches more the first was blonde fair of skin with eyes of a sapphireblue the other was morbidgrey ravenhaired and crimsoneyed and of course the necroscope was entirely human he looked upon his brother the two of them motionless and nathans finger unflinching on the trigger but for all that he was fuelled by hatred by a dire loathing and natural dread of the wamphyri he knew he couldnt make the first and last move couldnt pull that trigger despite what hed seen in future time it was out of the question he couldnt do it not with his mothers pitiful deadspeak cries ringing out in his metaphysical mind nathan no nathan you would never forgive yourself but her soulful supplications werent for him alone nestor son everything told you is the truth if you must die then die but not this way i beg you this way youll be cursed by the dead for all eternity and so little brother nestor sighed his voice muffled a panting rasp from behind gauze wrappings and inclining his head he went on my great enemy you a mere man betrayer thief plague in my mind and curse on my being you such a flimsy thing as you well your mother pleads for you and rightly nathan darent so much as blink but he could speak and for you nestor she pleads for you too nestor stepped aside from the mound edged closer and his eyes seemed to drip fire but i dont need her pleas nor i while i hold this weapon you saw it used before on the dome of sanctuary rock nestor scarcely seemed to move yet stood all of a long pace closer why should i fear death even the true death im doomed anyway as a leper nathan that too is your fault no ill not be blamed for that nathan answered the szgany give blame where its due but by the same token they also know how to accept responsibility for their actions they dont accuse their fellow men out of spite but then neither have they leeches to appease he could have bitten his tongue but couldnt help it it was tit for tat hed fallen into the mode of wamphyri argument automatically giving blow for blow are you saying im less than a man nestor was no more than two paces away now im saying youre wamphyri nathan croaked from a bonedry gulping throat which means that you cant win for your greatest battle is already lost and nathaaan nana wailed nestooor the tendrils of a mist began to coil from under nestors cloak lapping his feet you are my great enemy he breathed and the mist was also in his breath now he stood only a single pace away at arms length and his eyes were like magnets that held nathans in an iron grip but the necroscopes finger was still cold on the trigger of his weapon and it seems we must have it out husked nestor except suddenly they were not alone iv the death of nestor intuition deai with a devii the whup whup whup of mighty membrane wings as dark manta shadows blotted out the stars and mentalist voices spoke in the trembling aether so nestor and how is my handsome lusty lord after all this time for upon a time you made a lady out of a poor thrall you loved her to death or undeath and while she slept you pegged her out where the sun would find her but the lord vasagi found her first as we have now found you she came from the south skimming the trees wild and weird in her saddle her scarlet jaws agape her flyer dipped its bellypouch yawned open nestor had nowhere to run and suddenly his legs had no strength to carry him fullwaxed his disease was out of control running rampant through his system down nathan yelled and astonished nestor knew that his necroscope brother shouted at him he fell beside nanas mound and carmens flyer came on but a powerful mentalist was in nathans mind reading the secrets of his awesome weapon there and carmen beware that one is dangerous he will surely kill you it was vasagi whose telepathic voice nathan would know anywhere vasagi his mothers murderer there was blood and a mutual deathvow between them and this carmen was a creature of his before when he faced nestor pointblank nothing short of a direct fullfrontal attack could have induced the necro scope to pull the trigger of his rocketlauncher now nothing could have stopped him heeding vasagis warning carmen swerved and flew off at a tangent gaining elevation to clear the trees at the side of the clearing aiming twelve inches ahead of her middle nathan squeezed off his missile which hurtled home along a path of sizzling blinding fire there came a flash and a hot blast and carmen cleared the trees in small pieces and a scarlet spray and carmenwhoshouldnotbe was not her mount its thorny spine gouged by a great bite where the saddle had been issued a single shrilling bleat and crumpled headon into the trees while overhead one of you is weak as a sick wolfcub vasagi sent as he began sideslipping his flyer to earth and the other is merely human szgany and now weaponless scarcely a match for vasagi but vasagi was not the one who threw down the gauntlet his mount settled like a leaf on a still day or a flat stone through water slipping from side to side with its manta wings arched into airtrap scoops but despite that carmen was dead still nathan detected two alien minds in the telepathic aether the other belonged to vasagis flyer karz nathan gasped karz biteri and at last his old friend knew him too nathan seersthrall called kiklu who had flown him to freedom out of runemanse in turgosheim then no said karz to vasagi i may not take you down we have journeyed far enough together you and i amazingly a vampire flyer defied its lord and rider take me down now vasagis voice was a grunt a threat as karz plied his wings and rose up a little no karz denied him yet again i have had more than enough of you vasagi as of now we go our own ways you and i it was always our agreement vasagi was furious beast i order you take me down nathan sensed karzs mental shrug so be it and somewhat higher than the treetops karz did an utterly unthinkable thing and reneged on a lord of the wamphyri folding a wing and rolling over sideways he flexed his body like a steel spring and hurled vasagi from the saddle vasagi the gape fell he fluttered through the higher foliage smashed through lower branches thumped down in dark green undergrowth the fall might well have stunned a man but never a vampire lord a mist issued from the nightdark forest and vasagi was in it nestor too continued to manufacture his mist and the clearing lay deep in milky white then go said nana to nathan go now while you may but as the necroscope conjured a door he saw the writhing mist part as his brother nestor flowed upright from it and hurled himself upon vasagi where the gape had tried to creep up on nathan and go nestor repeated nana even as he grappled with the monstrous vasagi this one is mine upon a time i gave him life a mistake ill now try to correct before my own wasted existence and body are finished so go while you can little brother and consider yourself lucky nathan went but not too far time seemed to blur lan goodly was waiting at the camp for nathan with what he needed or what the precog knew nathan would be needing he was so sure of himself he twisted the grenades fins as he thrust it into nathans hand all of which took perhaps five or six seconds the next four would be crucial one nathan took the grenade and trusted to the future or rather to the understanding goodly had with the future two he conjured a door and sped back to the unequal combat in the clearing three he vacated the mobius continuum into a waistdeep sea of mist that lapped like bluetinged milk but had an ugly living texture to it somewhere in there nestor and vasagi struggled even now four his time was up and he must use the grenade meanwhile ten seconds is life or death in handtohand combat especially when the combatants are wamphyri nestor was weak made weak by his disease but vasagi was at the peak of his power made even stronger by his madness and in his madness he hadnt once paused to consider the reason for his opponents weakness he knew only that he was under attack and must retaliate vasagi had no gauntlet indeed nestor wore his gauntlet taken for his own after vasagis duel with wran just another infuriating factor on top of the death of carmen which had served to madden the gape even further being raked with his own gauntlet as nestor tackled him had been the last straw and knocking nestor down and falling on him to enfold his upper half in vertical jaws all of three feet long had been vasagis answer to injury added to insult but instead of feeling pain in the necromancers mind as the gapes metamorphic flesh plunged a thousand small siphons into him to draw off his vital fluids vasagi had sensed what satisfaction even triumph by which time his leech had known that nestor was a leper and even in the act of gutting the other and tearing out his parasite in pieces vasagi had recoiled let go his deathgrip on nestor and flowed upright in the lake of their mutual mist five and just a little late or at the precise optimum moment nathan lobbed his grenade into the convulsing mass of vasagis innards and hurled himself backwards away from that reeling monstrosity astonishment and a pointblank refusal an inability to comprehend to believe registered in nathans mind along with vasagis eh what before a muffled blast and flash of brilliant white light signalled the gapes end nathan felt himself splashed not his flesh but his clothing and with trembling fingers began to strip himself naked and aye nestor gasped in his mind let nothing jet nothing of of that one cling to you his telepathic voice was so very weak that nathan knew he was finished and trembling still but from the shock of violent action and otherwise unafraid finally the necroscope went to his blood brother and found his crushed and broken body in the mist dont touch nestor warned him as vasagi is unclean so am i indeed i am twicetainted wait nathan husked and went to the camp and returned with a cured skin to carefully wrap his brother who seemed so small so shrivelled now and ththere he said his voice breaking and surprising him wwwarmth for you and protection for mmme and cradling the others head he thought i havent stuttered in a long time ahhh nestor breathed out loud now i remember how once i was your protection his head lolled but he lived on and the fire in his eyes flickered still what to do what to do nathan felt crushed inside even as nestor was crushed but his mother told him you know what to do and her tears were hot as his own albeit in his mind she has it right nestor whispered but quickly while i while i have it right such pain should never be and it will go on and on and ill fight it to the end because there is that of the vampire in me even now what little vasagi left me nestor do it do it now nestor twitched and jerked beneath his blanket and nathan gathered him up and took him there ten thousand miles south to a brilliant blue sky high over the endless furnace deserts and a golden orb like the hearthfire of some alien god standing high on the southern horizon then its done nathan said his physical voice lost in the fluttering air as they fell like stones and he pushed nestor away from him so be it said the other falling through a door nathan emerged below in the shade of a sunscorched outcrop and watched nestor plummet down the blinding sky like a meteorite at noon he left a trail white at first rapidly turning black which boiled for a moment and was gone and nestor gone with it the blanket flapped empty wings like a strange mad bird tumbling to earth then a flash of gold a golden dart spearing down from the sky from nestor and nathan had seen just such a dart before it struck home found its target and came home like a soft silent arrow to the necroscopes head intuition the very essence of intuition his fathers intuition which in harry keogh had made him a master of numbers and of the mobius continuum it was everything that had been missing from nathans makeup his personality that which he might have had right from the beginning if nestor had not needed it more than he did it was the instinct to know these things and to understand almost everything else that had baffled nathan to distraction nestor had not been the strong but the weak one and the dart had known it instinctively that was why on the day of harrys death the dart had gone to nestor even nestors dark and tortured future had probably been known but as a descendant or continuation of the necroscope harry keogh he must be given a chance except nestor had not been like harry or nathan but had his own nature or the dark side of his fathers whichever he was omega to nathans alpha and once his course had been set there was no help for it but that the dart must see it through with him and nestors instinct his intuitive empathy since childhood had been for the wamphyri because of that he would have ascended to a lord anyway even without the dart but with it little wonder his awakening had been so swift his metamorphosis so allconsuming nathan saw it all now he understood those shards those fragments of his father they were guides to see him and his brother on their way through life but the knowledge had been in nathan already and he had not needed not until that time in the mediterranean when at last a door had been opened for him and all that time his dart waiting buried in the heart of a dead machine at ebranch hq ready to spring to life at the moment of his greatest need just how much of the future was known then how much had been charted by those incorporeal inhabitants of mobiusspace mobiustime those pieces of the necroscope harry keogh or was it a mystery even to such as them had they been allowed a glimpse along nestors blue lifethread to see it turn scarlet instinctively nathan knew they had also that they must have known the end of it how when the hour was right nestors hitherto wasted dart would come home to him and the hour was right sunsidestarsides hour of greatest need now he stepped naked out of the shadow of the rock and felt the heat of the desert under his feet and with his head ringing with new thoughts he conjured a mobius door and returned to the night keeping his mind shielded as best he might nathan went to the oasis at placeundertheyellowcliffs and alerted atwei who found clothes for him he didnt dare to stay not even to speak to misha but at once returned to his helllander colleagues in their camp where indeed all hell seemed to be breaking loose ben trask acted as coordinator frantically directing the efforts of zek and david chung respectively where they listened in on or tracked who else but their vampire enemies who finally were on the move and grinner was in telepathic contact with blaze and the grey brotherhood somewhere in the barrier mountains receiving a mass of information and warnings but unable to pass them on with clear definition to anyone but the necroscope theyre coming uncle grinner barked in nathans mind as he saw him materialize those in the foothills theyve spread themselves out along the range beating upwards into the peaks and driving the grey brothers before them and the others from the last aerie that vampire army out of the east the sky is thick with them on their way to sunside a mass attack on the szgany it could only be now that wrathstack had been taken devetaki skullguise would use the rest of the night to monstrous advantage shed be looking for nathan of course but while searching for him her troops would rain terror on sunside indeed that was probably a major part of her plan so that the necroscope would be drawn into the open alexei yefros is onto you nathan zek and chung called out almost as one voice not only that chung added but he has been on you all the time youve been away at a site a few miles north of here your mothers grave and even out in the desert in fact wherever you go yefros was one hell of a locator before but now that hes a vampire nathan was aghast are you telling me he knows about the thyre maybe not about them chung answered but its an even bet he knows where youve moved all those szgany groups even i would know that i can feel their massed minds in the night away in the south like a softglowing cloud of fireflies and ahhh chung gasped crouching down as a dark and pulsing manta shape passed overhead and jesus the locator continued but thats not all i feel trask was down on one knee in a moment his smg aimed up towards the stars the necroscope stopped him with two words no ben not even the fleetest of the enemys flyers could have got here that fast this could only be karz biteri and to confirm it nathan karz sent from where he hovered on a night wind devetakis army is on its way the aether seethes with their lust youre in great danger but i can take you out of here he did not know how good the necroscope was at taking care of himself my thanks karz nathan told him but this is my fight and i have to stay here karz sensed his determination and perhaps something of his power can you win i can try i have weapons that that i cant even begin to explain good fortune then said karz and my thanks for seeing how strong you are yet again youve given me strength to go on i too have a fight to fight nathan nodded yet the last time we spoke you only wanted to die but no longer not yet for now i have a mission in the east aye now that turgosheim is empty or almost empty maglore the same karz sounded grimly determined and since im on my own again i go there now tonight too late nathan told him the nights half done the sun will find you out before you clear the great red waste is it so then i must wait on another chance nathan thought fast for he had enough to do here but on the other hand how long would it take the answer was simple no time at all karz he sent land out there if you trust me that hummock on the rim of the savanna and even as karz came down he went there himself via the mobius continuum how said karz astonished uncoiling his belly thrusters as he settled to earth and what nathan said upon a time you carried me out of turgosheim to safety regardless of the risk to yourself a favour for a favour karz now ill take you back he climbed up into the saddle lift me up and in a moment they were airborne you do trust me then in turgosheim and ever since but about returning there didnt you tell me ust a moment ago the sun would find me out over the great red waste theres another route so if you really do trust me do exactly as i tell you however strange it may seem nathan told him and karz obeyed gaining altitude and folding back his manta wings he sped like an arrow for earth and passed through the biggest door that nathan ever conjured a second door lay only an instant away but in the moment karz soared through it whaaat it wasnt only the way theyd got here that confused him but also the sight of the place turgosheim said the necroscope and realized immediately that it wasnt what karz had expected turgosheim right enough but deserted oh really they floated high above the rim of the gorge while down below the signs of war were plentiful black smoke coiling from burnedout stumps in the gloomy bottoms and fires still ablaze in many a manse in the towering honeycombed walls so that even to a dazed karz biteri it was all too clear what had happened here maglore had his opportunity or glory and like any or ajl of the wamphyri he couldnt resist it nathan finished it yes i know what did you expect karz that the place would be derelict windblown dead except for maglore something like that aye nathan shook his head not so there are thralls and creatures galore down there only the lords and ladies are missing except as you rightly suppose maglore in runemanse so do you still intend to stay here what will you do now a mental shrug i shall hope that my time will come karz answered then take my chance for glory and revenge even as magjore has taken his then before i go i had better warn you nathan told him that there may not be a lot of time things are going to happen karz things of great moment they can only be an improvement said the other but you nathan these amazing powers of yours alas nathan shook his head ive neither the time nor the means to explain them but indeed they are the weapons i mentioned farewell karz he tumbled himself from the saddle karz angled his great head to watch the necroscope turn over twice in midair before flattening out and disappearing through an entirely invisible mobius door then karz bitteri once a man and perhaps still a man soared alone in the reeking updrafts out of turgosheim it had taken a minute maybe two nathan scarcely considered the time wasted as he materialized back at the camp but trask and the others might disagree nathan whats going on zek started as he appeared then grabbed his arm something i had to do he answered and here he loosened her fingers looked her steadily in the eyes she knew how tense she must appear slowed down and calmed herself and remember she said that its different for you but we arent we dont were not necroscopes all right im sorry nathan said and i know i shouldnt just leave you like that but i have a feeling that everything will be fine its going to be okay ben trask had heard their conversation likewise the precog and locator all of them eased off and gathered to nathan and trask asked him are you going to explain lets get round the fire nathan answered and they did and when they were settled the aerial vampire army is on its way from wrathstack nathan started also they have several advance parties made up of those camps in the starside foothills by now they could be in the high peaks devetaki has alexei yefros whose talent has been enhanced by his vampirism they know where i am or where we are and they probably know where a good many szgany are too all gathered together for them in thyre harbour areas like bunches of grapes but there are a lot more of the travellers right here in sunside hiding in the forests and theyll be more difficult to find and flush out also what devetaki doesnt know several pockets of humanity in the forests are equipped with weapons out of earth and men who can use them thats the current situation now timings if the foothills parties come right for us theyll be here in a little over an hour if they hold back and wait for devetakis main force well be safe here for at least two and a half hours more so theres no need for panic right now but there are still some thirtyodd hours of night and morning twilight left before sunup when nature swings over to our side and a lot can happen in half a sunside night now listen the vampires cant trap us for we have our own talents which are equal to theirs zek and i are able to hear them grinner smells them out david knows where they are and lan can sometimes see whats coming and if they get too close i can move us out of here so in general as an overview thats about the scheme of things but the overall original plan wasnt to hide from them or evade them but destroy them utterly and if we fail to see it through then all this is for nothing especially now that devetaki knows theres something south of here namely my desertdwelling friends the thyre but the south spells danger to a vampire and we have to hope shell think twice before committing her forces in that direction which leaves us with one conclusion that she intends to saturate sunside flush us out add our talents to hers and consolidate her position tomorrow night thats how i see it but i could be wrong and only time will tell unless you can tell me otherwise us trask stared at him youre the ones with the talents nathan answered we have two hours maximum to formulate new plans but sweeping plans to decimate and even destroy any last trace of wamphyri contamination lets start with you ben do you find any fault in what ive said was it a true or a false scenario trask shrugged the best i can tell you is that you yourself believe in it he answered but as youve already said time alone will tell that is if lan goodly cant tell in advance he looked at the precog goodly was gaunt as ever we have to plan of course he said despite that the bestlaid plans and all that what i mean is the future will be but its always governed by the present so i simply cant tell you what to do or even not to do anything but only to do what you must in other words nathans scenario seems sound to me and if the future doesnt like it it will be changed accordingly theres only one thing i know for sure that something big is coming oh ive said it before i know but its so big it obscures everything else and it has to do with what nathans dead thyre friends told him nathan nodded and excitedly took over there was something hed been wanting to show them and now seemed the perfect opportunity lets take another look at that then he found the piece of bark hed drawn on for trask and showed them ethlois no longer mysterious symbols for this time his newfound intuition prompted him to make changes the arrows suggest movement he said from a to c or from one to three but if you number the phases like this its at once apparent that this isnt an engine and now the whole thing was simplicity itself but to be absolutely sure the necroscope explained it anyway then went on to describe the system as an unending selfperpetuating cycle which gives total protection to two worlds but damages and depletes neither its just like the mobius strip which i was shown superimposed over this diagram a single system transcending and blending disparate dimensions yet interfering with neither one of them the strip was my fathers life it became my symbol and saved my life now it will be the salvation of a world even a universe listening and looking trasks jaw had fallen open as he recognized the truth of this thing finally he jumped to his feet but this presupposes that were going to get back to our own world we have to in order to initiate it nathan grinned wolfishly at him at all of them and said did you ever have any doubts any of you one of them had at least lan goodly said its possible of course that gustav turchin has figured it out for himself which would mean our return isnt necessarily a foregone conclusion as they pondered that nathan said now has to be as good a time as any i can take a quick look at the gate and if its safe move you out there right now on the first leg of your trip home then we can be sure that this he indicated the diagram will definitely happen whether turchin has already thought of it or not at least one of our problems your main problem will have been solved zek reached out and patted his hand but yours will still remain havent you given up trying to get rid of us yet nathan dont you know its not going to be that easy he sighed out loud and said very well but from now on youve got to stay close together all four of you and at all times from this moment on ive got to be able to move all of you in one bunch and at a moments notice agreed said trask and meanwhile now nathan looked at them in turn i could use a situation report he patted grinners head where the wolf of the wild lay close by ive lost my observers grinner said the grey brothers are scattered in the mountain heights broken up by the vampires in the foothills but the reports of several individuals all tejj the same story the flyers out of wrathstack are coming in great waves turning the sky black there cant be that many nathan was perplexed a wolf shrug wolves are sometimes like men or dogs they like to exaggerate they bark at shadows zek had got something of this and now said there isnt a peep out of them theyre not talking and theyre shielding their minds radio silence said trask nathan looked at him but trask shook his head an earth tactic he said apparently it applies here too and frowning chung said there are a great many of them but its a funny thing i mean if this devetaki creature is mainly interested in you nathan then why doesnt she concentrate her forces on us why are they spreading out evenly like a great blanket are they nathan was keenly interested anxious yes from the petrified lava falls beyond the great pass their front extends many miles west of here like a mileslong wave rolling in on a beach zek said halfclosing her eyes and reaching out with her mind nathans turn to frown as he added or like a net being draped over us suddenly he was worried but what if they go right on over us and head out into the desert to the harbour areas and the thyre ive placed a good many hundreds of men women and children in thyre colonies out there all on a line roughly east to west devetakis wave would hit them more or less simultaneously and theres no way i can be in four or five different places at the same time it was trasks turn to calm him down son take it easy you painted a picture a few minutes ago and it was a true one as far as it went theres nothing more to be done right now if you make a mobiusjump out into the colonies to alert your people and the thyre yefros will know of it at once for you cant make a move without stirring up your numbers vortex and it gives you away every time but if or when the first vampire wave passes over us heading out across the desert then youll know the worst of it and that will be your signal to take some kind of action to save your people until then you cant give the show away nathan nodded and after that if it happens ill have no more than half an hour to visit all those thyre locations and take my people out of there except this time i wont make any mistakes but move them right away from here east to the very limits of the barrier mountains and fifty miles out into the desert devetaki wont be able to reach them there not and get back to wrathstack before the sun rises again trask nodded approvingly goodly on the other hand merely grunted and turned his face away nathan looked at him until the precog felt his gaze and returned it and well said nathan weve arrived at the one conclusion we had to arrive at goodly said and as you can see the only action we can take is what we would have taken anyway without all the discussion the talk is fine and lets us all know where we stand but the future is narrowing down on us and will be as it will be just dont believe for a moment that were in charge because were not and dont forget the big one keeps getting closer minute by minute but you still dont know what this big one will be goodly shook his head good or bad i cant say i only know that its close and were all in it together but i have to remind you nathan even though i hate to remind you of what we saw in futuretime you and i i mean im not worried for myself but i know what you mean nathan stopped him ive already been into it with ben here now i dont want to think about it any more until it comes he threw a dead branch onto the fire leaned back against the bole of a fallen tree and closed his eyes in fact i just want to clear my mind of all this and see what else comes into it one thing i can guarantee though im not about to reach the end of my tether just yet awhile the necroscope wasnt trying to sleep wasnt trying to do anything he literally cleared his mind relaxed and took a mental breather and slept after a few moments when zek said something to him in a low voice his only reponse was when his hand slid from his chest to nestle openfisted in the grass by his side a glance into his mind disclosed the white noise of human sleep prior to the dreamstate and a dispersing collapsing whirl of numbers as mental exhaustion returned him to the basic state of mind mentally even possessing his metaphysical mind the necroscope was little more than a mote now drifting wherever the eddies of dreams and fancies might take him trask draped a blanket over nathans shoulders looked at the others and shrugged i feel weary too tension and anxiety i suppose let alone all the physical stuff that hes been going through god only knows what his talent is taking out of him we can let him be for an hour or so recharge his batteries so to speak but lets all of us stay on the alert and as soon as we have something we wake him up grinner seemed to understand he got up loped to the rim of the clearing and began circling sniffing the air listening not only with keen mobile wolf ears but with who could tell how many other wolf senses all tuned for danger zek and chung likewise began pacing back and forth their wild talents reaching out into the north to discover whatever they might and lan goodly sat by the fire not far from nathan glancing at the sleeping necroscope now and then and perhaps trying to catch the occasional glimpse of other things eygor killglance wasted no time his previously developed rapport with nathan took him direct to his targets mind and the monsters panic and confusion told of the state he was in in his madmanse pit in turgosheim necroscope what terrible thing is this youve wrought what have you done to me eygors deadspeak voice was as evil as ever like the methanebelching slurp and gurgle of a quagmire but his anxiety was very real nathan knew him at once of course and despite sensing eygors genuine but as yet unexplained alarm returned oh and is this a new approach eygor are you claiming to be the victim of some act of mine what did you tell maglore the other hissed which had the effect of jogging nathans memory and bringing alive the screen of his mind until eygor saw its pictures so and now all is explained then explain it to me nathan gave a mental shrug you threatened him with me do you deny it no it was a word game he taunted me and returned fire he made threats and i threatened him with me aye eygor finished it for him except it was more than a word game to him maglore knows your powers necroscope and those he doesnt know he suspects you hinted that he wasnt yet safe from a dead old thing in a pit that in certain circumstances under the right conditions a ghost may be more than a mere ghost to you this was a word game a careless jest or taunt as it would be to many a lord of the wamphyri but to maglore nathan knew what he meant that maglore of runemanse was a seer a supernaturalist even beyond the scope of wamphyri knowledge and talents a believer in omens signs and sigils dooms and damnations of course he was else nathans threat had carried no weight but how much weight hod it carried his thoughts were deadspeak and eygor was in tune with them oh i con tell you that all right the monster said a lot of weight a world of weight the weight of all the rubble and boulders that choke the throat of my pit for even now he digs his way down to me he comes to discover and disassemble me in this stifling stagnant nitrous place to break me up burn what will burn and scatter the rest to the four corners of turgosheim because he fears old eygor as never before with a fear that you gave him necroscope its all your doing your fault and only you can put it right only you can call me up not good enough said nathan while in his secret mind he turned it over he had never once deliberately called up a dead creature though past events and now his intuition told him that indeed he had the power yet on two occasions the dead had returned of their own volition to come to his aid in desperate circumstances and when he was safe theyd gone down again of their own free will so apparently the talent worked independent of nathan himself it was that the great majoritys love of his father had transferred to him because like harry before him he was the single light in their eternal darkness eygor killglance on the other hand couldnt come up because even if nathan were threatened there wasnt enough love in the vampire indeed not any to motivate and mobilize him he must therefore be brought up by the incredible regenerative power of the necroscope and why not why not fight fire with fire hadnt he been the one to stop trask shooting at the flyer rider and gasbeast bomb out of wrathstack because he liked the idea of vampires destroying each other wouldnt this be the same and didnt maglore deserve all of it and more for what hed done to karz and orlea and hundreds of others not to mention what he would do to nathan if ever he had the chance nathans mindshield slipped a little as he became engrossed with the idea eygor read him and urged fust think what better way to stop the old bastard raiding on turgosheims sunside give him something better or worse to think about eh at the moment the seerlord is glutted and all his creatures too but sooner or later hell need to reinforce turgosheim blood with fresh stuff out of sunside do you really want to wait that long how long nathan wanted to know when hes finished with me i should think right now im the one thing that stands between maglore and an easy mind and peaceful dreams except there is one other hell be needing to deal with soon enough oh i sense it said eygor my own flesh and blood returning out of the west one of my bloodsons spiro out on the boulder plains the teeming dead were listening to their conversation now jason lidesci said it could be that hes telling the truth necroscope wrathstack has all but fallen but spiro is not among the dead the other brother wran is dead and raging still but not spiro he has fled the fray eygor insisted hes on his way back to turgosheim even now if its true jason continued then you have real trouble on your hands for spiro has inherited his fathers evil eye the victims of that eye lie scattered around the foot of wrathstack vampire victims nathan said i feel nothing for them no but you do feel for the szgany of turgosheims sunside eygor reminded him so hows it to be necroscope will you not call me up to put paid to both maglore and spiro and remember you dont come out of this emptyhanded well strike a bargain not an eye for an eye but an eye for a moment of life or however long it takes me nathan was tempted there was nothing of a healthy nature in turgosheim for eygor to corrupt he felt sure that the thing in its madmanse pit could handle both spiro killglance and maglore the mage if only he could be sure that once eygor was up he could be put down again as easily but you have the power eygor was persuasive and anyway what is there for an old dead thing in his pit in the world of the jiving nothing but revenge on maglore who dares to covet madmanse and my bastard bloodson spiro who blinded and murdered me as for wran hes dead you say good but i wish that i had got to him first nathan was halfconvinced eygors killing eye would make a powerful addition to his arsenal of metaphysical weapons if i make a deal with you how will you give me your eye only let me into your mind and it shall be done except nathan knew that upon a time his father had made a similar mistake again eygor read him and said but how may i possibly harm you im dead in turgosheim and you are alive in the west give me your eye now nathan answered and if or when maglore reaches you in your pit or spiro makes it back across the great red waste then ill call you up what what is that for a bargain the only one youll get from me the necroscope answered for long moments eygor was sullenly silent he was over a barrel and knew it but eventually so be it he said however grudgingly sleep on nathan but leave your mind open to me so that i may invest it with mine nathan did as instructed and knew evil dreams a while then done said eygor suddenly nathans brain seethed there was an unholy power in him he felt it there like a cancer in his mind eating away at the good in him eygor had put something into him the power of his evil eye of course and nathan knew that the monster in his pit had hoped it would make him as evil as eygor himself given time perhaps it would with a cry of alarm nathan sprang awake v shaking the web siege on settlement ben trask had been about to wake the necroscope leaning over nathan touching his arm trask felt the brief vibration that shook him then heard his cry of alarm as he snatched himself sideways away from trask then his eyes opening wide wider as something monstrous stirred behind them something awful and awesome about them in the shifting firelight trask jerked upright and made an inarticulate questioning sound in the back of his throat he went to step back a pace and found himself lifted bodily from his feet and hurled back his heart felt as if someone had jabbed it with a live electrode zek and lan goodly had seen something of it they made to go to trask but nathan was there first his eyes were normal now ben are you all right trask got up slowly staggered looked at the necroscope curiously cautiously and gasped jesus christ how the what in the name of something hit me nathan said nothing but he knew knew too that from now on people must tread warily about him try not to take him by surprise and never shock him zek read something of it in his mind and said ben this is all part of it part of the big one goodly came to her help an important part chung had arrived from the perimeter grinner loped at his heels somethings coming right now the locator said nothing big but nasty as all hell whatever had happened was put aside for now as in the next moment bats huge desmodus bats with wingspans a yard across swerving and dancing overhead there were four of them advance reconnaissance probably recruited in wrathstack trasks machinepistol made its distinctive chching sound as he cocked it but nathan was wide awake now and stopped him save your ammunition theyre more or less harmless you cant get them all and in any case their failure to report back would tell devetaki just as much but as the bats made off nathan held back a curse of frustration in all likelihood he probably could have got them all and all it would have cost was a glance on the other hand he didnt have the measure of his new talent yet it might be as well to use it sparingly lest it grow on him another glance told him hed been asleep for well over an hour whats been happening chung was first to answer flyers have landed warriors too in the sunside foothills perhaps twentyodd miles east of here also due north and other parties in the west and thereve been plenty more landings too all regularly spaced out along the barrier range only in the foothills no chung shook his head small packets have been putting down every few miles or so into the woods forming a sort of grid system getting closer all the time nathan nodded like the squares of a large silk net settling gently to earth right across sunside only its not silk and it wont be gentle not for long theyre still mainly silent zek told him with no apparent or specific interest in our group nathan looked at goodly who gave a shrug time is i know nathan cut him short its narrowing down and grinner took the opportunity to put in my grey brothers are scattered throughout the heights the vampire army has mostly passed over them chung was alert as never before north of here but approaching fast in a direct line something coming at us straight as an arrow there came a distant throb of propulsors and carried on a soughing breeze out of the northeast the crack crack crack of automatic fire to disturb the nights comparative silence its beginning nathan said but this time at least my people have the means to fight back i dont understand said chung this oncoming party is just another thread in the net thats being laid down i dont get the feeling that were a specific target why are we being what ignored its like theyre waiting for us to show our hand trask said and nathan agreed theyre trying to draw me into it and meanwhile the net or web spins itself ever wider over sunside very close now chungs voice showed his alarm are we just going to sit here in the north spied over a horizon of tall trees several menacing manta shapes scudded with the last handful of clouds and time we were on our way said the necroscope but even as he spoke he felt an unaccustomed anger even rage deep inside and his eyes felt hot where cold sweat stood out suddenly upon his brow briefly he fought with emotions that were his yet alien to him the urge to stay and fight and try out his dreadful eyes but before the urge could win he conjured a mobius door and guided his companions through it and took them out five miles into the nightdark desert where as they exited from the continuum into sand and brittle scrub zek clapped a hand to her forehead and gasped they werent ignoring us after all or theyre not now anyway their minds are open messages pass between them they recognized your signature the numbers vortex nathan and they know weve moved but are they still advancing he looked at chung yes said the locator in a moment their net is being dragged out into the desert but its staggered now and this is their main spearhead theyre pushing on us or on the thyre harbours nathan groaned placeundertheyellowcliffsthe new oasisatweimisha you can move misha and the lidescis trask told him and pinpoint their hideout chung warned another five minutes maximum and well have to move on anyway said zek how big is this spearhead nathan felt his anger growing again a burning behind his eyes despite him trying to keep them cool not big chung said after a moment this net of theirs is really stretching them the bloodwar cost them heavily the necroscope made up his mind til move misha lardis and the lidescis then well defend placeundertheyellowcliffs we have to i wont have vampires in the cavern of the ancients the thyre would never forgive me and to me their culture is at least as important as any of this he conjured another door and they were on their way the thyre were expecting them therefore so were lardis misha and the szgany lidesci the best of the thyre mentalists atwei included had been keeping surreptitious sporadic watch on the necroscope and his friends and on the wamphyri of course lardis and his people were waiting in the new oasis ready to play nathans game of hide and seek and nathan told them this time im taking you far enough away that the vampire army cant possibly get to you not tonight anyway but as they took up their rope in preparation lardis and kirk lisescu spoke up almost as one man were not going what nathan looked at them were fighters and we have weapons lardis growled and kirk added were sick of hiding and not knowing whats going on out there in the forests there are szgany who could use our skills weve been idle too long take the rest of our people where you will but take lardis and me where the fighting is nathan looked around and lardis knew what he was looking for andrei will stay here help protect the thyre since you and your friends are going to be here a while i know hell be safe enough also he has this woman this anna who will stay with him so andrei romani had been hooked at last and anna marie english had found a new cause the thyre nathan was glad both ways anyway he had no time to argue he supposed he must consider himself fortunate that misha wasnt giving him problems too except she was im staying here with you she said and her tone told him shed brook no denial that nothing would shift her he could only shrug his shoulders helplessly and so leaving trask and his colleagues in the oasis with lardis and misha and telling the old lidesci til be back for you and kirk be ready he led the rest of the travellers into and through the mobius continuum to crater lake far in the east and sixty miles out in the supposed desert wasteland devetaki couldnt possibly get here before dawn should she be so foolish as to try it shed never make the return journey home again to the last aerie word of the necroscopes coming had gone out in advance of him passed telepathically down the line of thyre colonies by atwei and other powerful thyre mentalists so that his arrival was anticipated no time was wasted in handing over his charges into thyre care and he returned immediately to placeundertheyellowcliffs armed to the teeth with hellland weapons lardis and kirk were waiting where do you want to go nathan asked them east of the great pass said lardis without hesitation there are people scattered there afraid inexperienced its likely theyre in trouble and could use our help nathan frowned supplicant territory vormulac wiped most of them out and i thought you were glad to see them go theyre szgany lardis snapped this could be our opportunity to win them back from the wamphyri forever youre sure youll be all right no but there again ive never been sure of that in fifty years enough talk take us there so nathan took them to a place due south of the lava falls on starside but on this side of the barrier mountains the foothills where they sloped down into the forest in supplicant territory from perhaps a mile away there came shouts crashing sounds a veritable uproar the old lidesci nodded his grim approval supplicants they might have been in their time but it seems theyre fighting well enough now and to the necroscope youll know where to find us come morning he clasped forearms with nathan take care lad go to it lardis nathan told him in the terminology of an alien world then as if realizing his error tear down the mountains old friend he watched the pair slip silently into the woods then returned to the starlit oasis and arrived with only a minute or two to spare of all the thyre atwei was the one who had chosen to wait with trask and the others theyre coming she told him i know he nodded we make a stand here in the oasis upon a time my father defended a garden such as this with just such weapons and friends as i have but especially friends men and a woman even the same woman out of an alien world it seems seemly atwei was reluctant to leave nathan asked her how many routes go down under the earth to your colony several the one you know lies through the cavern of the ancients high in the cliffs there at the back of the oasis i wont tell you the others what you dont know cant hurt the thyre or you she answered my people have turned the secret ways into traps if the vampires attempt to descend nathan understood the routes were boobytrapped and the cavern of the ancients the way stands clear for you and yours nathan shook his head it wont come to that ill take my friends oh somewhere else but the wamphyri well be ready for them if they dare descend he took her and zek and misha too despite all their protests up into the cavern of the ancients and returned to the oasis a moment later spied as silhouettes against a starry horizon the vampires came it would seem just two flyers trask husked and their thrall riders chung noted but up there a dark blot circling in the bluetinged sky its booming thunder reaching down to them in the moment of chungs warning a warrior small of its sort but deadly theyll see the oasis goodly knew it of course knew what was coming too he could hear the uproar see the fire smell the blood they have backup chung shouted as the warriors main propulsors fired and it began a spiralling descent towards the oasis a mile or two back more of them ben goodly gasped his adamsapple wobbling were to take the flyers and riders you me and david but the warrior is nathans chung was carrying his flamethrower nathan asked him do you have fuel for that thing a little and then theres this a machinepistol they all had machinepistols compact and easy to handle but nathan had only a conventional szgany crossbow plus a weapon hed not yet put to the trial grenades the three nodded in unison they all had grenades good luck said nathan he needed elevation room to focus his eyes his anger hatred on the warrior it seemed like madness but there was nothing else he could try he transferred himself to the narrow ledge in front of the tunnel to the cavern of the ancients and from there sent a stream of mental abuse directly into the warriors tiny brain and im here he told the thing right here on the cliff you ugly son of all thats filthy you steaming issue of a cesspit the nightmare thing circled to the far side of the canyon but its eyes swivelled to focus on nathan it slipped below the rim of the cliffs turned inwards commenced a run on him this was how he would take the warrior out of the fight behind him the tunnel wouldnt take its bulk below him the others were free to engage the flyers and riders and they were engaging them gunfire and the shattering blast of a grenade a flyer shrilling like a baby lifting up on shredded blazing wings then crumpling back out of sight a grounded lieutenant or thrall yelling wamphyri wamph drowned out and changed by the obscene chatter of a machinepistol to a scream that jarred like syrup on a bad tooth the warrior came on and nathan took a long shot with his crossbow if he found his target it made no difference it was less than a pinprick to this thing how he hated the bastard his lips drew back from his teeth and his brain seemed to burn as he fell into a crouch his loathing was poison that must be out of him almost without knowing it he fired his mindbolt the warrior gurgled made a weird somehow questioning sound but kept coming except now it had a visible list to the left from below came the flash of a grenade which lit up the warriors prow nathan saw its forwardfacing eyes raw craters streaming bjood and brains and its jaws gaping open in a rictus of agony he could scarcely take it in as the thing tilted more yet swerved offcourse and instead of climbing to clear the rim dipped towards the floor of the ravine a moment later at seventy or eighty miles an hour it slammed into the sheer cliff and burst into a welter of flying chitin scales and crimson scrambled guts but nathan knew it had been dead before it hit from the moment hed lashed out with his killing eye as atwei zek and misha came running along the passage from the cavern of the ancients he went down to the oasis a riderless flyer limped off over the desert towards the distantly leering northstar and david chung was using up the last of his fuel on things that crackled and sent up black smoke as they burned but more flyers are on their way the locator said his fire dying even as he spoke and lan goodly gasped nathan you have work elsewhere will you be all right here nathan looked at the three yes trask answered especially if you take us up into that tunnel mouth before you go it looks easy to defend flyers cant land there and its more or less safe from warriors trask was wearing that curious speculative frown of his again and while were talking about warriors i no time for that now nathan shook his head later when i understand it better myself he took them up into the mouth of the tunnel and looking out anxiously over the ravine and oasis asked chung i dont suppose you can tell me where the next spearhead is atwei stepped forward i can the elders are passing messages up and down the line the psychic aether is full of them but of course the wamphyri hear them too and so our secret is out unless the vampires are stopped their bloodwars must now carry to us nathan took her arm but gently where will they strike strike i cant say they seem too few for a taskforce but theyre advancing on crackintherocks forty miles east when will they get there and how few any time now atwei told him her eyes huge and unblinking no more of them than were here there were a handful of szgany karl zestoss people at crackintherocks nathan knew he could move them out in one packet he might even leave them there if the thyre had boobytrapped the several narrow entrances crackintherocks would not need much defending he began to conjure a door paused to crush misha to him as she flew into his arms take care she told him breathlessly if anything happens to you ill never forgive you and then looking at him more closely did you get smoke in your eyes your right eye is bloodshot probably yes or a little dirt maybe he kissed her and over her shoulder looked at trask in time to see him begin frowning again but saving the moment goodly said nathan im coming with you another kiss for misha rough almost hurtful something to remember and then they were on their way in the mobius continuum nathan asked why did you come is it that close just that i saw that i would come goodlys mental shrug also if im with you youll be the first to know it if something extraordinary happens everything hinges on you nathan or on devetaki nathan answered i get the feeling shes setting me up almost certainly now that wrathstacks gone youre her biggest threat but how can she hope to trap me she cant fix me in one place long enough to do anything then logically she has to cover all places if i were her id station troops at all of your coordinates she doesnt know them all but if she makes you move often enough shell soon know an awful lot of them maybe she doesnt know your choices are well almost infinite they emerged from the mobius continuum at the geological fault which the thyre called crackintherocks in ages past great plates of bedrock had folded pushing up through lesser strata and deep desert sand to form granite outcrops beneath the earth in this place far underground the principal thyre watercourse called the great dark river flowed east through countless canals over eelinfested shallows of shattered bedrock under mighty arching ceilings of impervious stone that was where the thyre had their colony in caverns on the banks of the winding river nathan could have transferred directly into caves he remembered from his travels with the thyre but hed wanted to see the nature of the attackers and their numbers first there were just two of them flyers and riders still airborne in the great dark bowl of the sky where they blotted the stars in their crisscrossing but theyd sensed the swirl of nathans numbers vortex as he vacated the mobius continuum and so knew he was there a mentalist himself he sensed their telepathic transmission flash north reporting his presence so another of his coordinates was now known to them good let them thin themselves out even more as they attempted to cover all of them which was patently impossible but these were thoughts he kept to himself observers he said to goodly i doubt if theyll land theres nothing here for them earlier nathan had moved karl zestoss people here plus two of lardiss men armed with weapons of earth now without pause he took the precog down into the earth where first he checked that indeed the routes from the surface had been camouflaged and boobytrapped and that the thyre and the szgany zestos were as safe as possible from attack then he relieved one of lardiss men of his weapon a selfloading rifle and transferred out of the place and to be certain the vampires would know hed moved on he deliberately made a brief appearance on the surface before heading for placeofthebeastbones placeofthebeastbones was one of the few mistakes that nathan had made during an incredibly busy sunside evening now not necessarily too late he had realized the error also that going there at this time might possibly compound it that was a chance he must take the error was geographical and lay in the colonys location only thirtyeight miles southeast of the great pass well within devetakis reach worse as a surface settlement it was vulnerable to attack set in a stony desert depression the colony was housed in flatceilinged caverns in the walls of a canyon cut by the resurgent great dark river where the strata had been sluiced away by water action fossils of mighty prehistoric creatures were revealed hence the name of the place but in the canyon walls descending tiers of wide ledges would make ideal landing andor launching sites for flyers and warriors alike and there were no subsurface escape routes where the river plunged back into the earth again its course was an inhospitable unnavigable borehole possibly nathans earlier visitto deposit a small community of forestdwelling travellers here had been monitored by the wamphyri if not they would certainly know the location of the place now which meant that placeofthebeastbones was going to need defending which in turn meant a further series of dizzying mobiusjumps collecting armed men from other locations but as goodly pointed out along the way or you could have moved the thyre and the szgany out of there except that would make the place a wamphyri stronghold if or when they ever get to it but in actual fact i dont see that any of this does any harm j mean surely by now devetaki has got the message that she cant possibly cover all of your coordinates the more places you visit the thinner she has to spread her net or web and all the time the night is moving on towards morning and the big one that too and she i mean devetaki will be involved in it the very cause of it yes finally the job was done and nathan satisfied that he had put as many armed trained men into placeofthebeastbones as he could spare but as he and the precog stepped from the mobius continuum back into the cavern of the ancients he shook his head worriedly the wamphyri arent stupid he said especially devetaki shes got yefros and together theyre plotting something all thats happened so far is only a small part of a much greater scheme in the thyre mausoleum atwei trask and misha and the others were waiting for him now they could update him in person zek and i have managed to pinpoint devetaki and yefros chung told him excitedly shes directing all of this from a plateau over the great pass midway between sunside and starside large vampire contingents are en route to most of the thyre colonies but the bulk of them have put down on the rim of the forests zek added theyre maintaining their net formation and trask finished it covering as much territory as possible theres a lot of fighting in the sunside woods nathan all those travellers who didnt trust you to move them to safety meanwhile were here armed and dangerous and useless his voice was sour i know now how lardis felt suddenly the necroscope was desperate he simply couldnt be everywhere at the same time and he could see no end to it i have to draw their fire he said and lure them away from both the travellers in the forests and the thyre colonies but thats exactly what devetaki wants zek told him then lets give it to her nathan growled and his voice hardly seemed like his at all his blood was up now and behind his sore eyes his mind ached from the pressure of it all or from something else settlement goodly hissed staggering as his hand went to his brow it it will be settlement nathan bared his teeth and said well thats good enough for me thats where it all started more than three and a half years ago now let it finish there one way or the other andrei romani and anna marie english had come up from the subterranean colony pushing forward andrei said youre not leaving us out of this one indeed if its going to be settlement then a of the lidescis will want to be in on it there are caches of dimi petrescus powder there pitfalls warriortraps rockets we can put up a real fight trask grabbed goodlys arm settlement youre sure the precog nodded yes and trask said grimly all of us then and well need all the earthweapons you can get together nathan well be a focal point of resistance that the wamphyri cant resist there was nothing else to be said with the exception of misha and anna marie english who wanted to stay with the thyre nathan moved them to settlement then he collected the szgany lidesci from crater lake the szgany zestos from crackintherocks weapons from wherever he could find them what with all the explaining he must do en route it took the best part of two hours until he was sick and disoriented from it even the necroscope disoriented but by the time he was finished andrei romani already had everyone working at a frenzied pace in the shattered old town when finally the wamphyri came settlement would be ready for them hours passed reports reached nathan from the thyre the wamphyri had definitely stopped advancing on them across the nightdark desert it looked like their colonies were safe at least for tonight the vampires had not moved off entirely however but rested in the forest fringes where they met the savannas they were still within striking distance even now as for the bulk of devetakis forces david chung reported plenty of furtive movement mainly hidden under what trask had termed radio silence but as time went by so zek and chung began to piece together a picture of what was happening devetakis web was more truly webshaped now concentric semicircles of vampire elements flitting or spurting over the forests taking up planned positions and hemming settlement in where the old place nestled in the lee of the foothills other covert contingents had landed in the heights overlooking the town but vampire mists were not in evidence the virgin grandam kept her movements discreet as possible in the town itself discretion was flown to the wind the men couldnt be expected to work by starlight alone in what the old lidesci had long since transformed into a deadly trap for men and beasts alike andrei romani had lit fires literally beacon fires by which the men worked bombhurling ballistae and giant crossbows were back in working order fragileseeming rocketlaunching frameworks had been hauled into position where stockade walls had been destroyed men with amazing alien weapons patrolled equally treacherous catwalks atop swaying walls and nathan keogh called the necroscope was at an utter loss to explain why nothing was happening his nerves were on edge but nothing was happening settlement was full of people lit up brighter than at any time in four years it was surrounded by vampires and nothing was happening nathan called trask and the other espers together to ask them what in hell is or isnt going on why is devetaki waiting the twilight before the dawn is only seven hours away sunup in less than twelve hours time what is she doing the way her web is laid down she could hit us with one wave after another endlessly until eventually wed be overwhelmed what is she doing zek foener had the right answer keeping you guessing she said waiting for you to panic watching to see which way youll jump and shaking her web said trask trying to tangle you up or startle you into doing something against your better judgement maybe trying to force your hand the words had seemed to leap to his lips unbidden surprising even him nathan turned to him how forcing me how can she force me to do anything by not moving trask couldnt answer but suddenly the precog lan goodly was pale in the gouting firelight who said she isnt moving he said and his great wide eyes went outwards to the night in the next moment wamphyri radio silence was broken indeed shattered zek whose mind was wide open reeled from a sudden telepathic onslaught but not against her the vampires were simply talking to each other and their messages could scarcely be clearer ignore the szgany theyll keep but take the others the outsiders the talented ones they have weird weapons but their numbers are few and the harsh threatening sendings of some lesser lord you lieutenants you thralls success means glory but failure means death this last i can promise you and by my own hand wherefore you have everything to gain nothing to lose devetaki wants the necroscope and the female mentalist especially take them alive she wants me zek gasped and groped in a pocket for a lone bullet which shed placed there right from the beginning shed been the property of a lady once before but not a lady like the one who commanded this army nathan had heard the sendings too his mouth was dry as a hardbaked riverbed as he looked at zek trask the others from earth uppermost in his mind was a picture of ethloi the ancients diagram of a device to close the gates forever the saving of one world at least which meant the saving of trask and the others lives was imperative i have to take you he began but they were already crouching down taking up positions spreading out and david chungs warning a malediction in the suddenly electric atmosphere as a mist rolled down from the foothills and swirled in through gaps in the battered stockade and the air grew heavy and a growing rumble of thunder which wasnt thunder sounded from the forests and mountains here they come the gate on starside the thought was like a brand burning in nathans brain he had to get his friends to the gate and now in one sense the necroscope felt like a traitor the thought of leaving the szgany zestos and the lidescis to battle on alone but in another there was the chance it would have the beneficial sideeffect of diverting the attack for right now devetaki wasnt much concerned with common travellers it was nathan zek and the other alien talents that she wanted to recruit also nathan himself wasnt going not very far anyway and not for long he would be back just as soon as he saw the others through the gate except even as he worked it out they were scrambling for previously arranged vantage points then to further distract him a warrior crashed down from a suddenly leaden sky on top of a ramshackle structure that only roughly resembled a house obviously this creature had instructions to destroy any szgany refuges its furious bellowing turned to roars of agony as the flimsy shell collapsed pitching it into the pit waiting below where it impaled itself on sharp sixfoot stakes gasbladders burst and released their stench the doomed creatures propulsors fired sporadically and sputtered into silence some brave traveller loped forward hurled a torch that spun end over end like a ring of fire before falling directly into the pit amid a chaos of tortured vampire flesh and splintered timbers the ensuing blast hurled the necroscope from his feet but he was up again in a moment a flyer came pulsing over leaning stockade walls its lieutenant riders visage was the leering bloodlusting mask of a primal beast where he leaned forward in his saddle swinging a bolas of vicious hooks and seeking victims zek was halfway across a rubblestrewn square the lieutenant saw her and his jaws gaped wider yet in nightmarish anticipation as he swerved his mount in her direction skimming lower the beast arched airtrap wings its bellypouch yawned open no nathan sent directly into the lieutenants mind feral eyes glanced his way opened wide were immediately trapped by his eyes and no you fucking dont the necroscope told him crouching down and unleashing his mindbolt still seeking a place to hide a hole in the ground any scrap of cover zek saw it happen saw the lieutenant cave in as if crushed by a giant hand saw scarlet gush from ears eyes mouth saw his head compress into his chest and his upper torso into his lower body before he was swatted like a fly sideways from his saddle but the flyer came on she twisted the fins on a grenade and forced herself to stand tall stand still and wait the flyers bellypouch was zeroed on the middle of zeks body there were only inches to spare between the lip of the pouch and the lapping white lake of the vampire groundmist zek lobbed her grenade and threw herself flat the flyer scooped at empty air then closed its pouch and rotated its manta wings for elevation it passed over zek climbing into the reeking air and pressured smoke jetted like steam from the scalloped gash of the flyers pouch in the splitsecond before internal lightning gutted the creature driving lances of fire and shards of steel up through its spine its rubbery neck slumped at once its mighty manta wings began to fold upwards collapsing like a pack of cards it drifted on rapidly losing height as it disappeared in mist and distance by which time nathan was at zeks side looking this way and that to locate the others and by then too the night was alive with the throb of propulsors dark with the pulsing shadows of flyers shocked to full awful awareness by the urgent shouting of men the stutter and cough of automatic weapons trask had seen the incident with zek the flyer and rider to hell with his position on the stockade wall with his heart in his mouth he came running as behind him that section of the great fence buckled and fell inwards and the ugly shape of a warrior was silhouetted against the misted forest its pincers and stabbers all mobile as it prepared to launch itself upon settlements defenders rockets were hastily aimed and fired travellers tossed grenades a burst of automatic fire ripped into exploding gasbladders before the heat of a rockets exhaust turned the monster into a raging inferno a moment later and goodly stumbled out of the smoke and stench with david chung close behind i knew it was time and that you wanted us he shouted at nathan david knew where to find you nathan took them with him through a mobius door just forty paces to where andreis men worked at a battery of four makeshift rockets when youve finished with those he told them try these retaining zeks machinepistol and the grenades in their pockets the five dumped the rest of their alien weapons and ammunition on the ground where trask and his colleagues were going they wouldnt be needing them any more that was the idea anyway then nathan took them to starside checking his coordinates the necroscope got them as close to the gate as possible maybe fortyfive yards northwest of the low crater wall and its core of white light like the shining eye of some blinded paralysed cyclops gazing upwards into the starside sky the weird interference of the gate amplified by its proximity to the natural gate at the bottom of the crater was stronger far than that of its perchorsk twin nathans mobius door writhed like a snake threatening to warp back out of existence as he hastily guided his charges out on to the barren boulder plains if hed tried to get any closer than this he knew there would have been a problem what he didnt yet know was that he and his friends had a problem anyway without pause as they cleared the door zek trask chung and goodly crouched down and went running towards the blinding hemisphere of cold light caught up in the urgency of the moment nathan ran with them he was intent on seeing them safely on their way zek and lan to romania trask and chung to perchorsk perhaps too intent and perhaps too all of the action back in settlement had glutted their sensibilites blunted their natural talents clumps of boulders silhouetted in dazzle from the gate appeared as concentric rings of menhirs going out across starside towards the northern auroras also to east and west and south to the foothills and barrier mountains facing the gate the rocky terrain reflected its brilliance by contrast away from the gate the shadows of these boulder clumps were etched as sharp as knives and black as pitch ideal hidingplaces as zek and goodly could testify and not only for men after a handful of long loping paces the group passed between two such clusters and at once sensed the shadows moving there it was very much a group thing a sudden shared awareness a sensation of intense danger in actuality it was the relaxation of massed vampire minds the opening of channels of communication the springing of the trap vi the big one goodlys ahhh was all the warning they got as in the precogs mind jesus of course she knew that nathans choices were infinite alexei yeros had told her as much thats why she had to narrow his choices down and bring him here to the gate nathan was thinking just one thought one word trapped zek and chung too their talents likewise springing to the fore as the ambushers lifted their radio silence zeks mentalism the telepathic aether vibrant with the presence of monstrous minds chungs lodestone skill locating the source of the threat and discovering it all around them as they came to a startled stumbling halt trask saw the truth written on all their faces and gasped the clever bitch she made us jump from the fat into the fire better than that the necroscope told him she knows its the one place i cant jump back out of not this close to the gate and now nathan understood the reasoning behind devetakis small detachments in the starside foothills these were the same men their mission to disperse the grey brothers into the heights then to deploy here keep silent wait he looked back the way they had come between the boulder clumps and saw figures moving languidly even tauntingly into view out of the shadows a bulky lieutenant well over six feet in height and two male thralls all three of them wearing murderous gauntlets and from rocky hiding places all around more vampires appearing very sure of themselves unhurriedly moving closer the lieutenant was a mentalist zek and nathans eyes met in grim acknowledgement as they heard his thoughts fly south we have them my lady and devetakis answer i know well done hold them there im on my way the perchorsk gate trask snapped youve used it one way nathan but only one way so you can use it again you can come with david and me through into perchorsk breaking into a run the five made for the crater wall and again skidded to a halt they were cut off vampires were emerging from the magma ss wormholes all around the gate where they had been waiting in ambush two concentric rings of vampires and the five caught between them nathan was frustrated afraid angry his eyes were burning in his face hurting him with their stored energy all of you get behind me he said dont look at my face the unaccustomed ugly tone of his voice its threatening quality caused them to obey at once behind him the four formed a small circle facing outwards trask took zeks weapon and switched it to short burst the familiar chching rang loud in the unnaturally quiet night as he cocked it zek passed him a spare magazine which he pocketed sure that hed be able to use it the trouble was that it took too many bullets to knock these bastards down and even then they wouldnt stay down in front towards the gate a row of vampires mainly thralls were up out of their magmass wormholes others were still emerging behind among the scattered rocks the night was alive with sinuous motion and the gleam of feral eyes the nearest of them was less than fortyfive feet away and their numbers were far too many but nathan had the answer to that beware he told them sounding more like one of them now my eyes contain the power of life and death it was no idle boast oh really said the lieutenant with an oily glutinous chuckle yet here we stand untouched powers you surely have we are all witness to that but you are not the longdead eygor killglance nor his cowardly bloodson spiro the lieutenant was in command here swat him and the rest would be a rabble they might panic attack en masse overwhelm by sheer weight of numbers but show him something unpleasant give him an example teach him a lesson nathan crouched down and concentrated his hatred into his eyes his face became a tortured mask his lips drew back from his teeth he glanced at the thralls to left and right of the lieutenant hurled two bolts in rapid succession and snarled die then and they did the one on the left threw wide his arms and opened his mouth to scream but only blood emerged as his skull caved in driving his brains out forcefully through eyes and ears and the one on the right coughed a single unintelligible word then staggered hands fluttering like trapped birds his body vibrated his ribs and spine making audible crackling sounds as bones shivered into shards finally he crumpled shuddering to earth like a lightningstruck tree and nathan jiked it there he said his hideous face split by an even more hideous grin but in the next moment necroscope bring me up now your promise do it now necroscope for the fiend magjore has broken into my pit no said nathan while still his intelligence was his own this eye of yours is a power its true but its also a nightmare which you knew when you gave it to me so stay in your pit eygor for after all its the best pjace for you what all of this in the necroscopes metaphysical mind while in the physical world the vampires were slipping back into their magmass wormholes the lieutenant was loping for cover thralls were scattering under the hot gaze of a man who was suddenly a monster from behind a clump of boulders briefly a target appeared a thrall who whirled a bolas over his head nathan was too late to catch him in the act the man ducked back out of sight his hurled weapon came whipping through the air towards the group of humans goodly cried his pain before the bolas hit him the thing had three vicious sixinch razorsharp hooks two of them clanged together catching harmlessly in the precogs clothing the third whirled around him and hooked itself through his trousers into his inner right thigh goodly went down yelping the blurred glint of more bolas a man stepped from cover to release his weapon nathan struck at him with his killing eye but nothing happened i take it back eygor told him i take back my eye liar cheat you have robbed me of my vengeance robbed even a dead thing of his one tomb however inglorious for maglore shaji give me many tombs and all of them depleting me his men are into my pit even now youve doomed me who did you no harm vampires were creeping back out of their wormholes their rockpile hiding places trasks machinepistol came coughing alive in short staccato bursts three thralls howled as they were knocked backwards disappearing below the smooth rims of their chutelike refuges perhaps they would slip all the way to the bottom shoot into the subterranean gate and end their days as dripstone fossils in a carpathian foothills cavern then abruptly the chatter of the machinepistol came to a halt trask swore as he tossed aside the empty magazine and slapped a new one the last one into its housing and the necroscope knew that he must have eygors eye give it back when you bring me up but its now or never necroscope for they are on me and they will break me in pieces coil me up now or its the end of you and of meeeee damn you nathan ground his teeth damn your black heart to hell very well then hear me now eygor killglance i command you come up from the dead be alive mobile in the world of the living and return to me your eye and so be it said the other his lunatic laughter ringing out through all the deadspeak aether and in madmanse in turgosheim the runemage maglore leaned on the shallow wall of an ancient refuse pit amid the piled rubble of excavation and called down well how goes it for just a moment ago thered come a lull in the murmur of excited voices reaching up from the reeking gloom where his thralls had discovered the incredible fossil the gigantic amalgam that was eygor killglance do you not hear me maglore raised his voice i asked what have you discov at which point he paused openmouthed in the middle of a word as a vast sigh went up or was sent up by a mighty monstrous mind into his mind in that selfsame moment maglore knew even before the previous babble of thrall voices became a ripple of horror and the ripple an uproar and the uproar a mad scramble for the dozen ropes that hung down into the pit for suddenly there was mist down there in that mausoleum pit where no mist should be a cold cold mist that writhed up into the shaft even to maglore at the rim he felt it and felt what was in it faces appeared the faces of men coming faster up the ropes than ever theyd gone down gasping men panting men not screaming but saving their breath for climbing as they fled the nightmare that was eygor maglore breathed snatching himself back from the low wall aware that his limbs had turned to rubber and maglooore came the answer what and do you dare invade me in my own manse maglore sounds from below a strenuous grunting a squelching the crunch of ancient bones under some monstrous weight the mist grew thick where it swirled from the pit the ropes went taught stretched snapped at the rim all save one the last of maglores thralls reached up a hand to him gasping master he lives he uh then his eyes went wide his rope also parted he was gone eygors mist swirled where he had been and maglore likewise gone gone in a trice from the rim of the pit gone up through haunted madmanse into runemanse where he called where he shrieked and gibbered for his lieutenants his men and monsters and ordered them down into madmanse in a body to do battle with the dead and alive and undead thing that was eygor killglance but ah no not yet my friend eygor told him ill not be coming for you just yet live awhile maglore and see what i learned down here in the bowels of the rock about the fusion of disparate things and the skills of artistic creation no no dont think it i would not put you apart from the world nor even apart from me instead i shall make you a part of me watch me if you will maglore if you dare while i put on flesh in the gorge of turgosheim eygor had already put on flesh in his pit the flesh of maglores thralls but how in what way what manner of thing was he now maglore went to a window to peer down with seers eyes through the fogs and reek into the gloomy gulf turgosheim all of its creatures in all its manses were maglores now except eygor but then who would want eygor and the seerlord shuddered even lord maglore of the wamphyri shuddering at the thought of the fate of his thralls in that pit and shuddered again at the thought of what by now had surely come up out of that pit then down in the bottoms what a resurgence maglore saw it he sensed it an outflowing certainly an exudation a spewing out like pus from a boil from the lower levels of madmanse down its ramps and through its gantlets into the scree and rubble of the bottoms good for several of maglores warriors prowled down there set loose in the bed of the gorge to keep him safe because they were his he knew their minds and could follow their progress as they too sensed this eruption and rushed to investigate he was with three of them well in part given the limited capacity of their minds as they came upon this strange new force this swiftflowing thing with them aye as one by one they blinked out or became one with it what was it eygor had talked about the putting on of flesh and the fusion of disparate things and what had he threatened i shall make you a part of me what the absorption of creatures even men within himself all vampires were eaters of life indeed the blood is the life but this was something else maglores throat was dry perhaps he was mistaken he must try again to penetrate the mists and reach his monsters minds he did and met a different sort of monster ah no dont be in such a hurry maglore the thing told him your turn soon enough the creature this loathsome flowing mass was now at the gates of the squat square gargoyle hump of trollmanse lorn halfstrucks place or what had been his place on the bed of the gorge now its inhabitants were lieutenants and thralls of maglores indeed his man karpath was there in residence caretaker master of a manse of his own at last or until the seerlord deemed otherwise or until something else deemed otherwise and maglore sent directly into karpaths mind beware a thing approaches across the bottoms it is at your gates even now the answer came at once lord there are no gates they are fallen and i have seen this thing trollmanse too must fall it cannot stand maglore stood aghast karpath listen to me do as i too late said the other his faint unequal mental voice a groan then silence a vacuum which swelled at once into an obscene chuckle eygors of course enough maglore no longer felt safe in his own manse such a horror as this loose in turgosheim and the seerlord knew who to blame that sapless freak nathan except he wasnt sapless but a power and such a power maglores dreadful premonitions multiplied themselves tenfold even as eygor killglance was at this very moment putting on flesh and multiplying himself hurrying to his landingbay maglore bumped into orlea my lord what is it the ladys eyes were wide she felt the terror in him in this place in all turgosheim he thrust her aside she must take her chances with the rest ive this and that to do he said dont bother me now theres oh i dont know some small trouble below in the bottoms he did indeed have things to do saddle a flyer fly deep into the gorge see how the nightmare progressed its rate of acceleration he should visit the highter spires and manses advise their barricading their defences could they be defended could anything be protected if not he must flee west and report this invasionfromwithin to whoever commanded whatever was left of vormulacs army one thing for certain the thingthathadbeeneygor could not follow him there over the great red waste and no one in the west knew of his treachery perhaps he should not even delay to inspect the bottoms but go there now far into wrathas land of milk and blood and honey in the west except he couldnt set out tonight dawn was too close he must fly to the western extreme of the range and find a place to hide during the long day then set off west at sundown so great was maglores terror of eygor killglance he was in such a hurry so preoccupied with his problems that he scarcely noted that a mount was waiting in the landingbay unattended saddled and ready for flight climbing into a saddle that he hadnt seen for years he gave the silent nodding beast only a cursory glance then dug in his heels urging the creature to flight but airborne when he would descend the flyer ascended it gained altitude cleared the rim and rose up on turgosheims queasy thermals now what in the name of down he demanded skim the bottoms will observe except so maglore i have you at last karz told him an almost electric shock to the seerlords system you who having made a man into a monster never trusted to climb upon his back and with good reason he stalled tilted commenced a nosedive into the gorge but i have seen what is happening here and it suits my purpose admirably for now i make a monster out of you maglore clung on for dear life or grim death drained by fear he knew he wasnt up to metamorphosis he didnt have the energy to change his shape to an airfoil and fly not a physical sort by wamphyri standards hed only rarely used the art and then in his youth karz biteri oncehistorian to the wamphyri maglore choked the words out loud they were whipped away by dark wind and dank fog below the humped gargoyle bottoms took on shape through the wreathing mists also a mobile halfacre of horror that rumbled over the bed of the gorge full of terrible intent it was composed of many things none of them clean healthy or alive in the truest sense of the word debris of longdead warriors flesh of men the undying mind of the maniac eygor karz was done with this world but at least he was avenged he flew straight for the centre of the mobile thing feeling only a momentary horror when it pulsed and turned its many eyes upwards to him and sent the flung spume and froth of its tossing to meet and engulf him also to engulf his oncemaster empty now of thoughts and words runes sigils and symbols plunged to his death in a moment and blended with filth and oblivion while thousands of miles to the west at the starside gate the necroscope and his charges had taken temporary refuge in a shallow depression with a hard earth rim and a low wall of stones what cover they had protected them from hurled wamphyri weapons the vampires must step out into the open to direct and release their bolas whenever this happened either nathan with his killing eye or trask with his machinepistol would cut them down trask was low on bullets the only advantage of nathans weapon was that its results were permanent is that what i felt when i woke you up trask asked him the necroscope glanced at him with a face that was now totally alien shrivelled and hateful even luminous with evil power yes it was instinct in me as it is in eygor killglance trask didnt understand that last so said nothing but zek read nathan like a book she squeezed his arm where he crouched beside her in the hole she knew what he feared that the eyes influence would be too strong for him that having resisted all else life in the vampire world could throw at him finally hed succumb to this youre stronger than that she whispered oh he didnt look at her but his voice was a low purr a rumble a growl yes for you have your fathers strength zek knew she was right to believe it after all like harry before him nathan had saved her life the precog lan goodly did nothing said nothing did his best not to feel the agony of the great barbed tine in his thigh it couldnt be removed here zek had wrapped it with strips of cloth from her skirt amazingly shed stopped the worst of the bleeding while david chung comforted him the precog could only grit his teeth and wait for the big one nodding feeling faint his head swaying he groaned it out loud the big one coming what chung couldnt believe his ears do you mean this isnt it the tumbling moon had come up silver bloated it floated well above the horizon its full face told mockingly of a sunup that was still six or seven hours away but the moon itself its strange eccentric orbit told more than that to nathan if to no one else so close to the gate trapped here between two camps of vampires unable or not daring to make use of the mobius continuum and vulnerable to viciously cruel weapons if he should try to make a break for it in either direction which was out of the question anyway because of goodly the necroscope had found time to think rather his intuitive maths both physical and metaphysical had been at work within him before hed often wondered at the weird physical properties of his vampire world where some of the universal laws hed discovered in trasks world didnt seem to work or where they had been bent out of shape by the advent of an immemorial white sun that fell out of the sky and buried itself in the bottom of a crater the original gate and hed likened the worlds wobble to that of an illbalanced bolas whose connecting rope had stiffened to a bar of unbreakable metal the maths of the thing was now clear in his mind he simply knew it without knowing what to do with it or even if there was anything he could do with it knowing that it takes twelve thousand bricks to build a house doesnt get it built knowing that e me isnt enough in itself to create a brief but very destructive star in your garden on the other hand how often had he been told numbers dont do anything they simply are time and again by everyone from the mainly innumerate desertdwelling thyre to a highly sophisticated earth mathematician and he was the living proof that all of them were wrong which was why now as once before he wondered what would happen if he conjured a door so strong it challenged the alien immutable gravitational force of the gate or gates if he were to make one of his usual mobius doors in the immediate vicinity of the gate it would tremble collapse and get sucked into the gate or hurled away from it in all probability he and his friends would go with it perhaps into a place where life simply couldnt exist two magnets their like poles facing each other pushed or held apart by equal forces but if they were driven towards each other there must come a point when something had to give the necroscope decided to try an experiment at the moment nothing was happening had been happening ever since they took cover here the vampires seemed happy enough simply to harrass them hold them in situ make them keep their heads down but that was selfexplanatory these creatures hemming nathan and the others in knew better now than to show themselves too frequently the fugitives had been in possession of a handful of grenades which they had used unfortunately less than effectively but there were fresh blast marks around several of the wormholes near the gate and there must have been some damage at least in the surrounding boulder clumps also there was no urgency on the part of the ambushers now no need to take any further action devetaki skullguise wanted these fugitives alive and she would soon be here her main forces were pulling out of sunside all heading for wrathstack david chung was able to guarantee that last the siege of settlement had been lifted and the fighting stopped there was no profit wasting good flesh and effort now that the birds were flown especially since theyd flown into the trap sunup was still a long way off but the vampires knew it was coming and would feel a lot safer starside of the barrier mountains so nathan had time on his hands however little he let his numbers vortex swarm free to surround his mind with a maelstrom of onceesoteric equations except of course they were no longer secret to him only call them down onto the computer screen of his brain he could decipher all of them in as much time as it takes to tell but even the vortex warped away from the gates influence disturbed by its proximity the physical affecting the metaphysical but if the metaphysical were stronger could it affect even overpower the physical certainly hadnt the necroscope proved it every time hed travelled in the continuum the mathematics of the problem was right there waiting for him to unravel it but at a time and in a place like this why even bother it was partly instinct intuition but more than that it was what the thyre had told him and what goodly had corroborated in fact and if it worked it was the big one the very very big one the correction of a disordered world which had gone wrong when an alien body mutated to a dimensional singularity and fell on starside again he thought of what thikkoul and others of the dead thyre ancients had told him remembering the way thikkoul had expressed what to the ancient was an unthinkable concept instead of the moon the sun the stars in their eternal revolutions i feel this very earth itself moving leaning towards the sun and the turning of the world nathan stars moving in the night sky from south to north with the turning of the earth also what goodly had said when nathan had asked him when the big one was scheduled night or day hed answered that it would happen in the night and in the morning was there a clue there of course there was nathans numbers proved it he held the equations steady on the screen of his mind and followed them through saw their solution and knew its truth except his mind simply wasnt big enough wasnt strong enough he knew the number of bricks it would take to build his house but he had no mortar unless the mortar of his anger and the strength of eygors evil eye and and our strength zeks hand closed over his where it was clenched trembling our combined strength he knew what she meant hed heard the idea broached back at ebranch hq in her world in times of extreme danger the joining of esp talents into one superesp identity one power could his friends provide the extra bit of mortar that he needed to hold his bricks together all of their metaphysical energy together against the gate the moon was fully up now and borne on a wind from the northeast came a tumult of sound thunderous music and an indescribably mournful howling it was like an omen on the necroscopes decision or maybe a warning of devetakis imminent arrival shes almost through the pass chung gasped fifteen minutes at the outside nathan quickly explained what he would do but he needed their help the immovable centre of gravity at the core of the world would be his fulcrum the invisible unbendable force it exerted on the gate would be his lever effort would come from the combined energy of their minds concentrated upon the most powerful door hed ever conjured and the task would be to turn a world correct its eccentricity make the stars move through the sky and turn a night into morning they didnt understand but neither did they question him as they stood up and linked arms and glared back at the glaring gate through narrowed eyes all of them with the exception of trask who must mind their backs while they worked watchful he stayed down between their legs weighing his precious magazine and wondering how many bullets were left in it then forgetting to wonder anything as the necroscope fortified his numbers vortex and conjured his mobius door now nathan said as the thing warped and fluttered and rippled like water in his mind they held and glared chewed their lips and weighed their minds against the weight of the gate and held and the door held with them it shaped up it glowed with the energy of their combined effort it was visible for the first time ever people who were not of the necroscope harry keoghs flesh saw a mobius door a hole in nothing going nowhere and everywhere but it fluttered like a flag it must collapse at any moment or be hurled away or be shredded and drawn into the gate but it didnt and it wasnt for nathan held it with his mind and eygors eye the most powerful combination of wills to ever exist in the vampire world and hold it nathan husked hold it and yes goodly gasped the single word yes and a black cloud in the heights over the pass trask said then cloud nothing it has to be devetaki the ruination of everything if she should get here first it galvanized the necroscope to greater effort and as trasks machinepistol barked a single shot and barked again nathan groaned push we have to do more than just hold it so push and yes said goodly yes trask thought he felt the ground trembling under his feet where he kneeled but nothing was happening nathans metaphysical door had firmed up and shone and shimmered like a fiery portal but that was all the energy the four were burning made the air hum but nothing had changed trask groaned saw motion in the corner of his eye the glitter of a whirling bolas snapped off a shot and brought the thrall down before he could release his weapon but a moment later and trask saw a different kind of motion an impossible kind of motion the moon performing a slow curve across the sky not its weird orbit but a curve from south to north jesus trask sobbed raggedly the breath catching in his throat as a wild wind blew out of nowhere tugging at his hair oh sweet jesus the very vault of the heavens seemed to be moving the icechip northstar was receding over the last great aerie of the wamphyri the rest of the stars were following on behind uniformly marching south to north across the sky push nathans voice was a whisper yes goodlys too my god my god zek heard the moaning of the wind and the moaning of a hundred vampire voices in her head the world was turning and a far faint flush limned the high peaks of the barrier mountains then through all the telepathic tumult of fearful vampire moanings one voice sounding loud and shrill with the realization of what was happening and who was making it happen devetaki skullguise commanding kilj them do it now beore they doom us each and every one and up out of the magmass wormholes came five feraleyed thralls and out from behind the boulders stepped the lieutenant and others of the ambush crew trask knew he couldnt possibly have more than three or four rounds left but hed make every one of them count he would have to for nathan was out of it and must continue confronting the gate with his irresistible door and the world continued to turn the wind to howl the thunderous music from wrathstack to blare like the trumpets of hell the whirl of a bolas crack and a thrall leaking brains from a hole between his eyes went toppling another bolas crack trask took his eye out the lieutenant came loping ducking weaving he wore a gauntlet crack the man spun round in a complete circle his eyes went to the scarletpumping hole in his shoulder he kept coming crack he was knocked over backwards flipped from his shoulders where they hit the dirt came springing to his feet crack and this one took him in the heart which finally swatted him the five thralls were closing from the direction of the gate seeing trask aiming at them they crouched low spread out came zigzagging towards the fugitives one of them made a sideways leap when he saw trask lining up his sights somehow he got between the gate and nathans door his body was illumined in a golden glow for a splitsecond like a flash of lightning before he disintegrated like a sheet of paper in a shredder he was there and he was gone disrupted vanished without trace the others came on trask squeezed the trigger the bolt flew forward and nothing zek touched trasks head managed to grin at him even through her tears as she passed something down to him her bullet fuck it she said he yanked back the bolt pushed the bullet home with his thumb looked at her his heart was in his mouth the vampires from the wormholes were coming one of them started to swing his bolas and trask didnt think twice crack the man went down spraying red half a mile away towards the pass the sky had turned black with flyers devetaki but the world was still turning the wind still howling the defenders of two universes still standing to the end except this was the end surely but if so why had the vampires from the magmass stopped advancing what was that look on their faces what could it mean trask glanced behind and saw what it meant that the dead of starside werent about to let this happen not to the necroscope nathan keogh trasks jaw fell open the vampires from the rockpiles were fighting with dead men with mummified pieces of men with the desiccated debris of men it was a rebellion of the dead against that which must never be the destruction of their one champion in the world of the living the teeming dead not called up but come up of their own accord all of the countless szgany who over a thousand years had trudged the dreary road to the aeries of the wamphyri and never made it suffering the true death out here on these barren boulder plains all the victims of vampire bloodwars long forgotten by the leaning menhirs of starside all the ragged scraps and dust of men long gone knowing that they must come up to a semblance of life at least else life itself had not been worth it jason lidesci was their leader albeit a slender lich he was a true lidesci to the end but there were many others the necroscope had never known glina berea was among them who in her time had vowed vengeance on nestor and now fought for his brother oh their names were legion which they sang to nathan like a battlecry even knowing that he couldnt answer for he was engaged in a battle of his own as for the vampires the blinding dust of dead men was in their eyes choking dust in their nostrils throats ears and they knew how unequal was the battle because dead men cant die twice but devetaki and hers did not know that not yet all she knew was that the world was turning the peaks of the barrier mountains gleamed golden in her wake and the furnace sun was rising like a great blazing meteor to fry her eyes and scorch her undead bones ahead of the rest she came swooping over and through and around the glare of the gate driving her mount in what was very nearly a suicide dive right at the group of aliens in the shallow depression nathan saw her coming and his gaze his mind his strength was diverted from the glowing mobius door which at once collapsed there was nothing he could do about it he couldnt concentrate on two problems at the same time and devetaki was now the most immediate threat he went into his killing crouch and glared doom and destruction at the lady her flyer alexei yefros where the russian locator hung on behind her the merest pulse of his former power there was little of strength in it fuelling the door had drained him to the dregs still his mindbolt was not entirely without effect devetaki gave a small choking cry yanked on the reins to haul back her mounts head climbed up up into a sky no longer black where now the stars were the merest flecks of flickering light and yet a sky blacker than the blackest night to devetaki for she was blind blind her eyes ruined yet she saw quite clearly saw that it was the end sensed cessation felt finality as her soaring blinded beast lofted her into sighing searing sunlight ahhh devetaki herself sighed wonderingly groped for her scowling mask didnt quite make it and at last the pain the rapid devolution a drift of smoke and slow silent rain of smouldering ashes along with a faster rain of leaden trappings leather iron and a few charred bones alexei yefros not long a vampire fell with the saddle shrieking until he hit then lying still the sun would do the rest the sun for it had risen on starside and despite that nathans door was no more it was still rising and the moon a strange pale orb where it hung in the sky no longer tumbling and in the north wrathstack a golden finger pointing toward a glorious future or perhaps at the northstar more properly a north star now a blink of silver against faded auroras the dawn had happened first and fastest of course sunside of the barrier mountains it had come as something of a surprise to say the least not least to the lady ursula torspawn standing a discreet distance from her funeral pyre lardis lidesci wondered very briefly who shed been then put her out of his mind forever shed been wamphyri definitely else at the end thered been much less of a commotion in fact nothing had gone right for ursula earlier shed taken up with a party of exsupplicant szgany and trembling in every beautiful limb she had told how she was the lone survivor of a family group slaughtered by the wamphyri that had been several hours ago shortly after the party itself had survived an attack which made ursulas story doubly acceptable if she had known it at the time however she might have tried her luck elsewhere the skirmish had made these peopleextra vigilant they clung together shed not had a chance to lure anyone away and tend to her needs whats more these were the folk that lardis lidesci and kirk lisescu were helping and lardiss reputation in respect of vampires had been hardearned still it was a credit to the old lidescis powers of observation that in those weird moments as the stars commenced their march across the sky and the horizon was suddenly aglow with a dawn all of six hours early he had noticed something strange about one lone lovely woman then as shed made casually away lardis had asked the young leader of the group who is she and his tone of voice had been such that the other had forgotten for a moment the miracle that was taking place to blurt a stranger a survivor what does it matter shes a girl wholl breed children to replace the many weve lost or given away aye and a curse on our cowardly leaders for that and she came to you as you see her now unmarked clean and in good clothes aye what of it at which lardiss eyes had narrowed and hed signalled to kirk lisescu her bells make no sound bells decorations that make pretty noises man we were supplicants we wore no silver but she does except her bells dont ring because they arent silver theyre lead kirk that last loudly explosively so that ursula would hear him she did and knew that it was all up the sun was rising in the night and she was in the camp of the enemy then the dark of ursulas eyes turning red and a spontaneous eruption of dagger teeth as the gape of her jaws yawned open to house them kirk lisescu had put three shots into her as she turned to run but still shed made it halfway up a hillside before the sun caught up with her aye and a hell of an uproar then for she had been a vampire for oh for a long time when most of the din was over theyd tossed branches over what was left and torched the lot it was much the same for paxton caught in the suns golden net halfway back to starside in a broad section of the great pass where sunlight never penetrated before the same but it could have been worse for paxton was a very recent convert and it might have taken a lot longer at first he had felt the furnace heat on his back the way his hair grew hot the stretching and splitting of skin already torn from digging his way out of the collapsed cave the sudden and rapid blistering of his ears and neck then without thinking what he was doing as if the seething golden stain crawling through the bed of the pass wasnt evidence enough hed turned to see what was wrong a moment later hed been blind and all the skin peeling from his eyeballs then his screaming and tottering to and fro the heat of his body turning the space inside his clothes to a furnace his flesh beginning to broil but moving blindly in and out of shadowed areas it might easily have lasted for hours if he hadnt got his ankle trapped between boulders and broken it so that he flopped there in full sunlight and that way it had been easy on him his unbearable agony put an end to him by the time the sun moved on a little the shadows found his clothing stuck to the rocks with black tar gluey hands with some bones showing through protruded from the frayed cuffs of his combatsuit in wrathstack wratha had seen the sun come up so swift shed known she was insane which of course she was her crazed cackling was now at an end however her cage swung on high almost empty its silverlattice floor dribbling a reeking oily substance into the abyss on the south face of the stack scorch marks and a few puffs of smoke were all that remained of the mangemanse siege while the last scrap or two of bubbling smouldering devolving matter went spiralling down to the bloodsoaked scree and rubble slopes and yet while still the sun rose up and its light cut deeper yet searing all down the length of the last aerie the bonesong from wrathstacks dark side continued for the doglord canker had witnessed a wonder and knew that he canker canison was its author the moonpriests were so afraid of him that the lunar orb itself had turned pale cankers throat was raw but his song was at an end now he could fly to the moon to claim her for his own deaf and bleeding from his ears canker went stumbling to find the lady siggi and say a fond farewell and tell her that soon he would return with all her silver sisters and he knew where to find her she was bringing on the hatchlings in the cave of spiders normally turkur tzonovs screams would have led canker to siggi at play but he no longer heard them stumbling and moaning he heardnothing but his bonesong despite that he was not playing and siggi poor siggi would she even know him it seemed unlikely for she had bathed in his light too long and was no longer sensitive to mundane things while canker he was too sensitive by far and his head hurt and his ears and the singing the singing it seemed the stack itself was swaying as if his playing had shaken the foundations or the great fang itself danced to the tune in cankers head and now the sun was fully up standing higher in the sky than ever before and its rays lit on all starside but canker in the dark of his manse couldnt know it or that golden rays were even now eating into the very heart of rock that had known the horror of ages the works and working of vampire lords the harrowing and hollowing of unhallowed hands all the shocks the stack had taken the centuries of tunnelling and endless whittling of wamphyri inhabitants explosive heat of fires and blast of alien bombs and last but by no means least the thunder of the doglords songs all it had needed was a push albeit the push of a giant the shifting of the earth causing the stack to rock and the great destroyer sun burning out every last trace of evil vampire influence until the rock itself was calcined and now the pull of a moon in a strange new orbit it was all too much wrathstack went down in rubble rot and ruin crumbling as it toppled its various levels splitting apart and crashing down onto the the shuddering boulder plains adding its terrible tonnage to all the tumuli of olden stacks gone before at last there was no last aerie earlier in turgosheim spiro killglance had left his second mount spreadeagled on the rim of the gorge utterly exhausted from its flight while he descended first into promontory runemanse looking for maglore then into madmanse but the aeries were empty the gorge itself seemed devoid of life and even undeath nothing stirred in that haunted old place haunted aye by spiros demented father eygor oh how spiro had feared that old devil upon a time but no more now indeed he felt grateful what but he had inherited the cruel old bastards evil eye and even the seerlord maglore was in hiding from him laughing and hearing the echoes reverberate away and back he went to the choked refuse pit where he and wran had trapped their father after they had blinded him he went there and found the pit dug out and the silence of the place unnatural breathless and nothing exactly the way spiro remembered it as suddenly what little light there had been began to dim but how there were no curtains at the windows in the perimeter rooms and no one to draw them if there had been and the stone floors rubbery under spiros feet and the walls and dripstone columns feeling damp slimy even sweaty to his touch like raw meat but stone doesnt beat like a great heart or pulse and shudder when you touch it the light continued to dim spiro ran on trembling legs from room to unremembered room breathing stale air that tasted already breathed looking for the source of the darkness to discover who it was that slowly shut out the light and how he found a room with windows which closed themselves one by one as he arrived and yet no drapes had been drawn for there were none the holes in the solid rock walls had simply sealed themselves because the walls werent of rock and welcome home bloodson said eygor from all around him flesh of my flesh returned at last to my flesh in answer to which no said spiro drooling spittle on the floor in the moment before the room which wasnt a room in a manse that was only a manse on the outside closed on him to make him one with it and shortly six hours of night left and eygor quicker more fluid elastic than any creature before him and hungry he was dead undead alive he was an animal an amalgam an allconsuming organism he was an animalgamism and hungry but sunside meant blood and the blood is the life a thing whose tendril extensions and frothing extrusions reached down into every crevice spire and manse in turgosheim eygor pulsed up through runemanse on the rim and gushed like a lake of living lava onto the plateau that sloped to sunside where he flowed headlong into the searing gaze and golden rays of the sun and where evil eyes were concerned to eygor killglance especially nothing could be more lethal than the burning yellow eye of that ultimate orb what happened then was lightningfast a total instant katabolism the dispersal of the eygorthing into vile gases that mushroomed up in a cloud as if some mighty explosion had occurred though that was not the case a chain reaction of dissolution going down into turgosheim wherever eygors tendrils reached transforming them to slime dust finally the very elements of their constitution and eygor and indeed turgosheim were no more just a barren gorge remained where the shadows were driven back as the sun rose higher still at that same instant but several thousands of miles away as the rumble of wrathstacks fall subsided the necroscope and his party stood in an awesome silence at the gate where all around the landscape was dotted with smoking ashes but after a while the precog lan goodly said nathan i im sorry i mean i i know nathan nodded its soon now right the end of my tether goodly looked away but nathan only smiled and his smile and his eyes were his own for the awful power within had gone with eygors going dissolved with the monsters dissolution they carried the precog a safe distance from the gate and nathan conjured a door and took them back to settlement there he called for grinner and as the wolf came loping spoke to his friends if this fails he said you know where the gate is and you still have time but i wont say goodbye and dont you say good luck the first is premature and the last just doesnt count the future has it all worked out for me one way or the other smiling again at goodly he conjured another door epilogue in the mobius continuum grinner said why uncle since weve done this before is there any point i hope so nathan told him you see back there on starside at the gate i discovered something i really should have known before except this time i had the intuition to recognize it the fact that there are many different types of doors thikkoul of the thyre knew it a jong time ago but without knowing that he knew it he told me i see doors but liquid drawn on water formed of ripples and behind each one of them a piece of your future my doors are commonplace compared to others that exist or that can be caused to exist other doors exist grinner seemed surprised without that you make them thats the whole point nathan answered some that exist and others that are made of course ive known for some time now that there were future and pasttime doors and doors that i could conjure to get me into and out of the mobius continuum but id never thought to make a door here within the continuum itself you see the continuum is like a large manse with many rooms ive never visited perhaps im not supposed to for ive only been shown one of those rooms two if you include sunsidestarside i dont understand said grinner but you will your father knew those doors and so do you you sniff them out except you dont understand them youre a wolf of the wild who understands trails and tracks and spoor you understand directions ahh said grinner my fathers world and yours uncle exactly nathan nodded you showed me the way before but there was no trail or you to follow i had not made one now if you show me it again ill remember it always as one of my coordinates but its there its right there grinner told him pointing the way without pause nathan made his door and as it opened felt a warm sweet wind rush out of it to ruffle his hair one of the many winds of earth then as he stepped through the door with grinner he thought the end of my tether in the parallel dimension of sunsidestarside at least but if lan goodly and i had gone on awhile then we would have come to where it starts again and on the other side of the door he knew where he was at once a place hed found magical which now he had found again but in a magical manner a sunlit hillside overlooking zeks house at porto zoro on the island of zante in the mediterranean standing in the shade of a gnarled old pine the necroscope breathed deeply of resinladen air and gazed out across the incredibly blue ionian but as for grinner he sat down abruptly on his rump and whined for all of his directions were gone now and he was the stranger in a strange far land its all right nathan told him stroking a flattened trembling ear we wont be here long just long enough to talk to gustav turchin and six months later earthtime it was nighttime and again they stood by the starside gate except now they must find a new name for the land north of the barrier mountains and perhaps even a new name for the barrier mountains now they were only a barrier in the sense that they obstructed eager travellers holding them back from a rapidly developing territory and a land free of vampires in the far east and west at least as far as men had yet to journey the vampire swamps were drying out cracking open in their beds cleansed by the sun and in all the length and breadth of the vampire world no vampires existed at least so far as men knew but that was not to say that men wouldnt keep watching not while lardis lidesci lived anyway nor was the transformation confined to the swamps water released from the icelands drifting in clouds on high bringing great rains to the scrubland savannas and lesser precipitation even to the deserts had already turned the land green as far as most of the thyre colonies all of which processes of an altered nature and others would go on for a long time yet so things were very different not least at the place where the adventurers were gathered together the helllands gate on starside scarcely a gate to hell now and no longer a gate in any sense or a oneway gate at best of sorts and utterly impassable to man or beast or vampire no longer a gate no but a lake and all the stars of night mirrored in its shining whirling surface whose waters formed small whirlpools that went down through the magmass wormholes to the subterranean gate and on into another world as the necroscope had pointed out an unending cycle protecting the privacy and integrity of two worlds but depriving neither a closed circuit much like the mobius strip itself for the waters would return of course from the great dam in perchorsk whose torrent had been diverted into the now abandoned projekt by premier gustav turchin a fountain of light reaching up a hundred feet into the starside night illuminated by the gate at its core and raining its soft white waters on the land and into the lake of all the wonders in the vampire world surely this was the greatest of all nathan thought so certainly where he crushed his misha so tightly she held her breath and lardis trask zek goodly chung kirk grinner and blaze and especially andrei but the greatest wonder to andrei was not the lake itself but the firmbodied woman who laughed and danced and pirouetted there where wavelets lapped a oncedustbowl shore a woman far younger than her years whose name was anna marie
