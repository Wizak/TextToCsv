casino royale ian fleming casino royale chapter the secret agent the scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning then the soulerosion produced by high gambling a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it james bond suddenly knew that he was tired he always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on the knowledge this helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes he shifted himself unobtrusively away from the roulette he had been playing and went to stand for a moment at the brass rail which surrounded breasthigh the top table in the salle prive le chiffre was still playing and still apparently winning there was an untidy pile of flecked hundredmille plaques in front of him in the shadow of his thick left arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow ones worth half a million francs each bond watched the curious impressive profile for a time and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and moved away the barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as your chin and the caissier who is generally nothing more than a minor bank clerk sits on a stool and dips into his piles of notes and plaques these are ranged on shelves they are on a level behind the protecting barrier with your groin the caissier has a cosh and a gun to protect him and to heave over the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and get out of the casino through the passages and doors would be impossible and the caissiers generally work in pairs bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of hundred thousand and then the sheaves of ten thousand franc notes with another part of his mind he had a vision of tomorrows regular morning meeting of the casino committee monsieur le chiffre made two million he played his usual game miss fairchild made a million in an hour and then left she executed three bancos of monsieur le chiffre within an hour and then left she played with coolness monsieur le vicomte de villorin made one million two at roulette he was playing the maximum on the first and last dozens he was lucky then the englishman mister bond increased his winnings to exactly three million over the two days he was playing a progressive system on red at table five duclos the chef de partie has the details it seems that he is persevering and plays in maximums he has luck his nerves seem good on the soire the chemindefer won x the baccarat won y and the roulette won z the boule which was again badly frequented still makes its expenses merci monsieur xavier merci monsieur le president or something like that thought bond as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle prive and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric footswitch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble and the casino committee would balance its books and break up to its homes or cafs for lunch as for robbing the caisse in which bond himself was not personally concerned but only interested he reflected that it would take ten good men that they would certainly have to kill one or two employees and that anyway you probably couldnt find ten nonsqueal killers in france or in any other country for the matter of that as he gave a thousand francs to the vestiaire and walked down the steps of the casino bond made up his mind that le chiffre would in no circumstances try to rob the caisse and he put the contingency out of his mind instead he explored his present physical sensations he felt the dry uncomfortable gravel under his evening shoes the bad harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his arms he could feel his eyes filling their sockets the front of his face his nose and antrum were congested he breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses and his wits he wanted to know if anyone had searched his room since he had left it before dinner he walked across the broad boulevard and through the gardens to the htel splendide he smiled at the concierge who gave him his key no on the first floor and took the cable it was from jamaica and read kingstonja xxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxx bond splendide royaleleseaux seine inferieure havana cigar production all cuban factories ten million repeat ten million stop hope this figure you require regards dasilva this meant that ten million francs was on the way to him it was the reply to a request bond had sent that afternoon through paris to his headquarters in london asking for more funds paris had spoken to london where clements the head of bonds department had spoken to m who had smiled wryly and told the broker to fix it with the treasury bond had once worked in jamaica and his cover on the royale assignment was that of a very rich client of messrs caffery the principal import and export firm of jamaica so he was being controlled through jamaica through a taciturn man who was head of the picture desk on the daily gleaner the famous newspaper of the caribbean this man on the gleaner whose name was fawcett had been bookkeeper for one of the leading turtlefisheries on the cayman islands one of the men from the caymans who had volunteered on the outbreak of war he had ended up as a paymasters clerk in a small naval intelligence organization in malta at the end of the war when with a heavy heart he was due to return to the caymans he was spotted by the section of the secret service concerned with the caribbean he was strenuously trained in photography and in some other arts and with the quiet connivance of an influential man in jamaica found his way to the picture desk of the gleaner in the intervals between sifting photographs submitted by the great agencies keystone wideworld universal inp and reuterphoto he would get peremptory instructions by telephone from a man he had never met to carry out certain simple operations requiring nothing but absolute discretion speed and accuracy for these occasional services he received twenty pounds a month paid into his account with the royal bank of canada by a fictitious relative in england fawcetts present assignment was to relay immediately to bond full rates the text of messages which he received at home by telephone from his anonymous contact he had been told by this contact that nothing he would be asked to send would arouse the suspicion of the jamaican post office so he was not surprised to find himself suddenly appointed string correspondent for the maritime press and photo agency with presscollect facilities to france and england on a further monthly retainer of ten pounds he felt secure and encouraged had visions of a bem and made the first payment on a morris minor he also bought a green eyeshade which he had long coveted and which helped him to impose his personality on the picture desk some of this background to his cable passed through bonds mind he was used to oblique control and rather liked it he felt it featherbedded him a little allowed him to give or take an hour or two in his communications with m he knew that this was probably a fallacy that probably there was another member of the service at royaleleseaux who was reporting independently but it did give the illusion that he wasnt only miles across the channel from that deadly office building near regents park being watched and judged by those few cold brains that made the whole show work just as fawcett the cayman islander in kingston knew that if he bought that morris minor outright instead of signing the hirepurchase agreement someone in london would probably know and want to know where the money had come from bond read the cable twice he tore a telegram form off the pad on the desk and wrote his reply in capital letters thanks information should suffice bond he handed this to the concierge and put the cable signed dasilva in his pocket the employers of the concierge could bribe a copy out of the local post office if the concierge hadnt already steamed the envelope open or read the cable upside down in bonds hands he took his key and said good night and turned to the stairs shaking his head at the liftman bond knew what an obliging dangersignal a lift could be he didnt expect anyone to be moving on the first floor but he preferred to be prudent walking quietly up on the balls of his feet he regretted the hubris of his reply to m via jamaica as a gambler he knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a capital anyway m probably wouldnt let him have any more he shrugged his shoulders and turned off the stairs into the corridor and walked softly to the door of his room bond knew exactly where the switch was and it was with one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the door full open the light on and a gun in his hand the safe empty room sneered at him he ignored the halfopen door of the bathroom and locking himself in he turned up the bedlight and the mirrorlight and threw his gun on the settee beside the window then he bent down and inspected one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it before dinner wedged into the drawer of the writingdesk next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard it appeared immaculate he went into the bathroom lifted the cover of the lavatory cistern and verified the level of the water against a small scratch on the copper ballcock doing all this inspecting these minute burglaralarms did not make him feel foolish or selfconscious he was a secret agent and still alive thanks to his exact attention to the detail of his profession routine precautions were to him no more unreasonable than they would be to a deepsea diver or a test pilot or to any man earning dangermoney satisfied that his room had not been searched while he was at the casino bond undressed and took a cold shower then he lit his seventieth cigarette of the day and sat down at the writingtable with the thick wad of his stake money and winnings beside him and entered some figures in a small notebook over the two days play he was up exactly three million francs in london he had been issued with ten million and he had asked london for a further ten with this on its way to the local branch of crdit lyonnais his working capital amounted to twentythree million francs or some twentythree thousand pounds for a few moments bond sat motionless gazing out of the window across the dark sea then he shoved the bundle of banknotes under the pillow of the ornate single bed cleaned his teeth turned out the lights and climbed with relief between the harsh french sheets for ten minutes he lay on his left side reflecting on the events of the day then he turned over and focused his mind towards the tunnel of sleep his last action was to slip his right hand under the pillow until it rested under the butt of the colt police positive with the sawn barrel then he slept and with the warmth and humour of his eyes extinguished his features relapsed into a taciturn mask ironical brutal and cold chapter dossier for m two weeks before this memorandum had gone from station s of the secret service to m who was then and is today head of this adjunct to the british defence ministries to m from head of s subject a project for the destruction of monsieur le chiffre one of the oppositions chief agents in france and undercover paymaster of the syndicat des ouvriers dalsace the communistcontrolled trade union in the heavy and transport industries of alsace and as we know an important fifth column in the event of war with redland documentation head of archives biography of le chiffre is attached at appendix a also appendix b a note on smersh we have been feeling for some time that le chiffre is getting into deep water in nearly all respects he is an admirable agent of the ussr but his gross physical habits and predilections are an achilles heel of which we have been able to take advantage from time to time and one of his mistresses is a eurasian controlled by station f who has recently been able to obtain insight into his private affairs briefly it seems that le chiffre is on the brink of a financial crisis certain straws in the wind were noticed by some discreet sales of jewellery the disposal of a villa at antibes and a general tendency to check the loose spending which has always been a feature of his way of life further inquiries were made with the help of our friends of the deuxiљme bureau and a curious story has come to light in january le chiffre bought control of a chain of brothels known as the cordon jaune operating in normandy and brittany he was foolish enough to employ for this purpose some fifty million francs of the moneys entrusted to him by leningrad section iii for the financing of soda the trade union mentioned above normally the cordon jaune would have proved a most excellent investment and it is possible that le chiffre was motivated more by a desire to increase his union funds than by the hope of lining his own pocket by speculating with his employers money however that may be it is clear that he could have found many investments more savoury than prostitution if he had not been tempted by the byproduct of unlimited women for his personal use fate rebuked him with terrifying swiftness barely three months later on april there was passed in france law no entitled loi tendant la fermeture des maisons de tolrance et au renforcement de la lutte contre le proxnitisme when m came to this sentence he grunted and pressed a switch on the intercom head of s sir what the hell does this word mean he spelt it out pimping sir this is not the berlitz school of languages head of s if you want to show off your knowledge of foreign jawbreakers be good enough to provide a crib better still write in english sorry sir m released the switch and turned back to the memorandum this law known popularly as la loi marthe richard closing all houses of illfame and forbidding the sale of pornographic books and films knocked the bottom out of his investment almost overnight and suddenly le chiffre was faced with a serious deficit in his union funds in desperation he turned his open houses into maisons de passe where clandestine rendezvous could be arranged on the borderline of the law and he continued to operate one or two cinmas bleus underground but these shifts in no way served to cover his overheads and all attempts to sell his investment even at a heavy loss failed dismally meanwhile the police des mours were on his trail and in a short while twenty or more of his establishments were closed down the police were of course only interested in this man as a bigtime brothelkeeper and it was not until we expressed an interest in his finances that the deuxiљme bureau unearthed the parallel dossier which was running with their colleagues of the police department the significance of the situation became apparent to us and to our french friends and in the past few months a veritable rathunt has been operated by the police after the establishments of the cordon jaune with the result that today nothing remains of le chiffres original investment and any routine inquiry would reveal a deficit of around fifty million francs in the trade union funds of which he is the treasurer and paymaster it does not seem that the suspicions of leningrad have been aroused yet but unfortunately for le chiffre it is possible that at any rate smersh is on the scent last week a highgrade source of station p reported that a senior official of this efficient organ of soviet vengeance had left warsaw for strasbourg via the eastern sector of berlin there is no confirmation of this report from the deuxiљme bureau nor from the authorities in strasbourg and there is also no news from le chiffres headquarters there which we have well covered by a double agent if le chiffre knew that smersh was on his tail or that they had the smallest suspicion of him he would have no alternative but to commit suicide or attempt to escape but his present plans suggest that while he is certainly desperate he does not yet realize that his life may be at stake it is these rather spectacular plans of his that have suggested to us a counteroperation which though risky and unconventional we submit at the end of this memorandum with confidence in brief le chiffre plans we believe to follow the example of most other desperate tillrobbers and make good the deficit in his accounts by gambling the bourse is too slow so are the various illicit traffics in drugs or rare medicines such as aureo and streptomycin and cortisone no racetracks could carry the sort of stakes he will have to play and if he wins he would more likely be killed than paid off in any case we know that he has withdrawn the final twentyfive million francs from the treasury of his union and that he has taken a small villa in the neighbourhood of royaleleseaux just north of dieppe for a week from a fortnight tomorrow now it is expected that the casino at royale will see the highest gambling in europe this summer in an effort to wrest the big money from deauville and le touquet the socit des bains de mers de royale have leased the baccarat and the two top chemindefer tables to the mahomet ali syndicate a group of migr egyptian bankers and businessmen with it is said a call on certain royal funds who have for years been trying to cut in on the profits of zographos and his greek associates resulting from their monopoly of the highest french baccarat banks with the help of discreet publicity a considerable number of the biggest operators in america and europe have been encouraged to book at royale this summer and it seems possible that this oldfashioned wateringplace will regain some of its victorian renown be that as it may it is here that le chiffre will we are confident endeavour on or after june to make a profit at baccarat of fifty million francs on a working capital of twentyfive million proposed counteroperation it would be greatly in the interests of this country and of the other nations of the north atlantic treaty organization that this powerful soviet agent should be ridiculed and destroyed that his communist trade union should be bankrupted and brought into disrepute and that this potential fifth column with a strength of capable in time of war of controlling a wide sector of frances northern frontier should lose faith and cohesion all this would result if le chiffre could be defeated at the tables we therefore recommend that the finest gambler available to the service should be given the necessary funds and endeavour to outgamble this man the risks are obvious and the possible loss to the secret funds is high but other operations on which large sums have been hazarded have had fewer chances of success often for a smaller objective if the decision is unfavourable the only alternative would be to place our information and our recommendations in the hands of the deuxiљme bureau or of our american colleagues of the central intelligence agency in washington both of these organizations would doubtless be delighted to take over the scheme signed s appendix a

own archives and scanty material made available by deuxiљme bureau and cia washington smersh is a conjunction of two russian words smyert shpionam meaning roughly death to spies ranks above mwd and is believed to come under the personal direction of beria headquarters leningrad its tasks is the elimination of all forms of treachery and backsliding with the various branches of the soviet secret service and secret police at home and abroad it is the most powerful and feared organization in the ussr and is popularly believed never to have failed in a mission of vengeance it is thought that smersh was responsible for the assassination of trotsky in mexico and may indeed have made its name with this successful murder after attempts by other russian individuals and organizations had failed smersh was next heard of when hitler attacked russia it was then rapidly expanded to cope with treachery and double agents during the retreat of the soviet forces in at that time it worked as an execution squad for the nkvd and its present selective mission was not so clearly defined the organization itself was thoroughly purged after the war and is now believed to consist of only a few hundred operatives of very high quality divided into five sections department i in charge of counterintelligence among soviet organizations at home and abroad department ii operations including executions department iii administration and finance department iv investigations and legal work personnel department v prosecutions the section which passes final judgement on all victims only one smersh operative has come into our hands since the war goytchev alias garradjones he shot petchora medical officer at the yugoslav embassy in hyde park august during interrogation he committed suicide by swallowing a coatbutton of compressed potassium cyanide he revealed nothing beyond his membership of smersh of which he was arrogantly boastful we believe that the following british double agents were victims of smersh donovan harthropvane elizabeth dumont ventnor mace savarin conclusion every effort should be made to improve our knowledge of this very powerful organization and destroy its operatives chapter number head of s was so keen on his plan for the destruction of le chiffre and it was basically his own plan that he took the memorandum himself and went up to the top floor of the gloomy building overlooking regents park and through the green baize door and along the corridor to the end room he walked belligerently up to ms chief of staff a young sapper who had earned his spurs as one of the secretariat to the chiefs of staff committee after having been wounded during a sabotage operation in and had kept his sense of humour in spite of both experiences now look here bill i want to sell something to the chief is this a good moment what do you think penny the chief of staff turned to ms private secretary who shared the room with him miss moneypenny would have been desirable but for eyes which were cool and direct and quizzical should be all right he won a bit of a victory at the fo this morning and hes not got anyone for the next half an hour she smiled encouragingly at head of s whom she liked for himself and for the importance of his section well heres the dope bill he handed over the black folder with the red star which stood for top secret and for gods sake look enthusiastic when you give it him and tell him ill wait here and read a good codebook while hes considering it he may want some more details and anyway i want to see you two dont pester him with anything else until hes finished all right sir the chief of staff pressed a switch leant towards the intercom on his desk yes asked a quiet flat voice head of s has an urgent docket for you sir there was a pause bring it in said a voice the chief of staff released the switch and stood up thanks bill ill be next door said head of s the chief of staff crossed his office and went through the double doors leading into ms room in a moment he came out and over the entrance a small blue light burned the warning that m was not to be disturbed later a triumphant head of s said to his number two we nearly cooked ourselves with that last paragraph he said it was subversion and blackmail he got pretty sharp about it anyway he approves says the ideas crazy but worth trying if the treasury will play and he thinks they will hes going to tell them its a better gamble than the money were putting into deserting russian colonels who turn double after a few months asylum here and hes longing to get at le chiffre and anyway hes got the right man and wants to try him out on the job who is it asked number two one of the double os i guess hes tough and m thinks there may be trouble with those gunmen of le chiffres he must be pretty good with the cards or he wouldnt have sat in the casino in monte carlo for two months before the war watching that roumanian team work their stuff with the invisible ink and the dark glasses he and the deuxiљme bowled them out in the end and turned in a million francs he had won at shemmy good money in those days james bonds interview with m had been short what about it bond asked m when bond came back into his room after reading head of ss memorandum and after gazing for ten minutes out of the waitingroom window at the distant trees in the park bond looked across the desk into the shrewd clear eyes its very kind of you sir id like to do it but i cant promise to win the odds at baccarat are the best after trenteetquarante evens except for the tiny cagnotte but i might get a bad run against me and get cleaned out plays going to he pretty high openingll go up to half a million i should think bond was stopped by the cold eyes m knew all this already knew the odds at baccarat as well as bond that was his job knowing the odds at everything and knowing men his own and the oppositions bond wished he had kept quiet about his misgivings he can have a bad run too said m youll have plenty of capital up to twentyfive million the same as him well start you on ten and send you another ten when youve had a look round you can make the extra five yourself he smiled go over a few days before the big game starts and get your hand in have a talk to q about rooms and trains and any equipment you want the paymaster will fix the funds im going to ask the deuxiљme to stand by its their territory and as it is we shall be lucky if they dont kick up rough ill try and persuade them to send mathis you seemed to get on well with him in monte carlo on that other casino job and im going to tell washington because of the nato angle cia have got one or two good men at fontainebleau with the joint intelligence chaps there anything else bond shook his head id certainly like to have mathis sir well well see try and bring it off were going to look pretty foolish if you dont and watch out this sounds an amusing job but i dont think its going to be le chiffre is a good man well best of luck thank you sir said bond and went to the door just a minute bond turned i think ill keep you covered bond two heads are better than one and youll need someone to run your communications ill think it over theyll get in touch with you at royale you neednt worry itll be someone good bond would have preferred to work alone but one didnt argue with m he left the room hoping that the man they sent would be loyal to him and neither stupid nor worse still ambitious chapter lennemi coute as two weeks later james bond awoke in his room at the htel splendide some of this history passed through his mind he had arrived at royaleleseaux in time for luncheon two days before there had been no attempt to contact him and there had been no flicker of curiosity when he had signed the register james bond port maria jamaica m had expressed no interest in his cover once you start to make a set at le chiffre at the tables youll have had it he said but wear a cover that will stick with the general public bond knew jamaica well so he asked to be controlled from there and to pass as a jamaican plantocrat whose father had made his pile in tobacco and sugar and whose son chose to play it away on the stock markets and in casinos if inquiries were made he would quote charles dasilva of chafferys kingston as his attorney charles would make the story stick bond had spent the last two afternoons and most of the nights at the casino playing complicated progression systems on the even chances at roulette he made a high banco at chemindefer whenever he heard one offered if he lost he would suivi once and not chase it further if he lost the second time in this way he had made some three million francs and had given his nerves and cardsense a thorough workout he had got the geography of the casino clear in his mind above all he had been able to observe le chiffre at the tables and to note ruefully that he was a faultless and lucky gambler bond liked to make a good breakfast after a cold shower he sat at the writingtable in front of the window he looked out at the beautiful day and consumed half a pint of iced orange juice three scrambled eggs and bacon and a double portion of coffee without sugar he lit his first cigarette a balkan and turkish mixture made for him by morlands of grosvenor street and watched the small waves lick the long seashore and the fishingfleet from dieppe string out towards the june heathaze followed by a paperchase of herringgulls he was lost in his thoughts when the telephone rang it was the concierge announcing that a director of radio stentor was waiting below with the wireless set he had ordered from paris of course said bond send him up this was the cover fixed by the deuxiљme bureau for their liaison man with bond bond watched the door hoping that it would be mathis when mathis came in a respectable businessman carrying a large square parcel by its leather handle bond smiled broadly and would have greeted him with warmth if mathis had not frowned and held up his free hand after carefully closing the door i have just arrived from paris monsieur and here is the set you asked to have on approval five valves superhet i think you call it in england and you should be able to get most of the capitals of europe from royale there are no mountains for forty miles in any direction it sounds all right said bond lifting his eyebrows at this mysterymaking mathis paid no attention he placed the set which he had unwrapped on the floor beside the unlit panel electric fire below the mantelpiece it is just past eleven he said and i see that the compagnons de la chanson should now be on the medium wave from rome they are touring europe let us see what the reception is like it should be a fair test he winked bond noticed that he had turned the volume on to full and that the red light indicating the long waveband was illuminated though the set was still silent mathis fiddled at the back of the set suddenly an appalling roar of static filled the small room mathis gazed at the set for a few seconds with benevolence and then turned it off and his voice was full of dismay my dear monsieur forgive me please badly tuned and he again bent to the dials after a few adjustments the close harmony of the french came over the air and mathis walked up and clapped bond very hard on the back and wrang his hand until bonds fingers ached bond smiled back at him now what the hell he asked my dear friend mathis was delighted you are blown blown blown up there he pointed at the ceiling at this moment either monsieur muntz or his alleged wife allegedly bedridden with the grippe is deafened absolutely deafened and i hope in agony he grinned with pleasure at bonds frown of disbelief mathis sat down on the bed and ripped open a packet of caporal with his thumbnail bond waited mathis was satisfied with the sensation his words had caused he became serious how it has happened i dont know they must have been on to you for several days before you arrived the opposition is here in real strength above you is the muntz family he is german she is from somewhere in central europe perhaps a czech this is an oldfashioned hotel there are disused chimneys behind these electric fires just here he pointed a few inches above the panel fire is suspended a very powerful radio pickup the wires run up the chimney to behind the muntzes electric fire where there is an amplifier in their room is a wirerecorder and a pair of earphones on which the muntzes listen in turn that is why madame muntz has the grippe and takes all her meals in bed and why monsieur muntz has to be constantly at her side instead of enjoying the sunshine and the gambling of this delightful resort some of this we knew because in france we are very clever the rest we confirmed by unscrewing your electric fire a few hours before you got here suspiciously bond walked over and examined the screws which secured the panel to the wall their grooves showed minute scratches now it is time for a little more playacting said mathis he walked over to the radio which was still transmitting close harmony to its audience of three and switched it off are you satisfied monsieur he asked you notice how clearly they came over are they not a wonderful team he made a winding motion with his right hand and raised his eyebrows they are so good said bond that i would like to hear the rest of the programme he grinned at the thought of the angry glances which the muntzes must be exchanging overhead the machine itself seems splendid just what i was looking for to take back to jamaica mathis made a sarcastic grimace and switched back to the rome programme you and your jamaica he said and sat down again on the bed bond frowned at him well its no good crying over spilt milk he said we didnt expect the cover to stick for long but its worrying that they bowled it out so soon he searched his mind in vain for a clue could the russians have broken one of our ciphers if so he might just as well pack up and go home he and his job would have been stripped naked mathis seemed to read his mind it cant have been a cipher he said anyway we told london at once and they will have changed them a pretty flap we caused i can tell you he smiled with the satisfaction of a friendly rival and now to business before our good compagnons run out of breath first of all and he inhaled a thick lungful of caporal you will be pleased with your number two she is very beautiful bond frowned very beautiful indeed satisfied with bonds reaction mathis continued she has black hair blue eyes and splendid er protuberances back and front he added and she is a wireless expert which though sexually less interesting makes her a perfect employee of radio stentor and assistant to myself in my capacity as wireless salesman for this rich summer season down here he grinned we are both staying in the hotel and my assistant will thus be on hand in case your new radio breaks down all new machines even french ones are apt to have teething troubles in the first day or two and occasionally at night he added with an exaggerated wink bond was not amused what the hell do they want to send me a woman for he said bitterly do they think this is a bloody picnic mathis interrupted calm yourself my dear james she is as serious as you could wish and as cold as an icicle she speaks french like a native and knows her job backwards her covers perfect and i have arranged for her to team up with you quite smoothly what is more natural than that you should pick up a pretty girl here as a jamaican millionaire he coughed respectfully what with your hot blood and all you would look naked without one bond grunted dubiously any other surprises he asked suspiciously nothing very much answered mathis le chiffre is installed in his villa its about ten miles down the coast road he has his two guards with him they look pretty capable fellows one of them has been seen visiting a little pension in the town where three mysterious and rather subhuman characters checked in two days ago they may be part of the team their papers are in order stateless czechs apparently but one of our men says the language they talk in their room is bulgarian we dont see many of those around theyre mostly used against the turks and the yugoslavs theyre stupid but obedient the russians use them for simple killings or as fallguys for more complicated ones thanks very much which is mine to be asked bond anything else no come to the bar of the hermitage before lunch ill fix the introduction ask her to dinner this evening then it will be natural for her to come into the casino with you ill be there too but in the background ive got one or two good chaps and well keep an eye on you oh and theres an american called leiter here staying in the hotel felix leiter hes the cia chap from fontainebleau london told me to tell you he looks okay may come in useful a torrent of italian burst from the wireless set on the floor mathis switched it off and they exchanged some phrases about the set and about how bond should pay for it then with effusive farewells and a final wink mathis bowed himself out bond sat at the window and gathered his thoughts nothing that mathis had told him was reassuring he was completely blown and under really professional surveillance an attempt might be made to put him away before he had a chance to pit himself against le chiffre at the tables the russians had no stupid prejudices about murder and then there was this pest of a girl he sighed women were for recreation on a job they got in the way and fogged things up with sex and hurt feelings and all the emotional baggage they carried around one had to look out for them and take care of them bitch said bond and then remembering the muntzes he said bitch again more loudly and walked out of the room chapter the girl from headquarters it was twelve oclock when bond left the splendide and the clock on the mairie was stumbling through its midday carillon there was a strong scent of pine and mimosa in the air and the freshly watered gardens of the casino opposite interspersed with neat gravel parterres and paths lent the scene a pretty formalism more appropriate to ballet than to melodrama the sun shone and there was a gaiety and sparkle in the air which seemed to promise well for the new era of fashion and prosperity for which the little seaside town after many vicissitudes was making its gallant bid royaleleseaux which lies near the mouth of the somme before the flat coastline soars up from the beaches of southern picardy to the brittany cliffs which run on to le havre had experienced much the same fortunes as trouville royale also started as a small fishing village and its rise to fame as a fashionable wateringplace during the second empire was as meteoric as that of trouville but as deauville killed trouville so after a long period of decline did le touquet kill royale at the turn of the century when things were going badly for the little seaside town and when the fashion was to combine pleasure with a cure a natural spring in the hills behind royale was discovered to contain enough diluted sulphur to have a beneficent effect on the liver since all french people suffer from liver complaints royale quickly became royaleleseaux and eau royale in a torpedoshaped bottle grafted itself demurely on to the tail of the mineralwater lists in hotels and restaurant cars it did not long withstand the powerful combines of vichy and perrier and vittel there came a series of lawsuits a number of people lost a lot of money and very soon its sale was again entirely local royale fell back on the takings from the french and english families during the summer on its fishingfleet in winter and on the crumbs which fell to its elegantly dilapidated casino from the table at le touquet but there was something splendid about the negresco baroque of the casino royale a strong whiff of victorian elegance and luxury and in royale caught the fancy of a syndicate in paris which disposed of large funds belonging to a group of expatriate vichyites brighton had been revived since the war and nice nostalgia for more spacious golden times might be a source of revenue the casino was repainted in its original white and gilt and the rooms decorated in the palest grey with winered carpets and curtains vast chandeliers were suspended from the ceilings the gardens were spruced and the fountains played again and the two main hotels the splendide and the hermitage were prinked and furbished and restaffed even the small town and the vieuxport managed to fix welcoming smiles across their ravaged faces and the main street became gay with the vitrines of great paris jewellers and couturiers tempted down for a butterfly season by rentfree sites and lavish promises then the mahomet ali syndicate was cajoled into starting a high game in the casino and the socit des bains de mer de royale felt that now at last le touquet would have to yield up some of the treasure stolen over the years from its parent plage against the background of this luminous and sparkling stage bond stood in the sunshine and felt his mission to be incongruous and remote and his dark profession an affront to his fellow actors he shrugged away the momentary feeling of unease and walked round the back of his hotel and down the ramp to the garage before his rendezvous at the hermitage he decided to take his car down the coast road and have a quick look at le chiffres villa and then drive back by the inland road until it crossed the route nationale to paris bonds car was his only personal hobby one of the last of the litre bentleys with the supercharger by amherst villiers he had bought it almost new in and had kept it in careful storage through the war it was still serviced every year and in london a former bentley mechanic who worked in a garage near bonds chelsea flat tended it with jealous care bond drove it hard and well and with an almost sensual pleasure it was a battleshipgray convertible coupe which really did convert and it was capable of touring at ninety with thirty miles an hour in reserve bond eased the car out of the garage and up the ramp and soon the loitering drumbeat of the twoinch exhaust was echoing down the treelined boulevard through the crowded main street of the little town and off through the sand dunes to the south an hour later bond walked into the hermitage bar and chose a table near one of the broad windows the room was sumptuous with those overmasculine trappings which together with briar pipes and wirehaired terriers spell luxury in france everything was brassstudded leather and polished mahogany the curtains and carpets were in royal blue the waiters wore striped waistcoats and green baize aprons bond ordered an americano and examined the sprinkling of overdressed customers mostly from paris he guessed who sat talking with focus and vivacity creating that theatrically clubbable atmosphere of lheure de lapritif the men were drinking inexhaustible quarterbottles of champagne the women dry martinis moi jadore le dry a brightfaced girl at the next table said to her companion too neat in his unseasonable tweeds who gazed at her with moist brown eyes over the top of an expensive shootingstick from hermes fait avec du gordons bien entendu daccord daisy mais tu sais un zeste de citron bonds eye was caught by the tall figure of mathis on the pavement outside his face turned in animation to a darkhaired girl in grey his arm was linked in hers high up above the elbow and yet there was a lack of intimacy in their appearance an ironical chill in the girls profile which made them seem two separate people rather than a couple bond waited for them to come through the street door into the bar but for appearances sake continued to stare out of the window at the passersby but surely it is monsieur bond mathiss voice behind him was full of surprised delight bond appropriately flustered rose to his feet can it be that you are alone are you awaiting someone may i present my colleague mademoiselle lynd my dear this is the gentleman from jamaica with whom i had the pleasure of doing business this morning bond inclined himself with a reserved friendliness it would be a great pleasure he addressed himself to the girl i am alone would you both care to join me he pulled out a chair and while they sat down he beckoned to a waiter and despite mathiss expostulations insisted on ordering the drinks a fine leau for mathis and a bacardi for the girl mathis and bond exchanged cheerful talk about the fine weather and the prospects of a revival in the fortunes of royaleleseaux the girl sat silent she accepted one of bonds cigarettes examined it and then smoked it appreciatively and without affectation drawing the smoke deeply into her lungs with a little sigh and then exhaling it casually through her lips and nostrils her movements were economical and precise with no trace of selfconsciousness bond felt her presence strongly while he and mathis talked he turned from time to time towards her politely including her in the conversation but adding up the impressions recorded by each glance her hair was very black and she wore it cut square and low on the nape of the neck framing her face to below the clear and beautiful line of her jaw although it was heavy and moved with the movements of her head she did not constantly pat it back into place but let it alone her eyes were wide apart and deep blue and they gazed candidly back at bond with a touch of ironical disinterest which to his annoyance he found he would like to shatter roughly her skin was lightly suntanned and bore no trace of makeup except on her mouth which was wide and sensual her bare arms and hands had a quality of repose and the general impression of restraint in her appearance and movements was carried even to her fingernails which were unpainted and cut short round her neck she wore a plain gold chain of wide flat links and on the fourth finger of the right hand a broad topaz ring her mediumlength dress was of grey soie sauvage with a squarecut bodice lasciviously tight across her fine breasts the skirt was closely pleated and flowered down from a narrow but not a thin waist she wore a threeinch handstitched black belt a handstitched black sabretache rested on the chair beside her together with a wide cartwheel hat of gold straw its crown encircled by a thin black velvet ribbon which tied at the back in a short bow her shoes were squaretoed of plain black leather bond was excited by her beauty and intrigued by her composure the prospect of working with her stimulated him at the same time he felt a vague disquiet on an impulse he touched wood mathis had noticed bonds preoccupation after a time he rose forgive me he said to the girl while i telephone to the dubernes i must arrange my rendezvous for dinner tonight are you sure you wont mind being left to your own devices this evening she shook her head bond took the cue and as mathis crossed the room to the telephone booth beside the bar he said if you are going to be alone tonight would you care to have dinner with me she smiled with the first hint of conspiracy she had shown i would like to very much she said and then perhaps you would chaperon me to the casino where monsieur mathis tells me you are very much at home perhaps i will bring you luck with mathis gone her attitude towards him showed a sudden warmth she seemed to acknowledge that they were a team and as they discussed the time and place of their meeting bond realized that it would be quite easy after all to plan the details of his project with her he felt that after all she was interested and excited by her role and that she would work willingly with him he had imagined many hurdles before establishing a rapport but now he felt he could get straight down to professional details he was quite honest to himself about the hypocrisy of his attitude towards her as a woman he wanted to sleep with her but only when the job had been done when mathis came back to the table bond called for his bill he explained that he was expected back at his hotel to have lunch with friends when for a moment he held her hand in his he felt a warmth of affection and understanding pass between them that would have seemed impossible half an hour earlier the girls eyes followed him out on to the boulevard mathis moved his chair close to hers and said softly that is a very good friend of mine i am glad you have met each other i can already feel the icefloes on the two rivers breaking up he smiled i dont think bond has ever been melted it will be a new experience for him and for you she did not answer him directly he is very goodlooking he reminds me rather of hoagy carmichael but there is something cold and ruthless in his the sentence was never finished suddenly a few feet away the entire plateglass window shivered into confetti the blast of a terrific explosion very near hit them so that they were rocked back in their chairs there was an instant of silence some objects pattered down on to the pavement outside bottles slowly toppled off the shelves behind the bar then there were screams and a stampede for the door stay there said mathis he kicked back his chair and hurtled through the empty windowframe on to the pavement chapter two men in straw hats when bond left the bar he walked purposefully along the pavement flanking the treelined boulevard towards his hotel a few hundred yards away he was hungry the day was still beautiful but by now the sun was very hot and the planetrees spaced about twenty feet apart on the grass verge between the pavement and the broad tarmac gave a cool shade there were few people abroad and the two men standing quietly under a tree on the opposite side of the boulevard looked out of place bond noticed them when he was still a hundred yards away and when the same distance separated them from the ornamental porte cochљre of the splendide there was something rather disquieting about their appearance they were both small and they were dressed alike in dark and bond reflected rather hotlooking suits they had the appearance of a variety turn waiting for a bus on the way to the theatre each wore a straw hat with a thick black ribbon as a concession perhaps to the holiday atmosphere of the resort and the brims of these and the shadow from the tree under which they stood obscured their faces incongruously each dark squat little figure was illuminated by a touch of bright colour they were both carrying square cameracases slung from the shoulder and one case was bright red and the other case bright blue by the time bond had taken in these details he had come to within fifty yards of the two men he was reflecting on the ranges of various types of weapon and the possibilities of cover when an extraordinary and terrible scene was enacted redman seemed to give a short nod to blueman with a quick movement blueman unslung his blue cameracase blueman and bond could not see exactly as the trunk of a planetree beside him just then intervened to obscure his vision bent forward and seemed to fiddle with the case then with a blinding flash of white light there was the earsplitting crack of a monstrous explosion and bond despite the protection of the treetrunk was slammed down to the pavement by a bolt of hot air which dented his cheeks and stomach as if they had been made of paper he lay gazing up at the sun while the air went on twanging with the explosion as if someone had hit the bass register of a piano with a sledgehammer when dazed and halfconscious he raised himself on one knee a ghastly rain of pieces of flesh and shreds of bloodsoaked clothing fell on him and around him mingled with branches and gravel then a shower of small twigs and leaves from all sides came the sharp tinkle of falling glass above in the sky hung a mushroom of black smoke which rose and dissolved as he drunkenly watched it there was an obscene smell of high explosive of burning wood and of yes that was it roast mutton for fifty yards down the boulevard the trees were leafless and charred opposite two of them had snapped off near the base and lay drunkenly across the road between them there was a still smoking crater of the two men in straw hats there remained absolutely nothing but there were red traces on the road and on the pavements and against the trunks of the trees and there were glittering shreds high up in the branches bond felt himself starting to vomit it was mathis who got to him first and by that time bond was standing with his arm round the tree which had saved his life stupefied but unharmed he allowed mathis to lead him off towards the splendide from which guests and servants were pouring in chattering fright as the distant clang of bells heralded the arrival of ambulances and fireengines they managed to push through the throng and up the short stairs and along the corridor to bonds room mathis paused only to turn on the radio in front of the fireplace then while bond stripped off his bloodflecked clothes mathis sprayed him with questions when it came to the description of the two men mathis tore the telephone off its hook beside bonds bed and tell the police he concluded tell them that the englishman from jamaica who was knocked over by the blast is my affair he is unhurt and they are not to worry him i will explain to them in half an hour they should tell the press that it was apparently a vendetta between two bulgarian communists and that one killed the other with a bomb they need say nothing of the third bulgar who must have been hanging about somewhere lout they must get him at all costs he will certainly head for paris roadblocks everywhere understand alors bonne chance mathis turned back to bond and heard him to the end merde but you were lucky he said when bond had finished clearly the bomb was intended for you it must have been faulty they intended to throw it and then dodge behind their tree but it all came out the other way round never mind we will discover the facts he paused but certainly it is a curious affair and these people appear to be taking you seriously mathis looked affronted but how did these sacr bulgars intend to escape capture and what was the significance of the red and the blue cases we must try and find some fragments of the red one mathis bit his nails he was excited and his eyes glittered this was becoming a formidable and dramatic affair in many aspects of which he was now involved personally certainly it was no longer just a case of holding bonds coat while he had his private battle with le chiffre in the casino mathis jumped up now get a drink and some lunch and a rest he ordered bond for me i must get my nose quickly into this affair before the police have muddied the trail with their big black boots mathis turned off the radio and waved an affectionate farewell the door slammed and silence settled on the room bond sat for a while by the window and enjoyed being alive later as bond was finishing his first straight whisky on the rocks and was contemplating the pat de foie gras and cold langouste which the waiter had just laid out for him the telephone rang this is mademoiselle lynd the voice was low and anxious are you all right yes quite im glad please take care of yourself she rang off bond shook himself then he picked up his knife and selected the thickest of the pieces of hot toast he suddenly thought two of them are dead and i have got one more on my side its a start he dipped the knife into the glass of very hot water which stood beside the pot of strasbourg porcelain and reminded himself to tip the waiter doubly for this particular meal chapter rouge et noir bond was determined to be completely fit and relaxed for a gambling session which might last most of the night he ordered a masseur for three oclock after the remains of his luncheon had been removed he sat at his window gazing out to sea until there came a knock on the door as the masseur a swede presented himself silently he got to work on bond from his feet to his neck melting the tensions in his body and calming his still twanging nerves even the long purpling bruises down bonds left shoulder and side ceased to throb and when the swede had gone bond fell into a dreamless sleep he awoke in the evening completely refreshed after a cold shower bond walked over to the casino since the night before he had lost the mood of the tables he needed to reestablish that focus which is half mathematical and half intuitive and which with a slow pulse and a sanguine temperament bond knew to be the essential equipment of any gambler who was set on winning bond had always been a gambler he loved the dry riffle of the cards and the constant unemphatic drama of the quiet figures round the green tables he liked the solid studied comfort of cardrooms and casinos the wellpadded arms of the chairs the glass of champagne or whisky at the elbow the quiet unhurried attention of good servants he was amused by the impartiality of the roulette ball and of the playingcards and their eternal bias he liked being an actor and a spectator and from his chair to take part in other mens dramas and decisions until it came to his own turn to say that vital yes or no generally on a fiftyfifty chance above all he liked it that everything was ones own fault there was only oneself to praise or blame luck was a servant and not a master luck had to be accepted with a shrug or taken advantage of up to the hilt but it had to be understood and recognized for what it was and not confused with a faulty appreciation of the odds for at gambling the deadly sin is to mistake bad play for bad luck and luck in all its moods had to be loved and not feared bond saw luck as a woman to be softly wooed or brutally ravaged never pandered to or pursued but he was honest enough to admit that he had never yet been made to suffer by cards or by women one day and he accepted the fact he would be brought to his knees by love or by luck when that happened he knew that he too would be branded with the deadly questionmark he recognized so often in others the promise to pay before you have lost the acceptance of fallibility but on this june evening when bond walked through the kitchen into the salle prive it was with a sensation of confidence and cheerful anticipation that he changed a million francs into plaques of fifty mille and took a seat next to the chef de partie at roulette table number bond borrowed the chefs card and studied the run of the ball since the session had started at three oclock that afternoon he always did this although he knew that each turn of the wheel each fall of the ball into a numbered slot has absolutely no connexion with its predecessor he accepted that the game begins afresh each time the croupier picks up the ivory ball with his right hand gives one of the four spokes of the wheel a controlled twist clockwise with the same hand and with a third motion also with the right hand flicks the ball round the outer rim of the wheel anticlockwise against the spin it was obvious that all this ritual and all the mechanical minutiae of the wheel of the numbered slots and the cylinder had been devised and perfected over the years so that neither the skill of the croupier nor any bias in the wheel could affect the fall of the ball and yet it is a convention among roulette players and bond rigidly adhered to it to take careful note of the past history of each session and to be guided by any peculiarities in the run of the wheel to note for instance and consider significant sequences of more than two on a single number or of more than four at the other chances down to evens bond didnt defend the practice he simply maintained that the more effort and ingenuity you put into gambling the more you took out on the record of that particular table after about three hours play bond could see little of interest except that the last dozen had been out of favour it was his practice to play always with the wheel and only to turn against its previous pattern and start on a new tack after a zero had turned up so he decided to play one of his favourite gambits and back two in this case the first two dozens each with the maximum one hundred thousand francs he thus had twothirds of the board covered and since the dozens pay odds of two to one he stood to win a hundred thousand francs every time any number lower than twentyfive turned up after seven coups he had won six times he lost on the seventh when thirty came up his net profit was four hundred thousand francs he kept off the table for the eighth throw zero turned up this piece of luck cheered him further and accepting the thirty as a fingerpost to the last dozen he decided to back the first and last dozens until he had lost twice ten throws later the middle dozen came up twice costing him four hundred thousand francs but he rose from the table one million francs to the good directly bond had started playing in maximums his game had become the centre of interest at the table as he seemed to be in luck one or two pilot fish started to swim with the shark sitting directly opposite one of these whom bond took to be an american had shown more than the usual friendliness and pleasure at his share of the winning streak he had smiled once or twice across the table and there was something pointed in the way he duplicated bonds movements placing his two modest plaques of ten mille exactly opposite bonds larger ones when bond rose he too pushed back his chair and called cheerfully across the table thanks for the ride guess i owe you a drink will you join me bond had a feeling that this might be the cia man he knew he was right as they strolled off together towards the bar after bond had thrown a plaque of ten mille to the croupier and had given a mine to the huissier who drew back his chair my names felix leiter said the american glad to meet you mines bond james bond oh yes said his companion and now lets see what shall we have to celebrate bond insisted on ordering leiters haigandhaig on the rocks and then he looked carefully at the barman a dry martini he said one in a deep champagne goblet oui monsieur just a moment three measures of gordons one of vodka half a measure of kina lillet shake it very well until its icecold then add a large thin slice of lemonpeel got it certainly monsieur the barman seemed pleased with the idea gosh thats certainly a drink said leiter bond laughed when im er concentrating he explained i never have more than one drink before dinner but i do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very wellmade i hate small portions of anything particularly when they taste bad this drinks my own invention im going to patent it when i can think of a good name he watched carefully as the deep glass became frosted with the pale golden drink slightly aerated by the bruising of the shaker he reached for it and took a long sip excellent he said to the barman but if you can get a vodka made with grain instead of potatoes you will find it still better mais nenculons pas des mouches he added in an aside to the barman the barman grinned thats a vulgar way of saying we wont split hairs explained bond but leiter was still interested in bonds drink you certainly think things out he said with amusement as they carried their glasses to a corner of the room he lowered his voice youd better call it the molotov cocktail after the one you tasted this afternoon they sat down bond laughed i see that the spot marked x has been roped off and theyre making cars take a detour over the pavement i hope it hasnt frightened away any of the big money people are accepting the communist story or else they think it was a burst gasmain all the burnt trees are coming down tonight and if they work things here like they do at monte carlo there wont be a trace of the mess left in the morning leiter shook a chesterfield out of his pack im glad to be working with you on this job he said looking into his drink so im particularly glad you didnt get blown to glory our people are definitely interested they think its just as important as your friends do and they dont think theres anything crazy about it at all in fact washingtons pretty sick were not running the show but you know what the big brass is like i expect your fellows are much the same in london bond nodded apt to be a bit jealous of their scoops he admitted anyway im under your orders and im to give you any help you ask for with mathis and his boys here there may not be much that isnt taken care of already but anyway here i am im delighted you are said bond the opposition has got me and probably you and mathis too all weighed up and it seems no holds are going to be barred im glad le chiffre seems as desperate as we thought he was im afraid i havent got anything very specific for you to do but id be grateful if youd stick around the casino this evening ive got an assistant a miss lynd and id like to hand her over to you when i start playing you wont be ashamed of her shes a good looking girl he smiled at leiter and you might mark his two gunmen i cant imagine hell try a rough house but you never know i may be able to help said leiter i was a regular in our marine corps before i joined this racket if that means anything to you he looked at bond with a hint of selfdeprecation it does said bond it turned out that leiter was from texas while he talked on about his job with the joint intelligence staff of nato and the difficulty of maintaining security in an organization where so many nationalities were represented bond reflected that good americans were fine people and that most of them seemed to come from texas felix leiter was about thirtyfive he was tall with a thin bony frame and his lightweight tancoloured suit hung loosely from his shoulders like the clothes of frank sinatra his movements and speech were slow but one had the feeling that there was plenty of speed and strength in him and that he would be a tough and cruel fighter as he sat hunched over the table he seemed to have some of the jackknife quality of a falcon there was this impression also in his face in the sharpness of his chin and cheekbones and the wide wry mouth his grey eyes had a feline slant which was increased by his habit of screwing them up against the smoke of the chesterfields which he tapped out of the pack in a chain the permanent wrinkles which this habit had etched at the corners gave the impression that he smiled more with his eyes than with his mouth a mop of strawcoloured hair lent his face a boyish look which closer examination contradicted although he seemed to talk quite openly about his duties in paris bond soon noticed that he never spoke of his american colleagues in europe or in washington and he guessed that leiter held the interests of his own organization far above the mutual concerns of the north atlantic allies bond sympathized with him by the time leiter had swallowed another whisky and bond had told him about the muntzes and his short reconnaissance trip down the coast that morning it was seventhirty and they decided to stroll over to their hotel together before leaving the casino bond deposited his total capital of twentyfour million at the caisse keeping only a few notes of ten mille as pocket money as they walked across to the splendide they saw that a team of workmen was already busy at the scene of the explosion several trees were uprooted and hoses from three municipal tank cars were washing down the boulevard and pavements the bombcrater had disappeared and only a few passersby had paused to gape bond assumed that similar facelifting had already been carried out at the hermitage and to the shops and frontages which had lost their windows in the warm blue dusk royaleleseaux was once again orderly and peaceful whos the concierge working for asked leiter as they approached the hotel bond was not sure and said so mathis had been unable to enlighten him unless you have bought him yourself he had said you must assume that he has been bought by the other side all concierges are venal it is not their fault they are trained to regard all hotel guests except maharajahs as potential cheats and thieves they have as much concern for your comfort or wellbeing as crocodiles bond remembered mathiss pronouncement when the concierge hurried up to inquire whether he had recovered from his most unfortunate experience of the afternoon bond thought it well to say that he still felt a little shaky he hoped that if the intelligence were relayed le chiffre would at any rate start playing that evening with a basic misinterpretation of his adversarys strength the concierge proffered glycerine hopes for bonds recovery leiters room was on one of the upper floors and they parted company at the lift after arranging to see each other at the casino at around half past ten or eleven the usual hour for the high tables to begin play chapter pink lights and champagne bond walked up to his room which again showed no sign of trespass threw off his clothes took a long hot bath followed by an icecold shower and lay down on his bed there remained an hour in which to rest and compose his thoughts before he met the girl in the splendide bar an hour to examine minutely the details of his plans for the game and for after the game in all the various circumstances of victory or defeat he had to plan the attendant roles of mathis leiter and the girl and visualize the reactions of the enemy in various contingencies he closed his eyes and his thoughts pursued his imagination through a series of carefully constructed scenes as if he was watching the tumbling chips of coloured glass in a kaleidoscope at twenty minutes to nine he had exhausted all the permutations which might result from his duel with le chiffre he rose and dressed dismissing the future completely from his mind as he tied his thin doubleended black satin tie he paused for a moment and examined himself levelly in the mirror his greyblue eyes looked calmly back with a hint of ironical inquiry and the short lock of black hair which would never stay in place slowly subsided to form a thick comma above his right eyebrow with the thin vertical scar down his right cheek the general effect was faintly piratical not much of hoagy carmichael there thought bond as he filled a flat light gunmetal box with fifty of the morland cigarettes with the triple gold band mathis had told him of the girls comment he slipped the case into his hip pocket and snapped his oxidized ronson to see if it needed fuel after pocketing the thin sheaf of tenmille notes he opened a drawer and took out a light chamois leather holster and slipped it over his left shoulder so that it hung about three inches below his armpit he then took from under his shirts in another drawer a very flat beretta automatic with a skeleton grip extracted the clip and the single round in the barrel and whipped the action to and fro several times finally pulling the trigger on the empty chamber he charged the weapon again loaded it put up the safety catch and dropped it into the shallow pouch of the shoulderholster he looked carefully round the room to see if anything had been forgotten and slipped his singlebreasted dinnerjacket coat over his heavy silk evening shirt he felt cool and comfortable he verified in the mirror that there was absolutely no sign of the flat gun under his left arm gave a final pull at his narrow tie and walked out of the door and locked it when he turned at the foot of the short stairs towards the bar he heard the liftdoor open behind him and a cool voice call good evening it was the girl she stood and waited for him to come up to her he had remembered her beauty exactly he was not surprised to be thrilled by it again her dress was of black velvet simple and yet with the touch of splendour that only half a dozen couturiers in the world can achieve there was a thin necklace of diamonds at her throat and a diamond clip in the low vee which just exposed the jutting swell of her breasts she carried a plain black evening bag a flat object which she now held her arm akimbo at her waist her jet black hair hung straight and simple to the final inward curl below the chin she looked quite superb and bonds heart lifted you look absolutely lovely business must be good in the radio world she put her arm through his do you mind if we go straight into dinner she asked i want to make a grand entrance and the truth is theres a horrible secret about black velvet it marks when you sit down and by the way if you hear me scream tonight i shall have sat on a cane chair bond laughed of course lets go straight in well have a glass of vodka while we order our dinner she gave him an amused glance and he corrected himself or a cocktail of course if you prefer it the food heres the best in royale for an instant he felt nettled at the irony the light shadow of a snub with which she had met his decisiveness and at the way he had risen to her quick glance but it was only an infinitesimal clink of foils and as the bowing maњtre dhtel led them through the crowded room it was forgotten as bond in her wake watched the heads of the diners turn to look at her the fashionable part of the restaurant was beside the wide crescent of window built out like the broad stern of a ship over the hotel gardens but bond had chosen a table in one of the mirrored alcoves at the back of the great room these had survived from the edwardian days and they were secluded and gay in white and gilt with the red silkshaded table and wall lights of the late empire as they deciphered the maze of purple ink which covered the double folio menu bond beckoned to the sommelier he turned to his companion have you decided i would love a glass of vodka she said simply and went back to her study of the menu a small carafe of vodka very cold ordered bond he said to her abruptly i cant drink the health of your new frock without knowing your christian name vesper she said vesper lynd bond gave her a look of inquiry its rather a bore always having to explain but i was born in the evening on a very stormy evening according to my parents apparently they wanted to remember it she smiled some people like it others dont im just used to it i think its a fine name said bond an idea struck him can i borrow it he explained about the special martini he had invented and his search for a name for it the vesper he said it sounds perfect and its very appropriate to the violet hour when my cocktail will now be drunk all over the world can i have it so long as i can try one first she promised it sounds a drink to be proud of well have one together when all this is finished said bond win or lose and now have you decided what you would like to have for dinner please be expensive he added as he sensed her hesitation or youll let down that beautiful frock id made two choices she laughed and either would have been delicious but behaving like a millionaire occasionally is a wonderful treat and if youre sure well id like to start with caviar and then have a plain grilled rognon de veau with pommes souffls and then id like to have fraises des bois with a lot of cream is it very shameless to be so certain and so expensive she smiled at him inquiringly its a virtue and anyway its only a good plain wholesome meal he turned to the maњtre dhtel and bring plenty of toast the trouble always is he explained to vesper not how to get enough caviar but how to get enough toast with it now he turned back to the menu i myself will accompany mademoiselle with the caviar but then i would like a very small tournedos underdone with sauce barnaise and a coeur dartichaut while mademoiselle is enjoying the strawberries i will have half an avocado pear with a little french dressing do you approve the maњtre dhtel bowed my compliments mademoiselle and monsieur monsieur george he turned to the sommelier and repeated the two dinners for his benefit parfait said the sommelier proffering the leatherbound wine list if you agree said bond i would prefer to drink champagne with you tonight it is a cheerful wine and it suits the occasion i hope he added yes i would like champagne she said with his finger on the page bond turned to the sommelier the taittinger a fine wine monsieur said the sommelier but if monsieur will permit he pointed with his pencil the blanc de blanc brut of the same marque is without equal bond smiled so be it he said that is not a wellknown brand bond explained to his companion but it is probably the finest champagne in the world he grinned suddenly at the touch of pretension in his remark you must forgive me he said i take a ridiculous pleasure in what i eat and drink it comes partly from being a bachelor but mostly from a habit of taking a lot of trouble over details its very pernickety and oldmaidish really but then when im working i generally have to eat my meals alone and it makes them more interesting when one takes trouble vesper smiled at him i like it she said i like doing everything fully getting the most out of everything one does i think thats the way to live but it sounds rather schoolgirlish when one says it she added apologetically the little carafe of vodka had arrived in its bowl of crushed ice and bond filled their glasses well i agree with you anyway he said and now heres luck for tonight vesper yes said the girl quietly as she held up her small glass and looked at him with a curious directness straight in the eyes i hope all will go well tonight she seemed to bond to give a quick involuntary shrug of the shoulders as she spoke but then she leant impulsively towards him i have some news for you from mathis he was longing to tell you himself its about the bomb its a fantastic story chapter the game is baccarat bond looked round but there was no possibility of being overheard and the caviar would be waiting for the hot toast from the kitchens tell me his eyes glittered with interest they got the third bulgar on the road to paris he was in a citron and he had picked up two english hikers as protective colouring at the roadblock his french was so bad that they asked for his papers and he brought out a gun and shot one of the motorcycle patrol but the other man got him i dont know how and managed to stop him committing suicide then they took him down to rouen and extracted the story in the usual french fashion i suppose apparently they were part of a pool held in france for this sort of job saboteurs thugs and so on and mathiss friends are already trying to round up the rest they were to get two million francs for killing you and the agent who briefed them told them there was absolutely no chance of being caught if they followed his instructions exactly she took a sip of vodka but this is the interesting part the agent gave them the two cameracases you saw he said the bright colours would make it easier for them he told them that the blue case contained a very powerful smokebomb the red case was the explosive as one of them threw the red case the other was to press a switch on the blue case and they would escape under cover of the smoke in fact the smokebomb was a pure invention to make the bulgars think they could get away both cases contained an identical highexplosive bomb there was no difference between the blue and the red cases the idea was to destroy you and the bombthrowers without trace presumably there were other plans for dealing with the third man go on said bond full of admiration for the ingenuity of the doublecross well apparently the bulgars thought this sounded very fine but cannily they decided to take no chances it would be better they thought to touch off the smokebomb first and from inside the cloud of smoke hurl the explosive bomb at you what you saw was the assistant bombthrower pressing down the lever on the phoney smokebomb and of course they both went up together the third bulgar was waiting behind the splendide to pick his two friends up when he saw what had happened he assumed they had bungled but the police picked up some fragments of the unexploded red bomb and he was confronted with them when he saw that they had been tricked and that his two friends were meant to be murdered with you he started to talk i expect hes still talking now but theres nothing to link all this with le chiffre they were given the job by some intermediary perhaps one of le chiffres guards and le chiffres name means absolutely nothing to the one who survived she finished her story just as the waiters arrived with the caviar a mound of hot toast and small dishes containing finely chopped onion and grated hardboiled egg the white in one dish and the yoke in another the caviar was heaped on to their plates and they ate for a time in silence after a while bond said its very satisfactory to be a corpse who changes places with his murderers for them it certainly was a case of being hoist with their own petard mathis must be very pleased with the days work five of the opposition neutralized in twentyfour hours and he told her how the muntzes had been confounded incidentally he asked how did you come to get mixed up in this affair what section are you in im personal assistant to head of s said vesper as it was his plan he wanted his section to have a hand in the operation and he asked m if i could go it seemed only to be a liaison job so m said yes although he told my chief that you would be furious at being given a woman to work with she paused and when bond said nothing continued i had to meet mathis in paris and come down with him ive got a friend who is a vendeuse with dior and somehow she managed to borrow me this and the frock i was wearing this morning otherwise i couldnt possibly have competed with all these people she made a gesture towards the room the office was very jealous although they didnt know what the job was all they knew was that i was to work with a double o of course youre our heroes i was enchanted bond frowned its not difficult to get a double o number if youre prepared to kill people he said thats all the meaning it has its nothing to be particularly proud of ive got the corpses of a japanese cipher expert in new york and a norwegian double agent in stockholm to thank for being a double probably quite decent people they just got caught up in the gale of the world like that yugoslav that tito bumped off its a confusing business but if its ones profession one does what ones told how do you like the grated egg with your caviar its a wonderful combination she said im loving my dinner it seems a shame she stopped warned by a cold look in bonds eye if it wasnt for the job we wouldnt be here he said suddenly he regretted the intimacy of their dinner and of their talk he felt he had said too much and that what was only a working relationship had become confused lets consider what has to be done he said in a matteroffact voice id better explain what im going to try and do and how you can help which isnt very much im afraid he added now these are the basic facts he proceeded to sketch out the plan and enumerate the various contingencies which faced them the maњtre dhtel supervised the serving of the second course and then as they ate the delicious food bond continued she listened to him coldly but with attentive obedience she felt thoroughly deflated by his harshness while admitting to herself that she should have paid more heed to the warning of head of s hes a dedicated man her chief had said when he gave her the assignment dont imagine this is going to be any fun he thinks of nothing but the job on hand and while its on hes absolute hell to work for but hes an expert and there arent many about so you wont be wasting your time hes a goodlooking chap but dont fall for him i dont think hes got much heart anyway good luck and dont get hurt all this had been something of a challenge and she was pleased when she felt she attracted and interested him as she knew intuitively that she did then at a hint that they were finding pleasure together a hint that was only the first words of a conventional phrase he had suddenly turned to ice and had brutally veered away as if warmth were poison to him she felt hurt and foolish then she gave a mental shrug and concentrated with all her attention on what he was saying she would not make the same mistake again and the main hope is to pray for a run of luck for me or against him bond was explaining just how baccarat is played its much the same as any other gambling game the odds against the banker and the player are more or less even only a run against either can be decisive and break the bank or break the players tonight le chiffre we know has bought the baccarat bank from the egyptian syndicate which is running the high tables here he paid a million francs for it and his capital has been reduced to twentyfour million i have about the same there will be ten players i expect and we sit round the banker at a kidneyshaped table generally this table is divided into two tableaux the banker plays two games one against each of the tableaux to left and right of him in the game that banker should be able to win by playing off one tableaux against the other and by firstclass accountancy but there arent enough baccarat players yet at royale and le chiffre is just going to pit his luck against the other players at the single tableau its unusual because the odds in favour of the banker arent so good but theyre a shade in his favour and of course he has control of the size of the stakes well the banker sits there in the middle with a croupier to rake in the cards and call the amount of each bank and a chef de partie to umpire the game generally i shall be sitting as near dead opposite le chiffre as i can get in front of him he has a shoe containing six packs of cards well shuffled theres absolutely no chance of tampering with the shoe the cards are shuffled by the croupier and cut by one of the players and put into the shoe in full view of the table weve checked on the staff and theyre all okay it would be useful but almost impossible to mark all the cards and it would mean the connivance at least of the croupier anyway we shall be watching for that too bond drank some champagne and continued now what happens at the game is this the banker announces an opening bank of five hundred thousand francs of five hundred pounds as it is now each seat is numbered from the right of the banker and the player next to the banker or number can accept this bet and push his money out on to the table or pass it if it is too much for him or he doesnt want to take it then number has the right to take it and if he refuses then number and so on round the table if no single player takes it all the bet is offered to the table as a whole and everyone chips in including sometimes the spectators round the table until the five hundred thousand is made up that is a small bet which would immediately be met but when it gets to a million or two its often difficult to find a taker or even if the bank seems to be in luck a group of takers to cover the bet at the moment i shall always try and step in and accept the bet in fact i shall attack le chiffres bank whenever i get a chance until either ive bust his bank or hes bust me it may take some time but in the end one of us is bound to break the other irrespective of the other players at the table although they can of course make him richer or poorer in the meantime being the banker hes got a slight advantage in the play but knowing that im making a dead set at him and not knowing i hope my capital is bound to play on his nerves a bit so im hoping that we start about equal he paused while the strawberries came and the avocado pear for a while they ate in silence then they talked of other things while the coffee was served they smoked neither of them drank brandy or a liqueur finally bond felt it was time to explain the actual mechanics of the game its a simple affair he said and youll understand it at once if youve ever played vingtetun where the object is to get cards from the banker which add up more closely to a count of twentyone than his do in this game i get two cards and the banker gets two and unless anyone wins outright either or both of us can get one more card the object of the game is to hold two or three cards which together count nine points or as nearly nine as possible court cards and tens count nothing aces one each any other card its face value it is only the last figure of your count that signifies so nine plus seven equals six not sixteen the winner is the one whose count is nearest to nine draws are played over again vesper listened attentively but she also watched the look of abstract passion on bonds face now bond continued when the banker deals me my two cards if they add up to eight or nine theyre a natural and i turn them up and i win unless he has an equal or a better natural if i havent got a natural i can stand on a seven or a six perhaps ask for a card or perhaps not on a five and certainly ask for a card if my count is lower than five five is the turning point of the game according to the odds the chances of bettering or worsening your hand if you hold a five are exactly even only when i ask for a card or tap mine to signify that i stand on what i have can the banker look at his if he has a natural he turns them up and wins otherwise he is faced with the same problems as i was but he is helped in his decision to draw or not to draw a third card by my actions if i have stood he must assume that i have a five six or seven if i have drawn he will know that i had something less than a six and i may have improved my hand or not with the card he gave me and this card was dealt to me face up on its face value and a knowledge of the odds he will know whether to take another card or to stand on his own so he has a very slight advantage over me he has a tiny help over his decision to draw or to stand but there is always one problem card at this game shall one draw or stand on a five and what will your opponent do with a five some players always draw or always stand i follow my intuition but in the end bond stubbed out his cigarette and called for the bill its the natural eights and nines that matter and i must just see that i get more of them than he does chapter the high table while telling the story of the game and anticipating the coming fight bonds face had lit up again the prospect of at least getting to grips with le chiffre stimulated him and quickened his pulse he seemed to have completely forgotten the brief coolness between them and vesper was relieved and entered into his mood he paid the bill and gave a handsome tip to the sommelier vesper rose and led the way out of the restaurant and out on to the steps of the hotel the big bentley was waiting and bond drove vesper over parking as close to the entrance as he could as they walked through the ornate anterooms he hardly spoke she looked at him and saw that his nostrils were slightly flared in other respects he seemed completely at ease acknowledging cheerfully the greetings of the casino functionaries at the door to the salle prive they were not asked for their membership cards bonds high gambling had already made him a favoured client and any companion of his shared in the glory before they had penetrated very far into the main room felix leiter detached himself from one of the roulette tables and greeted bond as an old friend after being introduced to vesper lynd and exchanging a few remarks leiter said well since youre playing baccarat this evening will you allow me to show miss lynd how to break the bank at roulette ive got three lucky numbers that are bound to show soon and i expect miss lynd has some too then perhaps we could come and watch you when your game starts to warm up bond looked inquiringly at vesper i should love that she said but will you give me one of your lucky numbers to play on i have no lucky numbers said bond unsmilingly i only bet on even chances or as near them as i can get well i shall leave you then he excused himself you will be in excellent hands with my friend felix leiter he gave a short smile which embraced them both and walked with an unhurried gait towards the caisse leiter sensed the rebuff hes a very serious gambler miss lynd he said and i guess he has to be now come with me and watch number obey my extrasensory perceptions youll find it quite a painless sensation being given plenty of money for nothing bond was relieved to be on his own again and to be able to clear his mind of everything but the task on hand he stood at the caisse and took his twentyfour million francs against the receipt which had been given him that afternoon he divided the notes into equal packets and put half the sum into his righthand coat pocket and the other half into the left then he strolled slowly across the room between the thronged tables until he came to the top of the room where the broad baccarat table waited behind the brass rail the table was filling up and the cards were spread face down being stirred and mixed slowly in what is known as the croupiers shuffle supposedly the shuffle which is most effective and least susceptible to cheating the chef de partie lifted the velvetcovered chain which allowed entrance through the brass rail ive kept number as you wished monsieur bond there were still three other empty places at the table bond moved inside the rail to where a huissier was holding out his chair he sat down with a nod to the players on his right and left he took out his wide gunmetal cigarettecase and his black lighter and placed them on the green baize at his right elbow the huissier wiped a thick glass ashtray with a cloth and put it beside them bond lit a cigarette and leant back in his chair opposite him the bankers chair was vacant he glanced round the table he knew most of the players by sight but few of their names at number on his right there was a monsieur sixte a wealthy belgian with metal interests in the congo at number there was lord danvers a distinguished but weaklooking man whose francs were presumably provided by his rich american wife a middleaged woman with the predatory mouth of a barracuda who sat at number bond reflected that they would probably play a pawky and nervous game and be amongst the early casualties at number to the right of the bank was a wellknown greek gambler who owned as in bonds experience apparently everyone does in the eastern mediterranean a profitable shipping line he would play coldly and well and would be a stayer bond asked the huissier for a card and wrote on it under a neat question mark the remaining numbers and asked the huissier to give it to the chef de partie soon it came back with the names filled in number still empty was to be carmel delane the american film star with alimony from three husbands to burn and bond assumed a call on still more from whoever her present companion at royale might be with her sanguine temperament she would play gaily and with panache and might run into a vein of luck then came lady danvers at number and numbers and were a mr and mrs du pont richlooking and might or might not have some of the real du pont money behind them bond guessed they would be stayers they both had a businesslike look about them and were talking together easily and cheerfully as if they felt very much at home at the big game bond was quite happy to have them next to him mrs du pont sat at number and he felt prepared to share with them or with monsieur sixte on his right if they found themselves faced with too big a bank at number was the maharajah of a small indian state probably with all his wartime sterling balances to play with bonds experience told him that few of the asiatic races were courageous gamblers even the muchvaunted chinese being inclined to lose heart if the going was bad but the maharajah would probably stay in the game and stand some heavy losses if they were gradual number was a prosperouslooking young italian signor tomelli who possibly had plenty of money from rackrents in milan and would probably play a dashing and foolish game he might lose his temper and make a scene bond had just finished his sketchy summingup of the players when le chiffre with the silence and economy of movement of a big fish came through the opening in the brass rail and with a cold smile of welcome for the table took his place directly opposite bond in the bankers chair with the same economy of movements the thick slab of cards which the croupier had placed on the table squarely between his blunt relaxed hands then as the croupier fitted the six packs with one swift exact motion into the metal and wooden shoe le chiffre said something quietly to him messieurs mesdames les jeux sont faits un banco de cinq cent mille and as the greek at number tapped the table in front of his fat pile of hundredmille plaques le banco est fait le chiffre crouched over the shoe he gave it a short deliberate slap to settle the cards the first of which showed its semicircular pale pink tongue through the slanting aluminium mouth of the shoe then with a thick white forefinger he pressed gently on the pink tongue and slipped out the first card six inches or a foot towards the greek on his right hand then he slipped out a card for himself then another for the greek then one more for himself he sat immobile not touching his own cards he looked at the greeks face with his flat wooden spatula like a long bricklayers trowel the croupier delicately lifted up the greeks two cards and dropped them with a quick movement an extra few inches to the right so that they lay just before the greeks pale hairy hands which lay inert like two watchful pink crabs on the table the two pink crabs scuttled out together and the greek gathered the cards into his wide left hand and cautiously bent his head so that he could see in the shadow made by his cupped hand the value of the bottom of the two cards then he slowly inserted the forefinger of his right hand and slipped the bottom card slightly sideways so that the value of the top card was also just perceptible his face was quite impassive he flattened out his left hand on the table and then withdrew it leaving the two pink cards face down before him their secret unrevealed then he lifted his head and looked le chiffre in the eye non said the greek flatly from the decision to stand on his two cards and not ask for another it was clear that the greek had a five or a six or a seven to be certain of winning the banker had to reveal an eight or a nine if the banker failed to show either figure he also had the right to take another card which might or might not improve his count le chiffres hands were clasped in front of him his two cards three or four inches away with his right hand he picked up the two cards and turned them face upwards on the table with a faint snap they were a four and a five an undefeatable natural nine he had won neuf la banque quietly said the croupier with his spatula he faced the greeks two cards et le sept he said unemotionally lifting up gently the corpses of the seven and queen and slipping them through the wide slot in the table near his chair which leads into the gib metal canister to which all dead cards are consigned le chiffres two cards followed them with a faint rattle which comes from the canister at the beginning of each session before the discards have made a cushion over the metal floor of their oubliette the greek pushed forward five plaques of one hundred thousand and the croupier added these to le chiffres half million plaque which lay in the centre of the table from each bet the casino takes a tiny percentage the cagnotte but it is usual at a big game for the banker to subscribe this himself either in a prearranged lump or by contributions at the end of each hand so that the amount of the banks stake can always be a round figure le chiffre had chosen the second course the croupier slipped some counters through the slot in the table which receives the cagnotte and announced quietly un banco dun million suivi murmured the greek meaning that he exercised his right to follow up his lost bet bond lit a cigarette and settled himself in his chair the long game was launched and the sequence of these gestures and the reiteration of this subdued litany would continue until the end came and the players dispersed then the enigmatic cards would be burnt or defaced a shroud would be draped over the table and the grassgreen baize battlefield would soak up the blood of its victims and refresh itself the greek after taking a third card could achieve no better than a four to the banks seven un banco de deux millions said the croupier the players on bonds left remained silent banco said bond chapter moment of truth le chiffre looked incuriously at him the whites of his eyes which showed all round the irises lending something impassive and dolllike to his gaze he slowly removed one thick hand from the table and slipped it into the pocket of his dinnerjacket the hand came out holding a small metal cylinder with a cap which le chiffre unscrewed he inserted the nozzle of the cylinder with an obscene deliberation twice into each black nostril in turn and luxuriously inhaled the benzedrine vapour unhurriedly he pocketed the inhaler then his hand came quickly back above the level of the table and gave the shoe its usual hard sharp slap during this offensive pantomime bond had coldly held the bankers gaze taking in the wide expanse of white face surmounted by the short abrupt cliff of reddishbrown hair the unsmiling wet red mouth and the impressive width of the shoulders loosely draped in a massively cut dinnerjacket but for the highlights on the satin of the shawlcut lapels he might have been faced by the thick bust of a blackfleeced minotaur rising out of a green grass field bond slipped a packet of notes on to the table without counting them if he lost the croupier would extract what was necessary to cover the bet but the easy gesture conveyed that bond didnt expect to lose and that this was only a token display from the deep funds at bonds disposal the other players sensed a tension between the two gamblers and there was silence as le chiffre fingered the four cards out of the shoe the croupier slipped bonds two cards across to him with the tip of his spatula bond still with his eyes holding le chiffres reached his right hand out a few inches glanced down very swiftly then as he looked up again impassively at le chiffre with a disdainful gesture he tossed the cards face upwards on the table they were a four and a five an unbeatable nine there was a little gasp of envy from the table and the players to the left of bond exchanged rueful glances at their failure to accept the two million franc bet with a hint of a shrug le chiffre slowly faced his own two cards and flicked them away with his fingernail they were two valueless knaves le baccarat intoned the croupier as he spaded the thick chips over the table to bond bond slipped them into his righthand pocket with the unused packet of notes his face showed no emotion but he was pleased with the success of his first coup and with the outcome of the silent clash of wills across the table the woman on his left the american mrs du pont turned to him with a wry smile i shouldnt have let it come to you she said directly the cards were dealt i kicked myself its only the beginning of the game said bond you may be right the next time you pass it mr du pont leant forward from the other side of his wife if one could be right every hand none of us would be here he said philosophically i would be his wife laughed you dont think i do this for pleasure as the game went on bond looked over the spectators leaning on the high brass rail round the table he soon saw le chiffres two gunmen they stood behind and to either side of the banker they looked respectable enough but not sufficiently a part of the game to be unobtrusive the one more or less behind le chiffres right arm was tall and funereal in his dinnerjacket his face was wooden and grey but his eyes flickered and gleamed like a conjurers his whole long body was restless and his hands shifted often on the brass rail bond guessed that he would kill without interest or concern for what he killed and that he would prefer strangling he had something of lennie in of mice and men but his inhumanity would not come from infantilism but from drugs marihuana decided bond the other man looked like a corsican shopkeeper he was short and very dark with a flat head covered with thickly greased hair he seemed to be a cripple a chunky malacca cane with a rubber tip hung on the rail beside him he must have had permission to bring the cane into the casino with him reflected bond who knew that neither sticks nor any other objects were allowed in the rooms as a precaution against acts of violence he looked sleek and well fed his mouth hung vacantly halfopen and revealed very bad teeth he wore a heavy black moustache and the backs of his hands on the rail were matted with black hair bond guessed that hair covered most of his squat body naked bond supposed he would be an obscene object the game continued uneventfully but with a slight bias against the bank the third coup is the sound barrier at chemindefer and baccarat your luck can defeat the first and second tests but when the third deal comes along it most often spells disaster again and again at this point you find yourself being bounced back to earth it was like that now neither the bank nor any of the players seemed to be able to get hot but there was a steady and inexorable seepage against the bank amounting after about two hours play to ten million francs bond had no idea what profits le chiffre had made over the past two days he estimated them at five million and guessed that now the bankers capital could not be more than twenty million in fact le chiffre had lost heavily all that afternoon at this moment he only had ten million left bond on the other hand by one oclock in the morning had won four million bringing his resources up to twentyeight million bond was cautiously pleased le chiffre showed no trace of emotion he continued to play like an automaton never speaking except when he gave instructions in a low aside to the croupier at the opening of each new bank outside the pool of silence round the high table there was the constant hum of the other tables chemindefer roulette and trenteetquarante interspersed with the clear calls of the croupiers and occasional bursts of laughter or gasps of excitement from different corners of the huge salle in the background there thudded always the hidden metronome of the casino ticking up its little treasure of onepercents with each spin of a wheel and each turn of a card a pulsing fatcat with a zero for a heart it was at ten minutes past one by bonds watch when at the high table the whole pattern of play suddenly altered the greek at number was still having a bad time he had lost the first coup of half a million francs and the second he passed the third time leaving a bank of two millions carmel delane at number refused it so did lady danvers at number the du ponts looked at each other banco said mrs du pont and promptly lost to the bankers natural eight un banco de quatre millions said the croupier banco said bond pushing out a wad of notes again he fixed le chiffre with his eye again he gave only a cursory look at his two cards no he said he held a marginal five the position was dangerous le chiffre turned up a knave and a four he gave the shoe another slap he drew a three sept la banque said the croupier et cinq he added as he tipped bonds losing cards face upwards he raked over bonds money extracted four million francs and returned the remainder to bond un banco de huit millions suivi said bond and lost again to a natural nine in two coups he had lost twelve million francs by scraping the barrel he had just sixteen million francs left exactly the amount of the next banco suddenly bond felt the sweat on his palms like snow in sunshine his capital had melted with the covetous deliberation of the winning gambler le chiffre was tapping a light tattoo on the table with his right hand bond looked across into the eyes of murky basalt they held an ironical question do you want the full treatment they seemed to ask suivi bond said softly he took some notes and plaques out of his right hand pocket and the entire stack of notes out of his left and pushed them forward there was no hint in his movements that this would be his last stake his mouth felt suddenly as dry as flock wallpaper he looked up and saw vesper and felix leiter standing where the gunman with the stick had stood he did not know how long they had been standing there leiter looked faintly worried but vesper smiled encouragement at him he heard a faint rattle on the rail behind him and turned his head the battery of bad teeth under the black moustache gaped vacantly back at him le jeu est fait said the croupier and the two cards came slithering towards him over the green baize a green baize which was no longer smooth but thick now and furry and almost choking its colour as livid as the grass on a fresh tomb the light from the broad satinlined shades which had seemed so welcoming now seemed to take the colour out of his hand as he glanced at the cards then he looked again it was nearly as bad as it could have been the king of hearts and an ace the ace of spades it squinted up at him like a black widow spider a card he still kept all emotion out of his voice le chiffre faced his own two cards he had a queen and a black five he looked at bond and pressed out another card with a wide forefinger the table was absolutely silent he faced it and flicked it away the croupier lifted it delicately with his spatula and slipped it over to bond it was a good card the five of hearts but to bond it was a difficult fingerprint in dried blood he now had a count of six and le chiffre a count of five but the banker having a five and giving a five would and must draw another card and try and improve with a one two three or four drawing any other card he would be defeated the odds were on bonds side but now it was le chiffre who looked across into bonds eyes and hardly glanced at the card as he flicked it face upwards on the table it was unnecessarily the best a four giving the bank a count of nine he had won almost slowing up bond was beaten and cleaned out chapter the deadly tube bond sat silent frozen with defeat he opened his wide black case and took out a cigarette he snapped open the tiny jaws of the ronson and lit the cigarette and put the lighter back on the table he took a deep lungful of smoke and expelled it between his teeth with a faint hiss what now back to the hotel and bed avoiding the commiserating eyes of mathis and leiter and vesper back to the telephone call to london and then tomorrow the plane home the taxi up to regents park the walk up the stairs and along the corridor and ms cold face across the table his forced sympathy his better luck next time and of course there couldnt be one not another chance like this he looked round the table and up at the spectators few were looking at him they were waiting while the croupier counted the money and piled up the chips in a neat stack in front of the banker waiting to see if anyone would conceivably challenge this huge bank of thirtytwo million francs this wonderful run of bankers luck leiter had vanished not wishing to look bond in the eye after the knockout he supposed yet vesper looked curiously unmoved she gave him a smile of encouragement but then bond reflected she knew nothing of the game had no notion probably of the bitterness of his defeat the huissier was coming towards bond inside the rail he stopped beside him bent over him placed a squat envelope beside bond on the table it was as thick as a dictionary said something about the caisse moved away again bonds heart thumped he took the heavy anonymous envelope below the level of the table and slit it open with his thumbnail noticing that the gum was still wet on the flap unbelieving and yet knowing it was true he felt the broad wads of notes he slipped them into his pockets retaining the halfsheet of notepaper which was pinned to the topmost of them he glanced at it in the shadow below the table there was one line of writing in ink marshall aid thirtytwo million francs with the compliments of the usa bond swallowed he looked over towards vesper felix leiter was again standing beside her he grinned slightly and bond smiled back and raised his hand from the table in a small gesture of benediction then he set his mind to sweeping away all traces of the sense of complete defeat which had swamped him a few minutes before this was a reprieve but only a reprieve there could be no more miracles this time he had to win if le chiffre had not already made his fifty million if he was going to go on the croupier had completed his task of computing the cagnotte changing bonds notes into plaques and making a pile of the giant stake in the middle of the table there lay thirtytwo thousand pounds perhaps thought bond le chiffre needed just one more coup even a minor one of a few million francs to achieve his object then he would have made his fifty million francs and would leave the table by tomorrow his deficits would be covered and his position secure he showed no signs of moving and bond guessed with relief that somehow he must have overestimated le chiffres resources the then only hope thought bond was to stamp on him now not to share the bank with the table or to take some minor part of it but to go the whole hog this would really jolt le chiffre he would hate to see more than ten or fifteen million of the stake covered and he could not possibly expect anyone to banco the entire thirtytwo millions he might not know that bond had been cleaned out but he must imagine that bond had by now only small reserves he could not know of the contents of the envelope if he did he would probably withdraw the bank and start all over again on the wearisome journey up from the five hundred thousand franc opening bet the analysis was right le chiffre needed another eight million at last he nodded un banco de trentedeux millions the croupiers voice rang out a silence built itself up round the table un banco de trentedeux millions in a louder prouder voice the chef de partie took up the cry hoping to draw big money away from the neighbouring chemindefer tables besides this was wonderful publicity the stake had only once been reached in the history of baccarat at deauville in the rival casino de la fort at le touquet had never got near it it was then that bond leant slightly forward suivi he said quietly there was an excited buzz round the table the word ran through the casino people crowded in thirtytwo million for most of them it was more than they had earned all their lives it was their savings and the savings of their families it was literally a small fortune one of the casino directors consulted with the chef de partie the chef de partie turned apologetically to bond excusez moi monsieur la mise it was an indication that bond really must show he had the money to cover the bet they knew of course that he was a very wealthy man but after all thirtytwo millions and it sometimes happened that desperate people would bet without a sou in the world and cheerfully go to prison if they lost mes excuses monsieur bond added the chef de partie obsequiously it was when bond shovelled the great wad of notes out on to the table and the croupier busied himself with the task of counting the pinned sheaves of ten thousand franc notes the largest denomination issued in france that he caught a swift exchange of glances between le chiffre and the gunman standing directly behind bond immediately he felt something hard press into the base of his spine right into the cleft between his two buttocks on the padded chair at the same time a thick voice speaking southern french said softly urgently just behind his right ear this is a gun monsieur it is absolutely silent it can blow the base of your spine off without a sound you will appear to have fainted i shall be gone withdraw your bet before i count ten if you call for help i shall fire the voice was confident bond believed it these people had shown they would unhesitatingly go the limit the thick walkingstick was explained bond knew the type of gun the barrel a series of soft rubber baffles which absorbed the detonation but allowed the passage of the bullet they had been invented and used in the war for assassinations bond had tested them himself un said the voice bond turned his head there was the man leaning forward close behind him smiling broadly under his black moustache as if he was wishing bond luck completely secure in the noise and the crowd the discoloured teeth came together deux said the grinning mouth bond looked across le chiffre was watching him his eyes glittered back at bond his mouth was open and he was breathing fast he was waiting waiting for bonds hand to gesture to the croupier or else for bond suddenly to slump backwards in his chair his face grimacing with a scream trois bond looked over at vesper and felix leiter they were smiling and talking to each other the fools where was mathis where were those famous men of his quatre and the other spectators this crowd of jabbering idiots couldnt someone see what was happening the chef de partie the croupier the huissier cinq the croupier was tidying up the pile of notes the chef de partie bowed smilingly towards bond directly the stake was in order he would announce le jeux est fait and the gun would fire whether the gunman had reached ten or not six bond decided it was a chance he carefully moved his hands to the edge of the table gripped it edged his buttocks right back feeling the sharp gunsight grind into his coccyx sept the chef de partie turned to le chiffre with his eyebrows lifted waiting for the bankers nod that he was ready to play suddenly bond heaved backwards with all his strength his momentum tipped the crossbar of the chairback down so quickly that it cracked across the malacca tube and wrenched it from the gunmans hand before he could pull the trigger bond went headoverheels on to the ground amongst the spectators feet his legs in the air the back of the chair splintered with a sharp crack there were cries of dismay the spectators cringed away and then reassured clustered back hands helped him to his feet and brushed him down the huissier bustled up with the chef de partie at all costs a scandal must be avoided bond held on to the brass rail he looked confused and embarrassed he brushed his hands across his forehead a momentary faintness he said it is nothing the excitement the heat there were expressions of sympathy naturally with this tremendous game would monsieur prefer to withdraw to lie down to go home should a doctor be fetched bond shook his head he was perfectly all right now his excuses to the table to the banker also a new chair was brought and he sat down he looked across at le chiffre through his relief at being alive he felt a moment of triumph at what he saw some fear in the fat pale face there was a buzz of speculation round the table bonds neighbours on both sides of him bent forward and spoke solicitously about the heat and the lateness of the hour and the smoke and the lack of air bond replied politely he turned to examine the crowd behind him there was no trace of the gunman but the huissier was looking for someone to claim the malacca stick it seemed undamaged but it no longer carried a rubber tip bond beckoned to him if you will give it to that gentleman over there he indicated felix leiter he will return it it belongs to an acquaintance of his the hussier bowed bond grimly reflected that a short examination would reveal to leiter why he had made such an embarrassing public display of himself he turned back to the table and tapped the green cloth in front of him to show that he was ready chapter a whisper of love a whisper of hate la partie continue announced the chef impressively un banco de trentedeux millions the spectators craned forward le chiffre hit the shoe with a flathanded slap that made it rattle as an afterthought he took out his benzedrine inhaler and sucked the vapour up his nose filthy brute said mrs du pont on bonds left bonds mind was clear again by a miracle he had survived a devastating wound he could feel his armpits still wet with the fear of it but the success of his gambit with the chair had wiped out all memories of the dreadful valley of defeat through which he had just passed he had made a fool of himself the game had been interrupted for at least ten minutes a delay unheard of in a respectable casino but now the cards were waiting for him in the shoe they must not fail him he felt his heart lift at the prospect of what was to come it was two oclock in the morning apart from the thick crowd round the big game play was still going on at three of the chemindefer games and at the same number of roulette tables in the silence round his own table bond suddenly heard a distant croupier intone neuf le rouge gagne impair et manque was this an omen for him or for le chiffre the two cards slithered towards him across the green sea like an octopus under a rock le chiffre watched him from the other side of the table bond reached out a steady right hand and drew the cards towards him would it be the lift of the heart which a nine brings or an eight brings he fanned the two cards under the curtain of his hand the muscles of his jaw rippled as he clenched his teeth his whole body stiffened in a reflex of selfdefence he had two queens two red queens they looked roguishly back at him from the shadows they were the worst they were nothing zero baccarat a card said bond fighting to keep hopelessness out of his voice he felt le chiffres eyes boring into his brain the banker slowly turned his own two cards face up he had a count of three a king and a black three bond softly exhaled a cloud of tobacco smoke he still had a chance now he was really faced with the moment of truth le chiffre slapped the shoe slipped out a card bonds fate and slowly turned it face up it was a nine a wonderful nine of hearts the card known in gipsy magic as a whisper of love a whisper of hate the card that meant almost certain victory for bond the croupier slipped it delicately across to le chiffre it meant nothing bond might have had a one in which case he now had ten points or nothing or baccarat as it is called or he might have had a two three four or even five in which case with the nine his maximum count would be four holding a three and giving nine is one of the moot situations at the game the odds are so nearly divided between to draw or not to draw bond let the banker sweat it out since his nine could only be equalled by the banker drawing a six he would normally have shown his count if it had been a friendly game bonds cards lay on the table before him the two impersonal pale pinkpatterned backs and the faced nine of hearts to le chiffre the nine might be telling the truth or many variations of lies the whole secret lay in the reverse of the two pink backs where the pair of queens kissed the green cloth the sweat was running down either side of the bankers beaky nose his thick tongue came out slyly and licked a drop out of the corner of his red gash of a mouth he looked at bonds cards and then at his own and then back at bonds then his whole body shrugged and he slipped out a card for himself from the lisping shoe he faced it the table craned it was a wonderful card a five huit la banque said the croupier as bond sat silent le chiffre suddenly grinned wolfishly he must have won the croupiers spatula reached almost apologetically across the table there was not a man at the table who did not believe bond was defeated the spatula flicked the two pink cards over on their backs the gay red queens smiled up at the lights et le neuf a great gasp went up round the table and then a hubbub of talk bonds eyes were on le chiffre the big man fell back in his chair as if slugged above the heart his mouth opened and shut once or twice and his right hand felt at his throat then he rocked back his lips were grey as the huge stack of plaques was shunted across the table to bond the banker reached into an inner pocket of his jacket and threw a wad of notes on to the table the croupier riffled through them un banco de dix millions he announced he slapped down their equivalent in ten plaques of a million each this is the kill thought bond this man has reached the point of no return this is the last of his capital he has come to where i stood an hour ago and he is making the last gesture that i made but if this man loses there is no one to come to his aid no miracle to help him bond sat back and lit a cigarette on a small table beside him half a bottle of clicquot and a glass had materialized without asking who the benefactor was bond filled the glass to the brim and drank it down in two long draughts then he leant back with his arms curled forward on the table in front of him like the arms of a wrestler seeking a hold at the opening of a bout of jujitsu the players on his left remained silent banco he said speaking straight at le chiffre once more the two cards were borne over to him and this time the croupier slipped them into the green lagoon between the outstretched arms bond curled his right hand in glanced briefly down and flipped the cards face up into the middle of the table le neuf said the croupier le chiffre was gazing down at his own two black kings et le baccarat and the croupier eased across the table the fat tide of plaques le chiffre watched them go to join the serried millions in the shadow of bonds left arm then he stood up slowly and without a word he brushed past the players to the break in the rail he unhooked the velvetcovered chain and let it fall the spectators opened a way for him they looked at him curiously and rather fearfully as if he carried the smell of death on him then he vanished from bonds sight bond stood up he took a hundredmille plaque from the stacks beside him and slipped it across the table to the chef de partie he cut short the effusive thanks and asked the croupier to have his winnings carried to the caisse the other players were leaving their seats with no bankers there could be no game and by now it was half past two he exchanged some pleasant words with his neighbours to right and left and then ducked under the rail to where vesper and felix leiter were waiting for him together they walked over to the caisse bond was invited to come into the private office of the casino directors on the desk lay his huge pile of chips he added the contents of his pockets to it in all there was over seventy million francs bond took felix leiters money in notes and took a cheque to cash on the credit lyonnais for the remaining fortyodd million he was congratulated warmly on his winnings the directors hoped that he would be playing again that evening bond gave an evasive reply he walked over to the bar and handed leiters money to him for a few minutes they discussed the game over a bottle of champagne leiter took a bullet out of his pocket and placed it on the table i gave the gun to mathis he said hes taken it away he was as puzzled as we were by the spill you took he was standing at the back of the crowd with one of his men when it happened the gunman got away without difficulty you can imagine how they kicked themselves when they saw the gun mathis gave me this bullet to show you what you escaped the nose has been cut with a dumdum cross youd have been in a terrible mess but they cant tie it on to le chiffre the man came in alone theyve got the form he filled up to get his entrance card of course itll all be phony he got permission to bring the stick in with him he had a certificate for a warwound pension these people certainly get themselves well organized theyve got his prints and theyre on the belinograph to paris so we may hear more about him in the morning felix leiter tapped out another cigarette anyway alls well that ends well you certainly took le chiffre for a ride at the end though we had some bad moments i expect you did too bond smiled that envelope was the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me i thought i was really finished it wasnt at all a pleasant feeling talk about a friend in need one day ill try and return the compliment he rose ill just go over to the hotel and put this away he said tapping his pocket i dont like wandering around with le chiffres deathwarrant on me he might get ideas then id like to celebrate a bit what do you think he turned to vesper she had hardly said a word since the end of the game shall we have a glass of champagne in the nightclub before we go to bed its called the roi galant you get to it through the public rooms it looks quite cheerful i think id love to said vesper ill tidy up while you put your winnings away ill meet you in the entrance hall what about you felix bond hoped he could be alone with vesper leiter looked at him and read his mind id rather take a little rest before breakfast he said its been quite a day and i expect paris will want me to do a bit of moppingup tomorrow there are several loose ends you wont have to worry about i shall ill walk over to the hotel with you might as well convoy the treasure ship right into port they strolled over through the shadows cast by the full moon both had their hands on their guns it was three oclock in the morning but there were several people about and the courtyard of the casino was still lined with motorcars the short walk was uneventful at the hotel leiter insisted on accompanying bond to his room it was as bond had left it six hours before no reception committee observed leiter but i wouldnt put it past them to try a last throw do you think i ought to stay up and keep you two company you get your sleep said bond dont worry about us they wont be interested in me without the money and ive got an idea for looking after that thanks for all youve done i hope we get on a job again one day suits me said leiter so long as you can draw a nine when its needed and bring vesper along with you he added dryly he went out and closed the door bond turned back to the friendliness of his room after the crowded arena of the big table and the nervous strain of the three hours play he was glad to be alone for a moment and be welcomed by his pyjamas on the bed and his hairbrushes on the dressingtable he went into the bathroom and dashed cold water over his face and gargled with a sharp mouthwash he felt the bruises on the back of his head and on his right shoulder he reflected cheerfully how narrowly he had twice that day escaped being murdered would he have to sit up all that night and wait for them to come again or was le chiffre even now on his way to le havre or bordeaux to pick up a boat for some corner of the world where he could escape the eyes and the guns of smersh bond shrugged his shoulders sufficient unto that day had been its evil he gazed for a moment into the mirror and wondered about vespers morals he wanted her cold and arrogant body he wanted to see tears and desire in her remote blue eyes and to take the ropes of her black hair in his hands and bend her long body back under his bonds eyes narrowed and his face in the mirror looked back at him with hunger he turned away and took out his pocket the cheque for forty million francs he folded this very small then he opened the door and looked up and down the corridor he left the door wide open and with his ears cocked for footsteps or the sound of the lift he set to work with a small screwdriver five minutes later he gave a lastminute survey to his handiwork put some fresh cigarettes in his case closed and locked the door and went off down the corridor and across the hall and out into the moonlight chapter la vie en rose the entrance to the roi galant was a sevenfoot golden pictureframe which had once perhaps enclosed the vast portrait of a noble european it was in a discreet corner of the kitchen the public roulette and boule room where several tables were still busy as bond took vespers arm and led her over the gilded step he fought back a hankering to borrow some money from the caisse and plaster maximums over the nearest table but he knew that this would be a brash and cheap gesture pour pater la bourgeoisie whether he won or lost it would be a kick in the teeth to the luck which had been given him the nightclub was small and dark lit only by candles in gilded candelabra whose warm light was repeated in wall mirrors set in more gold pictureframes the walls were covered in dark red satin and the chairs and banquettes in matching red plush in the far corner a trio consisting of a piano an electric guitar and drums was playing la vie en rose with muted sweetness seduction dripped on the quietly throbbing air it seemed to bond that every couple must be touching with passion under the tables they were given a corner table near the door bond ordered a bottle of veuve clicquot and scrambled eggs and bacon they sat for a time listening to the music and then bond turned to vesper its wonderful sitting here with you and knowing the jobs finished its a lovely end to the day the prizegiving he expected her to smile she said yes isnt it in a rather brittle voice she seemed to be listening carefully to the music one elbow rested on the table and her hand supported her chin but on the back of her hand and not on the palm and bond noticed that her knuckles showed white as if her fist was tightly clenched between the thumb and first two fingers of her right hand she held one of bonds cigarettes as an artist holds a crayon and though she smoked with composure she tapped the cigarette occasionally into an ashtry when the cigarette had no ash bond noticed these small things because he felt intensely aware of her and because he wanted to draw her into his own feeling of warmth and relaxed sensuality but he accepted her reserve he thought it came from a desire to protect herself from him or else it was her reaction to his coolness to her earlier in the evening his deliberate coolness which he knew had been taken as a rebuff he was patient he drank champagne and talked a little about the happenings of the day and about the personalities of mathis and leiter and about the possible consequences for le chiffre he was discreet and he only talked about the aspects of the case on which she must have been briefed by london she answered perfunctorily she said that of course they had picked out the two gunmen but had thought nothing of it when the man with the stick had gone to stand behind bonds chair they could not believe that anything would be attempted in the casino itself directly bond and leiter had left to walk over to the hotel she had telephoned paris and told ms representative of the result of the game she had had to speak guardedly and the agent had rung off without comment she had been told to do this whatever the result m had asked for the information to be passed on to him personally at any time of the day or night this was all she said she sipped at her champagne and rarely glanced at bond she didnt smile bond felt frustrated he drank a lot of champagne and ordered another bottle the scrambled eggs came and they ate in silence at four oclock bond was about to call for the bill when the maњtre dhtel appeared at their table and inquired for miss lynd he handed her a note which she took and read hastily oh its only mathis she said he says would i come to the entrance hall hes got a message for you perhaps hes not in evening clothes or something i wont be a minute then perhaps we could go home she gave him a strained smile im afraid i dont feel very good company this evening its been rather a nerveracking day im so sorry bond made a perfunctory reply and rose pushing back the table ill get the bill he said and watched her take the few steps to the entrance he sat down and lit a cigarette he felt flat he suddenly realized that he was tired the stuffiness of the room hit him as it had hit him in the casino in the early hours of the previous day he called for the bill and took a last mouthful of champagne it tasted bitter as the first glass too many always does he would have liked to have seen mathiss cheerful face and heard his news perhaps even a word of congratulation suddenly the note to vesper seemed odd to him it was not the way mathis would do things he would have asked them both to join him at the bar of the casino or he would have joined them in the nightclub whatever his clothes they would have laughed together and mathis would have been excited he had much to tell bond more than bond had to tell him the arrest of the bulgarian who had probably talked some more the chase after the man with the stick le chiffres movements when he left the casino bond shook himself he hastily paid the bill not waiting for the change he pushed back his table and walked quickly through the entrance without acknowledging the goodnights of the maњtre dhtel and the doorman he hurried through the gamingroom and looked carefully up and down the long entrance hall he cursed and quickened his step there were only one or two officials and two or three men and women in evening clothes getting their things at the vestiaire no vesper no mathis he was almost running he got to the entrance and looked along the steps to left and right down and amongst the few remaining cars the commissionaire came towards him a taxi monsieur bond waved him aside and started down the steps his eyes staring into the shadows the night air cold on his sweating temples he was halfway down when he heard a faint cry then the slam of a door way to the right with a harsh growl and stutter from the exhaust a beetlebrowed citron shot out of the shadows into the light of the moon its front wheel drive dryskidding through the loose pebbles of the forecourt its tail rocked on its soft springs as if a violent struggle was taking place on the back seat with a snarl it raced out to the wide entrance gate in a spray of gravel a small black object shot out of an open rear window and thudded into a flowerbed there was a scream of tortured rubber as the tyres caught the boulevard in a harsh lefthanded turn the deafening echo of a citrons exhaust in second gear a crash into top then a swiftly diminishing crackle as the car hared off between the shops on the main street towards the coast road bond knew he would find vespers evening bag among the flowers he ran back with it across the gravel to the brightlylit steps and scrabbled through its contents while the commissionaire hovered round him the crumpled note was there amongst the usual feminine baggage can you come out to the entrance hall for a moment i have news for your companion ren mathis chapter black hare and grey hound it was the crudest possible forgery bond leapt for the bentley blessing the impulse which had made him drive it over after dinner with the choke full out the engine answered at once to the starter and the roar drowned the faltering words of the commissionaire who jumped aside as the rear wheels whipped gravel at his piped trouserlegs as the car rocked to the left outside the gate bond ruefully longed for the frontwheel drive and low chassis of the citroen then he went fast through the gears and settled himself for the pursuit briefly savoring the echo of the huge exhaust as it came back at him from either side of the short main street through the town soon he was out on the coast road a broad highway through the sanddunes which he knew from his mornings drive had an excellent surface and was well catseyed on the bends he pushed the revs up and up hurrying the car to eighty then to ninety his huge marchal headlights boring a safe white tunnel nearly half a mile long between the walls of the night he knew the citron must have come this way he had heard the exhaust penetrate beyond the town and a little dust still hung on the bends he hoped soon to see the distant shaft of its headlights the night was still and clear only out at sea there must be a light summer mist for at intervals he could hear the foghorns lowing like iron cattle down the coast as he drove whipping the car faster and faster through the night with the other half of his mind he cursed vesper and m for having sent her on the job this was just what he had been afraid of these blithering women who thought they could do a mans work why the hell couldnt they stay at home and mind their pots and pans and stick to their frocks and gossip and leave mens work to the men and now for this to happen to him just when the job had come off so beautifully for vesper to fall for an old trick like that and get herself snatched and probably held to ranson like some bloody heroine in a strip cartoon the silly bitch bond boiled at the thought of the fix he was in of course the idea was a straight swop the girl against his cheque for forty million well he wouldnt play wouldnt think of playing she was in the service and knew what she was up against he wouldnt even ask m this job was more important than her it was just too bad she was a fine girl but he wasnt going to fall for this childish trick no dice he would try and catch the citron and shoot it out with them and if she got shot in the process that was too bad too he would have done his stuff tried to rescue her before they got her off to some hideout but if he didnt catch up with them he would get back to his hotel and go to sleep and say no more about it the next morning he would ask mathis what had happened to her and show him the note if le chiffre put the touch on bond for the money in exchange for the girl bond would do nothing and tell no one the girl would just have to take it if the commissionaire came along with the story of what he had seen bond would bluff it out by saying he had had a drunken row with the girl bonds mind raged furiously on with the problem as he flung the great car down the coast road automatically taking the curves and watching out for carts or cyclists on their way into royale on straight stretches the amherst villiers supercharger dug spurs into the bentleys twentyfive horses and the engine sent a highpitched scream of pain into the night then the revolutions mounted until he was past and on to the mph mark on the speedometer he knew he must be gaining fast loaded as she was the citron could hardly better eighty even on this road on an impulse he slowed down to seventy turned on his foglights and dowsed the twin marchals sure enough without the blinding curtain of his own lights he could see the glow of another car a mile or two down the coasts he felt under the dashboard and from a concealed holster took out a longbarrelled colt army special and laid it on the seat beside him with this if he was lucky with the surface of the road he could hope to get their tyres or their petrol tank at anything up to a hundred yards then he switched on the big lights again and screamed off in pursuit he felt calm and at ease the problem of vespers life was a problem no longer his face in the blue light from the dashboard was grim but serene ahead in the citron there were three men and the girl le chiffre was driving his big fluid body hunched forward his hands light and delicate on the wheel beside him sat the squat man who had carried the stick in the casino in his left hand he grasped a thick lever which protruded beside him almost level with the floor it might have been a lever to adjust the driving seat in the back seat was the tall thin gunman he lay back relaxed gazing at the ceiling apparently uninterested in the wild speed of the car his right hand lay caressingly on vespers left thigh which stretched out naked beside him apart from her legs which were naked to the hips vesper was only a parcel her long black velvet skirt had been lifted over her arms and head and tied above her head with a piece of rope where her face was a small gap had been torn in the velvet so that she could breathe she was not bound in any other way and she lay quiet her body moving sluggishly with the swaying of the car le chiffre was concentrating half on the road ahead and half on the onrushing glare of bonds headlights in the drivingmirror he seemed undisturbed when not more than a mile separated the hare from the hounds and he even brought the car down from eighty to sixty miles an hour now as he swept round a bend he slowed down still further a few hundred yards ahead a michelin post showed where a small parochial road crossed with the highway attention he said sharply to the man beside him the mans hand tightened on the lever a hundred yards from the crossroads he slowed to thirty in the mirror bonds great headlights were lighting up the bend le chiffre seemed to make up his mind allez the man beside him pulled the lever sharply upwards the boot at the back of the car yawned open like a whales mouth there was a tinkling clatter on the road and then a rhythmic jangling as if the car was towing lengths of chain behind it coupez the man depressed the lever sharply and the jangling stopped with a final clatter le chiffre glanced again in the mirror bonds car was just entering the bend le chiffre made a racing change and threw the citron lefthanded down the narrow sideroad at the same time dowsing his lights he stopped the car with a jerk and all three men got swiftly out and doubled back under cover of a low hedge to the crossroads now fiercely illuminated by the lights of the bentley each of them carried a revolver and the thin man also had what looked like a large black egg in his right hand the bentley screamed down towards them like an express train chapter the crawling of the skin as bond hurtled round the bend caressing the great car against the camber with an easy sway of body and hands he was working out his plan of action when the distance between the two cars had narrowed still further he imagined that the enemy driver would try to dodge off into a sideroad if he got the chance so when he got round the bend and saw no lights ahead it was a normal reflex to ease up on the accelerator and when he saw the michelin post to prepare to brake he was only doing about sixty as he approached the black patch across the righthand crown of the road which he assumed to be the shadow cast by a wayside tree even so there was no time to save himself there was suddenly a small carpet of glinting steel spikes right under his offside wing then he was on top of it bond automatically slammed the brakes full on and braced all his sinews against the wheel to correct the inevitable slew to the left but he only kept control for a split second as the rubber was flayed from his offside wheels and the rims for an instant tore up the tarmac the heavy car whirled across the road in a tearing dry skid slammed the left bank with a crash that knocked bond out of the drivingseat on to the floor and then facing back up the road it reared slowly up its front wheels spinning and its great headlights searching the sky for a split second resting on the petrol tank it seemed to paw at the heavens like a giant prayingmantis then slowly it toppled over backwards and fell with a splintering crash of coachwork and glass in the deafening silence the nearside front wheel whispered briefly on and then squeaked to a stop le chiffre and his two men only had to walk a few yards from their ambush put your guns away and get him out he ordered brusquely ill keep you covered be careful of him i dont want a corpse and hurry up its getting light the two men got down on their knees one of them took out a long knife and cut some of the fabric away from the side of the convertible hood and took hold of bonds shoulders he was unconscious and immovable the other squeezed between the upturned car and the bank and forced his way through the crumpled windowframe he eased bonds legs pinned between the steeringwheel and the fabric roof of the car then they inched him out through a hole in the hood they were sweating and filthy with dust and oil by the time they had him lying in the road the thin man felt his heart and then slapped his face hard on either side bond grunted and moved a hand the thin man slapped him again thats enough said le chiffre tie his arms and put him in the car here he threw a roll of flex to the man empty his pockets first and give me his gun he may have got some other weapons but we can get them later he took the objects the thin man handed him and stuffed them and bonds beretta into his wide pockets without examining them he left the men to it and walked back to the car his face showed neither pleasure nor excitement it was the sharp bite of the wire flex into his wrists that brought bond to himself he was aching all over as if he had been thrashed with a wooden club but when he was yanked to his feet and pushed towards the narrow sideroad where the engine of the citron was already running softly he found that no bones were broken but he felt in no mood for desperate attempts to escape and allowed himself to be dragged into the back seat of the car without resisting he felt thoroughly dispirited and weak in resolve as well as in his body he had had to take too much in the past twentyfour hours and now this last stroke by the enemy seemed almost too final this time there could be no miracles no one knew where he was and no one would miss him until well on into the morning the wreck of his car would be found before very long but it would take hours to trace the ownership to him and vesper he looked to the right past the thin man who was lying back with his eyes closed his first reaction was one of scorn damn fool girl getting herself trussed up like a chicken having her skirt pulled over her head as if the whole of this business was some kind of dormitory rag but then he felt sorry for her her naked legs looked so childlike and defenseless vesper he said softly there was no answer from the bundle in the corner and bond suddenly had a chill feeling but then she stirred slightly at the same time the thin man caught him a hard backhanded blow over the heart silence bond doubled over with the pain and to shield himself from another blow only to get a rabbit punch on the back of the neck which made him arch back again the breath whistling through his teeth the thin man had hit him a hard professional cutting blow with the edge of the hand there was something rather deadly about his accuracy and lack of effort he was now again lying back his eyes closed he was a man to make you afraid an evil man bond hoped he might get a chance of killing him suddenly the boot of the car was thrown open and there was a clanking crash bond guessed that they had been waiting for the third man to retrieve the carpet of spiked chainmail he assumed it must be an adaptation of the nailstudded devices used by the resistance against german staffcars again he reflected on the efficiency of these people and the ingenuity of the equipment they used had m underestimated their resourcefulness he stifled a desire to place the blame on london it was he who should have known he who should have been warned by small signs and taken infinitely more precautions he squirmed as he thought of himself washing down champagne in the roi galant while the enemy was busy preparing his counterstroke he cursed himself and cursed the hubris which had made him so sure the battle was won and the enemy in flight all this time le chiffre had said nothing directly the boot was shut the third man whom bond at once recognized climbed in beside him and le chiffre reversed furiously back on to the main road then he banged the gear lever through the gate and was soon doing seventy on down the coast by now it was dawn about five oclock bond guessed and he reflected that a mile or two on was the turning to le chiffres villa he had not thought that they would take vesper there now that he realized that vesper had only been a sprat to catch a mackerel the whole picture became clear it was an extremely unpleasant picture for the first time since his capture fear came to bond and crawled up his spine ten minutes later the citron lurched to the left ran on a hundred yards up a small sideroad partly overgrown with grass and then between a pair of dilapidated stucco pillars into an unkempt forecourt surrounded by a high wall they drew up in front of a peeling white door above a rusty bellpush in the doorframe small zinc letters on a wooden base spelled out les noctambules and underneath sonnez svp from what bond could see of the cement frontage the villa was typical of the french seaside style he could imagine the dead bluebottles being hastily swept out for the summer let and the stale rooms briefly aired by a cleaning woman sent by the estate agent in royale every five years one coat of whitewash would be slapped over the rooms and the outside woodwork and for a few weeks the villa would present a smiling front to the world then the winter rains would get to work and the imprisoned flies and quickly the villa would take on again its abandoned look but bond reflected it would admirably serve le chiffres purpose this morning if he was right in assuming what that was to be they had passed no other house since his capture and from his reconnaissance of the day before he knew there was only an occasional farm for several miles to the south as he was urged out of the car with a sharp crack in the ribs from the thin mans elbow he knew that le chiffre could have them both to himself undisturbed for several hours again his skin crawled le chiffre opened the door with a key and disappeared inside vesper looking incredibly indecent in the early light of day was pushed in after him with a torrent of lewd french from the man whom bond knew to himself as the corsican bond followed without giving the thin man a chance to urge him the key of the front door turned in the lock le chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the right he crooked a finger at bond in a silent spidery summons vesper was being led down a passage towards the back of the house bond suddenly decided with a wild backward kick which connected with the thin mans shins and brought a whistle of pain from him he hurled himself down the passage after her with only his feet as weapons there was no plan in his mind except to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with the girl no other plan was possible he just wanted to tell her not to give in as the corsican turned at the commotion bond was on him and his right shoe was launched in a flying kick at the other mans groin like lightning the corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and as bonds foot whistled past his hip he very quickly but somehow delicately shot out his left hand caught bonds shoe at the top of its arch and twisted it sharply completely off balance bonds other foot left the ground in the air his whole body turned and with the momentum of his rush behind it crashed sideways and down on to the floor for a moment he lay there all the breath knocked out of him then the thin man came and hauled him up against the wall by his collar he had a gun in his hand he looked bond inquisitively in the eyes then unhurriedly he bent down and swiped the barrel viciously across bonds shins bond grunted and caved at the knees if there is a next time it will be across your teeth said the thin man in bad french a door slammed vesper and the corsican had disappeared bond turned his head to the right le chiffre had moved a few feet out into the passage he lifted his finger and crooked it again then for the first time he spoke come my dear friend we are wasting our time he spoke in english with no accent his voice was low and soft and unhurried he showed no emotion he might have been a doctor summoning the next patient from the waitingroom a hysterical patient who had been expostulating feebly with a nurse bond again felt puny and impotent nobody but an expert in jujitsu could have handled him with the corsicans economy and lack of fuss the cold precision with which the thin man had paid him back in his own coin had been equally unhurried even artistic almost docilely bond walked back down the passage he had nothing but a few more bruises to show for his clumsy gesture of resistance to these people as he preceded the thin man over the threshold he knew that was utterly and absolutely in their power chapter my dear boy it was a large bare room sparsely furnished in cheap french art nouveau style it was difficult to say whether it was intended as a living or diningroom for a flimsylooking mirrored sideboard sporting an orange crackleware fruit dish and two painted wooden candlesticks took up most of the wall opposite the door and contradicted the faded pink sofa ranged against the other side of the room there was no table in the centre under the alabasterine ceiling light only a small square of stained carpet with a futurist design in contrasting browns over by the window was an incongruouslooking thronelike chair in carved oak with a red velvet seat a low table on which stood an empty water carafe and two glasses and a light armchair with a round cane seat and no cushion halfclosed venetian blinds obscured the view from the window but cast bars of early sunlight over the few pieces of furniture and over part of the brightly papered wall and the brown stained floorboards le chiffre pointed at the cane chair that will do excellently he said to the thin man prepare him quickly if he resists damage him only a little he turned to bond there was no expression on his large face and his round eyes were uninterested take off your clothes for every effort to resist basil will break one of your fingers we are serious people and your good health is of no interest to us whether you live or die depends on the outcome of the talk we are about to have he made a gesture towards the thin man and left the room the thin mans first action was a curious one he opened the claspknife he had used on the hood of bonds car took the small armchair and with a swift motion he cut out its cane seat then he came back to bond sticking the still open knife like a fountainpen in the vest pocket of his coat he turned bond round to the light and unwound the flex from his wrists then he stood quickly aside and the knife was back in his right hand vite bond stood chafing his swollen wrists and debating with himself how much time he could waste by resisting he only delayed an instant with a swift step and a downward sweep of his free hand the thin man seized the collar of his dinnerjacket and dragged it down pinning bonds arms back bond made the traditional counter to this old policemans hold by dropping down on one knee but as he dropped the thin man dropped with him and at the same time brought his knife round and down behind bonds back bond felt the back of the blade pass down his spine there was the hiss of a sharp knife through cloth and his arms were suddenly free as the two halves of his coat fell forward he cursed and stood up the thin man was back in his previous position his knife again at the ready in his relaxed hand bond let the two halves of his dinnerjacket fall off his arms on to the floor allez said the thin man with a faint trace of impatience bond looked him in the eye and then slowly started to take off his shirt le chiffre came quietly back into the room he carried a pot of what smelt like coffee he put it on the small table near the window he also placed beside it on the table two other homely objects a threefootlong carpetbeater in twisted cane and a carving knife he settled himself comfortably on the thronelike chair and poured some of the coffee into one of the glasses with one foot he hooked forward the small armchair whose seat was now an empty circular frame of wood until it was directly opposite him bond stood stark naked in the middle of the room bruises showing livid on his white body his face a grey mask of exhaustion and knowledge of what was to come sit down there le chiffre nodded at the chair in front of him bond walked over and sat down the thin man produced some flex with this he bound bonds wrists to the arms of the chair and his ankles to the front legs he passed a double strand across his chest under the armpits and through the chairback he made no mistakes with the knots and left no play in any of the bindings all of them bit sharply into bonds flesh the legs of the chair were broadly spaced and bond could not even rock it he was utterly a prisoner naked and defenceless his buttocks and the underpart of his body protruded through the seat of the chair towards the floor le chiffre nodded to the thin man who quietly left the room and closed the door there was a packet of gauloises on the table and a lighter le chiffre lit a cigarette and swallowed a mouthful of coffee from the glass then he picked up the cane carpetbeater and resting the handle comfortably on his knee allowed the flat trefoil base to lie on the floor directly under bonds chair he looked bond carefully almost caressingly in the eyes then his wrists sprang suddenly upwards on his knee the result was startling bonds whole body arched in an involuntary spasm his face contracted in a soundless scream and his lips drew right away from his teeth at the same time his head flew back with a jerk showing the taut sinews of his neck for an instant muscles stood out in knots all over his body and his toes and fingers clenched until they were quite white then his body sagged and perspiration started to bead all over his body he uttered a deep groan le chiffre waited for his eyes to open you see dear boy he smiled a soft fat smile is the position quite clear now a drop of sweat fell off bonds chin on to his naked chest now let us get down to business and see how soon we can be finished with this unfortunate mess you have got yourself into he puffed cheerfully at his cigarette and gave an admonitory tap on the floor beneath bonds chair with his horrible and incongruous instrument my dear boy le chiffre spoke like a father the game of red indians is over quite over you have stumbled by mischance into a game for grownups and you have already found it a painful experience you are not equipped my dear boy to play games with adults and it was very foolish of your nanny in london to have sent you out here with your spade and bucket very foolish indeed and most unfortunate for you but we must stop joking my dear fellow although i am sure you would like to follow me in developing this amusing little cautionary tale he suddenly dropped his bantering tone and looked at bond sharply and venomously where is the money bonds bloodshot eyes looked emptily back at him again the upward jerk of the wrist and again bonds whole body writhed and contorted le chiffre waited until the tortured heart eased down its laboured pumping and until bonds eyes dully opened again perhaps i should explain said le chiffre i intend to continue attacking the sensitive parts of your body until you answer my question i am without mercy and there will be no relenting there is no one to stage a lastminute rescue and there is no possibility of escape for you this is not a romantic adventure story in which the villain is finally routed and the hero is given a medal and marries the girl unfortunately these things dont happen in real life if you continue to be obstinate you will be tortured to the edge of madness and then the girl will be brought in and we will set about her in front of you if that is still not enough you will both be painfully killed and i shall reluctantly leave your bodies and make my way abroad to a comfortable house which is waiting for me there i shall take up a useful and profitable career and live to a ripe and peaceful old age in the bosom of the family i shall doubtless create so you see my dear boy that i stand to lose nothing if you hand the money over so much the better if not i shall shrug my shoulders and be on my way he paused and his wrist lifted slightly on his knee bonds flesh cringed as the cane surface just touched him but you my dear fellow can only hope that i shall spare you further pain and spare your life there is no other hope for you but that absolutely none well bond closed his eyes and waited for the pain he knew that the beginning of torture is the worst there is a parabola of agony a crescendo leading up to a peak and then the nerves are blunted and react progressively less until unconsciousness and death all he could do was to pray for the peak pray that his spirit would hold out so long and then accept the long freewheel down to the final blackout he had been told by colleagues who had survived torture by the germans and the japanese that towards the end there came a wonderful period of warmth and languor leading into a sort of sexual twilight where pain turned to pleasure and where hatred and fear of the torturers turned to a masochistic infatuation it was the supreme test of will he had learnt to avoid showing this form of punchdrunkenness directly it was suspected they would either kill you at once and save themselves further useless effort or let you recover sufficiently your nerves had crept back to the other side of the parabola then they would start again he opened his eyes a fraction le chiffre had been waiting for this and like a rattlesnake the cane instrument leapt from the floor it struck again and again so that bond screamed and his body jangled in the chair like a marionette le chiffre desisted only when bonds tortured spasms showed a trace of sluggishness he sat for a while sipping his coffee and frowning slightly like a surgeon watching a cardiograph during a difficult operation when bonds eyes flickered and opened he addressed him again but now with a trace of impatience we know that the money is somewhere in your room he said you drew a cheque to cash for forty million francs and i know that you went back to the hotel to hide it for a moment bond wondered how he had been so certain directly you left for the night club continued le chiffre your room was searched by four of my people the muntzes must have helped reflected bond we found a good deal in childish hidingplaces the ballcock in the lavatory yielded an interesting little codebook and we found some more of your papers taped to the back of a drawer all the furniture has been taken to pieces and your clothes and the curtains and bedclothes have been cut up every inch of the room has been searched and all the fittings removed it is most unfortunate for you that we didnt find the cheque if we had you would now be comfortably in bed perhaps with the beautiful miss lynd instead of this he lashed upwards through the red mist of pain bond thought of vesper he could imagine how she was being used by the two gunmen they would be making the most of her before she was sent for by le chiffre he thought of the fat wet lips of the corsican and the slow cruelty of the thin man poor wretch to have been dragged into this poor little beast le chiffre was talking again torture is a terrible thing he was saying as he puffed at a fresh cigarette but it is a simple matter for the torturer particularly when the patient he smiled at the word is a man you see my dear bond with a man it is quite unnecessary to indulge in refinements with this simple instrument or with almost any other object one can cause a man as much pain as is possible or necessary do not believe what you read in novels or books about the war there is nothing worse it is not only the immediate agony but also the thought that your manhood is being gradually destroyed and that at the end if you will not yield you will no longer be a man that my dear bond is a sad and terrible thought a long chain of agony for the body and also for the mind and then the final screaming moment when you will beg me to kill you all that is inevitable unless you tell me where you hid the money he poured some more coffee into the glass and drank it down leaving brown corners to his mouth bonds lips were writhing he was trying to say something at last he got the word out in a harsh croak drink he said and his tongue came out and swilled across his dry lips of course my dear boy how thoughtless of me le chiffre poured some coffee into the other glass there was a ring of sweat drops on the floor round bonds chair we must certainly keep your tongue lubricated he laid the handle of the carpetbeater down on the floor between his thick legs and rose from his chair he went behind bond and taking a handful of his soaking hair in one hand he wrenched bonds head sharply back he poured the coffee down bonds throat in small mouthfuls so that he would not choke then he released his head so that it fell forward again on his chest he went back to his chair and picked up the carpetbeater bond raised his head and spoke thickly money no good to you his voice was a laborious croak police trace it to you exhausted by the effort his head sank forward again he was a little but only a little exaggerating the extent of his physical collapse anything to gain time and anything to defer the next searing pain ah my dear fellow i had forgotten to tell you le chiffre smiled wolfishly we met after our little game at the casino and you were such a sportsman that you agreed we would have one more run through the pack between the two of us it was a gallant gesture typical of an english gentleman unfortunately you lost and this upset you so much that you decided to leave royale immediately for an unknown destination like the gentleman you are you very kindly gave me a note explaining the circumstances so that i would have no difficulty in cashing your cheque you see dear boy everything has been thought of and you need have no fears on my account he chuckled fatly now shall we continue i have all the time in the world and truth to tell i am rather interested to see how long a man can stand this particular form of er encouragement he rattled the harsh cane on the floor so that was the score thought bond with a final sinking of the heart the unknown destination would be under the ground or under the sea or perhaps more simply under the crashed bentley well if he had to die anyway he might as well try it the hard way he had no hope that mathis or leiter would get to him in time but at least there was a chance that they would catch up with le chiffre before he could get away it must be getting on for seven the car might have been found by now it was a choice of evils but the longer le chiffre continued the torture the more likely he would be revenged bond lifted his head and looked le chiffre in the eyes the china of the whites was now veined with red it was like looking at two blackcurrants poached in blood the rest of the wide face was yellowish except where a thick black stubble covered the moist skin the upward edges of black coffee at the corners of the mouth gave his expression a false smile and the whole face was faintly striped by the light through the venetian blinds no he said flatly you le chiffre grunted and set to work again with savage fury occasionally he snarled like a wild beast after ten minutes bond had fainted blessedly le chiffre at once stopped he wiped some sweat from his face with a circular motion of his disengaged hand then he looked at his watch and seemed to make up his mind he got up and stood behind the inert dripping body there was no colour in bonds face or anywhere on his body above the waist there was a faint flutter of his skin above the heart otherwise he might have been dead le chiffre seized bonds ears and harshly twisted them then he leant forward and slapped his cheeks hard several times bonds head rolled from side to side with each blow slowly his breathing became deeper an animal groan came from his lolling mouth le chiffre took a glass of coffee and poured some into bonds mouth and threw the rest in his face bonds eyes slowly opened le chiffre returned to his chair and waited he lit a cigarette and contemplated the spattered pool of blood on the floor beneath the inert body opposite bond groaned again pitifully it was an inhuman sound his eyes opened and he gazed dully at his torturer le chiffre spoke that is all bond we will now finish with you you understand not kill you but finish with you and then we will have in the girl and see if something can be got out of the remains of the two of you he reached towards the table say goodbye to it bond chapter a craglike face it was extraordinary to hear the third voice the hours ritual had only demanded a duologue against the horrible noise of the torture bonds dimmed senses hardly took it in then suddenly he was halfway back to consciousness he found he could see and hear again he could hear the dead silence after the one quiet word from the doorway he could see le chiffres head slowly come up and the expression of blank astonishment of innocent amazement slowly give way to fear shtop had said the voice quietly bond heard slow steps approaching behind his chair dhrop it said the voice bond saw le chiffres hand open obediently and the knife fall with a clatter to the floor he tried desperately to read into le chiffres face what was happening behind him but all he saw was blind incomprehension and terror le chiffres mouth worked but only a highpitched eek came from it his heavy cheeks trembled as he tried to collect enough saliva in his mouth to say something ask something his hands fluttered vaguely in his lap one of them made a slight movement towards his pocket but instantly fell back his round staring eyes had lowered for a split second and bond guessed there was a gun trained on him there was a moments silence smersh the word came almost with a sigh it came with a downward cadence as if nothing else had to be said it was the final explanation the last word of all no said le chiffre no i his voice tailed off perhaps he was going to explain to apologize but what he must have seen in the others face made it all useless your two men both dead you are a fool and a thief and a traitor i have been sent from the soviet union to eliminate you you are fortunate that i have only time to shoot you if it was possible i was instructed that you should die most painfully we cannot see the end of the trouble you have caused the thick voice stopped there was silence in the room save for the rasping breath of le chiffre somewhere outside a bird began to sing and there were other small noises from the awakening countryside the bands of sunlight were stronger and the sweat on le chiffres face glistened brightly do you plead guilty bond wrestled with his consciousness he screwed up his eyes and tried to shake his head to clear it but his whole nervous system was numbed and no message was transmitted to his muscles he could just keep his focus on the great pale face in front of him and on its bulging eyes a thin string of saliva crept from the open mouth and hung down from the chin yes said the mouth there was a sharp phut no louder than a bubble of air escaping from a tube of toothpaste no other noise at all and suddenly le chiffre had grown another eye a third eye on a level with the other two right where the thick nose started to jut out below the forehead it was a small black eye without eyelashes or eyebrows for a second the three eyes looked out across the room and then the whole face seemed to slip and go down on one knee the two outer eyes turned trembling up towards the ceiling then the heavy head fell sideways and the right shoulder and finally the whole upper part of the body lurched over the arm of the chair as if le chiffre were going to be sick but there was only a short rattle of his heels on the ground and then no other movement the tall back of the chair looked impassively out across the dead body in its arms there was a faint movement behind bond a hand came from behind and grasped his chin and pulled it back for a moment bond looked up into two glittering eyes behind a narrow black mask there was the impression of a craglike face under a hatbrim the collar of a fawn mackintosh he could take in nothing more before his head was pushed down again you are fortunate said the voice i have no orders to kill you your life has been saved twice in one day but you can tell your organization that smersh is only merciful by chance or by mistake in your case you were saved first by chance and now by mistake for i should have had orders to kill any foreign spies who were hanging round this traitor like flies round a dogs mess but i shall leave you my visitingcard you are a gambler you play at cards one day perhaps you will play against one of us it would be well that you should be known as a spy steps moved round to behind bonds right shoulder there was the click of a knife opening an arm in some grey material came into bonds line of vision a broad hairy hand emerging from a dirty white shirtcuff was holding a thin stiletto like a fountainpen it poised for a moment above the back of bonds right hand immovably bound with flex to the arm of the chair the point of the stiletto executed three quick straight slashes a fourth slash crossed them where they ended just short of the knuckles blood in the shape of an inverted m welled out and slowly started to drip on to the floor the pain was nothing to what bond was already suffering but it was enough to plunge him again into unconsciousness the steps moved quietly away across the room the door was softly closed in the silence the cheerful small sounds of the summers day crept through the closed window high on the lefthand wall hung two small patches of pink light they were reflections cast upwards from the floor by the zebra stripes of june sunshine cast upwards from two separate pools of blood a few feet apart as the day progressed the pink patches marched slowly along the wall and slowly they grew larger chapter the white tent you are about to awake when you dream that you are dreaming during the next two days james bond was permanently in this state without regaining consciousness he watched the procession of his dreams go by without any effort to disturb their sequence although many of them were terrifying and all were painful he knew that he was in a bed and that he was lying on his back and could not move and in one of his twilight moments he thought there were people round him but he made no effort to open his eyes and reenter the world he felt safer in the darkness and he hugged it to him on the morning of the third day a bloody nightmare shook him awake trembling and sweating there was a hand on his forehead which he associated with his dream he tried to lift an arm and smash it sideways into the owner of the hand but his arms were immovable secured to the sides of his bed his whole body was strapped down and something like a large white coffin covered him from chest to feet and obscured his view of the end of the bed he shouted a string of obscenities but the effort took all his strength and the words tailed off into a sob tears of forlornness and selfpity welled out of his eyes a womans voice was speaking and the words gradually penetrated to him it seemed to be a kind voice and it slowly came to him that he was being comforted and that this was a friend and not an enemy he could hardly believe it he had been so certain that he was still a captive and that the torture was about to begin again he felt his face being softly wiped with a cool cloth which smelt of lavender and then he sank back into his dreams when he awoke again some hours later all his terrors had gone and he felt warm and languorous sun was streaming into the bright room and garden sounds came through the window in the background there was the noise of small waves on a beach as he moved his head he heard a rustle and a nurse who had been sitting beside his pillow rose and came into his line of vision she was pretty and she smiled as she put her hand on his pulse well im certainly glad youve woken up at last ive never heard such dreadful language in my life bond smiled back at her where am i he asked and was surprised that his voice sounded firm and clear youre in a nursing home at royale and ive been sent over from england to look after you there are two of us and im nurse gibson now just lie quiet and ill go and tell the doctor youre awake youve been unconscious since they brought you in and weve been quite worried bond closed his eyes and mentally explored his body the worst pain was in his wrists and ankles and in his right hand where the russian had cut him in the centre of the body there was no feeling he assumed that he had been given a local anaesthetic the rest of his body ached dully as if he had been beaten all over he could feel the pressure of bandages everywhere and his unshaven neck and chin prickled against the sheets from the feel of the bristles he knew that he must have been at least three days without shaving that meant two since the morning of the torture he was preparing a short list of questions in his mind when the door opened and the doctor came in followed by the nurse and in the background the dear figure of mathis a mathis looking anxious behind his broad smile who put a finger to his lips and walked on tiptoe to the window and sat down the doctor a frenchman with a young and intelligent face had been detached from his duties with the deuxiљme bureau to look after bonds case he came and stood beside bond and put his hand on bonds forehead while he looked at the temperature chart behind the bed when he spoke he was forthright you have a lot of questions to ask my dear mr bond he said in excellent english and i can tell you most of the answers i do not want you to waste your strength so i will give you the salient facts and then you may have a few minutes with monsieur mathis who wishes to obtain one or two details from you it is really too early for this talk but i wish to set your mind at rest so that we can proceed with the task of repairing your body without bothering too much about your mind nurse gibson pulled up a chair for the doctor and left the room you have been here about two days continued the doctor your car was found by a farmer on the way to market in royale and he informed the police after some delay monsieur mathis heard that it was your car and he immediately went to les noctambules with his men you and le chiffre were found and also your friend miss lynd who was unharmed and according to her account suffered no molestation she was prostrated with shock but is now fully recovered and is at her hotel she has been instructed by her superiors in london to stay at royale under your orders until you are sufficiently recovered to go back to england le chiffres two gunmen are dead each killed by a single bullet in the back of the skull from the lack of expression on their faces they evidently never saw or heard their assailant they were found in the same room as miss lynd le chiffre is dead shot with a similar weapon between the eyes did you witness his death yes said bond your own injuries are serious but your life is not in danger though you have lost a lot of blood if all goes well you will recover completely and none of the functions of your body will be impaired the doctor smiled grimly but i fear that you will continue to be in pain for several days and it will be my endeavour to give you as much comfort as possible now that you have regained consciousness your arms will be freed but you must not move your body and when you sleep the nurse has orders to secure your arms again above all it is important that you rest and regain your strength at the moment you are suffering from a grave condition of mental and physical shock the doctor paused for how long were you maltreated about an hour said bond then it is remarkable that you are alive and i congratulate you few men could have supported what you have been through perhaps that is some consolation as monsieur mathis can tell you i have had in my time to treat a number of patients who have suffered similar and not one has come through it as you have done the doctor looked at bond for a moment and then turned brusquely to mathis you may have ten minutes and then you will be forcibly elected if you put the patients temperature up you will answer for it he gave them both a broad smile and left the room mathis came over and took the doctors chair thats a good man said bond i like him hes attached to the bureau said mathis he is a very good man and i will tell you about him one of these days he thinks you are a prodigy and so do i however that can wait as you can imagine there is much to clear up and i am being pestered by paris and of course london and even by washington via our good friend leiter incidentally he broke off i have a personal message from m he spoke to me himself on the telephone he simply said to tell you that he is much impressed i asked if that was all and he said well tell him that the treasury is greatly relieved then he rang off bond grinned with pleasure what most warmed him was that m himself should have rung up mathis this was quite unheard of the very existence of m let alone his identity was never admitted he could imagine the flutter this must have caused in the ultrasecurityminded organization in london a tall thin man with one arm came over from london the same day we found you continued mathis knowing from his own experience that these shop details would interest bond more than anything else and give him most pleasure and he fixed up the nurses and looked after everything even your cars being repaired for you he seemed to be vespers boss he spent a lot of time with her and gave her strict instructions to look after you head of s thought bond theyre certainly giving me the red carpet treatment now said mathis to business who killed le chiffre smersh said bond mathis gave a low whistle my god he said respectfully so they were on to him what did he look like bond explained briefly what had happened up to the moment of le chiffres death omitting all but the most essential details it cost him an effort and he was glad when it was done casting his mind back to the scene awoke the whole nightmare and the sweat began to pour off his forehead and a deep throb of pain started up in his body mathis realized that he was going too far bonds voice was getting feebler and his eyes were clouding mathis snapped shut his shorthand book and laid a hand on bonds shoulder forgive me my friend he said it is all over now and you are in safe hands all is well and the whole plan has gone splendidly we have announced that le chiffre shot his two accomplices and then committed suicide because he could not face an inquiry into the union funds strasbourg and the north are in an uproar he was considered a great hero there and a pillar of the communist party in france this story of brothels and casinos has absolutely knocked the bottom out of his organization and theyre all running around like scalded cats at the moment the communist party is giving out that he was off his head but that hasnt helped much after thorezs breakdown not long ago theyre just making it look as if all their big shots were gaga god knows how theyre going to unscramble the whole business mathis saw that his enthusiasm had had the desired effect bonds eyes were brighter one last mystery mathis said and then i promise i will go he looked at his watch the doctor will be after my skin in a moment now what about the money where is it where did you hide it we too have been over your room with a toothcomb it isnt there bond grinned it is he said more or less on the door of each room there is a small square of black plastic with the number of the room on it on the corridor side of course when leiter left me that night i simply opened the door and unscrewed my number plate and put the folded cheque underneath it and screwed the plate back itll still be there he smiled im glad theres something the stupid english can teach the clever french mathis laughed delightedly i suppose you think thats paid me back for knowing what the muntzes were up to well ill call it quits incidentally weve got them in the bag they were just some minor fry hired for the occasion well see they get a few years he rose hastily as the doctor stormed into the room and took one look at bond out he said to mathis out and dont come back mathis just had time to wave cheerfully to bond and call some hasty words of farewell before he was hustled through the door bond heard a torrent of heated french diminishing down the corridor he lay back exhausted but heartened by all he had heard he found himself thinking of vesper as he quickly drifted off into a troubled sleep there were still questions to be answered but they could wait chapter the nature of evil bond made good progress when mathis came to see him three days later he was propped up in bed and his arms were free the lower half of his body was still shrouded in the oblong tent but he looked cheerful and it was only occasionally that a twinge of pain narrowed his eyes mathis looked crestfallen heres your cheque he said to bond ive rather enjoyed walking around with forty million francs in my pocket but i suppose youd better sign it and ill put it to your account with the crdit lyonnais theres no sign of our friend from smersh not a damn trace he must have got to the villa on foot or on a bicycle because you heard nothing of his arrival and the two gunmen obviously didnt its pretty exasperating weve got precious little on this smersh organization and neither has london washington said they had but it turned out to be the usual waffle from refugee interrogation and you know thats about as much good as interrogating an english maninthe street about his own secret service or a frenchman about the deuxiљme he probably came from leningrad to berlin via warsaw said bond from berlin theyve got plenty of routes open to the rest of europe hes back home by now being told off for not shooting me too i fancy theyve got quite a file on me in view of one or two of the jobs ms given me since the war he obviously thought he was being smart enough cutting his initial in my hand whats that asked mathis the doctor said the cuts looked like a square m with a tail to the top he said they didnt mean anything well i only got a glimpse before i passed out but ive seen the cuts several times while they were being dressed and im pretty certain they are the russian letter for sh its rather like an inverted m with a tail that would make sense smersh is short for smyert shpionam death to spies and he thinks hes labelled me as a shpion its a nuisance because m will probably say ive got to go to hospital again when i get back to london and have new skin grafted over the whole of the back of my hand it doesnt matter much ive decided to resign mathis looked at him with his mouth open resign he asked incredulously what the hell for bond looked away from mathis he studied his bandaged hands when i was being beaten up he said i suddenly liked the idea of being alive before le chiffre began he used a phrase which stuck in my mind playing red indians he said thats what i had been doing well i suddenly thought he might be right you see he said still looking down at his bandages when ones young it seems very easy to distinguish between right and wrong but as one gets older it becomes more difficult at school its easy to pick out ones own villains and heroes and one grows up wanting to be a hero and kill the villains he looked obstinately at mathis well in the last few years ive killed two villains the first was in new york a japanese cipher expert cracking our codes on the thirtysixth floor of the rca building in the rockefeller centre where the japs had their consulate i took a room on the fortieth floor of the nextdoor skyscraper and i could look across the street into his room and see him working then i got a colleague from our organization in new york and a couple of remington thirtythirtys with telescopic sights and silencers we smuggled them up to my room and sat for days waiting for our chance he shot at the man a second before me his job was only to blast a hole through the windows so that i could shoot the jap through it they have tough windows at the rockefeller centre to keep the noise out it worked very well as i expected his bullet got deflected by the glass and went god knows where but i shot immediately after him through the hole he had made i got the jap in the mouth as he turned to gape at the broken window bond smoked for a minute it was a pretty sound job nice and clean too three hundred yards away no personal contact the next time in stockholm wasnt so pretty i had to kill a norwegian who was doubling against us for the germans hed managed to get two of our men captured probably bumped off for all i know for various reasons it had to be an absolutely silent job i chose the bedroom of his flat and a knife and well he just didnt die very quickly for those two jobs i was awarded a double o number in the service felt pretty clever and got a reputation for being good and tough a double o number in our service means youve had to kill a chap in cold blood in the course of some job now he looked up again at mathis thats all very fine the hero kills two villains but when the hero le chiffre starts to kill the villain bond and the villain bond knows he isnt a villain at all you see the other side of the medal the villains and heroes get all mixed up of course he added as mathis started to expostulate patriotism comes along and makes it seem fairly all right but this countryrightorwrong business is getting a little outofdate today we are fighting communism okay if id been alive fifty years ago the brand of conservatism we have today would have been damn near called communism and we should have been told to go and fight that history is moving pretty quickly these days and the heroes and villains keep on changing parts mathis stared at him aghast then he tapped his head and put a calming hand on bonds arm you mean to say that this precious le chiffre who did his best to turn you into a eunuch doesnt qualify as a villain he asked anyone would think from the rot you talk that he had been battering your head instead of your he gestured down the bed you wait till m tells you to get after another le chiffre i bet youll go after him all right and what about smersh i can tell you i dont like the idea of these chaps running around france killing anyone they feel has been a traitor to their precious political system youre a bloody anarchist he threw his arms in the air and let them fall helplessly to his sides bond laughed all right he said take our friend le chiffre its simple enough to say he was an evil man at least its simple enough for me because he did evil things to me if he was here now i wouldnt hesitate to kill him but out of personal revenge and not im afraid for some high moral reason or for the sake of my country he looked up at mathis to see how bored he was getting with these introspective refinements of what to mathis was a simple question of duty mathis smiled back at him continue my dear friend it is interesting for me to see this new bond englishmen are so odd they are like a nest of chinese boxes it takes a very long time to get to the centre of them when one gets there the result is unrewarding but the process is instructive and entertaining continue develop your arguments there may be something i can use to my own chief the next time i want to get out of an unpleasant job he grinned maliciously bond ignored him now in order to tell the difference between good and evil we have manufactured two images representing the extremes representing the deepest black and the purest white and we call them god and the devil but in doing so we have cheated a bit god is a clear image you can see every hair on his beard but the devil what does he look like bond looked triumphantly at mathis mathis laughed ironically a woman its all very fine said bond but ive been thinking about these things and im wondering whose side i ought to be on im getting very sorry for the devil and his disciples such as the good le chiffre the devil has a rotten time and i always like to be on the side of the underdog we dont give the poor chap a chance theres a good book about goodness and how to be good and so forth but theres no evil book about evil and how to be bad the devil has no prophets to write his ten commandments and no team of authors to write his biography his case has gone completely by default we know nothing about him but a lot of fairy stories from our parents and schoolmasters he has no book from which we can learn the nature of evil in all its forms with parables about evil people proverbs about evil people folklore about evil people all we have is the living example of the people who are least good or our own intuition so continued bond warming to his argument le chiffre was serving a wonderful purpose a really vital purpose perhaps the best and highest purpose of all by his evil existence which foolishly i have helped to destroy he was creating a norm of badness by which and by which alone an opposite norm of goodness could exist we were privileged in our short knowledge of him to see and estimate his wickedness and we emerge from the acquaintanceship better and more virtuous men bravo said mathis im proud of you you ought to be tortured every day i really must remember to do something evil this evening i must start at once i have a few marks in my favour only small ones alas he added ruefully but i shall work fast now that i have seen the light what a splendid time im going to have now lets see where shall i start murder arson rape but no these are peccadilloes i must really consult the good marquis de sade i am a child an absolute child in these matters his face fell ah but our conscience my dear bond what shall we do with him while we are committing some juicy sin that is a problem he is a crafty person this conscience and very old as old as the first family of apes which gave birth to him we must give that problem really careful thought or we shall spoil our enjoyment of course we should murder him first but he is a tough bird it will be difficult but if we succeed we could be worse even than le chiffre for you dear james it is easy you can start off by resigning that was a brilliant thought of yours a splendid start to your new career and so simple everyone has the revolver of resignation in his pocket all youve got to do is pull the trigger and you will have made a big hole in your country and your conscience at the same time a murder and a suicide with one bullet splendid what a difficult and glorious profession as for me i must start embracing the new cause at once he looked at his watch good ive started already im half an hour late for a meeting with the chief of police he rose to his feet laughing that was most enjoyable my dear james you really ought to go on the halls now about that little problem of yours this business of not knowing good men from bad men and villains from heroes and so forth it is of course a difficult problem in the abstract the secret lies in personal experience whether youre a chinaman or an englishman he paused at the door you admit that le chiffre did you personal evil and that you would kill him if he appeared in front of you now well when you get back to london you will find there are other le chiffres seeking to destroy you and your friends and your country m will tell you about them and now that you have seen a really evil man you will know how evil they can be and you will go after them to destroy them in order to protect yourself and the people you love you wont wait to argue about it you know what they look like now and what they can do to people you may be a bit more choosy about the jobs you take on you may want to be certain that the target really is black but there are plenty of really black targets around theres still plenty for you to do and youll do it and when you fall in love and have a mistress or a wife and children to look after it will seem all the easier mathis opened the door and stopped on the threshold surround yourself with human beings my dear james they are easier to fight for than principles he laughed but dont let me down and become human yourself we would lose such a wonderful machine with a wave of the hand he shut the door hey shouted bond but the footsteps went quickly off down the passage chapter vesper it was on the next day that bond asked to see vesper he had not wanted to see her before he was told that every day she came to the nursing home and asked after him flowers had arrived from her bond didnt like flowers and he told the nurse to give them to another patient after this had happened twice no more flowers came bond had not meant to offend her he disliked having feminine things around him flowers seemed to ask for recognition of the person who had sent them to be constantly transmitting a message of sympathy and affection bond found this irksome he disliked being cosseted it gave him claustrophobia bond was bored at the idea of having to explain some of this to vesper and he was embarrassed at having to ask one or two questions which mystified him questions about vespers behaviour the answers would almost certainly make her out to be a fool then he had his full report to m to think about in this he didnt want to have to criticize vesper it might easily cost her her job but above all he admitted to himself he shirked the answer to a more painful question the doctor had talked often to bond about his injuries he had always told him that there would be no evil effects from the terrible battering his body had received he had said that bonds full health would return and that none of his powers had been taken from him but the evidence of bonds eyes and his nerves refused these comforting assurances he was still painfully swollen and bruised and whenever the injections wore off he was in agony above all his imagination had suffered for an hour in that room with le chiffre the certainty of impotence had been beaten into him and a scar had been left on his mind that could only be healed by experience from that day when bond first met vesper in the hermitage bar he had found her desirable and he knew that if things had been different in the nightclub if vesper had responded in any way and if there had been no kidnapping he would have tried to sleep with her that night even later in the car and outside the villa when god knows he had had other things to think about his eroticism had been hotly aroused by the sight of her indecent nakedness and now when he could see her again he was afraid afraid that his senses and his body would not respond to her sensual beauty afraid that he would feel no stir of desire and that his blood would stay cool in his mind he had made this first meeting into a test and he was shirking the answer that was the real reason he admitted why he had waited to give his body a chance to respond why he had put off their first meeting for over a week he would like to have put off the meeting still further but he explained to himself that his report must be written that any day an emissary from london would come over and want to hear the full story that today was as good as tomorrow that anyway he might as well know the worst so on the eighth day he asked for her for the early morning when he was feeling refreshed and strong after the nights rest for no reason at all he had expected that she would show some sign of her experiences that she would look pale and even ill he was not prepared for the tall bronzed girl in a cream tussore frock with a black belt who came happily through the door and stood smiling at him good heavens vesper he said with a wry gesture of welcome you look absolutely splendid you must thrive on disaster how have you managed to get such a wonderful sunburn i feel very guilty she said sitting down beside him but ive been bathing every day while youve been lying here the doctor said i was to and head of s said i was to so well i just thought it wouldnt help you for me to be moping away all day long in my room ive found a wonderful stretch of sand down the coast and i take my lunch and go there every day with a book and i dont come back till the evening theres a bus that takes me there and back with only a short walk over the dunes and ive managed to get over the fact that its on the way down that road to the villa her voice faltered the mention of the villa had made bonds eyes flicker she continued bravely refusing to be defeated by bonds lack of response the doctor says it wont be long before youre allowed up i thought perhaps i thought perhaps i could take you down to this beach later on the doctor says that bathing would be very good for you bond grunted god knows when ill be able to bathe he said the doctors talking through his hat and when i can bathe it would probably be better for me to bathe alone for a bit i dont want to frighten anybody apart from anything else he glanced pointedly down the bed my bodys a mass of scars and bruises but you enjoy yourself theres no reason why you shouldnt enjoy yourself vesper was stung by the bitterness and injustice in his voice im sorry she said i just thought i was just trying suddenly her eyes filled with tears she swallowed i wanted i wanted to help you get well her voice strangled she looked piteously at him facing the accusation in his eyes and in his manner then she broke down and buried her face in her hands and sobbed im sorry she said in a muffled voice im really sorry with one hand she searched for a handkerchief in her bag its all my fault she dabbed at her eyes i know its all my fault bond at once relented he put out a bandaged hand and laid it on her knee its all right vesper im sorry i was so rough its just that i was jealous of you in the sunshine while im stuck here directly im well enough ill come with you and you must show me your beach of course its just what i want itll be wonderful to get out again she pressed his hand and stood up and walked over to the window after a moment she busied herself with her makeup then she came back to the bed bond looked at her tenderly like all harsh cold men he was easily tipped over into sentiment she was very beautiful and he felt warm towards her he decided to make his questions as easy as possible he gave her a cigarette and for a time they talked of the visit of head of s and of the reactions in london to the rout of le chiffre from what she said it was clear that the final object of the plan had been more than fulfilled the story was still being splashed all over the world and correspondents of most of the english and american papers had been at royale trying to trace the jamaican millionaire who had defeated le chiffre at the tables they had got on to vesper but she had covered up well her story was that bond had told her he was going on to cannes and monte carlo to gamble with his winnings the hunt had moved down to the south of france mathis and the police had obliterated all other traces and the papers were forced to concentrate on the strasbourg angles and the chaos in the ranks of the french communists by the way vesper said bond after a time what really happened to you after you left me in the night club all i saw was the actual kidnapping he told her briefly of the scene outside the casino im afraid i must have lost my head said vesper avoiding bonds eyes when i couldnt see mathis anywhere in the entrance hall i went outside and the commissionaire asked me if i was miss lynd and then told me the man who had sent in the note was waiting in a car down on the right of the steps somehow i wasnt particularly surprised id only known mathis for a day or two and i didnt know how he worked so i just walked down towards the car it was away on the right and more or less in the shadows just as i was coming up to it le chiffres two men jumped out from behind one of the other cars in the row and simply scooped my skirt over my head vesper blushed it sounds a childish trick she looked penitently at bond but its really frightfully effective ones a complete prisoner and although i screamed i dont expect any sound came out from under my skirt i kicked out as hard as i could but that was no use as i couldnt see and my arms were absolutely helpless i was just a trussed chicken they picked me up between them and shoved me into the back of the car i went on struggling of course and when the car started and while they were trying to tie a rope or something round the top of my skirt over my head i managed to get an arm free and throw my bag through the window i hope it was some use bond nodded it was rather instinctive i just thought youd have no idea what had happened to me and i was terrified i did the first thing i could think of bond knew that it was him they had been after and that if vesper hadnt thrown her bag out they would probably have thrown it out themselves directly they saw him appear on the steps it certainly helped said bond but why didnt you make any sign when they finally got me after the car smash when i spoke to you i was dreadfully worried i thought they might have knocked you out or something im afraid i must have been unconscious said vesper i fainted once from lack of air and when i came to they had cut a hole in front of my face i must have fainted again i dont remember much until we got to the villa i really only gathered you had been captured when i heard you try and come after me in the passage and they didnt touch you asked bond they didnt try and mess about with you while i was being beaten up no said vesper they just left me in an armchair they drank and played cards belotte i think it was from what i heard and then they went to sleep i suppose that was how smersh got them they bound my legs and put me on a chair in a corner facing the wall and i saw nothing of smersh i heard some odd noises i expect they woke me up and then what sounded like one of them falling off his chair then there were some soft footsteps and a door closed and then nothing happened until mathis and the police burst in hours later i slept most of the time i had no idea what had happened to you but she faltered i did once hear a terrible scream it sounded very far away at least i think it must have been a scream at the time i thought it might have been a nightmare im afraid that must have been me said bond vesper put out a hand and touched one of his her eyes filled with tears its horrible she said the things they did to you and it was all my fault if only she buried her face in her hands thats all right said bond comfortingly its no good crying over spilt milk its all over now and thank heavens they let you alone he patted her knee they were going to start on you when theyd got me really softened up weve got a lot to thank smersh for now come on lets forget about it it certainly wasnt anything to do with you anybody could have fallen for that note anyway its all water over the dam he added cheerfully vesper looked at him gratefully through her tears you really promise she asked i thought you would never forgive me i ill try and make it up to you somehow she looked at him somehow thought bond to himself he looked at her she was smiling at him he smiled back youd better look out he said i may hold you to that she looked into his eyes and said nothing but the enigmatic challenge was back she pressed his hand and rose a promise is a promise she said this time they both knew what the promise was she picked up her bag from the bed and walked to the door shall i come tomorrow she looked at bond gravely yes please vesper said bond id like that please do some more exploring it will be fun to think of what we can do when i get up will you think of some things yes said vesper please get well quickly they gazed at each other for a second then she went out and closed the door and bond listened until the sound of her footsteps had disappeared chapter the hastening saloon from that day bonds recovery was rapid he sat up in bed and wrote his report to m he made light of what he still considered amateurish behaviour on the part of vesper by juggling with the emphasis he made the kidnapping sound much more machiavellian than it had been he praised vespers coolness and composure throughout the whole episode without saying that he had found some of her actions unaccountable every day vesper came to see him and he looked forward to these visits with excitement she talked happily of her adventures of the day before her explorations down the coast and the restaurants where she had eaten she had made friends with the chief of police and with one of the directors of the casino and it was they who took her out in the evening and occasionally lent her a car during the day she kept an eye on the repairs to the bentley which had been towed down to coachbuilders at rouen and she even arranged for some new clothes to be sent out from bonds london flat nothing survived from his original wardrobe every stitch had been cut to ribbons in the search for the forty million francs the le chiffre affair was never mentioned between them she occasionally told bond amusing stories of head of ss office she had apparently transferred there from the wrns and he told her of some of his adventures in the service he found he could speak to her easily and he was surprised with most women his manner was a mixture of taciturnity and passion the lengthy approaches to a seduction bored him almost as much as the subsequent mess of disentanglement he found something grisly in the inevitability of the pattern of each affair the conventional parabola sentiment the touch of the hand the kiss the passionate kiss the feel of the body the climax in the bed then more bed then less bed then the boredom the tears and the final bitterness was to him shameful and hypocritical even more he shunned the mise en scљne for each of these acts in the play the meeting at a party the restaurant the taxi his flat her flat then the weekend by the sea then the flats again then the furtive alibis and the final angry farewell on some doorstep in the rain but with vesper there could be none of this in the dull room and the boredom of his treatment her presence was each day an oasis of pleasure something to look forward to in their talk there was nothing but companionship with a distant undertone of passion in the background there was the unspoken zest of the promise which in due course and in their own time would be met over all there brooded the shadow of his injuries and the tantalus of their slow healing whether bond liked it or not the branch had already escaped his knife and was ready to burst into flower with enjoyable steps bond recovered he was allowed up then he was allowed to sit in the garden then he could go for a short walk then for a long drive and then the afternoon came when the doctor appeared on a flying visit from paris and pronounced him well again his clothes were brought round by vesper farewells were exchanged with the nurses and a hired car drove them away it was three weeks from the day when he had been on the edge of death and now it was july and the hot summer shimmered down the coast and out to sea bond clasped the moment to him their destination was to be a surprise for him he had not wanted to go back to one of the big hotels in royale and vesper said she would find somewhere away from the town but she insisted on being mysterious about it and only said that she had found a place he would like he was happy to be in her hands but he covered up his surrender by referring to their destination as trou sur mer and lauding the rustic delights of outside lavatories bedbugs and cockroaches their drive was spoiled by a curious incident while they followed the coast road in the direction of les noctambules bond described to her his wild chase in the bentley finally pointing out the curve he had taken before the crash and the exact place where the vicious carpet of spikes had been laid he slowed the car down and leant out to show her the deep cuts in the tarmac made by the rims of the wheels and the broken branches in the hedge and the patch of oil where the car had come to rest but all the time she was distrait and fidgety and commented only in monosyllables once or twice he caught her glancing in the drivingmirror but when he had a chance to look back through the rear window they had just rounded a bend and he could see nothing finally he took her hand somethings on your mind vesper he said she gave him a taut bright smile its nothing absolutely nothing i had a silly idea we were being followed its just nerves i suppose this road is full of ghosts under cover of a short laugh she looked back again look there was an edge of panic in her voice obediently bond turned his head sure enough a quarter of a mile away a black saloon was coming after them at a good pace bond laughed we cant be the only people using this road he said anyway who wants to follow us weve done nothing wrong he patted her hand its a middleaged commercial traveller in carpolish on his way to le havre hes probably thinking of his lunch and his mistress in paris really vesper you mustnt think evil of the innocent i expect youre right she said nervously anyway were nearly there she relapsed into silence and gazed out of the window bond could still feel her tenseness he smiled to himself at what he took to be simply a hangover from their recent adventures but he decided to humour her and when they came to a small lane leading towards the sea and slowed to turn down it he told the driver to stop directly they were off the main road hidden by the tall hedge they watched together through the rear window through the quiet hum of summer noises they could hear the car approaching vesper dug her fingers into his arm the pace of the car did not alter as it approached their hidingplace and they had only a brief glimpse of a mans profile as a black saloon tore by it was true that he seemed to glance quickly towards them but above them in the hedge there was a gaily painted sign pointing down the lane and announcing lauberge du fruit dfendu crustaces fritures it was obvious to bond that it was this that had caught the drivers eye as the rattle of the cars exhaust diminished down the road vesper sank back into her corner her face was pale he looked at us she said i told you so i knew we were being followed now they know where we are bond could not contain his impatience bunkum he said he was looking at that sign he pointed it out to vesper she looked slightly relieved do you really think so she asked yes i see of course you must be right come on im sorry to be so stupid i dont know what came over me she leant forward and talked to the driver through the partition and the car moved on she sank back and turned a bright face towards bond the colour had almost come back to her cheeks i really am sorry its just that its that i cant believe everythings over and theres no one to be frightened of any more she pressed his hand you must think me very stupid of course not said bond but really nobody could be interested in us now forget it all the whole jobs finished wiped up this is our holiday and theres not a cloud in the sky is there he persisted no of course not she shook herself slightly im mad now well be there in a second i do hope youre going to like it they both leant forward animation was back in her face and the incident left only the smallest questionmark hanging in the air even that faded as they came through the dunes and saw the sea and the modest little inn amongst the pines its not very grand im afraid said vesper but its very clean and the foods wonderful she looked at him anxiously she need not have worried bond loved the place at first sight the terrace leading almost to the hightide mark the low twostoried house with gay brickred awnings over the windows and the crescentshaped bay of blue water and golden sands how many times in his life would he have given anything to have turned off a main road to find a lost corner like this where he could let the world go by and live in the sea from dawn to dusk and now he was to have a whole week of this and of vesper in his mind he fingered the necklace of the days to come they drew up in the courtyard behind the house and the proprietor and his wife came out to greet them monsieur versoix was a middleaged man with one arm the other he had lost fighting with the free french in madagascar he was a friend of the chief of police of royale and it was the commissaire who had suggested the place to vesper and had spoken to the proprietor on the telephone as a result nothing was going to be too good for them madame versoix had been interrupted in the middle of preparing dinner she wore an apron and held a wooden spoon in one hand she was younger than her husband chubby and handsome and warmeyed instinctively bond guessed that they had no children and that they gave their thwarted affection to their friends and some regular customers and probably to some pets he thought that their life was probably something of a struggle and that the inn must be very lonely in wintertime with the big seas and the noise of the wind in the pines the proprietor showed them to their rooms vespers was a double room and bond was next door at the corner of the house with one window looking out to sea and another with a view of the distant arm of the bay there was a bathroom between them everything was spotless and sparsely comfortable the proprietor was pleased when they both showed their delight he said that dinner would be at seventhirty and that madame la patronne was preparing broiled lobsters with melted butter he was sorry that they were so quiet just then it was tuesday there would be more people at the weekend the season had not been good generally they had plenty of english people staying but times were difficult over there and the english just came for a weekend at royale and then went home after losing their money at the casino it was not like the old days he shrugged his shoulders philosophically but then no day was like the day before and no century like the previous one and quite so said bond chapter tide of passion they were talking on the threshold of vespers room when the proprietor left them bond pushed her inside and closed the door then he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks this is heaven he said then he saw that her eyes were shining her hands came up and rested on his forearms he stepped right up against her and his arms dropped round her waist her head went back and her mouth opened beneath his my darling he said he plunged his mouth down on to hers forcing her teeth apart with his tongue and feeling her own tongue working at first shyly then more passionately he slipped his hands down to her swelling buttocks and gripped them fiercely pressing the centres of their bodies together panting she slipped her mouth away from his and they clung together while he rubbed his cheek against hers and felt her hard breasts pressing into him then he reached up and seized her hair and bent her head back until he could kiss her again she pushed him away and sank back exhausted on to the bed for a moment they looked at each other hungrily im sorry vesper he said i didnt mean to then she shook her head dumb with the storm which had passed through her he came and sat beside her and they looked at each other with lingering tenderness as the tide of passion ebbed in their veins she leant over and kissed him on the corner of the mouth then she brushed the black comma of hair back from his damp forehead my darling she said give me a cigarette i dont know where my bag is she looked vaguely round the room bond lit one for her and put it between her lips she took a deep lungful of smoke and let it pour out through her mouth with a slow sigh bond put his arm round her but she got up and walked over to the window she stood there with her back to him bond looked down at his hands and saw they were still trembling its going to take some time to get ready for dinner said vesper still not looking at him why dont you go and bathe ill unpack for you bond left the bed and came and stood close against her he put his arms round her and put a hand over each breast they filled his hands and the nipples were hard against his fingers she put her hands over his and pressed them into her but still she looked away from him out of the window not now she said in a low voice bond bent and burrowed his lips into the nape of her neck for a moment he strained her hard to him then he let her go all right vesper he said he walked over to the door and looked back she had not moved for some reason he thought she was crying he took a step towards her and then realized that there was nothing to say between them then my love he said then he went out and shut the door bond walked along to his room and sat down on the bed he felt weak from the passion which had swept through his body he was torn between the desire to fall back fulllength on the bed and his longing to be cooled and revived by the sea he played with the choice for a moment then he went over to his suitcase and took out white linen bathingdrawers and a dark blue pyjamasuit bond had always disliked pyjamas and had slept naked until in hong kong at the end of the war he came across the perfect compromise this was a pyjamacoat which came almost down to the knees it had no buttons but there was a loose belt round the waist the sleeves were wide and short ending just above the elbow the result was cool and comfortable and now when he slipped the coat on over his trunks all his bruises and scars were hidden except the thin white bracelets on wrists and ankles and the mark of smersh on his right hand he slipped his feet into a pair of darkblue leather sandals and went downstairs and out of the house and across the terrace to the beach as he passed across the front of the house he thought of vesper but he refrained from looking up to see if she was still standing at the window if she saw him she gave no sign he walked along the waterline on the hard golden sand until he was out of sight of the inn then he threw off his pyjamacoat and took a short run and a quick flat dive into the small waves the beach shelved quickly and he kept underwater as long as he could swimming with powerful strokes and feeling the soft coolness all over him then he surfaced and brushed the hair out of his eyes it was nearly seven and the sun had lost much of its heat before long it would sink beneath the further arm of the bay but now it was straight in his eyes and he turned on his back and swam away from it so that he could keep it with him as long as possible when came ashore nearly a mile down the bay the shadows had already engulfed his distant pyjamas but he knew he had time to lie on the hard sand and dry before the tide of dusk reached him he took off his bathingtrunks and looked down at his body there were only a few traces left of his injuries he shrugged his shoulders and lay down with his limbs spread out in a star and gazed up at the empty blue sky and thought of vesper his feelings for her were confused and he was impatient with the confusion they had been so simple he had intended to sleep with her as soon as he could because he desired her and also because and he admitted it to himself he wanted coldly to put the repairs to his body to the final test he thought they would sleep together for a few days and then he might see something of her in london then would come the inevitable disengagement which would be all the easier because of their positions in the service if it was not easy he could go off on an assignment abroad or which was also in his mind he could resign and travel to different parts of the world as he had always wanted but somehow she had crept under his skin and over the last two weeks his feelings had gradually changed he found her companionship easy and unexacting there was something enigmatic about her which was a constant stimulus she gave little of her real personality away and he felt that however long they were together there would always be a private room inside her which he could never invade she was thoughtful and full of consideration without being slavish and without compromising her arrogant spirit and now he knew that she was profoundly excitingly sensual but that the conquest of her body because of the central privacy in her would each time have the sweet tang of rape loving her physically would each time be a thrilling voyage without the anticlimax of arrival she would surrender herself avidly he thought and greedily enjoy all the intimacies of the bed without ever allowing herself to be possessed naked bond lay and tried to push away the conclusions he read in the sky he turned his head and looked down the beach and saw that the shadows of the headland were almost reaching for him he stood up and brushed off as much of the sand as he could reach he reflected that he would have a bath when he got in and he absentmindedly picked up his trunks and started walking back along the beach it was only when he reached his pyjamacoat and bent to pick it up that he realized he was still naked without bothering about the trunks he slipped on the light coat and walked on to the hotel at that moment his mind was made up chapter fruit dfendu when he got back to his room he was touched to find all his belongings put away and in the bathroom his toothbrush and shaving things neatly arranged at one end of the glass shelf over the washbasin at the other end was vespers toothbrush and one or two small bottles and a jar of facecream he glanced at the bottles and was surprised to see that one contained nembutal sleepingpills perhaps her nerves had been more shaken by the events at the villa than he had imagined the bath had been filled for him and there was a new flask of some expensive pine bathessence on a chair beside it with his towel vesper he called yes you really are the limit you make me feel like an expensive gigolo i was told to look after you im only doing what i was told darling the baths absolutely right will you marry me she snorted you need a slave not a wife i want you well i want my lobster and champagne so hurry up all right all right said bond he dried himself and dressed in a white shirt and dark blue slacks he hoped that she would be dressed as simply and he was pleased when without knocking she appeared in the doorway wearing a blue linen shirt which had faded to the colour of her eyes and a dark red skirt in pleated cotton i couldnt wait i was famished my rooms over the kitchen and ive been tortured by the wonderful smells he came over and put his arm round her she took his hand and together they went downstairs out on to the terrace where their table had been laid in the light cast by the empty diningroom the champagne which bond had ordered on their arrival stood on a plated winecooler beside their table and bond poured out two full glasses vesper busied herself with a delicious homemade liver pat and helped them both to the crisp french bread and the thick square of deep yellow butter set in chips of ice they looked at each other and drank deeply and bond filled their glasses again to the rim while they ate bond told her of his bathe and they talked of what they would do in the morning all through the meal they left unspoken their feelings for each other but in vespers eyes as much as in bonds there was excited anticipation of the night they let their hands and their feet touch from time to time as if to ease the tension in their bodies when the lobster had come and gone and the second bottle of champagne was halfempty and they had just ladled thick cream over their fraises des bois vesper gave a deep sigh of contentment im behaving like a pig she said happily you always give me all the things i like best ive never been so spoiled before she gazed across the terrace at the moonlit bay i wish i deserved it her voice had a wry undertone what do you mean asked bond surprised oh i dont know i suppose people get what they deserve so perhaps i do deserve it she looked at him and smiled her eyes narrowed quizzically you really dont know much about me she said suddenly bond was surprised by the undertone of seriousness in her voice quite enough he said laughing all i need until tomorrow and the next day and the next you dont know much about me for the matter of that he poured out more champagne vesper looked at him thoughtfully people are islands she said they dont really touch however close they are theyre really quite separate even if theyve been married for fifty years bond thought with dismay that she must be going into a vin triste too much champagne had made her melancholy but suddenly she gave a happy laugh dont look so worried she leaned forward and put her hand over his i was only being sentimental anyway my island feels very close to your island tonight she took a sip of champagne bond laughed relieved lets join up and make a peninsula he said now directly weve finished the strawberries no she said flirting i must have coffee and brandy countered bond the small shadow had passed the second small shadow this too left a tiny questionmark hanging in the air it quickly dissolved as warmth and intimacy enclosed them again when they had had their coffee and bond was sipping his brandy vesper picked up her bag and came and stood behind him im tired she said resting a hand on his shoulder he reached up and held it there and they stayed motionless for a moment she bent down and lightly brushed his hair with her lips then she was gone and a few seconds later the light came on in her room bond smoked and waited until it had gone out then he followed her pausing only to say good night to the proprietor and his wife and thank them for the dinner they exchanged compliments and he went upstairs it was only half past nine when he stepped into her room from the bathroom and closed the door behind him the moonlight shone through the halfclosed shutters and lapped at the secret shadows in the snow of her body on the broad bed bond awoke in his own room at dawn and for a time he lay and stroked his memories then he got quietly out of bed and in his pyjamacoat he crept past vespers door and out of the house to the beach the sea was smooth and quiet in the sunrise the small pink waves idly licked the sand it was cold but he took off his jacket and wandered naked along the edge of the sea to the point where he had bathed the evening before then he walked slowly and deliberately into the water until it was just below his chin he took his feet off the bottom and sank holding his nose with one hand and shutting his eyes feeling the cold water comb his body and his hair the mirror of the bay was unbroken except where it seemed a fish had jumped under the water he imagined the tranquil scene and wished that vesper could just then come through the pines and be astonished to see him suddenly erupt from the empty seascape when after a full minute he came to the surface in a froth of spray he was disappointed there was no one in sight for a time he swam and drifted and then when the sun seemed hot enough he came in to the beach and lay on his back and revelled in the body which the night had given back to him as on the evening before he stared up into the empty sky and saw the same answer there after a while he rose and walked back slowly along the beach to his pyjamacoat that day he would ask vesper to marry him he was quite certain it was only a question of choosing the right moment chapter blackpatch as he walked quietly from the terrace into the halfdarkness of the still shuttered diningroom he was surprised to see vesper emerge from the glassfronted telephone booth near the front door and softly turn up the stairs towards their rooms vesper he called thinking she must have had some urgent message which might concern them both she turned quickly a hand up to her mouth for a moment longer than necessary she stared at him her eyes wide what is it darling he asked vaguely troubled and fearing some crisis in their lives oh she said breathlessly you made me jump it was only i was just telephoning to mathis to mathis she repeated i wondered if he could get me another frock you know from that girlfriend i told you about the vendeuse you see she talked quickly her words coming out in a persuasive jumble ive really got nothing to wear i thought id catch him at home before he went to the office i dont know my friends telephone number and i thought it would be a surprise for you i didnt want you to hear me moving and wake you up is the water nice have you bathed you ought to have waited for me its wonderful said bond deciding to relieve her mind though irritated with her obvious guilt over this childish mystery you must go in and well have breakfast on the terrace im ravenous im sorry i made you jump i was just startled to see anyone about at this hour of the morning he put his arm round her but she disengaged herself and moved quickly on up the stairs it was such a surprise to see you she said trying to cover the incident up with a light touch you looked like a ghost a drowned man with the hair down over your eyes like that she laughed harshly hearing the harshness she turned the laugh into a cough i hope i havent caught cold she said she kept on patching up the edifice of her deceit until bond wanted to spank her and tell her to relax and tell the truth instead he just gave her a reassuring pat on the back outside her room and told her to hurry up and have her bathe then he went on to his room that was the end of the integrity of their love the succeeding days were a shambles of falseness and hypocrisy mingled with her tears and moments of animal passion to which she abandoned herself with a greed made indecent by the hollowness of their days several times bond tried to break down the dreadful walls of mistrust again and again he brought up the subject of the telephone call but she obstinately bolstered up her story with embellishments which bond knew she had thought out afterwards she even accused bond of thinking she had another lover these scenes always ended in her bitter tears and in moments almost of hysteria each day the atmosphere became more hateful it seemed fantastic to bond that human relationships could collapse into dust overnight and he searched his mind again and again for a reason he felt that vesper was just as horrified as he was and if anything her misery seemed greater than his but the mystery of the telephone conversation which vesper angrily almost fearfully it seemed to bond refused to explain was a shadow which grew darker with other small mysteries and reticences already at luncheon on that day things got worse after a breakfast which was an effort for both of them vesper said she had a headache and would stay in her room out of the sun bond took a book and walked for miles down the beach by the time he returned he had argued to himself that they would be able to sort the problem out over lunch directly they sat down he apologized gaily for having startled her at the telephone booth and then he dismissed the subject and went on to describe what he had seen on his walk but vesper was distrait and commented only in monosyllables she toyed with her food and she avoided bonds eyes and gazed past him with an air of preoccupation when she had failed once or twice to respond to some conversational gambit or other bond also relapsed into silence and occupied himself with his own gloomy thoughts all of a sudden she stiffened her fork fell with a clatter on to the edge of her plate and then noisily off the table on to the terrace bond looked up she had gone as white as a sheet and she was looking over his shoulder with terror in her face bond turned his head and saw that a man had just taken his place at a table on the opposite side of the terrace well away from them he seemed ordinary enough perhaps rather sombrely dressed but in his first quick glance bond put him down as some businessman on his way along the coast who had just happened on the inn or had picked it out of the michelin what is it darling he asked anxiously vespers eyes never moved from the distant figure its the man in the car she said in a stifled voice the man who was following us i know it is bond looked again over his shoulder the patron was discussing the menu with the new customer it was a perfectly normal scene they exchanged smiles over some item on the menu and apparently agreed that it would suit for the patron took the card and with bond guessed a final exchange about the wine he withdrew the man seemed to realize that he was being watched he looked up and gazed incuriously at them for a moment then he reached for a briefcase on the chair beside him extracted a newspaper and started to read it his elbows propped up on the table when the man had turned his face towards them bond noticed that he had a black patch over one eye it was not tied with a tape across the eye but screwed in like a monocle otherwise he seemed a friendly middleaged man with dark brown hair brushed straight back and as bond had seen while he was talking to the patron particularly large white teeth he turned back to vesper really darling he looks very innocent are you sure hes the same man we cant expect to have this place entirely to ourselves vespers face was still a white mask she was clutching the edge of the table with both hands he thought she was going to faint and almost rose to come round to her but she made a gesture to stop him then she reached for a glass of wine and took a deep draught the glass rattled on her teeth and she brought up her other hand to help then she put the glass down she looked at him with dull eyes i know its the same he tried to reason with her but she paid no attention after glancing once or twice over his shoulder with eyes that held a curious submissiveness she said that her headache was still bad and that she would spend the afternoon in her room she left the table and walked indoors without a backward glance bond was determined to set her mind at rest he ordered coffee to be brought to the table and then he rose and walked swiftly to the courtyard the black peugeot which stood there might indeed have been the saloon they had seen but it might equally have been one of a million others on the french roads he took a quick glance inside but the interior was empty and when he tried the boot it was locked he made a note of the paris numberplate then he went quickly to the lavatory adjoining the diningroom pulled the chain and walked out on to the terrace the man was eating and didnt look up bond sat down in vespers chair so that he could watch the other table a few minutes later the man asked for the bill paid it and left bond heard the peugeot start up and soon the noise of its exhaust had disappeared in the direction of the road to royale when the patron came back to his table bond explained that madame had unfortunately a slight touch of sunstroke after the patron had expressed his regret and enlarged on the dangers of going out of doors in almost any weather bond casually asked about the other customer he reminds me of a friend who also lost an eye they wear similar black patches the patron answered that the man was a stranger he had been pleased with his lunch and had said that he would be passing that way again in a day or two and would take another meal at the auberge apparently he was swiss which could also be seen from his accent he was a traveller in watches it was shocking to have only one eye the strain of keeping that patch in place all day long he supposed one got used to it it is indeed very sad said bond you also have been unlucky he gestured to the proprietors empty sleeve i myself was very fortunate for a time they talked about the war then bond rose by the way he said madame had an early telephone call which i must remember to pay for paris an elyse number i think he added remembering that that was mathiss exchange thank you monsieur but the matter is regulated i was speaking to royale this morning and the exchange mentioned that one of my guests had put through a call to paris and that there had been no answer they wanted to know if madame would like the call kept in im afraid the matter escaped my mind perhaps monsieur would mention it to madame but let me see it was an invalides number the exchange referred to chapter sleep well my darling the next two days were much the same on the fourth day of their stay vesper went off early to royale a taxi came and fetched her and brought her back she said she needed some medicine that night she made a special effort to be gay she drank a lot and when they went upstairs she led him into her bedroom and made passionate love to him bonds body responded but afterwards she cried bitterly into her pillow and bond went to his room in grim despair he could hardly sleep and in the early hours he heard her door open softly some small sounds came from downstairs he was sure she was in the telephone booth very soon he beard her door softly close and he guessed that again there had been no reply from paris this was saturday on sunday the man with the black patch was back again bond knew it directly he looked up from his lunch and saw her face he had told her all that the patron had told him withholding only the mans statement that he might be back he had thought it would worry her he had also telephoned mathis in paris and checked on the peugeot it had been hired from a respectable firm two weeks before the customer had had a swiss triptyque his name was adolph gettler he had given a bank in zurich as his address mathis had got on to the swiss police yes the bank had an account in this name it was little used herr gettler was understood to be connected with the watch industry inquiries could be pursued if there was a charge against him vesper had shrugged her shoulders at the information this time when the man appeared she left her lunch in the middle and went straight up to her room bond made up his mind when he had finished he followed her both her doors were locked and when he made her let him in he saw that she had been sitting in the shadows by the window watching he presumed her face was of cold stone he led her to the bed and drew her down beside him they sat stiffly like people in a railway carriage vesper he said holding her cold hands in his we cant go on like this we must finish with it we are torturing each other and there is only one way of stopping it either you must tell me what all this is about or we must leave at once she said nothing and her hands were lifeless in his my darling he said wont you tell me do you know that first morning i was coming back to ask you to marry me cant we go back to the beginning again what is this dreadful nightmare that is killing us at first she said nothing then a tear rolled slowly down her cheek you mean you would have married me bond nodded oh my god she said my god she turned and clutched him pressing her face against his chest he held her closely to him tell me my love he said tell me whats hurting you her sobs became quieter leave me for a little she said and a new note had come into her voice a note of resignation let me think for a little she kissed his face and held it between her hands she looked at him with yearning darling im trying to do whats best for us please believe me but its terrible im in a frightful she wept again clutching him like a child with nightmares he soothed her stroking the long black hair and kissing her softly go away now she said i must have time to think weve got to do something she took his handkerchief and dried her eyes she led him to the door and there they held tightly to each other then he kissed her again and she shut the door behind him that evening most of the gayness and intimacy of their first night came back she was excited and some of her laughter sounded brittle but bond was determined to fall in with her new mood and it was only at the end of dinner that he made a passing remark which made her pause she put her hand over his dont talk about it now she said forget it now its all past ill tell you about it in the morning she looked at him and suddenly her eyes were full of tears she found a handkerchief in her bag and dabbed at them give me some more champagne she said she gave a queer little laugh i want a lot more you drink much more than me its not fair they sat and drank together until the bottle was finished then she got to her feet she knocked against her chair and giggled i do believe im tight she said how disgraceful please james dont be ashamed of me i did so want to be gay and i am gay she stood behind him and ran her fingers through his black hair come up quickly she said i want you badly tonight she blew a kiss at him and was gone for two hours they made slow sweet love in a mood of happy passion which the day before bond would never have thought they could regain the barriers of selfconsciousness and mistrust seemed to have vanished and the words they spoke to each other were innocent and true again and there was no shadow between them you must go now said vesper when bond had slept for a while in her arms as if to take back her words she held him more closely to her murmuring endearments and pressing her body down the whole length of his when he finally rose and bent to smooth back her hair and finally kiss her eyes and her mouth good night she reached out and turned on the light look at me she said and let me look at you he knelt beside her she examined every line on his face as if she was seeing him for the first time then she reached up and put an arm round his neck her deep blue eyes were swimming with tears as she drew his head slowly towards her and kissed him gently on the lips then she let him go and turned off the light good night my dearest love she said bond bent and kissed her he tasted the tears on her heck he went to the door and looked back sleep well my darling he said dont worry everythings all right now he closed the door softly and walked to his room with a full heart chapter the bleeding heart the patron brought him the letter in the morning he burst into bonds room holding the envelope in front of him as if it was on fire there has been a terrible accident madame bond hurled himself out of bed and through the bathroom but the communicating door was locked he dashed back and through his room and down the corridor past a shrinking terrified maid vespers door was open the sunlight through the shutters lit up the room only her black hair showed above the sheet and her body under the bedclothes was straight and moulded like a stone effigy on a tomb bond fell on his knees beside her and drew back the sheet she was asleep she must be her eyes were closed there was no change in the dear face she was just as she would look and yet and yet she was so still no movement no pulse no breath that was it there was no breath later the patron came and touched him on the shoulder he pointed at the empty glass on the table beside her there were white dregs in the bottom of it it stood beside her book and her cigarettes and matches and the small pathetic litter of her mirror and lipstick and handkerchief and on the floor the empty bottle of sleepingpills the pills bond had seen in the bathroom that first evening bond rose to his feet and shook himself the patron was holding out the letter towards him he took it please notify the commissaire said bond i will be in my room when he wants me he walked blindly away without a backward glance he sat on the edge of his bed and gazed out of the window at the peaceful sea then he stared dully at the envelope it was addressed simply in a large round hand pour lui the thought passed through bonds mind that she must have left orders to be called early so that it would not be he who found her he turned the envelope over not long ago it was her warm tongue which had sealed the flap he gave a sudden shrug and opened it it was not long after the first few words he read it quickly the breath coming harshly through his nostrils then he threw it down on the bed as if it had been a scorpion my darling james i love you with all my heart and while you read these words i hope you still love me because now with these words this is the last moment that your love will last so goodbye my sweet love while we still love each other goodbye my darling i am an agent of the mwd yes i am a double agent for the russians i was taken on a year after the war and i have worked for them ever since i was in love with a pole in the raf until you i still was you can find out who he was he had two dsos and after the war he was trained by m and dropped back into poland they caught him and by torturing him they found out a lot and also about me they came after me and told me he could live if i would work for them he knew nothing of this but he was allowed to write to me the letter arrived on the fifteenth of each month i found i couldnt stop i couldnt bear the idea of a fifteenth coming round without his letter it would mean that i had killed him i tried to give them as little possible you must believe me about this then it came to you i told them you had been given this job at royale what your cover was and so on that was why they knew about you before you arrived and why they had time to put the microphones in they suspected le chiffre but they didnt know what your assignment was except that it was something to do with him that was all i told them then i was told not to stand behind you in the casino and to see that neither mathis nor leiter did that was why the gunman was nearly able to shoot you then i had to stage that kidnapping you may have wondered why i was so quiet in the nightclub they didnt hurt me because i was working for mwd but when i found out what had been done to you even though it was le chiffre who did it and he turned out to be a traitor i decided i couldnt go on by that time i had begun to fall in love with you they wanted me to find out things from you while you were recovering but i refused i was controlled from paris i had to ring up an invalides number twice a day they threatened me and finally they withdrew my control and i knew my lover in poland would have to die but they were afraid i would talk i suppose and i got a final warning that smersh would come for me if i didnt obey them i took no notice i was in love with you then i saw the man with the black patch in the splendide and i found he had been making inquiries about my movements this was the day before we came down here i hoped i could shake him off i decided that we would have an affair and i would escape to south america from le havre i hoped i would have a baby of yours and be able to start again somewhere but they followed us you cant get away from them i knew it would be the end of our love if i told you i realized that i could either wait to be killed by smersh would perhaps get you killed too or i could kill myself there it is my darling love you cant stop me calling you that or saying that i love you i am taking that with me and the memories of you i cant tell you much to help you the paris number was invalides i never met any of them in london everything was done through an accommodation address a newsagents at charing cross place at our first dinner together you talked about that man in yugoslavia who was found guilty of treason he said i was carried away by the gale of the world thats my only excuse that and for love of the man whose life i tried to save its late now and im tired and youre just through two doors but ive got to be brave you might save my life but i couldnt bear the look in your dear eyes my love my love v bond threw the letter down mechanically he brushed his fingers together suddenly he banged his temples with his fists and stood up for a moment he looked out towards the quiet sea then he cursed aloud one harsh obscenity his eyes were wet and he dried them he pulled on a shirt and trousers and with a set cold face he walked down and shut himself in the telephone booth while he was getting through to london he calmly reviewed the facts of vespers letter they all fitted the little shadows and questionmarks of the past four weeks which his instinct had noted but his mind rejected all stood out now like signposts he saw her now only as a spy their love and his grief were relegated to the boxroom of his mind later perhaps they would be dragged out dispassionately examined and then bitterly thrust back with other sentimental baggage he would rather forget now he could only think of her treachery to the service and to her country and of the damage it had done his professional mind was completely absorbed with the consequences the covers which must have been blown over the years the codes which the enemy must have broken the secrets which must have leaked from the centre of the very section devoted to penetrating the soviet union it was ghastly god knew how the mess would be cleared up he ground his teeth suddenly mathiss words came back to him there are plenty of really black targets around and earlier what about smersh i dont like the idea of these chaps running around france killing anyone they feel has been a traitor to their precious political system how soon mathis had been proved right and how soon his own little sophistries had been exploded in his face while he bond had been playing red indians through the years the real enemy had been working quietly coldly without heroics right there at his elbow he suddenly had a vision of vesper walking down a corridor with documents in her hand on a tray they just got it on a tray while the cool secret agent with a double o number was gallivanting round the world playing red indians his fingernails dug into the palms of his hands and his body sweated with shame well it was not too late here was a target for him right to hand he would take on smersh and hunt it down without smersh without this cold weapon of death and revenge the mwd would be just another bunch of civil servant spies no better and no worse than any of the western services smersh was the spur be faithful spy well or you die inevitably and without any question you will be hunted down and killed it was the same with the whole russian machine fear was the impulse for them it was always safer to advance than to retreat advance against the enemy and the bullet might miss you retreat evade betray and the bullet would never miss but now he would attack the arm that held the whip and the gun the business of espionage could be left to the whitecollar boys they could spy and catch the spies he would go after the threat behind the spies the threat that made them spy the telephone rang and bond snatched up the receiver he was on to the link the outside liaison officer who was the only man in london he might telephone from abroad then only in dire necessity this is speaking this is an open line its an emergency can you hear me pass this on at once was a double working for redland yes dammit i said was the bitch is dead now
