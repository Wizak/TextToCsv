 thursday so whats the problem aurelio a little trip to sardinia all expenses paid i should be so lucky but once youre in business for yourself you learn that the boss works harder than ive already explained the problem gilberto christ whats the matter with you today it was the question that zen had been asking himself ever since arriving at the restaurant finding his friend free for lunch at such short notice had seemed a stroke of luck which might help zen gain control of the avalanche of events which had overrun his life gilberto nieddu an excolleague who now ran an industrial counterespionage firm was the person zen was closest to serious determined and utterly reliable there was an air of strength and density about him as though all his volatility had been distilled away whatever he did he did in earnest zen hadnt of course expected gilberto to produce instant solutions but he had counted on him to listen attentively and then bring a calm objective view to bear on the problems as a sardinian himself his advice and knowledge might make all the difference but gilberto was not his usual self today distracted and preoccupied continually glancing over his shoulder he paid little attention to zens account of his visit to palazzo sisti and its implications relax aurelio enjoy yourself ill bet you havent been here that often eh this was true enough in fact zen had never been to licios a legendary name among roman luxury res taurants the entrance was in a small street near the pantheon you could easily pass by without noticing it apart from a discreet brass plate beside the door there was no indication of the nature of the business carried on there no menu was displayed no exaggerated claims made for the quality of the cooking or the cellar inside you were met by licio himself a eunuchlike figure whose expression of transcendental serenity never varied it was only once you were seated that the unique attraction of licios became clear for thanks to the position of the tables in widelyseparated niches concealed from each other by painted screens and potted plants you had the illusinn of being the only people there the prices at licios were roughly double the going rate for the class of cuisine on offer but this was only logical since there were only half as many tables in any case the clientele came almost evclusively from the business and political worlds and was happy to pay whatever licio wished to ask in return for the privilege of being able to discuss sensitive matters in a normal tone of voice with no risk ofbeing either overheard or deafened by the neighbours hence the places unique cachet you went to other restaurants to see and be seen at licios you paid more to pass unnoticed on the rare occasions when zen spent this kind of money on a meal he went to places where the food rather than the ambience was the attraction so gilberto nieddus remark had been accurate enough that didnt make zen feel any happier about the slightly patronizing tone in which it had been made matters were not improved when gilberto patted his arm familiarly and whispered dont worry this ones on me zen made a final attempt to get his friend to appreciate the gravity of the situation look ill spell it out for you theyre asking me to frame someone do you understand im to go to sar dinia and fake some bit of evidence come up with a surprise witness anything they dont care what i do or how i do it as long as it gets the charges against favelloni withdrawn or at least puts the trial dates back several months gilberto nodded vaguely he was still glancing com pulsively around the restaurant this could be your big chance aurelio he murmured checking his watch yet again zen stared at him with a fixed intensity that was a reproach gilberto we are talking here about sending an inno cent person to prison for twenty years to say nothing of allowing a man who has gunned down four people in cold blood to walk free quite apart from the moral aspect that is seriously illegal the sardinian shrugged so dont do it phone in sick or something for fucks sake this is not just another job ive been recommended to these people theyve been told that im an unscrupulous selfseeker that i cooked the books in the miletti case and wouldnt think twice about doing so again theyve briefed me theyve cut me in i know what theyre planning to do and how theyre planning to do it if i try and get out of it now theyre not just going to say fine suit yourself well find someone else theyve already hinted that if i dont play along i could expect to become another statistic in somewhere like palermo down there you can get a contract hit done for a few million lire there are even people wholl do it for free just to make a name for themselves and no ones going to notice if another cop goes missing are you listening to any of this ah finally gilberto cried aloud a big client aurelio very big he hissed in an undertone to zen if we swing this one i can take a year off to listen to your problems just play along follow my lead he sprang to his feet to greet a stocky balding man with an air of immense selfsatisfaction who was being guided to their table by the unctuous licio commendatore good morning welcome how are you permit me to present vicequestore aurelio zen aurelio dottor dario ochetto of sifas enterprises lowering his voice suggestively nieddu added dottor zen works directly for the ministry of the interior zen felt like walking out but he knew he couldnt do it his friendship with gilberto was too important for him to risk losing it by a show of pique the fact that gilberto had probably counted on this reaction didnt make zen feel any happier about listening to the totally fictitious account of paragon securitys dealings with the ministry of the interior which nieddu used as a warmup before presenting his sales pitch meanwhile zen ate his way through the food that was placed before them and drank rather more wine than he would normally have done occasionally gilberto turned in his direction and said right aurelio fortunately neither he nor ochetto seemed to expect a reply zen found it impossible to tell whether ochetto was impressed favourably or otherwise by this farce but as soon as he had departed amid scenes of compulsive hand shaking gilberto exploded in jubilation and summoned the waiter to bring over a bottle of their best malt whisky its in the bag aurelio he exclaimed triumphantly an exclusive contract to install and maintain antibugging equipment at all their offices throughout the country and at five times the going rate because what isnt in the contract is the work they want done on the competition zen sipped the whisky which reminded him of a tar based patent medicine with which his mother had used to dose him liberally on the slightest pretext what kind of work nieddu gave him a sly look well what do you think i dont think anything zen retorted aggressively why dont you answer the question nieddu threw up his hands in mock surrender oh what is this an interrogation youve gone into the bugging business zen demanded have you got any objection i certainly have i object to be tricked into appearing to sanction illegal activities when i havent even been told what they are much less asked whether i mind being dragged in jesus christ almighty gilberto i dont fucking well need this not any time and especially not now gilberto nieddu gestured for calm moving his hands smoothly through the air as though stroking silk this lunch has been arranged for weeks aurelio i didnt ask you to come along on the contrary you phoned me at the last moment i would normally have said i was busy but because you sounded so desperate i went out of rny way to see you but i hadto explain your presence to ochetto otherwise he would have been suspicious this way hell just think i was trying to impress him with my contacts at the ministry it worked beautifully you were very convincing and dont worry about repercussions hes already forgotten you exist zen smiled wanly as he dug a nazionale out of his rapidly collapsing pack you were very convincing tania had said the same thing the night before and it had apparently been zens convincing performance in the miletti case which had recommended him to palazzo sisti everyone who used him for their own purposes seemed very satisfied with the results so youre in the shit again eh continued nieddu lighting a cigar and settling back in his chair whats it all about this time zen pushed his glass about on the tablecloth stained with traces of the various courses they had consumed he no longer had any desire to share his troubles with the sardinian oh nothing im probably just imagining it nieddu eyed his friend through a screen of richly fragrant smoke its time you got out of the police aurelio whats the point of slogging away like this at your age putting your life on the line leave that to the young ambitious pricks who still think theyre immortal lets face it its a mugs game theres nothing in it unless youre bent and even then its just small change really he clicked his fingers to summon the bill you know i never had any idea what was going on in the world until i went into business i simply never realized what life was about i mean they dont teach you this stuff at school what you have to grasp is its all there for the taking somebodys going to get it if it isnt you itll be someone else he sipped his whisky and drew at his cigar all these cases you get so excited about the burolos and all the rest of it do you know what that amounts to traffic accidents thats all if you have roads and cars a certain number of people are going to get killed and injured those people attract a lot of attention but theyre really just a tiny percentage of the number who arrive safely without any fuss or bother its the same in busi ness aurelio the systems there people are going to use it the only question is whether you want to spend your time cleaning up after other peoples pileups or driving off where you want to go fancy a cognac or something it was after three oclock when the two men emerged blinking into the afternoon sunlight they shook hands and parted amicably enough but as zen walked away it felt as though a door had slammed shut behind him people changed that was the inconvenient thing one always forgot it was years now since gilberto had left the police in disgust at the way zen had been treated over the moro affair but zen still saw him as a loyal colleague formed in the same professional mould sharing the same perceptions and prejudices but gilberto nieddu was no longer an expoliceman but a prosperous and successful businessman and his views and attitudes had changed accordingly on a daytoday level this had been no more apparent ihan the movement of a clocks hands it had taken this crisis to reveal the distance that now separated the two men the sardinian still wished zen well of course and would help him if he could but he found it increasingly difficult to take aurelios problems very seriously to him they seemed trivial irrelevant and selfinfiicted what was the point cf getting into trouble and taking risks with no prospect of profit at the end of it all gilbertos attitude made it impossible for zen to ask him for help yet help was what he desperately needed for the project that was beginning to form in his mind if he couldnt get it through official channels or friendly con tacts then there was only one other possibility the first sighting was just north of piazza venezia after the calm of the narrow streets from which most traffic was banned the renewed contact with the brutal realities of roman life was even more traumatic than usual im getting too old zen thought as he hovered indecisively at the ke rb my reactions are slowing down im losing my nerve my confidence so he was reassured to see that a toughlooking young man in a leather jacket and jeans was apparently just as reluctant to take the plunge in the end indeed it was zen who was the first to step out boldly into the traffic trusting that the drivers would choose not to exercise their power to kill or maim him it was marginally less reassuring to catch sight of the same young man just a few minutes later in piazza del campidoglio zen had taken this route because it avoided the maelstrom of piazza venezia although it meant climbing the long steep fiights of steps up the capitoline hill nevertheless when he paused for breath by the plinth where a statue of his namesake had stood until recently succumbing to air pollution there was the young man in the leather jacket about twenty metres behind bending down to adjust his shoelaces zen swung left and walked down past the mamertine prison to via dei fori imperiali he paused to light a cigarette twenty metres back leather jacket was loun ging against a railing admiring the view as zen replaced his cigarettes a piece of paper fluttered from his pocket to the ground he continued on his way counting his strides when he reached twenty he looked round again the young man in the leather jacket was bending to pick up the paper he had dropped the only thing he would learn from it was that zen had spent xzoo lire in a wine shop in piazza campo dei fiori that morning zen on the other hand had leamt two things the man was following him and he wasnt very good at it without breaking his pace he continued along the broad boulevard towards the colisseum this or rather the underground station of the same name had been his destination from the start but he would have to lose the tail first the men he was planning to visit had a code of etiquette as complex and inflexible as any member of romes vestigial aristocracy and would take a par ticularly poor view of anyone arriving with an unidentified guest in tow without knowing who leather jacket was working for it was difficult to choose the best way of disposing of him if he was an independent operator the easiest thing would be to have him arrested on some pretext this would also be quick a phone call would bring a patrol car in minutes and zen was already concerned about getting back to the house before six oclock when maria grazia went home but if leather jacket was part of an organiza tion then this solution would sacrifice zens longterm advantage by showing the tail that he had been burned he would simply be replaced by someone unknown to zen and quite possibly someone more experienced and harder to spot zen therefore reluctantly decided to go for the most difficult option that of losing the young man without allowing him to realize what had happened it was not until the last moment as he was passing the entrance that it dawned on him that the perfect territory for this purpose was conveniently to hand in the ticket office three men in shirtsleeves were engaged in a heated argument about craxis line on com batting inflation zen flashed his police identity card at them and then at the woman perched on a stool at the entrance a twoway radio in one hand and a paperback novel in the other without looking round to see if leather jacket was following he walked through the gateway and into the forum to his untutored eye the scene before him resembled nothing so much as a building site aii that was missing were the tall green cranes clustered together in groups like extraterrestial invaders it seemed as if this project had only just passed the foundation level and only then in a frag mentary and irregular way some areas were still pitted and troughed awaiting the installation of drainage and wiring while in others a few pillars and columns provided a tantalizing hint of the building to come elsewhere whole sections of the massive brick structures factories ware houses which had formerly occupied the area had still not been demolished completely for the moment work seemed to have ground to a halt no dumptrucks or concretepourers moved along the rough track running the length of the site perhaps some snag had arisen over the financing zen thought whimsically perhaps the govern ment had been reshuffled yet again and the new minister was reluctant to authorize further expenditure on a project which had already overrun its estimated cost by several hundred per cent or was at least holding out for some financial incentive on a scale similar to that which had induced his predecessor to sign the contract in the first place a carabinieri helicopter was thrashing about overhead like a shark circling for the kill zen tossed away his cigarette and strolled along a path in the patchy grass between the ruins a fine dust covered everything beaten into the air by passing feet from the bonedry soil the sun crouched low in a cloudless sky its weak rays absorbed and reflected by the marble and brick on every side overhead the helicopter swept past periodically watchful alien remote halfway up the path which veered off to the right and started to climb the palatine hill zen paused to survey the scene at that time of year there were only a few tourists about among them was a young man in a leather jacket and jeans oddly enough he was once again having prob lems with his laces zen resumed his walk with a fastidious smile if leather jacket thought that bending down to tie up your shoes made you invisible then he shouldnt prove too difficult to unload in fact he felt slightly piqued that such a thirdrate operator had been considered adequate for the task of shadowing him evidently he couldnt even inspire respect in his enemies the path ran up a shallow valley between masses of ancient brickwork emerging from the grass like weathered rocky outcroppings the signs and fences installed by the authorities had imposed some superficial order on the hills chaotic topography but this simply made its endless anom alies all the more incomprehensible nothing here was what it appeared to be having been recycled and can nibalized so many times that its original name and function was often unclear even to experts although no archae ologist zen was intimately familiar with the manylayered complexities of the palatine thanks to the angela barilli affair the daughter of a leading rome jeweller eighteeenyear old angela had been kidnapped in after months of io negotiations and a bungled payoff the kidnappers had broken off contact in desperation the barilli family had turned to the supernatural engaging a clairvoyant from turin who claimed to have led the police to three other kidnap victims the medium duly informed angelas mother that her daughter was being held in an under ground cell somewhere in the vast network of rooms and passages on the lower floors of the imperial palace at the heart of the palatine unlikely as this seemed the political clout wielded by the family was enough to ensure that zen who was direc ting the investigation had to waste three days organizing a painstaking search of the area the barilli girls corpse was in fact discovered the following year in a shallow concrete pit beneath a garage in the primavalle suburb where she had been held during her ordeal but zen had never forgotten the three days he had spent exploring the honeycomb of caverns tunnels cisterns and cellars that lay beneath the surface of the palatine it was an area so rich in possibilities that zen could simply disappear into the mathematics leaving his follower to solve an equation with too many variables when he reached the plateau at the top of the hill zen turned left behind the high stone wall which closed off a large rectangle of ground surrounding a church and waited for leather jacket to catch up there was no one about and the only sound was the distant buzzing of the helicopter it had now moved further to the east circling over the group of hospitals near san giovanni in laterano no doubt an important criminal was being transferred from regina coeli prison for treatment with the helicopter acting as an eye in the sky against any attempt to snatch him footsteps approached quickly almostat a run at the last moment zen stepped out from behind the wall sorry excuse me the collision had only been slight but the young man in the leather jacket looked deeply startled as zen had intended he should be close to his sheen of toughness fell apart like an actresss glamour on the wrong side of the footlights despite a virile stubble due no doubt to shaving last thing at night his skin looked babyish and his eyes were weak and evasive it always happens zen remarked the man stared at him mystified when theres no one about i mean zen explained have you noticed you can walk right through the stazione termini at rush hour and never touch anyone but go for a stroll up here and you end up walking straight into the only other person about the man muttered something inconclusive and turned away zen set off in the opposite direction not only would the encounter have shaken leather jacket but it would now be impossible for him to pass off any future contacts as mere coincidence that constraint would force him to hang back in order to keep well out of sight thus giving zen the margin he needed he made his way through a maze of gravelled paths winding among sections of ruined brick wall several metres thick lumps of marble lay scattered about like discarded playthings isolated stonepines rose from the ruins their rough straight trunks cantilevering out at the top to support the broad green canopy here and there excavations had scraped away the soil to expose a fraction of the hidden landscape beneath the surface fenced off and covered with sloping roofs of corrugated plastic sheeting they looked like the primitive shelters of some future tribe bringing the long history of this ancient hill full circle in the eternal darkness of a nuclear winter a line of pines divided this area from a formal garden with alleys flanked by closeclipped hedges screened by the dense thickets of evergreen trees and shrubs zen was able to move quickly along the paved path leading to a parterre with gravel walks a dilapidated pavilion and terrace overlooking the forum a fountain dripped bright dabs of orange fruit peeped through the greenery paths led away in every direction in the centre a flight of steps led down into a subterranean corridor running back the way he had come dimly lit by lunettes let into the wall just below the arched ceiling the passage seemed to extend itself as zen hurried along it the walls rough pitted plaster were hung with cobwebs as large and thick as handkerchiefs which fluttered in the cool draught at length the passage ended in another flight of steps leading up into the middle of the maze of brickwork and gravel paths which zen had passed through earlier keeping under cover of the fragments of wall he worked his way towards the massive ruins of the imperial palace itself the gate was just where he remembered it giving access to a yard used for storing odds and ends of unidentified marble it was supposed to be locked but one of the things that zen had leamed in the course of his abortive search for angela barilli was that it was left open during the day because the staff used it as a short cut ignoring the sign reading no admission to unauthorized persons zen walked through the yard to a passage at the back to the left a modern doorway led into a museum zen turned the other way down an ancient metal staircase descending into the bowels of the hill at first the staircase burrowed through a channel cut into the solid brickwork of the palace as zen walked down the light diminished above and simultaneously the darkness beneath began to glow then without warning he emerged into a vast underground space in which the staircase was suspended vertiginously bolted to the brickwork the other walls were immeasurably dis tant mere banks of shadow presences hinted at by the light seeping in far below obscuring the ground like thick mist zen clutched the handrail overwhelmed by vertigo everything had been turned on its head the ground above the light below step by step he made his way down the zigzag staircase through layers of cavernous gloom the floor was a bare expanse of beaten earth illuminated by light streaming in through large rectangular openings giving on to the sun ken courtyard at the heart of the palace zen walked across it glancing up at the metal railings high above where a trio of tourists stood reading aloud from a guidebook a rectangular opening in the brickwork opposite led into a dark passage which passed through a number of sombre gutted spaces and then a huge enclosed arena consisting of rows of truncated columns flanking a large grassy area he sat down on one of the broken columns out of sight of the path above and lit a cigarette at the base of the column lay a large pine cone its scales splayed back like the pads of a great cats paw the air was still the light pale and mild as though it too was antique the match stick figures displayed on zens digital watch continued their elaborate ballet but the resulting patterns seemed to have lost all meaning the only real measure of time was the slow disappearance of the cigarette smouldering between zens fingers and the equally deliberate progress of his thoughts who could leather jacket be working for until this moment zen had assumed that he must be connected with the breakin at his flat and the envelope full of shotgun pellets which had been left there but now after some consideration he rejected this idea leather jacket simply didnt look nasty enough to have a hand in the attempt to scare zen by copying the warnings sent to judge giulio bertolini before his death he didnt care enough it wasnt a personal vendetta he was involved in zen was sure of that he was in it for the money a cutrate employee hired by the hour to keep track of zens movements but who had hired him the longer zen thought about it the more significant it seemed that leather jacket had put in his first appearance shortly after zens interview at palazzo sisti the only surprising feature of this solution was that they should have chosen such a lowgrade operative to do the job but this was no doubt explained by the fact that lino was in charge of that department they might even prefer zen to know that they were keeping tabs on him he was their man now after all why shouldnt they keep him under surveillance what reason had they to trust him it was only when he had posed this question to himself that zen realized that it wasnt rhetorical once your accomplishments in the miletti case had been brought to our attention the young man had told him the facts spoke for themselves but who had brought those accom plishments to their attention in the first place pre sumably one of the contacts at the ministry the young man had mentioned earlier we have been let down before by people who promised us this that and the other and then couldnt deliver why only a few days ago we asked our man there to obtain a copy of the video tape showing the tragic events at the villa burolo a simple enough request you would think but even that proved beyond the powers of the individual in question nor was this the first time that he had disappointed us zen looked up with a start the sheer stone walls of the arena appeared to have crept closer hemming him in only the day before he had asked himself why vincenzo fabri had gone out on a limb with his harebrained notion about burolo not being the murderers intended victim that the killings had actually been a mafia hit on the architect vianello the answer of course was that this had been a bungled attempt to divert suspicion from renato favelloni fabris mission to sardinia had only nominally been undertaken on behalf of criminalpol his real client had been lonorevole and hed blown it that was why fabri had not been offered the chance to exploit the new evidence about furio pizzonis real identity it was too good a chance for palazzo sisti to risk wasting on someone in whom they no longe had any faith instead they had plumped for zen whose record spoke for itself only it hadnt of course someone had spoken for it first someone had brought zens accomplishments in the miletti case to the attention of palazzo sisti and sug gested that this unscrupuious manipulator of evidence and witnesses might be just the right man to bring the burolo imbroglio to a satisfactory conclusion and that someone it was nom clear could only be the partys man at the ministry vincenzo fabri himself zen lit another cigarette from the butt of the first a habit he normally despised but normality was rapidly losing its grip on his life vincenzo fabri had recommended zen to his masters as the white knight who could save renato favelloni from prison and onorevole from disgrace by doing so he had not only given his most bitter enemy a chance to succeed but to do so on the very ground where he himself had recently suffered a humiliating failure why would he do a thing like that the only possible answer was that fabri knew damn well that zen was not going to succeed so far from doing his enemy a good turn fabri had placed him in a trap with only two exits each potentially fatal if zen failed to satisfy palazzo sisti they would have him transferred to a city where his life could be terminated without attracting attention if on the other hand he did what was neces sary to get the favelloni trial postponed fabri would tip off the judiciary and have zen arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice whatever happened zen was bound to lose if his new friends didnt get him his old enemy would by now the sun had disappeared behind the grove of pines whose foliage was just visible above the far end of the sunken stadium all at once the air revealed its inner coldness the chill at its heart it was time to go leather jacket would most likely have given up the search by now and be waiting near the entrance on via dei fori imperiali zen got to his feet and started to pick his way through the jumble of ruins opposite a brick staircase and a cir cuitous path scuffed through the grass brought him out on a track flanked by pines leading down to the exit on via di san gregorio the odours of summer pine sap and dried shit lingered faintly in the undergrowth there was no sign of leather jacket but in any case zen no longer greatly cared about him being tailed was the least of his worries now as for that matter was the missing video tape to think that just that morning he had worked out an elaborate theory to explain the fact that fabri had put in a request for it the reason for this was now clear he had been told to get hold of a copy by palazzo sisto as for the theft it must indeed have been the work of a pickpocket as zen had originally supposed vincenzo fabri had bigger and better schemes in mind than pilfered videos had he not warned de angelis that very morning to keep away from zen because he was being measured for the drop the exact nature of that drop now seemed terrifyingly clear i was always biddable a born follower like those ducklings we had a fox killed the mother and they would follow whoever was wearing the green rubber boots that were the first thing they saw on opening their eyes if the boots had been able to walk by themselves they would have followed the boots or a bit of rubbish blown past by the wind whatever happened to be there when the darkness cracked open even the fox that killed their mother i can see him now standing there the light at his back and all the forces of the light come with me he said i cant i told him i mustnt it seemed that all this had happened before where do they come from these memories and dreams they must belong to someone else there was nothing before the darkness how could there be we come from darkness and to darkness we return there is nothing else he told me he would have taken me anyway by force the light burned so much i had to close my eyes when i opened them there were men everywhere rushing about shouting at each other crowding in their eyes swishing to and fro like scythes they took it in turns to pour their lies into me filling me with unease everything that had happened had been a mistake id done nothing wrong it uas all a mistake a scandal a tragic and shocking crime when i tried to say something my voice aston ished me a ravens croak pasing through my body nothing to do with me after that i kept silent there was no point in trying to resist they were too strong their desires too urgent sooner or later knno they uould have their way with me in the end fhey tired and let me go youre free they said like the follower i was i believed them i thought i could go back as though nothing had happened as though it had all been a dream
