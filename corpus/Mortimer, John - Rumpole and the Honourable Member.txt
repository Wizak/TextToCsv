john mortimer rumpole and the honourable member from rumpole of the bailey youre giving me a rape my clerk albert had just handed me a brief he then returned to the complicated business of working out the petty cash account his desk was covered with slips of paper a cash box and odd bits of currency i never inquired into alberts system of bookkeeping nor did anyone else in chambers dont you want it mr rumpole i turned to look at henry our second clerk henry had joined as an office boy a small tousled figure who scarcely seemed able to read or write albert used him mainly to run errands and make instant coffee and told him he would only be allowed to take a barrister into court when hed learnt to shine his shoes and clean his fingernails henry had changed over the years his shoes were now gleaming he wore a neat pinstriped suit with a waistcoat and was particularly assiduous in his attentions to guthrie featherstone qc mp our head of chambers albert as head clerk got ten percent of our earnings but henry was on a salary i had thought for a long time that henry thought albert past it and had his eye on a head clerks position i should add so you can get the complete picture of life in our clerks room that our old lady typist had left us and we had a new girl called dianne who read quite extraordinarily lurid novels when she wasnt typing spent a great deal of the day titivating in the loo and joined henry in looking pityingly at albert as he struggled to adjust the petty cash you dont ask whether you want a rape i told henry sharply rape comes uninvited i was gathering my post from the mantelpiece and looked at it with disgust like little brown envelopes from the inland revenue morning rumpole i became aware of the presence of young erskinebrown who was standing by the mantelpiece also watching albert in his struggle to balance the budget he was holding some sort of legal document and wearing a shirt with broad stripes elasticsided boots and an expression of amused contempt at alberts business methods as i have made clear earlier in these reminiscences i dont like erskinebrown i greeted him civilly however and asked him if hed ever done a rape as you know rumpole i prefer the civil side i really find crime moderately distasteful at this point erskinebrown started to complain to albert about the typing of the distasteful document some mortgage or other act of oppression he was carrying and albert said if he was interrupted hed have to start again on his column of figures i happened to glance down at the pound notes on alberts desk and noticed one marked with a small red cross in the corner but i thought no more of it at the time i then turned my attention to my brief which i immediately noticed was a paying one and not legal aided i carried it into my room with increased respect the first thing i discovered was that my client was a labour mp named ken aspen the next was that he was accused of no less a crime than the rape of one of his loyal party workers a girl called bridget evans in his committee room late on the night before the election i couldnt help feeling pleased and slightly flattered that such a case had come my way the press box at the bailey was bound to be full and the words of the rumpole might once again decorate the news of the world then i unfolded an election poster and saw the face of aspen the workers friend a reasonably goodlooking man in his early forties frowning slightly with the concentrated effort of bringing us all a new heaven and a new earth which would still be acceptable to the gnomes of zurich the poster i had was scrawled over and defaced apparently by the hand of the complainant miss bridget evans at the time of the alleged crime i lit a small cigar and read on in my instructions and as i read the wonder grew that an honourable member with a wife and family and a house in hampstead garden suburb should put it all at risk for a moment of unwelcomed pleasure on the floor of his committee room by night i had heard of political suicide but this was ridiculous and i believed that any jury would find it incredible too of course at that time i hadnt had the pleasure of meeting mrs kenneth aspen so bumble whitelock when they made him chief justice of the seaward isles i dont know some godforsaken hole had this man in the dock before him found guilty of living on immoral earnings and he was puzzled about the sentence so he sent a runner down to the docks where the old chief justice was boarding a p o steamer home with the urgent messages how much do you give a ponce look ill do this it was my practice to retire with my old clerk albert to pommeroys wine bar in fleet street at the end of a days work to strengthen myself with a glass or two of claret before braving the tube and she who must be obeyed during such sessions i seek to divert albert with a joke or two usually of a legal nature i was in full swing when one of the girls who works at pommeroys interrupted us with the full glasses of chateau fleet street albert had his wallet out and was paying for the treat no sir quite honestly i happened to see the note as albert handed it over it was marked with a small red cross in the corner all right my turn next so the message was i returned to my story how much do you give a ponce and the answer came back immediately from the old chief justice by very fast rickshaw never more than two and six cheers i dont know why but that story always makes me laugh albert was laughing politely also never more than two and six you like that one do you albert ive always liked it sir its like a bloody marriage albert weve got to know each others anecdotes perhaps youd like a divorce sir let young henry do your clerking for you i looked over to the bar erskinebrown was having a drink with henry and dianne they were drinking vermouth and henry seemed to be showing some photographs henry wed sit in here over a cinzano bianco and hed show me the colour snaps of his holiday in majorca no albert well rub along for a few more years who got me this brief for instance the solicitors sir they like the cut of your jib i ventured to contradict my old clerk privately paid rapes dont fall from the sky like apples in a high wind however my jib is cut then albert told me how the job had been done proving once again his true value as a clerk i have the odd drink in here with mr myers of your instructing solicitors their managing clerk remember old myersy he grows prize tomatoes likes to be asked about them sir if i may suggest it fellow with glasses overcoat pockets stuffed with writs smokes a mixture of old bed socks i remember myersy thats him mr rumpole he thinks our only chance is to crucify the girl seems a bit extreme now albert started to reminisce recalling my old triumphs i remember you sir when you crossexamined the complainant in that indecent assault in the old kilburn alhambra you brought out as hed touched her up during the movietone news and she admitted shed sat through the whole of rosemarie and a halfhour documentary about wild life on the river dee before she complained to the manager as i recollect she fainted during your questioning got her on the wing around the tenth question it was true the witness had plummeted like a partridge right out of the witness box i told old myersy that said albert proudly will rumpole be afraid of attacking her he said i told him theres not a woman in the world my mr rumpoles afraid of i was i suppose a little late in returning to the mansion flat in gloucester road as i hung up the coat and hat i was greeted by a great cry from the kitchen of rumpole it was my wife hilda she who must be obeyed and i moved towards the source of the shout muttering being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire in the kitchen mrs rumpole was to be seen dimly as through a mist of feathers she was plucking a bird have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require i was watching the clock hilda told me ignoring shakespeare ive been watching it since half past six something blew up a rape i bought a bottle of plonk i put my peaceoffering down on the table hilda told me that wouldnt be enough for the feast planned for the morrow for which she was denuding a guineafowl our son nick back from his year at an american university was bringing his intended a miss erica freyburg to dinner with the family if hes bringing erica i said ill slip down to the health food centre and get a magnum of carrot juice i had already met my potential daughterinlaw a young lady with strong views on dietary matters and indeed on every other subject under the sun whom nick had met in baltimore sometimes i think youre just jealous of erica jealous about nicky i had got the bottle of plonk open and was sitting at the kitchen table the snow of feathers settling gently you want your son to be happy dont you of course of course i want him to be happy then i put my problem to hilda can you understand why an mp an honourable member with a wife and a couple of kids should suddenly take it into his head to rape anyone an mp what sides he on labour oh well then hilda had no doubt about it it doesnt surprise me in the least the next day the honourable member ken aspen was sitting in my chambers flanked by his solicitors clerk myers and a calm competent handsome woman who was introduced to me as his wife anna i suggested that she might find it less embarrassing to slip out while we discussed the intimate details perhaps to buy a hat well some judges still like hats on women in court but mrs aspen anna told me that she intended to stay with her husband every moment that she could a dutiful wife you see and the loyalty shone out of her aspen spoke in a slightly modified publicschool accent and i thought the ken and the just flattened vowels were a concession to the workers like a cloth cap on a labour member being a politician he started off by looking for a compromise couldnt i perhaps have a word with miss bridget evans no i couldnt nor could i form a coalition with the judge to defeat her on a vote of no confidence i received kens permission to call him mr aspen and then i asked him to tell his story it seemed that it was late at night in the committee room and both janice crowshott the secretary and paul etherington the agent had gone home bridget evans asked aspen into her office saying the duplicating machine was stuck when he got in she closed the door and started to talk about politics youre going to tell me that the door of the duplicating room was locked so you could have a good old chat about home rule for wales of course not or that it was during a few strong words about the export figures that her clothes got torn she started to accuse me of being unfaithful to her i was puzzled to my principles oh those i wanted to hear his defence not his platitudes she said id betrayed her and all the party workers id betrayed socialism well you were used to hearing that i supposed that must be part of the wear and tear of life in the dear old labour party then she started talking about anna she wanted ken to leave me mrs aspen was leaning forward half smiling at me it was the whole setup she objected to the house in hampstead garden suburb the kids schools where do they go exactly sarahs at the convent and edwards down for westminster and the loyal voters are down for the comprehensive i couldnt resist it but it earned me a distinctly unfriendly look from mrs aspen i think after that she started screaming at me all sorts of abuse obscenities i cant remember righteous indignation and then she started clawing at me telling me i didnt even have the courage to the courage to what to make love to her thats what ken believed mrs aspen supplied the answer shed have made an excellent witness and i began to regret she wasnt on trial thank you is that true of course its true ken made love to her as she wanted on the floor again mrs aspen provided the answer you believed that was what she wanted at last my client spoke up for himself yes yes thats what i believed i lit a small cigar and began to get a sniff of a defence the house of lords has decided its a mans belief that matters in a rape case there are very few women among the judges of the house of lords meanwhile the honourable member carried on with the good work she was goading me shouting and screaming and then when i saw what shed done to my face on the poster i found the election poster scored over with a pen and torn you saw that iheny yes yes i think so youd better be sure about this you saw this poster scrawled on before anything happened yes im almost sure not almost sure mr aspen qtate quite sure well yes she didnt do it when you were there no so she must have done it before she called you into the room that would seem to follow mr myers took his pipe out of his mouth for the first time oh yes mr myers you see the point i congratulated him is it important the member asked innocently oh no a triviality it only means she hated your guts before anyone suggests you might have raped her you know mr aspen if youre applying the same degree of thought to the economy as you are to this case no wonder the pounds dickie i have been politer to clients but aspen took it very well he stood up smiling and said youre right the case is yours mr rumpole ill go back to worrying about the pound mrs aspen also stood and looked at me as though i was a regrettable necessity in their important lives like drains i said nothing cheering case i told them we havent got a case yet because at the moment mr myers doesnt know a damn thing about miss bridget evans that evening the fatted guineafowl was consumed i brought home three very decent bottles of claret from pommeroy and we entertained nick and his intended it was always a treat to have nick at home with us even though hed given up reading sherlock holmes and taken to sociology a subject which might for me be entirely written in the hieroglyphics of some remote civilization i can think of no social theory which could possibly account for such sports as rumpole and she who must be obeyed and i honestly dont believe were exceptions being surrounded by a sea of most peculiar and unclassifiable individuals dinner was over but we still sat round the table and i was giving the company one of my bluechip legal anecdotes guaranteed to raise a laugh it was the one about the retiring chief justice of the seaward isles how much do you give a ponce i was laughing myself now in joyful anticipation of the punch line and the answer came back by very fast rickshaw never more than two and six nick joined me in a burst of hilarity hilda said well thank goodness thats over and erica looked totally mystified then she told us that nick had been offered a vacancy in the department of social studies in the university of baltimore which came as something of a surprise to us as we both thought nick had settled on the job hed been offered at warwick so its not decided hilda said voicing the general anxiety from our point of view i suppose warwick would have certain advantages over baltimore i told nick i doubt the academic standards are any higher erica was defensive no but it is a great deal nearer gloucester road another glass of water i rose and poured for erica she was a goodlooking girl and seemed healthy enough although i regretted her habit of drinking water as i told her scientific research has conclusively proved that water causes the hair to drop out fallen arches and ingrowing toe nails they should pass a law against it at this point erica did her best to raise the level of the conversation by saying nickys told me all about your work i think its just great the way you stand up in court for the underprivileged i will stand up in court for absolutely any underprivileged person in the world provided theyve got legal aid whats your motivation in taking on these sort of cases erica asked me seriously and i told her my motivation is the money i think youre just rationalizing he does it because he cant resist the sound of his own voice nick who knows most about me told her but i would allow no illusions money if it wasnt for the legal aid cheque i tell you rumpole would be silent as the tomb the old bailey would no longer echo with my pleas for acquittal and the voice of the rumpole would not be heard in the strand but as it is the poor and the underprivileged can rely on me im sure they can erica sounded consoling and the legal aid brings us a quite drinkable claret i refilled my glass from jack pommeroys wine bar as a matter of fact i get privately paid sometimes sometimes i get a plum erica wants to come and hear you in court nick told me and she smiled how could i miss it well im not exactly a tourist attraction if im going to live in england i want to know all i can about your mores erica explained well if she wanted to see the natives at their primitive crafts who was i to stop her come next week down the bailey nickll bring you for lunch well have steak and kidney pud like the old days nick used to drop in at the bailey when he came back from school he enjoyed the occasional murder didnt you nick thats settled then well have a bit of fun fun what sort of fun erica sounded doubtful and i told her rape mr myers of my instructing solicitors went to the honourable members constituency and discovered gold miss bridget evans was not greatly liked in the local party being held to be a leftwing activist and a bloody nuisance more important than her adherence to the late leon trotsky was her affair with paul etherington the labour party agent i was gloating over this and other and more glorious goodies provided by the industrious myers when there was a knock on my door in chambers and in filtered erskinebrown glowing with some mysterious triumph rumpole one doesnt want to bother the head of chambers why not bother him hes got very little on his mind except settling a nice fat planning case and losing at golf to the lord chancellor guthrie featherstone qc old sweetheart is ripe for bothering i turned my attention back to the past of miss bridget evans its our head clerk erskinebrown went on mysteriously albert you want to go and bother him erskinebrown could restrain himself no longer hes a criminal our head clerk is a criminal rumpole i looked at the man with considerable disapproval as an ornament of the civil side dont you find that sort of word a little distasteful i have proof and erskinebrown fished a pound note out of his pocket i examined it curiously looks like a fairly conventional portrait of her majesty theres a red cross in the corner he announced proudly i put it there i marked the money in the petty cash i looked at my fellow barrister in astonishment ive suspected albert for a long time well i saw him in pommeroys wine bar and i got the note hed paid with off one of the girls perhaps its difficult for you to believe extremely i stood up and fixed him with an unfriendly gaze a private eye taking up the bar as a profession what do you mean rumpole i mean in my day they used to be nasty little men in macs sniffing round the registers in cheap hotels they used to spy into bedrooms with fieldglasses in the everpresent hope of seeing male and female clothing scattered around its the first time i ever heard of a private dick being called to the bar and becoming an expert on the law of contract i handed the marked pound back to erskinebrown the wellknown dick he looked displeased its obvious that i will have to go straight to the head of chambers as he made for the door i stopped him why not i said oh just one thing that may have escaped your attention my dear watson whats that yesterday afternoon i borrowed five pound notes from petty cash no doubt notes decorated by you and i paid for all of alberts drinks in pommeroys rumpole are you sure i could see he felt his case crumbling i would really advise you erskinebrown as a learned friend not to go round chambers making these sort of wild allegations against our clerk a man whos been here old darling since you were in nappies very well rumpole im sorry i interrupted your rape erskinebrown had the door open he was about to slink away say no more old sweetheart not one word more oh convey my condolences to the unfortunate henry the position of second clerk must be continually frustrating when i was alone i was well pleased albert and i had been together now for forty years and i was anxious not to cross my old dutch and the evidence little myersy had uncovered put me in mind of lewis caroll oh hast thou slain the jabberwock come to my arms thou beamish boy not yet father i said to myself but i will oh yes i certainly will tomatoes doing well mr myers are they i apply a great deal of artificial you see mr rumpole and theyre just coming up to the fourth truss fourth truss are they lively little blighters then we were waiting outside court mr and mrs aspen were sitting on a bench he looking curiously relaxed she glaring across at miss bridget evans who was looking young and demure on a bench some distance away meanwhile i was going through the old legal gambit of chatting up the instructing solicitor i showed concern for his tomatoes he asked after my son whom he remembered as a visitor to the courts of law nick oh hes the brains of the family sociology theyve offered him a lectureship at warwick university and hes engaged to be married met her in america and now hes bringing the lady to live in england i never had a family mr myers told me and added i do find having young kids about plays merry hell with your tomatoes at which point mrs anna aspen drew me aside for a conference the first thing she said surprised me a little i just hope youre not going to let me down let you down mrs aspen so far as i can see youre in no danger of the nick im in danger of losing everything i ever worked for i understand no you dont understand mr rumpole its been hard work but i made ken fight i made him go for the nomination i made him fight for the seat when he got in he wanted i dont know to relax on the back benches he said hed throw in ideas but i told him to fight for the pjpss job and hes got it she looked across to where her husband was actually trying the ghost of a smile in bridgets direction he cant see its either him or her now ken cant see that youre right about him looking for compromises sometimes it makes me so angry angrier than the idea of your husband and miss bridget evans on the floor of the office oh that why should i worry about that before i could answer her question an usher came out to invite the honourable member to step into the dock and we were away when you go into court in a rape case its like stepping into a refrigerator with the light off all the men on the jury are thinking of their daughters and all the women are sitting with their knees jammed together i found a sympatheticlooking moderately tarty middleaged lady juror the sort that might have smiled at the honourable member and thought why didnt you ring me dearie id have saved you all this trouble but her lips snapped shut during the opening by mr twentyman qc for the prosecution and i despaired of her even the judge old sam parkin an amiable old darling perfectly capable of giving a conditional discharge for manslaughter or putting an old lag on probation even old sam looked when the case opened as if hed just heard the clerk say put up jack the ripper now he seemed to be wanning to miss bridget evans who was telling her hairraising story with effective modesty as i tottered to my feet old sam gave me an icy look when you start to crossexamine in a rape case you open the flap of the tent and youre out in the blizzard miss bridget evans this this incident involving mr aspen occurred at on wednesday night i dont know i wasnt watching the clock the door of the court opened to admit the rumpole fan club my son nick and erica his intended she was wearing an ethnic skirt and gave me a warm smile as though to encourage my efforts on behalf of the underprivileged and the oppressed after all the witnesses had conveniently departed when there was no one there to establish my clients innocence after it was all over what did you do i went home a serious and terrible crime had been committed and you went home tucked yourself up in bed and went to sleep and you said not one word to the police about it until the following day albert also of the fan club was sitting in front of me next to mr myers i heard his penetrating whisper hes doing the old alhambra cinema technique it was nice to feel that dear old albert was proud of me when you went to bed did you go alone i dont see what thats got to do with it her answer had a hint of sharpness and for the first time there was a centimetre up in some of the jurors eyebrows did you go alone i told you i went to bed miss evans i shall ask my question again and i shall go on asking it all night if its necessary in the interests of my client did you go to bed alone do i have to answer that sort of question my lord yes you do and my lord will so direct i got in before sam could draw breath perhaps if you answer mr rumpoles questions shortly you will be out of the box quite quickly and your painful experience will be over sam parkin meant well but i intended to keep her there a little while longer yes i went to bed alone how long had that been going on how long had what been going on mr rumpole sam asked that the witness had taken to sleeping alone my lord you were no longer friendly with mr etherington paul and i we split about two years ago if youre interested in the truth i began to hear what a barrister longs for when hes crossexamining the note of anger yes miss evans i am interested in the truth and i expect the ladies and gentlemen of the jury are also the tarty lady nodded perceptibly she and i were beginning to reach an understanding mr rumpole is it going to help us to know about this young lady and paul sam was doing his best paul etherington my lord he was the parliamentary agent im anxious not to keep this witness longer than is necessary i understand my lord it must be most unpleasant almost as unpleasant i thought as five years in the nick which was what the honourable member might expect if i didnt demolish miss evans but i have my duty to do and a couple of refreshers to earn mr twentyman qc whispered a thought bitchily to his junior you had been living with paul etherington for two years before you parted yes so you were eighteen when you started living together just nearly eighteen and before that i was at school you had lovers before paul yes how many one or two or three or four how many or didnt they stay long enough to be counted my dear friend the lady juror gave a little disapproving sigh i had misjudged her the old darling was less afille dejoie than a member of the festival of light but i saw erica whisper to nick and he held her hand shushing her mr rumpole sam had flushed beneath his wig i took a swift move to lower his blood pressure i apologize my lord pure unnecessary comment i withdraw it at once your mr rumpole is doing us proud i heard mr myers whisper to albert who replied complacently his old hand has lost none of its cunning myersy after a dramatic pause i played the ace how old were you when you had the abortion i looked round the court and met ericas look not exactly a gaze of enraptured congratulation i was nineteen it was perfectly legal miss evans was now on the defensive i got a certificate from the psychiatrist saying you were unfit for childbirth i suppose so and the psychiatrist certified you were emotionally unstable it was a shot in the bloody dark but i imagine thats what trick cyclists always say to prevent any unwanted increase in the population something like that yes i gave ken aspen a cheering glance he was busy writing a note containing i hoped more ammunition for rumpole in the firing line so the jury have to rely in this case on the evidence of a yovosg vroman vfho has been certified emotionally unstable the jury were looking delightfully doubtful as the usher brought me the note from the dock no ammunition not even any congratulation but just one line scrawled leave her alone now please k a i crumpled the note with visible irritation in such a mood no doubt did nelson put the glass to his blind eye when reading the signal to retreat just three months ago you were rushed into hospital youd taken a number of sleeping tablets by accident i continued to attack no why well it was i told you id just parted from paul come now miss evans just think youd parted from paul over a year ago i was i was confused was it then you first met mr aspen just just about that time and fell in love with him no she was really angry now but she managed to smile at the jury who didnt smile back if i could have dropped dead of a coronary at that moment i thought miss bridget evans might be dancing for joy became so obsessed with him that you were determined to pursue him at any cost to him or to his family shall i tell you the truth i didnt even like him and that night after you and mr aspen had made love love is that what you call it he refused to leave his wife and children we never discussed his wife and children and it was in rage because he wouldnt leave his family that you made up this charge to ruin him you hate him so much i dont hate him oh can it be you are still in love with him i never hated him i tell you i was indifferent to him it was the answer i wanted and just the moment to hold up the poster of kens face scrawled on by miss evans in her fury so indifferent that you did that to his face on the wall perhaps after before because you had done that early in the evening hadnt you in one of your crazy fits of rage and jealousy now bridget evans was crying her face in her hands but whether in fury or grief or simply to stop the questions not i but the jury would have to judge will that poster be exhibit mr rumpole sam spoke in his best matteroffact judges voice and i gave him a bow of deep satisfaction and said if your lordship pleases is that your work i was entertaining nick and erica to an apresgouxt drink in pommeroys wine bar a group from chambers guthrie featherstone erskinebrown my friend george frobisher and old uncle tom were at the bar the rumpole family occupied a table in that part of pommeroys where ladies are allowed to assemble i felt as if id spent a day digging the roads in a muck sweat and exhausted after the crossexamination i was of course moderately well pleased with the way it had gone and i had asked joan the waitress to bring us a bottle of pommeroys cooking champagne and ericas special a cocacola when it came i took a quick glassful and answered her question when it goes well we made a bit of headway this afternoon you sure did erica was a bit upset nick looked from one to the other of us embarrassed is that the way you make your living erica repeated a humble living with an occasional glass of cooking champagne with paying briefs attacking women i must confess i hadnt thought of bridget evans as a woman but as a witness i tried to explain not women in particular i attack anyone regardless of age or sex who chooses to attack my client god knows which is the criminal him or her but old darling thats what were rather trying to find out what worries ricky is nick was doing his best to explain the girl has to go through all that i mean its not only the rape not only the rape well its like shes getting punished isnt it arent you rather rushing things i mean whos saying a rape took place wellisntshe oh i see you think its enough if she says it its a different sort of crime is it i mean not like murder or shoplifting or forging cheques they still have to be proved in the oldfashioned way but rape some dotty girl only has to say you did it and you trot off to chokey without asking embarrassing questions look you dont want to discuss a boring old case whatve you been doing nick getting ready for warwick but erica wasnt to be deterred of course we should discuss the case shed have made an advocate this erica she was dogged i mean its the greatest act of aggression that any human being can inflict ricky dads just doing his job im sorry we came nicky looked at his watch no doubt hoping they had an appointment im glad oh sure im glad erica was smiling quite mirthlessly hes a field study in archaic attitudes look old sweetheart is it archaic to believe in some sort of equality of the sexes she looked taken aback at that equality youre into equality for gods sake yes give you equal pay certainly let you be allin wrestlers and lord chancellor by all means ill even make the supreme sacrifice and give up giving my seat in the bus but youre asking for women witnesses to be more equal than any other witnesses but in that sort of case erica wasnt to be won over by any sort of irony a man forcing his masculinity or a woman getting her revenge i suggested i mean i dont suppose ill ever have to actually choose between being raped and being put in the cooler for five years banged up with a bar of soap and a chamber pot but if i ever had youre being defensive again erica smiled at me quite tolerantly ami the arguments kind of painful so you make a little joke perhaps but its not exactly a joke i mean have you considered the possibility of my client being innocent well hed better be thats all i can say after what you did to that girl this afternoon hed better be then nick remembered they were due at the pictures and they left me erica with the warm feeling of having struck a blow for her sex nick perhaps a little torn between us but holding ericas arm as he steered her out i went over to the bar for a packet of small cigars and there were the learned friends pouring over a pink slip of paper which jack pommeroy was showing them as soon as i drew up beside the bar jack showed me the cheque it was made out to me from a firm of solicitors called sprout and pennyweather and had my name scrawled on the back it was for the princely sum of nine pounds fifty my remuneration for a conference i looked at my purported signature and felt unaccountably depressed no need to tell us rumpole said guthrie featherstone qc mp its alberts signature its peaceful down here extraordinarily peaceful the honourable member was eating spaghetti rings and drinking hot sweet tea down in the cells sam parkin had declined bail in the lunch hour he seemed extraordinarily contented a fact which worried me not a little im afraid its hardly a three rosettes in the michelin as far as the grubs concerned i apologized to aspen its tasteless stodge like nursery tea sort of comforting really there are only two important things to remember one you saw the poster scribbled on as soon as you came into the room i tried to wrench his attention back to the case and you believed she wanted it thats all you just believed it did you have to ask her those questions aspen looked at me more in sorrow than in anger yes dragging out her life for the vultures in the press box i want you to win this bizarre ambition of mine made the honourable member smile you sound like my wife she wants me to win always im so tired its peaceful down here isnt it very peaceful look out old darling youre not falling in love with the nick are you i had seen it before that terrible look of resignation for years oh as long as i can remember annas worked so hard on me winning he seemed to be talking to himself i felt strangely superfluous sitting on platforms chatting up ministers keeping in with the press trying to convince the faithful that it all still meant something my wife anna you know she wanted me in the cabinet shed like to have been a ministers wife and what did you want it was a long time before he answered me and then he said i wanted it to stop calling your own client is the worst part of a trial you cant attack him or lead him or do anything but stand with your palms sweating and hope to god the old nitwit tells the right story mrs aspen was staring at her husband as if to transfer to him a little of her indomitable will he stood in the witness box smiling gently as though someone else was on trial and he was a not very interested spectator i showed him the defaced poster and asked the five thousand dollar question did you see that had been done when you went into the room he looked at me almost as if i was the one to be pitied and said after a pause i cant remember i smiled as if id got exactly the answer i wanted a bit of a sickly smile did miss evans start talking about your wife about anna yes did she want you to leave your wife did she sam parkin was helping me out in the silence i cant i cant exactly remember she went on and on goading me what happened then it was then the honourable member showed his first sign of passion shed been asking for it all that claptrap about betraying the party all those cliches about power corrupting i suddenly got angry it was then i then you what made made love to her in anger sam parkin was frowning i suppose so yes i saw annas look of fear and then the judge leaned forward to ask just tell us this mr aspen did you believe that was what she wanted so the old darling on the bench had chucked ken aspen a lifebelt i hoped to god the drowning man wasnt going to push it away it seemed about a year before he answered i dont know what i believed then exactly it wasnt your fault if i may say sir when i got back to the clerks room albert was as ever consoling it was the client thats right albert these things are always so much easier without clients i saw that henry our second clerk was smiling as he told me that there was a chambers meeting and i was to go up to our learned leaders room when albert offered to take me up henry said that featherstone had said that it was a meeting for members of chambers only and our head clerk wasnt invited albert looked at me and i could see he was worried cheer up albert i told him see you at pommeroys later featherstone was pouring us all earl grey out of his fine bone china tea service it seems that albert has been pursuing a long career of embezzlement he said as he handed round sugar that seems a very long word for nine pounds fifty i told them id say the correct legal expression was fiddling i dont see how we can excuse crime whatever you call it erskinebrown was clearly appearing for the prosecution anyway it was my nine pounds fifty it seems to me i can call it what i like i can call it a christmas present at which uncle tom who was dozing in the corner said i suppose it will be christmas again soon how depressing apparently its not justyour money rumpole featherstone sat judicially behind his desk isnt it is there the slightest evidence that anyone else suffered i asked the assembled company the petty cash erskinebrown was the only one to answer i told you about the petty cash i was too tired to argue with erskinebrown you told me youd borrowed from alberts float yes and paid for the drinks in pommeroys you were lying werent you rumpole now even featherstone realized erskinebrown had gone too far erskinebrown he said thats not the sort of language we use to another member of chambers if rumpole says he borrowed the money then i for one am prepared to accept his word as a gentleman suddenly i grew impatient with the learned friends i pushed myself to my feet then youre a fool thats all i can say as a gentleman of course i was lying what does rumpole say he was doing uncle tom asked george for information lying dear me how extraordinary i lied because i dont like people being condemned i explained it goes against my natural instincts thats very true he never prosecutes you dont prosecute do you rumpole george gave me a friendly smile i liked old george no i dont prosecute all right now well hear rumpoles defence of albert erskinebrown leant back in featherstones big leather chair trying to look like a juvenile judge it doesnt seem to me that its albert thats in trouble not in trouble its us legal gentlemen learned friends so friendly and so gentlemanly that we never check his books or ask to see his accounts of course he cheats us little small bits of cheating nine pounds fifty to buy a solicitor a drink or two in pommeroys he feels its a mark of respect due to a gent like calling you sir when you go wittering on about the typing errors in your statement of claim rather an odd mark of respect wouldnt you say rumpole featherstone stopped me and called the meeting to order i move we vote on this its a matter for the police erskinebrown said predictably rumpole you wouldnt agree the learned leader was asking for my vote youd hardly expect him to erskinebrown could never let a sleeping rumpole lie well alberts part of my life he always has been i remember when albert first came to us as a boy he was always whistling out of tune uncle tom was reminiscing and i added my tuppence worth hes like the wornout lino in the chambers loo and the cells under the old bailey i feel comfortable with abert hes like home and he goes out and grubs for briefs in a way were too gentlemanly to consider hes cheated us theres no getting away from that george interrupted me quite gently well weve got to be cheated occasionally thats what its all about isnt it i looked round at their blank faces otherwise youd spend your whole life counting your change and adding up bills and chucking grown men into chokey because they didnt live up to the high ideals of the chambers or the party or some bloody nonsense i dont know that i exactly follow george was doing his best neither do i ive done a rather bloody case im sorry i sat down beside our oldest member how are you uncle tom i never expected christmas to come again so quickly this was uncle toms contribution now featherstone was summing up personally speaking quite personally and without in any way condoning the seriousness of alberts conduct rapes bloody tiring i told them specially when you lose i would be against calling in the police this was featherstones judgement not very gentlemanly having old bill in chambers stamping with his great feet all over the petty cash vouchers i lit my last small cigar on the other hand albert in my view must be asked to leave immediately all those in favour at featherstones request all the other hands went up well rumpole said erskinebrown teller for the ayes have you anything to say have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed against you i blew out smoke as i told them an old chestnut they say mr justice snaggs once asked a murderer that bugger all came a mutter from the dock so snaggs j says to the murders counsel did your client say something bugger all my lord the counsel replied funny thing says mr justice snaggs i thought i heard him say something my story ended in a hoot of silence it was one that my old clerk albeit laughed at quite often in pommeroys wine bar a couple of nights later i was sitting alone in pommeroys telling myself a few old legal anecdotes when to my surprise and delight nick walked in alone he sat down and i ordered a bottle of the best chateau fleet street i dropped into chambers albert wasnt there no we have a new clerk henry im sorry about the case yes the honourable member got five years i took a mouthful of claret to wash away the taste of prisons and saw nick looking at me he had a strong desire to be found guilty i dont know why exactly so really you neednt have asked all those questions well yes nick yes i had to ask them now are we going to see you both on sunday there was a pause nick looked at me he obviously had something far more difficult to communicate than the old confessions of poker games in the deserted vicarage during his schooldays i wanted to tell you first you see well ive decided to take the job in baltimore ricky wants to go back i mean we can get a house there and well her familyd miss her if she were stuck with me in england her family theyre very close yes yes i suppose they are apparently her mother hates the idea of ricky being in england he smiled shes the sort of woman thatd start sending us food parcels i could think of nothing to say except it was good of you nick good of you to spare the time to drop into chambers well be back quite often ricky and i well be back for visits you and ricky of course well then cheers we had one for our respective roads and i gave my son a bit of advice theres one thing youll have to be careful of you know living in america whats that the hygiene it can be most awfully dangerous the purity the terrible determination not to adulterate anything you will be very careful of it wont you nick some weeks later as i was packing the bulging briefcase after breakfast for a day down the bailey with a rather objectionable fraud she who must be obeyed came in with a postcard from our son and his intended written in midair with a handsome picture of a jet and a blue sky on the front and kisses from nick and ricky on the back i handed it back to her and she gave it an attentive reread as she sat down for another cup of tea then she said you know why erica went back home dont you i confessed total ignorance she didnt like it when she came to see you in court she didnt like the way you asked all those questions she made that quite clear when they were here for lunch last sunday when they came to say goodbye she thought the questions you asked that girl were tasteless distasteful i was on my way to the door thats the word distasteful theres a picture of their jet on the front of this postcard i saw it very handsome i opened the kitchen door as dramatically as possible fare thee well and if forever still forever fare thee well it takes a bad moment to make me fall back on lord byron dont be silly hilda frowned whatre you going to do today rumpole it was a day like all the others and i said i suppose go on asking distasteful questions the end
