mysterious jones xxxvii the return of lefty lefty locke pitchermanager chapter i an unexpected offer lefty locke gave the man a look of surprise the soft bright moonlight was shining full on weegmans face and he was chuckling he was always chuckling or laughing outright and locke had grown tired of it it was monotonous what do you mean the pitcher asked tinware for kennedy i dont believe i get you weegman snapped his fingers another little trick that was becoming monotonous and irritating thats poor slang perhaps he admitted but youve been in the game long enough to understand it collier is going to tie the can to old jack lefty moved his chair round on the little vinecovered porch in order to face his visitor squarely frogs were chorusing in the distance and the dynamo in the electric power house on the edge of the town kept up its constant nocturnal droning i could scarcely believe you meant just that said the star slabman of the blue stockings soberly being charles colliers private secretary and therefore to a large extent aware of his plans i presume you know what youre talking about you can bet on it laughed weegman leaning back and puffing at his cigar im the man collier left to carry out his orders regarding the team i have full instructions and authority but im sure kennedy has no inkling of this i correspond with him regularly and i know he expected a new contract to sign before mr collier went abroad he wrote me that the contract was to be mailed him from new york but that he supposed collier being a sick man forgot it at the last moment weegman took the cigar from his mouth and leaned forward on the arm of his chair a new manager of the right sort is hard to find he stated confidentially and collier wasnt ready to let go all holds until he had some one else in view at least locke uttered a smothered exclamation of incredulity do you mean to tell me that charles collier was handing old jack kennedy a deal as deceitfully crooked as that he cried i cant believe it kennedy has been a faithful and loyal manager three years ago when collier secured the controlling interest in the club his bad judgment led him to drop kennedy and fill his place with al carson you know what happened carson made a mess of it and old jack was called back at the last moment to save the day he did it and won the championship for the blue stockings by a single game since then come now chuckled weegman snapping his fingers again you know you were the man who really won that championship by your airtight pitching why do you want to give somebody else the credit kennedy merely went in as a pinch hitter and pounded the only run of the game across the rubber no matter how airtight a pitchers work may be to win games the team behind him has got to hit kennedy was there with the goods thats ancient history now what has he done since then as a player hes a hasbeen hes lost his eyes so that he cant even bat in the pinches now his sun has set and he may as well retire to his farm and settle down for old age he hasnt lost his brains asserted locke warmly playing or pinch hitting is a small part of a managers business once since then hes copped the bunting for us and last year it was hard luck and injury to players that dropped us into third position i dont blame you said weegman good naturedly you ought to stand up for him it shows the right spirit he gave you your chance practically plucked you from the brambles but he supplemented disparagingly he was desperately hard up for twirlers that season you were sort of a lucky guess on his part save for the fact that hes never been able to win a worlds championship old jacks been picking fourleaf clovers all his life hes too soft and easygoing for a manager not enough drive to him it was lefty lockes turn to laugh but his merriment held more than a touch of irony jack kennedy has won pennants or kept in the first division at least with teams that would have been fighting for the subcellar under any other manager when meddlers have not interfered hes always been able to get the last ounce of baseball out of every man under him while he has handled it the club has always been a big paying proposition what he has done has been nothing short of miraculous considering the niggardly policy forced upon him by those in power its the lowestsalaried team in the league we have men getting twentyfive hundred or three thousand who should be drawing down twice as much and would be with any other winning big league club only a man with kennedys magnetism and tact could have kept them going at high pressure could have kept them from being dissatisfied and lying down what theyve accomplished has been done for him not for the owners and now you tell me hes to be canned theres gratitude my dear man chirruped weegman baseball is business and gratitude never goes far in business granting what you say may have been true in the past its plain enough that the old mans beginning to lose his grip he fell down last season and now that the feds are butting in and making trouble hes showing himself even more incompetent talk about gratitude it didnt hold grist or orth and now its reported that dillon is negotiating with the outlaws you know what that means our pitching staff is all shot to pieces if the players were so true to kennedy why didnt they wait for their contracts how could jack send them contracts when he hasnt one himself if he had the authority now perhaps he could save dillon for us even yet billy orth is hotheaded and impulsive and he thought he wasnt given a square deal as for grist old petes days are numbered and he knows it he was wise to the talk about asking waivers on him it was a tentoone shot hed have been sent to the minors this coming season with the federals offering him a threeyear contract at nearly twice as much as he ever received hed have been a fool to turn it down all the same he had a talk with kennedy before he signed jack couldnt guarantee him anything so he jumped thats it exclaimed weegman triumphantly theres a sample of kennedys incompetence right there he should have baited grist along and kept him away from the feds until the season was well under way when they would have had their teams made up and probably wouldnt have wanted pete then if he didnt come up to form he could be let out to the minors leftys face being in the shadow the other man did not see the expression of contempt that passed over it for a few minutes the southpaw was too indignant to reply when he did however his voice was level and calm though a trifle hard so that would have been your way of doing it grist has had hard luck with all his investments i understand hes saved very little hes a poor man weegman lolled back again puffing at his cigar thats his lookout anyway hes not much loss but these confounded feds arent through theyre after dirk nelson too what dye know about that our best catcher they seem to be trying to strip our whole team knowing something about the salaries our players get probably they figure it should be easy stripping suddenly the visitor leaned forward again and gazed hard at locke he was not laughing now have they been after you he asked yes i thought likely made you a big offer yes what have you done nothing good exclaimed weegman its a good thing for you that you kept your head theyre outside organized ball and any man who jumps to them will be blacklisted all this talk about the money they have behind them is pure bluff think so i know it theyre plunging like lunatics and theyll blow up before the seasons over they havent got the coin then how does it happen they are signing players for three years and handing over certified checks in advance for the first year besides guaranteeing salaries by bank deposits for the full tenure of contracts oh theyve got some money of course admitted weegman lightly but as i say theyre spending it like drunken sailors when the feds explode the fools who have jumped to them will find themselves barred from organized ball for all time theyll be down and out the outlaws may hurt us a little this year but after that nothing doing just the same i own up weve got to put a check on em before they rip the blue stockings wide open thats what brings me down here to fernandon to see you really said lefty interestedly you seem to be shouldering a lot of responsibility i am chuckled charles colliers private secretary it was all arranged with mr collier before he sailed he left me with proper authority i am to sign up the manager for the team is that right exclaimed locke surprised then according to your own statement if you want to save the blue stockings from being riddled youd better be about it i am said weegman thats why ive come to you for advice oh no he laughed heartily i dont need that i know what im about ive brought a contract i want you to put your name to it your salary will be advanced fifteen hundred dollars the feds offered to double it as a pitcher youre not getting this extra money on account of your pitching interposed weegman promptly im offering you the increase of salary to assume the additional duties of manager chapter ii something queer the expression of amazement that leaped into the eyes of lefty locke was masked by a shadow he stiffened and sat bolt upright speechless bailey weegman having stated the business that had unexpectedly brought him down from the north to the florida town where the great lefthander of the blue stockings was spending the winter with his wife once more settled back taking a long satisfied pull at the stump of his fragrant havana he was chuckling beneath his breath a gentle breeze crept into the leaves of the vinecovered porch and set them whispering like gossips the dynamo droned drowsily in the distance presently lefty found his voice whats the joke he asked a trifle harshly no joke assured the jovial visitor im not given to joking im a man of business but its preposterous a pitcher for manager clark griffith isnt the only pitcher who has succeeded as a manager griffiths success came when he was on the decline as a pitcher whats the use to argue locke theres really no good reason why a pitcher shouldnt manage a ball team youve been doing it with the little amateur club youve been running down here in fernandon this winter because necessity compelled nobody else would take hold of it i organized the team for a special reason its made up mainly of visitors from the north no salaries are paid i had located here for the winter and i wanted to keep in trim and work my arm into shape for the coming season i couldnt find anybody else to organize the club and handle it so i had to i have only three other players who have been with me from the start the rest of the nine has been composed of changing players who came and went college men or just plain amateurs who have taken to the sport we have played such teams as could be induced to come here from jacksonville st augustine and other places handling such a club has given me absolutely no reason to fancy myself qualified to manage one in the big league ive been keeping my eye on you said weegman patronizingly and i am satisfied that you can fill the position of playing manager for the blue stockings youre satisfied you how about charles collier as you know hes a sick man a very sick man otherwise hed never have dropped everything just at this time to go to europe along with a physician and trained nurses he has been too ill to attend properly to his regular business outside baseball and therefore his business has suffered he has had heavy financial reverses that have worried him and now the meddling of the feds has hurt the value of the ball club the stock wouldnt bring at a forced sale today half what it should be worth mr collier trusts me he was anxious to get some of the load off his shoulders he has left me to straighten out matters connected with the team where is mr collier now asked locke quietly he was taking the baths at eaux chaudes when last heard from but he has since left there i cant say where he is at the present time then how may he be communicated with in case of emergency chuckling weegman lighted a fresh cigar having tossed the remnant of the other away the glow of the match fully betrayed an expression of selfsatisfaction on his face he cant be he said it was his doctors idea to get him away where he could not be troubled by business of any nature he may be in tunis or naples for all i know its very remarkable said lefty slowly oh i dont know purred the other man locking his fingers over his little round stomach which seemed so incongruous for a person who was otherwise not overfat really he was in a bad way worrying over business reverses was killing him his only salvation was to get away from it all locke sat in thought watching the serene smoker through narrowed lids there was something queer about the affair something the southpaw did not understand true collier had seemed to be a nervous highstrung man but when lefty had last seen him he had perceived no indications of such a sudden and complete breakdown it had been colliers policy to keep a close and constant watch upon his baseball property but now at a time when such surveillance was particularly needed because of the harassing activities of the federals having turned authority over to a subordinate not only had he taken himself beyond the range of easy communication but apparently he had cut himself off entirely from the sources of inside information concerning baseball affairs furthermore it seemed to locke that the man who claimed to have been left in full control of that branch of colliers business was the last person who should have been chosen what lay behind it all the pitcher was curious to divine presently weegman gave a castanetlike snap of his fingers by the way he said sharply how about your arm my arm said lefty you mean its all right isnt it you know there was a rumor that you hurt it in the last game of the season some wise ginks even said youd never pitch any more ive been doing some pitching for my team here in fernandon then of course the old wings all right youll be in form again the greatest lefthander in the business how about it ive never been egotistical enough to put that estimate on myself well thats what lots of the sharps call you the arms as good as ever if you stop over tomorrow youll have a chance to judge for yourself were scheduled to play a roving independent nine known as the wind jammers and i hear theyre some team of the kind i shall pitch part of the game anyhow youve been pitching right along a little in every game lately i pitched four innings against the jacksonville reds and five against the cuban giants weve lost only one game thus far and that was our second one the eccentric manager and owner of the wind jammers who calls himself capn wiley threatens to take a heavy fall out of us he has a deafmute pitcher mysterious jones who he claims is as good as walter johnson weegman laughed derisively theres no pitcher as good as johnson anywhere much less traveling around with a bunch of hippodromers and bushwhackers but about your arm is it all right i hope to win as many games with it this year as i did last well the teams going to need pitchers the loss of orth is bound to be felt and if dillon jumps look here locke weve got to get busy and dig up two or three twirlers one of topnotch caliber we yes you and i of course we cant expect to get a firststringer out of the bushes that happens only once in a dogs age but perhaps kennedy has some good youngsters up his sleeve you should know about that im wise that he has consulted you regularly hes sought your advice and listened to it so in a way youve had considerable to do with the management of the team you say youve corresponded with him right along you ought to know all about his plans thats one reason why i came to figure on you as the man to fill his place i wondered murmured locke thats one reason for another thing youve got modesty as well as sense you dont think you know it all youre not set in your ways and probably youd listen to advice and counsel old jack is hardheaded and stiff when he makes up his mind theres no turning him he takes the bit in his teeth and he wants full swing hes always seemed to feel himself bigger than the owners hes butted up against mr collier several times and colliers always had to give in as i understand it said lefty smoothly you think the manager should be a man with few fixed opinions and no set and rigid policy in a way thats something like it admitted weegman he mustnt go and do things wholly on his own initiative and without consulting anybody especially those who have a right to say something about the running of the team mr collier has placed me in a position that makes it imperative that i should keep my fingers on the pulse of things i couldnt conscientiously discharge my duty unless i did so i know i could never get along with kennedy the manager must work with me well work together of course in most respects hell be permitted to do about as he pleases as long as he seems to be delivering the goods but it must be understood that i have the right to veto as well as the right to direct policies and deals with that understanding to start with well get along swimmingly he finished with a laugh lefty rose to his feet youre not looking for a manager weegman he said what you want is a putty man a figurehead under any circumstances youve come to the wrong market chapter iii the federal policy weegman was startled what whats that he spluttered staring upward at the towering figure in white what do you mean just what ive said replied the pitcher grimly under no circumstances would i think of stepping into old jack kennedys shoes but even if he were a perfect stranger to me you could not inveigle me into the management of the blue stockings on the conditions you have named management he scoffed why the man who falls for that will be a tame cat with clipped claws its evident mr weegman that youve made a long journey for nothing for a moment the visitor was speechless lefty lockes modest unassuming ways coupled with undoubted ambition and a desire to get on had led charles colliers secretary to form a very erroneous estimate of him but man alive said weegman do you realize what youre doing youre turning down the chance of a lifetime i have the contract right here in my pocket with colliers name properly attached and witnessed if you doubt my authority to put the deal through i can show you my power of attorney from mr collier in case sentiment or gratitude is holding you back let me tell you that under no circumstances will kennedy again be given control of the team now dont be a chump and if i were in your place interrupted locke i wouldnt waste any more breath weegman snapped his fingers and got up i wont i didnt suppose you were quite such a boob but you did suppose i was boob enough to swallow your bait at a gulp you thought me so conceited and greedy that i would jump at the chance to become a puppet a manager in name only without any real authority or control its plainly your purpose to be the real manager of the team for what reason or design i admit i dont quite understand just how you hypnotized charles collier and led him to consent to such a scheme i cant say but i do say that no successful ball team has ever been run in such a way youre not fit to manage a ball club and you wouldnt dare assume the title as well as the authority probably you know collier wouldnt stand for that yet you intend to force your dictation upon a pseudomanager such meddling would mean muddling it would knock the last ounce of starch out of the team if the blue stockings didnt finish a bad tailender it would be a miracle bailey weegman was furious all the way through but still he laughed and snapped his fingers youre a wise guy arent you he sneered i didnt dream you were so shrewd and discerning now let me tell you something my knowing friend ive tried to save your neck and you wont have it my neck exclaimed the pitcher incredulously youve tried to save my neck oh i know your old soup bones on the blink you didnt put anything over me by dodging and trimming when i questioned you about your arm you knocked it out last year and youve been spending the winter down here trying to work it back into shape you can pitch a little against weak bush teams but you cant even go the whole distance against one of them that being the case what sort of a figure do you expect to cut back in the big league up against the slugging wolves or the hardhitting hornets how long would you last ive got your number and you know it if thats so it seems still more remarkable that you should wish to hold me certainly id be a great addition to a pitching staff thats smashed already did i say anything about your strengthening the pitching staff i offered to engage you in another capacity think i didnt know why you declined to dicker with the feds when they made you a big offer you didnt dare for you know you couldnt deliver the goods having that knowledge under my hat ive been mighty generous with you weegman descended to the top step chuckling good night said locke longing to hasten the mans departure think it over invited charles colliers representative now that im here ill stick around and watch you pitch against these bushwhacking wind jammers tomorrow i imagine your efforts should be amusing perhaps youll change your mind before i catch the train north at yulee his chuckling became open laughter lefty turned and entered the cottage while weegman walked away in the moonlight the smoke of his cigar drifting over his shoulder certain circumstances had led philip hazelton to enter professional baseball under the pseudonym of tom locke to which as he was a lefthander his associates had added the nickname of lefty these names had stuck when he abruptly moved upward into the big league his rise having been rocketlike the pessimistic and the envious had never wholly ceased to look for the fall of a stick thus far in spite of the fact that each year of his service with the blue stockings saw him shouldering more and more of the pitching load until like jack coombs and ed walsh he had become known as the iron man they had looked in vain and it came to pass that even the most prejudiced was forced to admit that it was lefty who kept his team up there fighting for the bunting all the time toward the close of the last season however with the jinx in close pursuit of the blue stockings locke had pushed himself beyond the limit at one time the club had seemed to have the pennant cinched but through the crippling of players it had begun to slip in the latter part of the season in the desperate struggle to hold on going against manager kennedys judgment and advice lefty did more pitching than any other two men on the staff and with a little stronger team to support him his winning percentage would have been the highest of any pitcher in the league it was not his fault that the blue stockings did not finish better than third in the cozy living room of the little furnished cottage locke had leased for the brief winter months a remarkably pretty young woman sat reading by a shaded lamp she looked up from the magazine and smiled at him as he came in then she saw the serious look upon his face and the smile faded what is it phil she asked with a touch of anxiety is anything wrong he sat down facing her and told her all about his interview with bailey weegman as she listened her mobile face betrayed wonderment annoyance and alarm its a raw deal for kennedy he asserted in conclusion and i believe its wholly of weegmans devising im sure when the season ended collier had no idea of changing managers there isnt a more resourceful astute man in the business than old jack youre always thinking of others phil she said how about yourself what will happen to you if you dont come to weegmans terms hard to tell he admitted frankly in fact ive been wondering just where id get off if my arm fails to come back she uttered a little cry but youve been telling me that it was growing better janet thats true but still its not what it should be and i dont dare put much of a strain on it i dont know that id last any time at all in real baseball weegman is wise yet he offered me a contract to pitch and to manage the team on paper it would seem that he had retained one star twirler for the staff but if i failed to come back we wouldnt have a single firststring slabman as a manager i would be sewed up so that i couldnt do anything without his consent theres a nigger in the woodpile janet she had put the magazine aside and clasped her hands in her lap he went on it looks to me as if somebody is trying to punch holes in the team though i dont get the reason for it following jack kennedys advice ive invested every dollar i could save in the stock of the club as weegman says its doubtful if the stock would bring fifty cents on the dollar at a forced sale today collier has met with heavy financial reverses in other lines hes sick and hes in europe where no one can communicate with him is somebody trying to knock the bottom out of his baseball holdings in order to get control of the club it looks that way from the offing but you said janet still thinking of her husband youre not tied up with weegman and the federals have made you a splendid offer you can accept that and land on your feet he smiled shaking his head slowly there are several reasons why i dont care to follow that course the first and strongest is my loyalty to jack kennedy the man who gave me a square deal then i dont care to bunko anybody and unless my arm comes back i wont be worth the money the feds have offered for my services lastly im not sure the new league is going to be strong enough to win out against organized baseball but youve said that they seem to have plenty of money behind them youve said too that their plan of dealing directly with players instead of buying and selling them like chattels or slaves was the only system that gave the players a just and honest deal thats right affirmed lefty slavery in baseball is something more than a joke the organization has been one of the biggest trusts in the country and it has dealt in human beings it has been so that when a man signed his first contract he signed away his right to say what he would do as long as he remained in the game after that he could be bought sold or traded without receiving a dollar of the purchasing or trading price he had to go where he was sent regardless of his personal likes wishes or convenience he had to accept whatever salary a manager chose to give him or get out even if his contract had expired with one manager he couldnt go to another and make a bargain no matter how much the other manager was willing to give him the reserve clause held him chained hand and foot today if the powers chose i could be sent down to the minors at any old salary the minors chose to pay i could be sold like a horse or a dog and if i didnt like it i could quit the game that would be my only recourse its terribly unfair said janet unfair thats a tame word on the other hand the federals are dealing directly with the players if they think hes worth it they give a man a good salary and a bonus besides the bonus goes to the player not to the club owner added to that the federal contracts provide that a club must increase a players salary at least five per cent each year or give him his unconditional release thus making it possible for him to deal with any other club that may want him its plain your sympathy is with the federals if theyre not trying to jack up organized baseball and sell out said lefty i hope they come through chapter iv the magnetized ball what are your plans asked janet after they had discussed the situation in all its phases have you decided on anything the southpaw answered im going to put jack kennedy wise im going to write him a letter tonight and i shall send him a telegram as soon as the office opens in the morning its up to him to get in communication with collier if theres any way of doing it you have not received a letter from virginia lately virginia collier the charming daughter of the owner of the blue stockings was janets closest friend no i have not heard from her in over three weeks and i dont understand it returned his wife she seems to have stepped off the map along with her father the whole business is mysterious why dont you write her at once explaining what is going on and send the letter to her last address i will it may not reach her but theres no harm in trying meanwhile ill get busy on mine to kennedy there doesnt seem to be much chance to spike weegmans guns but its worth trying locke had the knack of writing a succinct letter the one he wrote old jack was concise yet it was clear and complete within two minutes after opening it doubtless kennedy would know as much about the situation as did lefty himself yet it was probable that like the pitcher the manager would be mystified by the surprising and seemingly sinister maneuvers of bailey weegman following leftys advice janet wrote to virginia collier locke rose early the following morning and posted the letters for the first outward mail he sent a telegram also returning past the magnolia hotel to his surprise he perceived colliers private secretary sitting on the veranda smoking weegman beamed and chuckled morning he cried waving his cigar between two fingers the early bird eh been firing off a little correspondence i presume our communications will reach kennedy in the same mail and i wired him too quite a little jolt for the old man but it cant be helped of course hell have the sense to bow gracefully to the inevitable and that will clear the air afterward perhaps you may change your mind regarding my offer perhaps so returned lefty pleasantly but if i do i shall be a fit subject for a padded cell the agreeable look was wiped from weegmans face as locke passed on some time after breakfast lefty returned to the magnolia to learn if capn wiley and his ball players had arrived approaching he perceived a queer assortment of strangers lounging on the veranda and from their appearance he judged that they were members of the team many of them looked like old stagers veterans who had seen better days some were youthful and raw and inclined to be cockahoop there was a german an italian an irishman and a swede one was lanky as a starved greyhound and apparently somewhere near six feet and six inches tall from his heels to his hair roots another was short and fat and looked as if he had been driven together by some one who had hit him over the head with a board in a way these strangers in fernandon were most remarkable for their attire with scarcely an exception the clothes they wore were weird and fantastic samples of sartorial art various and nearly all prevailing freaks of fashion were displayed with colored shirts flaring socks and giddy neckties they caused all beholders to gasp they were most amazingly bejeweled and adorned with difficulty locke suppressed a smile as his quick eyes surveyed them near the head of the broad steps leading up to the veranda sat a somewhat stocky but exceptionally wellbuilt man of uncertain age he was almost as swarthy as an indian and his dark eyes were swift and keen and shrewd his black hair was graying on the temples his coat and trousers of extravagant cut were made from pronounced blackandwhitestriped material his fancy waistcoat buttoned with a single button at the bottom was adorned with large orangecolored figures his silk socks were red his fourinhand necktie was purple and the band that encircled the straw hat cocked rakishly upon his head was green he was smoking a cigar and pouring a steady flow of words into the ear of bailey weegman who made a pretense of not noticing locke yes mate he was saying old man breckenridge was the most painfully inconsiderate batter i ever had the misfortune to pitch against smoke curves twisters slow balls low balls and high balls they all looked alike to him now i have a preference i prefer a high ball scotch and carbonic but it made no difference to breck when he put his fiftyfiveounce ash wand against the pill said pill made a pilgrimage it journeyed right away to some land distant and remote and unknown and it did not stay upon the order of its going when it came right down to slugging compared with old breck your homerun bakers and honus wagners and napoleon lajoies are puny and faded shines and he always seemed able to make connections when he desired if he rambled forth to the dish yearning for a hit there was no known method by which the most astute and talented pitcher could prevent him from hitting quite a wonder i must admit laughed weegman in high amusement rather strange the big leagues didnt get hold of such a marvelous batsman isnt it oh he was on the roster of some class a team at various times but he had one drawback that finally sent him away to the remote and uncharted bushes charley horse had him in its invidious grip a spavined snail could beat breck making the circuit of the sacks and cross the pan pulled up yet with this handicap the noble old slugger held the record for home runs in the tall grass league naturally i had heart failure and angie pectoris every time i was compelled to face him on the slab likewise naturally i began meditating with great vigor upon a scheme to circumvent the old terror and at last my colossal brain concocted a plan that led me to chortle with joy i am deeply interested and curious declared weegman as the narrator paused puffing complacently at his weed go on locke had stopped near at hand and was listening others were hovering about their ears open their faces wreathed in smiles it was a simple matter of scientific knowledge and a little skulduggery pursued the storyteller obligingly i possessed the knowledge and i bribed the bat boy of old brecks team to perform the skulduggery i sent to the factory and had some special baseballs manufactured for me and in the heart of each ball was hidden a tiny but powerful magnet then i secretly furnished the rascally bat boy with a specially prepared steel rod that would violently repel any magnet that chanced to wander around into the immediate vicinity of the rod i instructed the boy to bore brecks pet bat surreptitiously when the shades of night had fallen insert the steel rod and then craftily plug the hole and may i never sail the briny deep again if that little scoundrel didnt carry out my instructions with the skill of a cutthroat or a diplomat even nature intended him for higher things if he isnt hanged some day it wont be his fault well the next time old breck brought his team to play against us upon our field i used the magnetized baseballs i was doing the hurling and in the very first inning the old swatter came up with the sacks charged and two out he smiled a smile of pity as he bent his baleful glance upon me youd better walk me walter says he and force a run for if you put the spheroid over im going to give it a long ride i returned his smile with one of the most magnanimous contempt dont blow up old boy says i with the exception of your batting youre all in and ive a notion that your batting eye is becoming dim and hazy lets see you hit this then i passed him a slow straight one right over the middle of the rubber he took a mighty swing at it meaning to slam it over into the next county well mate may i be keelhauled if that ball didnt dodge the bat like a scared rabbit mind you i hadnt put a thing on it but the repulsion of that deneoutronized steel rod hidden in the bat forced the ball to take the handsomest drop you ever beheld and the violence with which old breck smote the vacant ozone caused him to spin round and concuss upon the ground when he sat down it was a tremendous shock to his nervous system and it filled me with unbounded jubilance for i knew i had him at my mercy literally in the hollow of my hand he rose painfully chagrined and annoyed but still confident give me another like that you little wart he ordered savagely and ill knock the peeling off it beaming i retorted you couldnt knock the peeling off a prune heres what you called for and i threw him another slow straight one excuse these few tears the memory of that hallowed occasion makes me cry for joy he did it again concussing still more shockingly when he sat down it was simply an utter impossibility for him to hit that magnetized ball with his doctored bat but of course he didnt know what the matter was he thought i was fooling him with some sort of a new drop i had discovered the fact that i was passing him the merry cachinnation peeved him vastly when he got upon his pins and squared away for the third attempt his face was the most fearsome i ever have gazed upon he shook his big bat at me one more he raged give me one more and drop flat on your face the moment you pitch the ball or ill drive it straight through the meridian of your anatomy let me tell you now mate that breck was a gentleman and that was the first and only time i ever knew him to lose his temper under the circumstances he was excusable i put all my nerveshattering steam into the next pitch and instead of dropping the ball hopped over his bat when he smote at it i had fanned the mighty breckenridge and the wondering crowd lifted their voices in hosannas yet i know they regarded it in the nature of an accident and not until i had whiffed him three times more in the same game did either breck or the spectators arrive at the conviction that i had something on him after that said the narrator as if in conclusion i had him eating out of my hand right up to the final and decisive game of the season weegman begged the fanciful romancer to tell what happened in the last game oh we won was the assurance but we never would have if breck had been wise the last time he came to bat it was in the ninth inning with the score three to two in our favor two down and runners on second and third knowing it was brecks turn to hit i was confident we had the game sewed up but the confidence oozed out of me all of a sudden when i saw the big fellow paw the clubs over to select a bat other than his own clammy perspiration started forth from every pore of my body with any other swat stick beside his own i knew he was practically sure to drive any ball i could pitch him over the fence the agony of apprehension which i endured at that moment gave me my first gray hairs although i did not know it at the time it chanced that breck had selected the bat of another player who had had it bored and loaded with an ordinary steel rod this you can clearly understand made it more than doubly certain that he would hit the magnetized ball which would be attracted instead of repelled had i known this i shouldnt have had the heart to pitch at all as the noble warrior stood up to the pan i considered what i could pitch him curves could not fool him and he literally ate speed therefore without hope i tossed him up a slow one now it chanced that the old boy had decided to try a surprise having become disheartened by his efforts to slug he had resolved to attempt to bunt knowing such a move would be unexpected so he merely stuck out his bat as the sphere came sailing over the magnet was attracted by the steel rod and the ball just jumped at the bat against which it struck and stuck i hope never to tell the truth again mate if im not stating a simple unadulterated unvarnished fact the moment the ball touched the bat it stuck fast to it as if nailed there breck was so astonished that he stood in his tracks staring at the ball like a man turned to stone i was likewise paralyzed for an extemporaneous fraction of time but my ready wit quickly availed me bounding forward i wrenched the ball from the bat and tagged old breck with it appealing to the umpire for judgment there was only one thing his umps could do he had seen the batter attempt to bunt had seen bat and ball meet and had seen me secure the ball on fair ground and put it on to the hitter he declared breckenridge out and that gave us the game and the championship bailey weegman lay back and roared in doing so he seemed to perceive lefty for the first time as soon as he could get his breath he said oh i say locke let me introduce you this is capn wiley owner and manager of the wind jammers chapter v a man of mystery the swarthy little fabulist rose hastily to his feet making a quick survey of the southpaw am i indeed and at last in the presence of the great lefty locke he cried his face beaming like the morning sun in a cloudless sky is it possible that after many weary moons i have dropped anchor in the same harbor with the most salubriously efficacious portside flinger of modern times pardon my deep emotion slip me your mudhook lefty let me give you the fraternal grip he grabbed lockes hand and wrung it vigorously while the other members of the wind jammers pressed nearer looking the big league pitcher over with interest in many a frozen igloo declared wiley i have dreamed of this day when i should press your lilywhite fingers oft and anon during my weary sojourn in that far land of snow and ice have i pictured to myself the hour when we should stand face to face and exchange genuflections and greetings and whenever a smooched and tattered monthsold newspaper would drift in from civilization with what eager and expectant thrills did i tremulously turn to the baseball page that i might perchance read thereon how you had stung the hornets bitten the wolves clipped the claws of the panthers or plucked the feathers from the white wings and i have been wondering confessed lefty if you could be the original capn wiley of whom i heard so many strange tales in my boyhood it was reported that you were dead many a time and oft hath that canard been circulated according to rumor i have demised a dozen times or more by land and sea but each time like the fabled phoenix i have risen from my ashes during the last few fleeting years i have been in pursuit of fickle fortune in faroff alaska where it was sometimes so extremely cold that fire froze and we cracked up the congealed flames into little chunks which we sold to the chilkoots and siwashes as precious bright red stones strange to say whenever i have related this little nanny goat it has been received with skepticism and incredulity the world is congested with doubters when you wrote me admitted locke proposing to bring your wind jammers here to play the fernandon grays i thought the letter was a hoax at first i was tempted not to answer it and when i did reply it was out of curiosity more than anything else i wanted to see what the next twist of the joke would be let me assure you that you will find playing against the wind jammers no joke i have conglomerated together the fastest segregation of baseball stars ever seen outside a major league circuit and i say it with becoming and blushing modesty look them over he invited with a proud wave of his hand toward the remarkable group of listeners it has always been my contention that there are just as good players to be found outside the big league as ever wore the uniform of a major i have held that hard luck frowning fate or contumelious circumstances have conspired to hold these naturalborn stars down and prevent their names from being chiseled on the tablet of fame having gathered unto myself a few slippery shekels from my mining ventures in the land where baseball games begin at the hour of midnight i have now set out to prove my theory and before i am through i expect to have all balldom sitting up agog and gasping with wonderment i wish you luck replied lefty if you dont do anything else you ought to get some sport out of it i presume you still ascend the mound as a pitcher oh was the airy answer on rare occasions i give the gaping populace a treat by propelling the sphere through the atmosphere when my projector is working up to its oldtime form i find little difficulty in leading the most formidable batters to vainly slash the vacant ether the weather seeming propitious i may burn a few over this pm i trust you will pitch also i think i shall start the game at least bailey weegman butted in but he wont finish it wiley like yourself hes not doing as much pitching as he did once his laugh was significant the owner of the wind jammers looked startled tell me not in mournful numbers that your star is already on the decline he exclaimed looking at locke with regret thats what the big leagues do to a good man they burn him out like a pitchpine knot ive felt all along that the blue stockings were working you too much lefty without you on their roster ready to work three or four times a week in the pinches they never could have kept in the running youre more than complimentary said locke after giving weegman a look but i think ill be able to shake something out of my sleeve this season the same as ever then dont let them finish you dont let them grind you to a frazzle advised wiley for the first time in recent history you have a chance for your white alley the federals are giving you that if youre not already enmeshed in the folds of a contract the feds will grab you and hand you a square deal weegman rose chuckling and snapping his fingers all this talk about what the feds can do is gas he declared theyre getting nothing but the soreheads and deadwood of organized baseball which will be vastly better off without the deserters cripples and hasbeens may make a good thing out of the feds for a short time perhaps locke would find it profitable to jump his meaning was all too plain lefty felt like taking the insinuating fellow by the neck and shaking him until his teeth rattled but outwardly he was not at all ruffled or disturbed mr weegman he said is showing pique because i have not seen fit to sign up as manager of the blue stockings he professes to have authority from charles collier to sign the manager collier having gone abroad for his health if anybody doubts my authority shouted weegman plunging his hand into an inner pocket of his coat i can show the documents that will the southpaw had turned his back on him i understand you have a clever pitcher in the man known as mysterious jones wiley he said a pippin was the enthusiastic answer ill give you a chance to see him sagaciate today he is a deafmute he couldnt hear a cannon if you fired it right under the lobe of his ear and he does his talking with his prehensile digits leon ames in his best days never had anything on jones strange i never even heard of him our scouts have scoured the bushes from one end of the country to the other i never collided with any baseball scouts in alaska said wiley oh you found jones in alaska pitching for a team in nome but baseball up there i didnt know oh no nobody ever thinks of baseball up there but in the all too short summer season theres something doing in that line why even modern dances have begun to run wild in alaska so you see theyre right up to the present jiffy where did this jones originally hail from ask me i dont know nobody i ever met knew anything about him and what he knows about himself he wont tell hes mysterious you understand but his beautiful work on the slab has caused my classic countenance to break into ripples and undulations and convolutions of mirth where is he id like to give him the once over i think hes out somewhere prowling around the town and sizing up the citizens thats one of his little vagaries he has a combustable curiosity about strangers every place we go he wanders around for hours lamping the denizens of the burg outside baseball strange people seem to interest him more than anything in the world but once he has taken a good square look at a person henceforth and for aye that individual ceases to attract him if he ever gives anybody a second look it is one of absolute indifference oh i assure you with the utmost voracity that jones is an odd one he must be agreed lefty ay tank capn said oleson the swede outfielder that yones now bane comin up the street wiley turned and gazed at an approaching figure yes he said thats him turn your binnacle lights on him lefty behold the greatest pitcher adrift in the uncharted regions of baseball chapter vi peculiar behavior jones was rather tall and almost slender although he had a fine pair of shoulders his arm was as long as walter johnsons his face was as grave as that of the sphinx and held more than a touch of the same somber sadness his eyes were dark and keen and penetrating with a single glance they seemed to pierce one through and through and they were ever on the move like little ferrets searching searching searching as he approached the hotel he met a man going in the opposite direction and he half paused to give the man a sharp lancelike stare involuntarily the man drew aside a trifle and walking on turning to look back with an expression of mingled questioning and resentment but jones had resumed his habitual pace his appearance that of a person who already overburdened had received one more disappointment barney oreilley the shortstop laughed sure said he its a bit of a jump old jonesy hands any one he looks at fair and hard lefty locke felt a throb of deep interest and curiosity there was something about the deafmute pitcher of the wind jammers that aroused and fascinated him instantly his first thought was that the man might be mentally unbalanced to a slight degree but though he knew not why something caused him to reject this conviction almost before it was formed apparently jones was well named mysterious theres the bird lefty said capn wiley proudly theres the boy whod make em sit up and take notice if ever he got a show in the big league yours truly the marine marvel knew what he was doing when he plucked that plum in the faraway land of lingering snows a queer sound behind him like a hissing shuddering gasp caused locke to look around quickly the sound had come from weegman who face blanched mouth agape eyes panicstricken was staring at the approaching pitcher amazement doubt disbelief fear he betrayed all these emotions even while he leaned forward to get a better view over the shoulder of a man before him he shrank back crouching like one ready to take to his heels like a person pleased by the sound of his own voice capn wiley rattled on in laudation of his mute pitcher no one save locke seemed to notice weegman and so wholly fascinated by the sight of jones was the latter that he was quite oblivious to the fact that he had attracted any attention smoke wiley was saying why mate when he uses all his speed a ball doesnt last a minute the calorie friction it creates passing through the air burns the cover off ya supplemented shaeffer the catcher und sometimes it sets my mitt afire some speed agreed lefty as jones his head bent reached the foot of the steps he looks tired hes always that way after he tramps around a strange town said the owner of the wind jammers afterward he usually goes to bed and rests and he comes out to the games as full of fire and kinks as a boy who has stuffed himself with green apples ill introduce you locke the southpaw looked round again weegman was gone probably he had vanished into the convenient door of the hotel capn wiley drew lefty forward to meet the voiceless pitcher and perceiving a stranger mysterious jones halted at the top of the steps and stabbed him with a stare full in the face lefty had never looked into such searching penetrating eyes wiley made some deft and rapid movements with his hands and fingers using the deafanddumb language to make jones aware of the identity of the famous big league pitcher already the mute had lapsed into disappointed indifference but he accepted lockes offered hand and smiled in a faint melancholy way hes feeling especially downcast today explained wiley and so hell pitch like a fiend this afternoon he always twirls his best when hes gloomiest appears to entertain the delusion that hes taking acrimonious revenge on the world for handing him some sort of a raw deal it would be a shame to use him against you the whole game lefty hed make your grays look like a lot of infirm prunes spare us pleaded locke in mock apprehension jones did not linger long with his teammates on the veranda with a solemn but friendly bow to lefty he passed on into the hotel wiley explaining that he was on his way to take his regular daily period of rest through the open door the southpaw watched the strange pitcher walk through the office and mount a flight of stairs and from the little writing room locke saw bailey weegman peer forth his eyes following the mysterious one until the latter disappeared then weegman hurried to the desk and interviewed the clerk after which he made an inspection of the names freshly written upon the hotel register the mans behavior was singular and lefty decided that for some reason weegman did not care to encounter jones this suspicion was strengthened when scarcely more than an hour later charles colliers private secretary appeared at the little cottage occupied by locke and his wife and stated that he had made a change from the magnolia hotel to the florida house a secondrate and rather obscure place on the edge of the colored quarter couldnt stand for wiley and his gang of bushwhackers weegman explained they made me sick and i had to get out even though im going to leave town at fivethirty this afternoon thats the first through train north that i can catch thought id let you know so you could find me in case you changed your mind about that offer you might have spared yourself the trouble said locke coldly weegman made a pretense of laughing no telling about that mules are obstinate but even they can be made to change their minds if you build a hot enough fire under them dont forget where you can find me lefty watched him walking away and noted that his manner was somewhat nervous and unnatural i wonder murmured the pitcher why you put yourself to so much discomfort to avoid mysterious jones directed by locke the grays put in an hour of sharp practice that forenoon as lefty had stated the team was practically comprised of winter visitors from the north some of them had come south for their health too three were well along in the thirties and one had passed forty yet for all such handicaps they were an enthusiastic energetic team and they could play the game at least five of them had once been stars on college nines having never lost their love for the game they had rounded into form wonderfully under the coaching of the big league pitcher also in nearly every game they pulled off more or less of the stuff known as inside baseball they had been remarkably successful in defeating the teams they had faced but locke felt sure that in spite of the conglomerate and freakish appearance of the wind jammers it was not going to be an easy thing to take a fall out of capn wileys aggregation of talent the selfstyled marine marvel had a record with players culled from the brambles as he knocked about the country he had in former days put to shame many a strong minor league outfit that had patronizingly and somewhat disdainfully consented to give him an engagement on an off date unless the eccentric and humorously boastful manager of the wind jammers had lost much of his judgment and cunning during the recent years that he had been out of the public eye the fastest independent team would have to keep awake and get a fair share of the breaks in order to trounce him locke warmed up his arm a little but even though he felt scarcely a twinge of the lameness and stiffness that had given him so much apprehension he was cautious at one time when the trouble was the worst he had not been able to lift his left hand to his mouth a massage expert in fernandon had done much for him and he hoped that he had done not a little for himself by perfecting a new style of delivery that did not put so much strain upon his shoulder still until he should be forced to the test he could never feel quite sure that he would be the same puzzle to the finest batsmen that he had once been and it must be confessed that he had looked forward with some dread to the day when that test should come suddenly he resolved that in a way he would meet the test at once doubtless the wind jammers were batters of no mean caliber for wiley had always got together a bunch of sluggers ill do it he decided ill go the limit if i cant do that now after the rest ive had and the doctoring my arm has received theres not one chance in a thousand that ill ever be able to pitch in fast company again chapter vii the test nearly all fernandon turned out to the game many residents of the town as well as a large number of the visitors from the north came in carriages and automobiles the covered reserved seats were filled and shielding themselves from the sun with umbrellas an eager crowd packed the bleachers on the sandy grass ground back of third base a swarm of chattering grinning colored people sat and sprawled holding themselves proudly aloof from the negroes a group of lanky sallow poor whites few of whom could read or write were displaying their ignorance by their remarks about the game and the players the mayor of the town had consented to act as umpire at four oclock he called play now were off sang capn wiley waltzing gayly forth to the coaching position near third heres where we hoist anchor and get away with a fair wind nuccio the oliveskinned italian third baseman selected his bat and trotted to the pan grinning at locke oh you lefty said he we gotta your number put your marlinespike against the pill and crack the coating on it urged wiley george sommers catcher for the grays adjusted his mask crouched signaled locke whipped one over the inside corner and nuccio fouled nicked it cried the marine marvel now bust it on the figurehead and make for the first mooring show our highly steamed friend lefty that hes got to pitch today if he dont want the wind taken out of his sails the southpaw tried to lead nuccio into reaching but the batter caught himself in his swing puta the ball over left he pleaded dont givea me the walk the pitcher smiled and handed up a hopper the batter fouled again lifting the ball on to the top of the covered seats i dont think you need worry about walking said sommers returning after having made a vain start in pursuit of the sphere youre in a hole already nuccio smiled wait he advised i spoil the gooda ones another ball followed then lefty warped one across the comer nuccio drove it into right for a pretty single bringing shouts of approval from the bench of the wind jammers wiley addressed locke really he said i fear me much that you undervalue the batting capacity of my players one and all individually and collectively they are there with the healthy bingle please i beg of you dont let them pound you off the slab in the first inning for that would puncture a hardearned reputation and bring tears of regret to my tender eyes for fear that you may be careless or disdainful i warn you that this next man cant touch anything down around his knees his arms being attached to his shoulders at such a dim and distant altitude he finds it difficult to reach down so far even with the longest bat luther bemis the player referred to was the marvelously tall and lanky center fielder of the wind jammers he had a queer halting walk like a person on stilts and his appearance was so ludicrous that the spectators tittered and laughed outright their amusement did not disturb him for he grinned cheerfully as he squared away waving his long bat dont you pay no tention to the cap n lefty he drawled in a nasal voice i can hit um acrost the knees jest as well as anywhere else hes tryin to fool ye lets see about that said locke putting one over low and close on the inside bemis smashed out a hot grounder and went galloping to first with tremendous groundcovering strides for all of his awkward walk and the fact that he ran like a frightened giraffe it would have required an excellent sprinter to beat him from the plate to the initial sack norris the shortstop got his hand on the ball and stopped it but it twisted out of his fingers it was an error on a hard chance for by the time he secured the sphere there was no prospect of getting either runner now thats what i call misfortune when regarded from one angle and mighty lucky if viewed from another said wiley beamy carries a rabbits foot thats why hes second on our batting disorder he does things like that when theyre least expected the most schaeffer was coaching at first is it lefty locke against us pitching he cried and such an easiness took a lead efrybody and move along when the irisher hits i hate to do ut protested barney oreilley shaking his red head as he walked into position its a pain it gives me lefty but i have to earn me salary no bad feelings ould man you understand just one moment called wiley holding up his hand sympathy impels me i have a tender heart lefty i feel that i must warn you again this descendant of the irish nobility can hit anything that sails over the platter if it were not a distressing fact that schepps who follows is even a more royal batter i would advise you to walk oreilley as it is i am in despair the crowd was not pleased it began to beg locke to fan oreilley and when the irishman missed the first shoot the pleadings increased barney is sympathetic also cried capn wiley but hed better not let his sympathy carry him amain whatever that is i shall fine him if he doesnt hit the ball locke had begun to let himself out in earnest for the situation was threatening it would not be wise needlessly to permit the wind jammers to get the jump they were a confident aggressive team and would fight to the last gasp to hold an advantage the southpaw realized that it would be necessary to do some really highgrade twirling to prevent them from grabbing that advantage in short order tug schepps a toughlooking hardfaced person was swinging two bats and chewing tobacco as he waited to take his turn he was a product of the sand lots land on it barney old top urged tug swat it on der trademark an clean der sacks dis lefty boy dont seem such a much locke shot over a high one going up whooped oreilley ignoring it get em down below the crows nest entreated wiley youre not pitching to bemis now the southpaw quickly tried a drop across the batters shoulders and not expecting that the ball had so much on it barney let it pass he made a mild kick when the mayorumpire called a strike its astigmatism ye have mr mayor he said politely the next one was too close but oreilley fell back and hooked it past third base even though the left fielder had been playing in nuccio might possibly have scored had he not stumbled as he rounded the corner wiley started to grab the fallen runner but remembered the new rule just in time and desisted put about he shouted head back to the last port the italian scrambled back to the sack spluttering he reached it ahead of the throw from the fielder capn wiley pretended to shed tears is it possible he muttered shaking his head that this is the great lefty locke if so it must be true that his star is on the decline alas and alack life is filled with such bitter disappointments whether the regret of wiley was real or pretended it was shared by a large part of the spectators who were friendly to the local team for locke had become very well liked in fernandon both by the citizens of the place and the northern visitors it must not be imagined that with the corners crowded and no one down locke was fully at his ease he had decided to make this game the test of his ability to come back and already it looked as if the first inning would give him his answer if he could not successfully hold in check this heterogeneous collection of bush talent it was easy to understand what would happen to him the next time he essayed to twirl for the blue stockings a sickening sense of foreboding crept over him but his lips wore a smile and he showed no sign of being perturbed schepps was at the plate having discarded one of the bats he had been swinging he grinned like a cheshire cat always tought i could bump a real league pitcher he said put one acrost pal an ill tear der cover off locke hesitated he had been using the new delivery he had acquired to spare his shoulder in previous games it had proved effective enough to enable him to continue four or five innings but now suddenly he whipped the ball to third sending nuccio diving headlong back to the sack the crafty little italian had been creeping off ready to make a flying dash for the plate he was safe by a hair not on your movie film cried capn wiley it cant be done lefty did not hear him he was gazing past the marine marvel at the face of a man who taking care to keep himself unobtrusively in the background was peering at him over the shoulders of a little group of spectators a grinning mocking derisive face it was weegman and weegman knew chapter viii at necessitys demand even after the ball was thrown back from third and lefty had turned away that grinning mocking face continued to leer at him wherever he looked it hovered before his mental vision like a taunting omen of disaster he was all in and weegman knew it the man had told him with sneering bluntness that his old soup bone was on the blink yet entertaining this settled conviction regarding lockes worthlessness as a pitcher weegman had made a long and wearisome journey in order that he might be absolutely sure by putting the deal through in person of signing the southpaw for the blue stockings at an increased salary the very fact that he had been offered the position of manager under conditions that would make him a mere puppet without any real managerial authority gave the proposition a blacker and more sinister look sommers was signaling lefty shook his head to rid himself of that hateful chimera misunderstanding the catcher quickly changed the sign the pitcher delivered the ball called for first and it went through sommers like a fine shot through an open sieve nuccio scored from third with ease bemis and oreilley advancing at the same time the wind jammers roared from the bench capn wiley threw up his hands furl every stitch cried the manager of the visitors batten the hatches the storm is upon us its going to be a ripsizzler im afraid the wreck will be a total loss covering the plate lefty took the ball from sommers how did you happen to cross me asked the catcher it was my fault was the prompt acknowledgment but it wont happen again i hope not said sommers he wanted to suggest that locke should retire at once and let matthews take up the pitching but he refrained the southpaw was doing some serious thinking as he walked back to the mound however well his newly acquired delivery had seemed to serve him on other occasions he was convinced that it would not do now either he must pitch in his own natural way and do his best or he must retire and let dade matthews try to check the overconfident aggressors if he retired he would prolong the uncertainty in his own mind he would leave himself in doubt as to whether or not there was any prospect of his return to the big league as a twirler worthy of his hire more than doubt he realized he would be crushed by a conviction that he was really down and out ive pampered my arm long enough he decided im going to find out if theres anything left in it perhaps the decision was unwise the result of the game with the wind jammers was of no importance but locke felt that for his own peace of mind he must know what stuff was left in him and there was no one present with authority no coach no counselor to restrain him there was a strange new gleam in his eyes when he once more toed the slab his faint smile had not vanished but it had taken lines of grimness schepps tapped the plate with his bat come on pal he begged dont blow up gimme one of der real kind an lemme have a swat at it the crowd was silent even the chattering darkies had ceased their noise only the wind jammers jubilated on the bench and the coaching lines poising himself locke caught sommers signal and nodded then he swung his arm with the old free supple whiplash motion and the ball that left his fingers cut the air like a streak of white taking a really remarkable hop schepps swat was wasted now dats like it cried the sandlotter whereve you been keepin dat kind old boy gimme a duplicate lefty watched bemis the longlegged ground coverer working away toward the plate and drove him back but he seemed to have forgotten oreilley and the irishman was taking a lead on which he should have little trouble in scoring if schepps drove out a safety farther and farther he crept up toward third sommers tugged at his mask with an odd little motion like a flash the southpaw whirled about and shot the ball to second knowing some one would be there to take the throw mel gates was the man who covered the bag and oreilley found himself caught between second and third gates went after him and the irishman ran toward third but locke had cut in on the line and he took a throw from gates that caused oreilley to turn back abruptly behind gates norris was covering the cushion tremain came down a little from third to back lefty up colby had raced from first base to the plate in order to support sommers for bemis was swiftly creeping down to make a dash on the coaching line capn wiley did a wild dance the spectators were thrilled by the sudden excitement of the moment lefty ran oreilley back toward second and he knew bemis was letting himself out in an attempt to score swinging instantly locke made a rifleaccurate throw to sommers who jammed the ball on to the longgeared runner as he was sliding for the plate the affair had been so skillfully managed that not only was oreilley prevented from advancing but also the attempt to sneak a tally while the irishman was being run down had resulted disastrously for the wind jammers dats der only way dey can get us out said schepps dis lefty person looks to me like a lemon capn wiley was philosophically cheerful just a little lull in the tornado he said its due to strike again in a minute lefty looked the confident schepps over and then he gave him a queer drop that deceived him even worse than the swift hopper the spectators who had been worried a short time before now expressed their approval and when a minute later the southpaw whiffed the sandlotter there was a sudden burst of handclapping and explosions of boisterous laughter from the delighted darkies whwhos dat man said lemon cried one dat lefty pusson sho handed him one dat time is it possible said capn wiley that im going to be compelled to revise my dates regarding that wreck then he roared at the swede get into the game oleson its your watch on deck and you want to come alive the wrong ships being scuttled aye aye captain responded oleson mebbe ay do somethin when ay get on the yob yust keep your eye on me believing himself a hitter superior to the men who had touched locke up so successfully at the beginning of the game he strode confidently forth for all of the failure of schepps sizing up the swede lefty tested him with a curve but oleson betrayed no disposition to reach a drop followed and the batter fouled it his style of swinging led the southpaw to fancy that he had a preference for drops and therefore locke wound the next one round his neck puncturing his weakness not only did oleson miss but he swung in a manner that made it doubtful if he would drive the ball out of the infield if he happened to hit one of that kind hit it where you missed it implored wiley dont let him bamboozle you with the chin wipers then he turned on oreilley cast off that mooring break your anchor loose and get under way man the halyards and crack on every stitch youve got to make port when ole stings the horsehide in spite of himself lefty was compelled to laugh outright at the marine marvels coaching contortions calm yourself capn he advised the hurricane is over how can i calm myself when calamity threatens was the wild retort you are a base deceiver lefty such chicanery is shameful i dont know what chicanery means but it seems to fit the offense and now the spectators fell to laughing at the swarthy little man who did not seem to be so very offensive after all and who was injecting more than a touch of vaudeville comedy into the game oleson waited patiently still determined to hit although somewhat dismayed by his two failures to gauge the lefthanders slants but when lefty suddenly gave him another exactly like the last he slashed at it awkwardly and fruitlessly the crowd broke into a cheer and the swede turned dazedly from the plate wiping beads of perspiration from his brow that lefty he bane some pitcher admitted oleson he got a good yump ball chapter ix torturing doubt to a degree locke had satisfied himself that he still had command of his speed and carves but the experience had also taught him that his efforts to acquire a new delivery as effective as his former style of pitching and one that would put less strain upon his shoulder had been a sheer waste of time working against batters who were dangerous his artificial delivery had not enabled him to pitch the ball that would hold them in check he had mowed them down however when he had resorted to his natural form but what would that do to his shoulder could he pitch like that and go the full distance with no fear of disastrous results should he attempt it even should he succeed perhaps the morrow would find him with his salary wing as weak and lame and lifeless as it had been after that last heartbreaking game in the big league involuntarily as he left the mound he looked around for weegman who had disappeared it gave lefty some satisfaction to feel that for the time being at least he had wiped the mocking grin from the schemers face capn wiley jogged down from third an expression of injured reproof puckering his countenance i am pained to the apple core he said my simple trusting nature has received a severe shock just when i thought we had you meandering away from here lefty you turned right round and came back if you handed us that one lone tally to chirk us along let me reassure you that you made the mistake of your young life i am going to ascend the hillock and do some volleying which makes it extensively probable that the run we have garnered will be sufficient to settle the game dont be so unfeeling responded locke give us mysterious jones oh perchance you may be able to get on the sacks with me pushing em over but if jones unlimbered his artillery on you hed mow you down as fast as you toddled up to the pentagon you see i wish the assemblage to witness some slight semblance of a game in action upon the slab wiley aroused still further merriment his windup before delivering the ball was most bewildering his writhing squirming twists would have made a circus contortionist gasp first he seemed to tie himself into knots pressing the ball into the pit of his stomach like a person in excruciating anguish on the swing back he turned completely away from the batter facing second base for a moment at the same time poising himself on his right foot and pointing his left foot toward the zenith then he came forward and around as if he would put the sphere over with the speed of a cannon ball and handed up a little slow bender but he need not have troubled himself to put a curve on that first one for fred hallett leading off for the grays stood quite still and stared like a person hypnotized the ball floated over and the umpire called a strike which led hallett to shake himself and join in the laughter of the crowd whats the matter whats the matter spluttered wiley was my speed too much for you couldnt you see it when it came across shall i pitch you a slow one hallett shook his head unable to reply oh vurry vurry well said the marine marvel as you choose i dont want to be too hard on you then after going through with a startling variation of the former convulsions he did pitch a ball that was so speedy that the batsman swung too slowly and a few minutes later completing the performance to his own satisfaction he struck hallett out with a neat little drop i preen myself said he that im still there with the huckleberries as a pitcher of class ive got matty and a few others backed up against the ropes bring on your next victim charlie watson found the burlesque so amusing that he laughed all the way from the bench to the plate the eccentric pitcher looked at him sympathetically when you get through shedding tears he said ill pitch to you i hate to see a strong man weep then without the slightest warning using no windup whatever he snapped one straight over catching watson unprepared that sobered watson down considerably im glad to see you feeling better declared the manager of the wind jammers now that youre quite prepared ill give you something easy the slow one that he tossed up seemed to hang in the air with the stitches showing watson hit it and popped a little fly into wileys hands the latter not being compelled to move out of his tracks he removed his cap and bowed his thanks doc tremain walked out seriously enough apparently not at all amused by the horseplay that was taking place with his hands on his hips wiley stared hard at tremain heres a jolly soul cried the pitcher hes simply laughing himself sick i love to see a man enjoy himself so diabolically oh play ball the doctor retorted tartly this crowd isnt here to see monkeyshines then they wont look at you my happy friend and thats a dart of subtle repartee wileys remarkable windup and delivery did not seem to bother tremain who viciously smashed the first ball pitched to him it was a savage line drive slightly to the left of the slabman but the latter shot out his gloved hand with the swiftness of a striking rattlesnake and grabbed the whistling sphere having made the catch the marine marvel tossed the ball carelessly to the ground and sauntered toward the bench with an air of bored lassitude there was a ripple of applause you got off easy that time capn said locke coming out when are you going to let us have a crack at jones a crack at him retorted wiley dont make me titter lefty your assemblage of wouldbes never could get anything remotely related to a crack off jones however when ongwee begins to creep over me ill let him go in and polish you off colonel rickey leading off for the wind jammers in the second hoisted an infield fly and expressed his annoyance in a choice southern drawl as he went back to the bench peter plum the fat right fielder followed poling out an infield drive which to the amazement of the crowd he nearly turned into a safety by the most surprising dash to first impossible though it seemed the chunky shortlegged fellow could run like a deer and when he was cut down by little more than a yard at the hassock he vehemently protested that it was robbery locke was taking it easy now he almost seemed to invite a situation that would again put his arm to the test there was a queer feeling in his shoulder a feeling he did not like and he wondered if he could tighten in repeated pinches as he had so frequently done when facing the best batters in the business but though he grooved one to schaeffer the catcher boosted an easy fly to watson in left field wiley went through the second inning unharmed although with two down colby landed on the horsehide for two sacks coming next gates bit at a slow one and lifted a foul to the third baseman now give me my faithful bludgeon cried the marine marvel making for the bats watch me start something im going to lacerate the feelings of this man lefty i hate to do it but i hear the clarion call of duty locke decided to strike wiley out wiley picked out a smoking shoot and banged it on a line for one sack nice tidy little bingle wasnt it mate he cried i fancied mayhap dame rumor had slandered you but alas i fear me you are easy for a real batter with an eye nuccio was up again and he also hit safely wiley going to third on the drive lockes teeth clicked together was it possible that real batters could find him with such ease if so the big league would see him no more he would not return to it if so his days as a pitcher were surely ended for a moment bailey weegmans grinning face again rose vaguely before him i must know he muttered i must settle these infernal doubts that are torturing me chapter x the only door luther bemis blundered he had been given the signal to let nuccio steal but he hit at the ball and raised a foul to colby who stepped back upon first and completed a double play unassisted the italian having made a break for second nuccio was disgusted and capn wiley made a few remarks to bemis that caused the lengthy center fielder to retire to the bench in confusion there has been a sudden addition to the bone crop concluded the vexed manager of the wind jammers beamy in order to avoid getting your dates mixed you should carry a telescope and take an occasional survey of the earths surface niver mind capn called oreilley ill put ye across whin i hit with a twinge of apprehension locke sought to trick the confident irishman into biting at a curve and even as he pitched he was annoyed with himself because apprehension prevented him from bending the ball over oreilley stubbornly declined to bite there was a sudden chorus of warning shouts as sommers returned the ball and the pitcher was surprised to see capn wiley running for the registry station the foxy old veteran was actually trying to steal home on the big league pitcher laughing lefty waited for the ball aware that sommers was leaping into position to nail the runner without undue haste yet without wasting a second the slabman snapped the sphere back to the eager hands of the catcher who poked it into the sliding mans ribs wiley was out by four feet at least why didnt you wait for oreilley to hit locke asked i wanted to spare your already tattered nerves was the instant answer you see sympathy may be found elsewhere than in the dictionary still floundering in the bog of doubt lefty was far from satisfied he had told himself that he invited the test which would give him the answer he sought yet he realized that face to face with it he had felt a shrinking a qualm akin to actual dread and he was angry with himself because he drew a breath of relief when the blundering and reckless playing of the wind jammers postponed the ordeal leaving him still groping in the dark sommers led off with a hot grounder which oreilley booted playing the game locke bunted advancing sommers and perishing himself at first cleverly done admitted capn wiley but it will avail you naught i shall now proceed to decorate the pill with the oil of elusion a friend called to lefty in the crowd back of first and the pitcher walked back to exchange a few words with him he was turning away when a hand fell on his arm and he looked round to find weegman there the mans face wore a supercilious and knowing smile i didnt mean to attend this game said weegman but having the time i decided to watch part of it as it would give me a good chance to settle a certain point definitely in my mind what ive seen has been quite enough your arm is gone locke and you know it youre laboring like a longshoreman against this bunch of bushers and working hard as you are you couldnt hold them only for their dub playing i admit that you struck out some of their weakest stickers but you were forced to the limit to do it and it made that injured wing of yours wilt they had you going in the last round and threw away their chance by bonehead playing weegman said locke im tired of hearing you talk the sound of your voice makes me weary but instead of being disturbed the man chuckled the truth frequently is unpleasant he returned and you know i am speaking the raw truth now i like you locke ive always liked you and i hate to see you go down and out for good thats what it means if you dont accept my offer as manager of the blue stockings you can hold your job this season if you dont pitch a ball itll enable you to stay in the business in a new capacity and youll not be dependent on your arm a pitchers arm may fail him any time as a manager you may last indefinitely it would be a crime if the sort of a manager you want lasted a month if you dont come at my terms you may kiss yourself goodby the feds are going to learn that your flinger is gone be sure of that thats a threat a warning if their crazy offer has tempted you put the temptation aside that offer will be withdrawn every manager and magnate in the business is going to know that as a pitcher you have checked in theres only one door for you to return by and im holding it open he laughed and placed his hand again ingratiatingly upon lockes arm locke shook it off instantly were i as big a rascal as you weegman he said with limitless contempt id make a dash through that door thank heaven im not the baffled man snapped his fingers you are using language youll regret he harshly declared although he maintained his smiling demeanor to such a degree that any one a few yards distant might have fancied the conversation between the two was of the pleasantest sort lefty returned to the coaching line taking the place of tremain for wiley had issued a pass to hallett watson was at bat and the doctor followed watson instantly sizing up the situation the southpaw signaled for a double steal and both runners started with the first movement of the pitchers delivery schaeffers throw to third was not good and sommers slid under hallett had no trouble about reaching second what are you trying to pull off here cried the manager of the wind jammers such behavior is most inconsiderate or words to that effect however it simply makes it necessary for me to inject a few more kinks into the horsehide admittedly he did hand up some peculiar curves to watson but his control was so poor that none of the twisters came over and like hallett the left fielder walked this peopled the corners here said wiley still chipper and undisturbed is that jolly soul who obligingly batted an easy one into my fin the last time i passed the last hitter in order to get at this kind party again tremain let one pitch go by but the next one pleased him and he cracked the ball on the nose it was a twobase drive which enabled the runners already on to score as the three raced over the plate one after another wiley was seen violently wigwagging toward the bench in response to his signal mysterious jones rose promptly and prepared to warm up with the second catcher im off today perhaps i should say im awful admitted the marine marvel a spazoozum like that is sufficient to open my eyes to the humiliating fact that im not pitching up to class in a few minutes however youll have an opportunity to see mr jones uncork some of the real stuff wiley dallied with the next batter for the purpose of giving the dummy pitcher time to shake the kinks out of his arm apparently jones did not need much time in which to get ready for when the sailor presently dealt out another pass the relief twirler signified his willingness to assume the burden as jones walked out upon the diamond locke looked around vainly for weegman it was possible of course that colliers private secretary had departed at once following his last rebuff but somehow lefty felt that he was still lingering and taking pains not to be seen by mysterious jones suddenly the southpaw felt a desire to bring the two men face to face wondering what would happen there was more than a possibility that such a meeting might present some dramatic features turning back leftys eyes followed jones the interest and fascination he had felt at first sight of the man returned taking hold upon him powerfully and intensely there was something in the solemn face of the mute that spoke of shattered hopes deep and abiding sorrow despair tragedy he was like one who stood aloof even while he mingled with mankind knowing other mutes many of whom seemed happy and contented locke could not believe that the peculiarities of mysterious jones were wholly due to resentment against the affliction which fate had placed upon him behind it all there must lay a story with perhaps more than one dark page chapter xi burning speed as a pitcher jones displayed no needless flourishes his style of delivery was simple but effective into the swing of his long arm he put the throwing force of his fine shoulder and sinewy body wiley had exaggerated in boasting of the mutes speed nevertheless that speed was something to marvel at norris the cleanup man of the grays who preferred smokers to any other kind was too slow in striking at the first two pitched to him by jones norris looked astounded and incredulous and the spectators gasped thats his slow one mates cried wiley pretty soon when he gets loosened up hell let out a link or two and burn a few across the daisies are growing above the only man he ever hit with the ball although norris was not slow in swinging at the next one the sphere took a shoot that deceived him and the mute had disposed of the first hitter with three pitched balls and the wiseacres say there are no real heavers left in the bushes whooped capn wiley locke was thrilled could it be that here was a discovery a find a treasure like a diamond in the rough left around underfoot amid pebbles the big league scouts are the grubstakers the prospectors the treasure hunters of baseball ceaselessly and tirelessly they scour the country even to the remote corners and outoftheway regions where the game nourishes in the crude lured on constantly by the hope of making a big find to them the unearthing of a ball player of real ability and promise is like striking the outcroppings of a comstock or a kimberly and among the cheering surface leads that they discover a hundred peter out into worthlessness where one develops into a property of value more and more the scouts complain that the ground has been raked over again and again and the prizes are growing fewer and farther between yet every now and then where least expected one of them will turn up something rich that has been overlooked by journeying too far afield the fancy that mysterious jones might be one of these unnoticed nuggets set lockes pulses throbbing jones had appeared to be a trifle slender in street clothes but now lefty could see that he was the possessor of fine muscles and whipcord sinews there was no ounce of unnecessary flesh upon him anywhere he was like an athlete trained to the minute and hardened for an enduring test by long and continuous work there seemed little likelihood that protracted strain would expose a flaw he had speed and stamina if he possessed the required skill and brains there was every reason to think that he might deliver the goods with the advent of the silent man upon the mound lockes attention became divided between doubts about himself and interest in the performance of the mute hampton who followed norris was quite as helpless against the dazzling speed of jones he could not even foul the ball great smoke locke he exclaimed pausing on his way to center field that mans a terror he seems to groove them all but you cant see them come over perhaps he cant keep it up said lefty i hope not if he does weve got to win on the runs weve made already therell be no more scoring for us its up to you to hold them down the southpaw held them in the fourth but he did so by working his head fully as much as his arm by this time he had learned something of the hitting weaknesses of the wind jammers and he played upon those weaknesses successfully to his teammates and the spectators the performance was satisfactory to him it proved only that his brain if not his arm was still in perfect condition mysterious jones came back with two strikeouts in fact he struck sommers the third man out also but the whistling shooting sphere went through the catcher and sommers raced to first on the error this brought locke up and he was eager to hit against jones he missed the first one cleanly but fouled the next two which was better than any one else had done then the silent man put something more on the ball and lefty failed to touch it nice little pitcher dont you think inquired capn wiley blandly he behaves well very well admitted the southpaw the grays implored locke to keep the enemy in hand the crowd entreated him this was the game they desired to win to them it was a struggle of vital importance and the winning or losing of it was the only question of moment they did not dream of something a thousand times more momentous involving lefty locke loyal to the team and its supporters the southpaw could not take needless chances of losing no matter how much he longed to be put upon his mettle and forced to the last notch therefore he continued to work his head while on the slab schaeffer fouled out jones fanned indifferently and nuccio popped to shortstop lucky boy called wiley but things wont always break so well for you youll have to go your limit before the game is over i hope so said lefty hallett caught one of jones whistlers on the end of his bat and drove it straight into the hands of the first baseman hooray laughed watson at least that shows that he can be hit a blind man might hit one in a million if he kept his bat swinging scoffed wiley lets see you do as much watson could not do as much he fanned three times then jones pitched four balls to tremain and the doctor placed himself in watsons class the game had become a pitchers battle with one twirler cutting the batters down with burning speed and shoots while the other held them in check through the knowledge he had swiftly acquired regarding their shortcomings with the stick in every way the performance of jones was the most spectacular and in the crowd scores of persons were beginning to tell one another that the mute was the greater pitcher the truth was experience in fast company had taught lefty locke to conserve his energies like mathewson he believed that the eight players who supported him should shoulder a share of the defensive work and it was not his practice to put everything on the ball with the cushions clean only when pinches came did he tighten and burn them across nor was he in that class of pitchers who are continually getting themselves into holes by warping them wide to lure batters into reaching for he had found that a twirler who followed such a method would be forced to go the limit by cool and heady batters who made a practice of waiting it out having that prime requisite of all firstclass moundmen splendid control he sought out an opponents weakest spot and kept the ball there compelling the man to strike at the kind from which he was least likely to secure effective drives this had led a large number of the fans who fancied themselves wise to hold fast to their oftenexpressed belief that the southpaw was lucky but they were always looking for the opposition to fall on him and hammer him all over the lot therefore it was not strange that the crowd assembled to watch the game in fernandon should soon come to regard the mute with his blinding speed and jagged shoots as the superior slabman apparently without striving for effect jones was a spectacular performer mechanical skill and superabundant energy were his to the limit but locke knew that something more was needed for a man to make good in the big league nevertheless with such a foundation to build upon unless the fellow should be flawed by some overshadowing natural weakness that made him impossible coaching training and experience were the rungs of the ladder by which he might mount close to the top loyal to the core lefty was thinking of the pitching staff of the blue stockings weakened by deflections to the federals possibly by his own inability to return for a little time even weegman was forgotten anyway the southpaw had not yet come to regard it as a settled thing that bailey weegman would be permitted to undermine and destroy the great organization if such was his culpable design in some manner the scoundrel would be blocked and baffled the sixth inning saw no break in the run of the game between the grays and the wind jammers bemis oreilley and schepps all hit locke but none hit safely while jones slaughtered three of the locals by the strikeout method as wiley had stated was the silent mans custom he seemed to be seeking revenge on the world for giving him a raw deal when oleson began the seventh with a weak grounder and got a life through an error lefty actually felt a throb of satisfaction for it seemed that the test might be forced upon him at last but the swede attempted to steal on the first pitch to rickey and sommers threw him out rickey then lifted a high fly just back of first base and colby put him out of his misery plum batted an easy one to second theres only one thing for me to do thought locke ive got to work the strikeout stuff in the next two innings just as if men were on bases and see if ive got it the game will be over if i wait any longer for a real pinch when jones had polished off gates and sommers locke stepped out to face the mute the second time having watched the man and analyzed his performance the southpaw felt that he should be able to obtain a hit if i cant lay the club against that ball he told himself then that fellows putting something on it beside speed and curves hes using brains also capn wiley jumped up from the bench and did a sailors hornpipe this is the life he cried the real thing against the real thing take soundings lefty youre running on shoals youll be high and dry in a minute straight and silent jones stood and looked at the big league player both hands holding the ball hidden before him wiley ceased his dancing and shouting and a hush settled on the crowd to locke it seemed that the eyes of the voiceless pitcher were plumbing the depths of his mind and searching out his hidden thoughts there came to lefty a ridiculous fancy that by some telepathic method the man on the slab could fathom his purposes and so make ready to defeat them an uncanny feeling crept upon him and he was annoyed jones pitched and the batsman missed a marvelous drop which he had not been expecting perhaps ill have to revise my theory about him not using brains was the southpaws mental admission the next two pitches were both a trifle wide and lefty declined to bite at either for the first time as if he knew that here was a test jones appeared to be trying to work the batter locke fouled the following one thats all there is to it declared wiley and im excruciatingly surprised that there should be even that much go way back mr locke again jones surveyed lefty with his piercing eyes and for the third time he pitched a shoot that was not quite across as if he had known it would not be over the batsman made not even the slightest move to swing some guessing match confessed the marine marvel now however let me give you my plighted word of dishonor that youre going to behold a specimen of the superfluous speed jonesy keeps on tap for special occasions hold your breath and see if you can see it go by the ball did not go by lefty hit it fairly and sent a safety humming to right chapter xii too much temptation is it possibill gasped capn wiley staggering and clutching at his forehead i am menaced by a swoon water whisky ill accept anything to revive me fred hallett hurried to the pan with his bat its my turn now he said weve started on him and we should all hit him locke signalled that he would steal and hallett let the first one pass lefty went down the line like a streak but schaeffer made a throw that forced him to hit the dirt and make a hook slide he caught his spikes in the bag and gave his ankle a twist that sent a pain shooting up his leg safe declared the umpire locke did not get up the crowd saw him drag himself to the bag and sit on it rubbing his ankle schepps bent over him solicitously dat was a nice little crack pal said the sandlotter and a nifty steal hope youse aint hoited but lefty had sprained his ankle so seriously that he required assistance to walk from the field a runner was put in his place although wiley informed them that they need not take the trouble and wiley was right for jones struck hallett out it was impossible for locke to continue pitching so matthews took his place and the southpaw was left still uncertain and doubtful the game had not provided the test he courted weegman apparently had departed there was no question in the mind of charles colliers representative and angered by the rebuff he had encountered he was pretty certain to spread the report that the great southpaw was all in he had practically threatened to do this when he declared that every manager and magnate in the business would soon know that lockes pitching days were over the wind jammers spurred on by capn wiley went after matthews aggressively and for a time it appeared certain that they were going to worry him off his feet with only one down they pushed a runner across in the eighth and there were two men on the sacks when a double play blighted their prospect of tying up perhaps of taking the lead at once as jones continued invulnerable in the last of the eighth the visitors made their final assault upon matthews in the ninth but fortune was against them the game ended with wiley greatly disappointed though still cheerful a little frost crept into my elbow in the faraway regions of the north he admitted ill shake it out in time if id started old jonesy against lefty there would have been a different tale to tell the wind jammers were booked to play in jacksonville the following afternoon but they remained in fernandon overnight seated on the veranda of the magnolia wiley was enjoying a cigar after the evening meal and romancing as usual when locke appeared limping with the aid of a cane it grieves me to behold your sorry plight said the marine marvel sympathetically i cajole with you most deprecatingly but why if you were going to get hurt at all werent you obliging enough to do it somewhat earlier in the pastime that would have given my faithful henchmen a chance to put the game away on ice you cant be sure about that returned lefty you collected no more scores off matthews than you did off me but you passed us six nice ripe goose eggs while he dealt out only one there was a difference that could be distinguished with the unclothed optic nevertheless it seems to me that jones had something on you while he officiated you were the only person who did any gamboling on the cushions and what you did didnt infect the result what do you think of jones will you lend me your ear while i express my opinion privately with the utmost perspicacity said wiley rising within my boudoir excuse my fluid french ill uncork either ear you prefer and let you pour it full to overflowing in the privacy of wileys room without beating around the bush locke stated that he believed jones promising material for the big league and that he wished to size up the man while i have no scouting commission or authority said lefty if kennedy should manage the blue stockings this season hed stand by my judgment the team must have pitchers of course some will be bought in the regular manner but i know that on my advice kennedy would take jones on and give him a show to make good just as he gave me a chance when i was a busher i did not climb up by way of the minors i made one clean jump from the back pastures into the big league mate said wiley let me tell you something a trifle bazaar jones hasnt the remotest ambition in the world to become a baseball pitcher locke stared at him incredulously the swarthy little man was serious at least as serious as he could be then asked the southpaw why is he pitching tell me ive done a little prognosticating over that question you say he does not talk about himself how do you let me elucidate if i can i told you i ran across jones in alaska i saw him pitch in a baseball match in nome how he came to ingratiate himself into that contest i am unable to state nobody seemed able to tell me all i found out about him was that he was one of three partners who had a valuable property somewhere up in the jade mountain region not a prospect but a real bonyfido mine already they had received offers for the property and any day they could sell out for a sum salubrious enough to make them all scandalously wealthy they had entered into some sort of an agreement that bound them all to hold on until two of the three should vote to sell jones was tied up under this contraction i had grown weary of the vain search for the root of all evil for me that root has always been more slippery than a squirming eel every time i thought i had it by the tail it would wriggle out of my eager clutch and get away i longed for the fleshpots of my own native heath watching that ball game in nome my blood churned in my veins until it nearly turned to butter once more in my wellfertilized fancy i saw myself towering the country with my wind jammers and could i secure jonesy for my star flinger i knew i would be able to make my return engagement a scintillating and scandalous success with him for a nucleus i felt confident that i could assemble together a bunch of world beaters i resolved to go after jones i went without dalliance i got him corralled in a private room and locked the door on him mate i am a plain and simple soul given not a jot or tittle to exaggeration yet i am ready to affirm i never swear its profane that i had the tussle of my life with jones parenthetically speaking we wrestled all over that room for about five solid hours i had supplied myself with forty reams of writing paper a bushel basket full of lead pencils and two dictionaries when i finally subdued jones i was using a stub of the last pencil in the basket was on the concluding sheet of paper had contracted writers cramp and the dictionaries were mere torn and tattered wrecks in the course of that argument i am certain i wrote every word in the english language besides coining a few thousand of my own i had practically exhausted every form of persuasion and was on the verge of lying down and taking the count then by the rarest chance i hit upon the right thing i wrote a paregoric upon the joys of traveling around over the united states from city to city from town to town of visiting every place of importance in the whole broad land of meeting practically every living human being in the country who was alive and deserved to be met somehow that got him i dont know why but it did i saw his eyes gleam and his somber face change as he read that last wild stab of mine it struck home he agreed to go i had conquered now mark ye well the amount of his salary had not a whit to do with it and he entertained absolutely no ambish to become a baseball pitcher he was compelled to leave his partners up there running the mine and to rely upon their honesty to give him a square deal you have been told how he promulgates around over every new place he visits and stares strangers out of countenance whether or not hes otherwise wrong in his garret hes certainly off on that stunt thats how im able to keep him on the parole of this club of mine in short hes a sort of monomaniac perhaps thats it lefty did a bit of thinking youve been touring the smaller cities and the towns in which an independent ball team would be most likely to draw in the large cities of a big league circuit there are thousands upon thousands of persons jones has never met he could work a whole season in such a circuit and continue to see hosts of strangers every time he visited any one of the cities included under such circumstances he would have the same incentive that he has now if he can be induced to make the change ill take a chance on him and ill see that you are well paid to use your persuasive powers to lead him to accept my proposition but you stated that you had no legal authority to make such a deal i havent but i am willing to take a chance with the understanding that the matter is to be kept quiet until i shall be able to put through an arrangement that will make it impossible for any manager in organized ball to steal him away wiley shook his head i couldnt get along without him lefty hes the mainsheet of the wind jammers it would be like chucking the sextant and the compass overboard wed be adrift without any instrument to give us our position or anything to lay a course by if you dont sell him to me some manager is going to take him from you without handing you as much as a lonesome dollar in return you cant dodge the big league scouts its a wonder youve dodged them as long as you have theyre bound to spot jones and gobble him up do you prefer to sell him or to have him snatched what will you give for him now youre talking business if i can put through the deal im figuring on ill give you five hundred dollars which considering the conditions is more than a generous price five hundred dollars is there that much money to be found in one lump anywhere in the world i own some blue stockings stock so you see i have a financial as well as a sentimental interest in the club im going to fight hard to prevent it from being wrecked as long as it can stay in the first division it will continue to be a moneymaker but already the impression has become current that the team is riddled and the stock has slumped there are evil forces at work i dont know the exact purpose these forces are aiming at but im a pretty good guesser the property is mighty valuable for some people to get hold of if they can get it cheap enough theyre even saying that youre extremely to the bad what do you think about it yourself lefty locke flushed time will answer that you look like a fighter said wiley i wish you luck but what do you say to my proposition give me a flat answer five hundred dollars murmured the marine marvel licking his lips im wabbling on the top rail of the fence fall one way or the other heaving a sigh the sailor rose to his feet and gave his trousers a hitch lets interview jones he proposed chapter xiii the perplexing question the following morning lefty locke received two letters one was from the federal league headquarters in chicago urging him to accept the offer of the manager who had made such a tempting proposal to him the position it stated was still his for the taking and he was pressed to wire agreement to the terms proposed the other letter was from lockes father a clergyman residing in a small new jersey town the contents proved disturbing the reverend mr hazeltons savings of a lifetime had been invested in a building and loan association and the association had failed disastrously practically everything the clergyman possessed in the world would be swept away it seemed likely that he would lose his home leftys face grew pale and grim as he read this letter he went directly to his wife and told her janet was distressed what can be done she cried you must do something lefty your father and mother at their age turned out of their home it is terrible what can you do locke considered a moment if i had not invested the savings of my baseball career in blue stockings stock he said regretfully id have enough now to save their home for them but cant you sell the stock yes for half what i paid for it perhaps that wouldnt he enough youre right in saying i must do something but what can i he stopped staring at the other letter he sat down still staring at it and janet came and put her arm about him heres something he exclaimed suddenly what dear this letter from federal league headquarters urging me to grab the offer the feds have made me twentyseven thousand dollars for three years a certified check for the first years salary and a thousand dollars bonus that means that i can get ten thousand right in my hand by signing a federal contract more than enough to save my folks janets face beamed and she clapped her hands i had forgotten about their offer why youre all right its just the thing i wonder she looked at him and grew sober oh you dont want to go to the federals youre afraid they wont last it isnt that no no girl if there was nothing else to restrain me id take the next train for chicago and put my fist to a fed contract just as soon as i could i need ten thousand dollars now and need it more than i ever before needed money janet ran her fingers through his hair bending forward to scan his serious and perplexed face she could see that he was fighting a battle silently grimly she longed to aid him in solving the problem by which he was confronted but realizing that she could not quite put herself in his place and that therefore her advice might not come from the height of wisdom and experience she held herself in check should he ask counsel of her she would give the best she could i know she said after a little period of silence that you must think of your financial interest in the blue stockings im not spending a moments thought on that now im thinking of old jack kennedy and charles collier of bailey weegman and his treachery for i believe he is treacherous to the core im thinking also of something else i dont like to think about tell me she urged he looked up at her and smiled wryly then he felt of his left shoulder its this he said she caught her breath but you said you were going to give your arm the real test yesterday the grays won and the score was three to one when you hurt your ankle and were forced to quit i thought you were satisfied i very much doubt if the grays would have won had not capn wiley insisted upon pitching the opening innings for his team the man who followed him did not permit us to score at all i was the only one who got a safe hit off him the test was not satisfactory janet her face grew white it was not like lefty to lack confidence in himself during the past months although his injured arm had seemed to improve with disheartening slowness he had insisted that it would come round all right before the season opened yet lately he had not appeared quite so optimistic and now after the game which was to settle his doubts he seemed more doubtful than before she believed that he was holding something back that he was losing heart but as long as there was any hope remaining he would try not to burden her with his worries suddenly she clutched his shoulders with her slender hands its all wrong she cried youve given up the best that was in you for the blue stockings youve done the work of two pitchers they wont let you go now even if your arm is bad at the beginning of the season theyll keep you on and give you a chance to get it back into condition old jack kennedy would but i have my doubts about any other manager you dont mean that theyd let you go outright just drop you oh its possible theyd try to sell me or trade me if they could work me off on to some one who wasnt wise probably theyd do it thats not reckoning on weegman hes so sore and vindictive that he may spread the report that ive pitched my wing off i fancy he wouldnt care a rap if that did lose collier the selling price that could be got for me oh i just hate to hear you talk about being traded or sold it doesnt sound as if you were a human being and this a free country cattle are traded and sold cattle and ball players its wrong isnt there any way the federals are showing the way your sympathys with them youre not bound to the blue stockings youre still your own free agent under the circumstances what would you have me do at last he had asked her advice now she could speak she did so eagerly accept the offer the federals have made you my dear he said would you have me do that with my own mind in doubt as to whether or not i was worth a dollar to them would you have me take the ten thousand i could get knowing all the time that they might be paying it for a hasbeen who wasnt worth ten cents would that be honest you can be honest then she hurriedly declared no one knows for a certainty not even yourself that you cant come back to your old form you can go to the manager and tell him the truth about yourself cant you do that and then what probably he wouldnt want me after that at any price you can make a fair bargain with him you can have it put in the contract that you are to get that money if you do come back and make good as a pitcher lefty laughed i think it would be the first time on record that a ball player ever went to a manager who was eager to sign him up and made such a proposition it would be honest janet but if the manager believed me if he saw i was serious do you fancy hed feel like coming across with the first years salary in advance and the bonus you see i cant raise the money i need and be honest she wrung her hands and came back to the first question that had leaped from her lips what can you do i dont think ill make any decisive move until i find out what sort of queer business is going on in the blue stockings camp i could get money through kennedy if he were coming back everything is up in the air how can you find out away down here youre too far away from the places where things are doing ive been looking for a telegram from old jack an answer to mine i feel confident ill get a wire from him as soon as he reads my letter meanwhile ill write to my parents and try to cheer them up its bound to take a little time to settle up the affairs of that building and loan association time is what i need now that very day locke received a telegram from jack kennedy meet me at the grand indianapolis the twentythird dont fail a train carried lefty north that night chapter xiv only one way the registry clerk stated that no mr kennedy was stopping at the grand hotel locke was disappointed for he had expected old jack would be waiting for him however the veteran manager would doubtless appear later lefty registered and the clerk tossed a room key to the boy who was waiting with the southpaws traveling bag as the pitcher turned from the desk he found himself face to face with a man whom he had seen on the train the man locke believed had come aboard at louisville there was something familiar about the appearance of the stranger yet lefty had not been able to place him he had narrow hips a rather small waist fine chest development and splendid shoulders his neck was broad and swelling at the base his head with the hair clipped close was round as a bullet his nose had been broken and there was an ugly scar upon his right cheek he did not look to be at all fat and yet he must have weighed close to one hundred and ninety his hands clenched would have resembled miniature batteringrams this person had not taken a look at the register yet he addressed the pitcher by name how are you locke he said with a grin that was half a sneer half a menace i guessed youd bring up here lefty knew mit skullen the moment he spoke onetime prize fighter and ball player skullen now posed as a scout employed by the rockets more often he acted as the henchman and bodyguard of tom garrity owner of the team and the besthated man in the business garrity had so many enemies that he could not keep track of them a dozen men had tried to get him at different times and twice he had been assaulted and beaten up skullen had saved him from injury on other occasions garrity was the most sinister figure in organized baseball once a newspaper reporter he had somehow obtained control of the rockets by chicanery and fraud sympathy and gratitude were sentiments unknown to him he would work a winning pitcher to death and then send the man shooting down to the minors the moment he showed the slightest symptom of weakness he scoffed at regulations and bylaws he defied restraint and control he was in a constant wrangle with other owners and managers and as a creator of discord and dissension he held the belt and he snapped his fingers in the face of the national commission the league longed to get rid of him but could not seem to find any method of doing so been lookin em over a little down south explained skullen superfluously not much doin this season but i spotted one pitcher with a rovin bunch o freaks who had more smoke and kinks than you ever showed before you broke your arm old boy and he wont cost a cent when we get ready to grab him nobodys wise to him but me either spose youve come on to meet weegman hey whered you run across this find asked locke casually endeavoring not to appear curious skullen pulled down one corner of his mouth and winked tink ill tell youse old boy but then texas is a big bunch o the map texas the wind jammers had come to florida from galveston did you have a talk with this unknown wizard questioned lefty he didnt talk much returned the scout oh you cant pump me i know your old blue stocks aint got a pitcher left thats worth a hoot in halifax or hardly a player for that matter but i aint goin to help you out you an weegman you gotter get together an do your own diggin weegman is in indianapolis as if you didnt know never had no use for that guy but all the same i advise you to grab on with him its your only chanct for a baseball job everybody in the games wise that youll never do no more hurlin boiling inwardly locke permitted himself to be conducted to the elevator while he was bathing he thought with increasing wrath and dismay of the insolent words of skullen the question that perplexed him most was how the bruiser knew anything of weegmans business especially the attempt to sign locke as a manager and weegman was in indianapolis coming down lefty went again to the desk to inquire about kennedy he was handed a telegram tearing it open he saw that it was from the federal manager who had offered him a three years contract it stated curtly that the offer was withdrawn skullen was right the story had gone forth that the star southpaw of the blue stockings would do no more pitching weegman was getting in his fine work lefty felt a hand grip his elbow locke a welldressed youngish man grasped his hand and shook it it was franklin parlmee who for a long time had evinced deep interest in virginia collier parlmee with family behind him and a moderate income had shown a distaste for business and a disposition to live the life of an idler collier had refused to countenance his daughters marriage to parlmee until the latter should get into some worthy and remunerative employment and make good for two years parlmee had been hustling and he had developed into a really successful automobile salesman by jove said parlmee i didnt expect to run across you here old man im mighty glad to see you perhaps you can tell me something about virginia what has mrs hazelton heard from her the man seemed worried and nervous and his question surprised lefty if any one should know about miss collier you are the person returned the pitcher janet has scarcely heard from her since she sailed with her father we supposed you were corresponding with her regularly parlmee drew him toward a leathercovered settee im pegged out he admitted and he looked it business forced me to run on or id not be here now im going back to new york tonight do you know ive received only two letters from virginia since she reached the other side one from london the other from eaux chaudes in france the latter was posted more than a month ago it stated that virginia and her father were leaving eaux chaudes for italy since then no letters have come from her do you mean to say you havent an idea where miss collier and her father are at the present time parlmee lighted a cigarette his hands were not steady i havent an idea where charles collier is as for virginia she cabled me that she was sailing on the victoria which reached new york four days ago i was at the pier to meet her but she didnt arrive and her name was not on the passenger list lefty uttered an exclamation that was strange the other man turned on the settee to face him the whole thing has been queer i had practically overcome mr colliers prejudice and won his entire approval then he broke down his health went to the bad and his manner toward me seemed to change i had an idea he went abroad more to take virginia away than for any other reason anyway i knew there was something wrong and the two letters i got from her added to that conviction her father was trying to get her to break with me there was another man whom he preferred another yes bailey weegman locke gave a great start as if he had received an electric thrust weegman he cried guardedly that scoundrel collier is crazy parlmee now youve said something i believe the mans mind is affected business reverses may have done it do you know that he left his baseball interests practically in the control of weegman no but it doesnt surprise me in some way that scoundrel has got a hold on him weegman has tried hard to undermine me with virginia ive always disliked him and his detestable laugh who is he anyway where did he come from and what are his antecedents youll have to ask somebody else its virginia im worrying about now said parlmee tossing aside his halfsmoked cigarette but if she was contemplating sailing for the united states with her father her cablegram to me didnt mention her father i got the impression that she was sailing alone alone great scott and she didnt sail where is she what happened to her do you wonder im rattled ive made arrangements so that i can have a month if necessary to dig into this business if that isnt enough ill take all the time needed its the deuce to pay locke as sure as youre a foot high in more ways than one agreed lefty i could tell you some other things but youve got enough to worry about we must arrange to keep in touch with each other i presume ill go back to fernandon when i get through here heres my new york address said parlmee handing over his card and rising five minutes after they separated old jack kennedy arrived dusty and weary from his railroad journey his shoulders were a trifle stooped and he looked older by years but his keen eyes lighted with a twinkle as he grasped lockes hand i knew youd beat me to it lefty he said wouldnt have called on you to make the jaunt but i had to chin with you face to face lets talk first and feed our faces afterward the veteran registered and they took the elevator carrying kennedys traveling bag a boy conducted them a bar boy bearing a tray that was decorated with drinks was knocking on a door within the room somebody called for him to enter and he did so as locke was passing at old jacks heels by chance lefty obtained a glimpse of the interior of that room before the door closed behind the boy two men smoking cigars were sitting at opposite sides of a table on which were empty glasses they were mit skullen and bailey weegman left together in kennedys room locke told the old manager what he had seen and immediately kennedys face was twisted into a wrathful pucker youre sure dead sure replied locke well it sorter confirms a little suspicion thats been creepin inter my noddle the blue stockings are up against somethin moren the feds and the feds have chewed the team to pieces within the last three days theyve nailed temple dayly and hyland theres only the remnants of a ball club left locke was aghast gene temple too he cried the boy i found i thought he would stick money gets the best of em why shouldnt it when them lads ought to have been tied up before this with blue stockings contracts the bars have been left down for the feds and theyve raided the preserves seems just like theyve been invited to come in and help themselves why not with a team without a manager and everything left at loose ends never heard of such criminal folly but mebbe it aint folly mebbe its plain cadougery ive had an idea there was somethin crooked behind it but couldnt just quite nose it out now with weegman and mit skullen gettin together private i see a light garritys the man you know how he got his dirty paws on the rockets well if he aint workin to gobble the blue stockings ill eat my hat ill bet that right now tom garritys gathered in all the loose stock of the club that he could buy and hes countin on havin enough to give him control before the season opens he saw his chance with the feds reachin for every decent player they could lay their hands on and he went for it what if the blue stockings do have a busted team this season in three years the club might be built up again and its a sure moneymaker just as long as it can keep in the first division lynchin is what a crook like garrity deserves kennedys eyes were flashing and he was literally quivering with wrath despite the fact that he was tired he strode up and down the room weegman must be garritys tool the creature who is helping him do the dirty work said locke youve got his number how he came to pick you for a mark i dont know unless it was because he thought you let me work you to death havin no mind of your own he knew he couldnt put anythin over with me and so he decided to get rid of me but he had to have somebody for a manager who would appear to be all right hes got to be blocked theres only one way how youll have to accept and sign a contract to manage the team lefty gasped but he said i cant do that you im out he wouldnt have me even if id do the work for no salary but i cant agree to weegmans terms i couldnt do anything of my own accord i couldnt sign a player unless he agreed he made that plain but he wouldnt dare put anything like that in the contract it would be too barefaced the minute you have the authority you can get to work savin the remnants of the team by signin up the players the feds havent grabbed already i have a line on a few good youngsters who went back to the minors last year because there wasnt room for them put proof of weegmans treachery before collier and weegmans done for its the one play thats got to be made in this here pinch there was a knock on the door come in called kennedy bailey weegman entered smiling chapter xv signing the manager weegman came in boldly his manner was ingratiating yet somewhat insolent and he chuckled as he saw the look of surprise on the face of lefty locke well well he said here we are this is first rate now we can get together and do things to the southpaws increasing astonishment kennedy stepped forward quickly seized weegmans hand and shook it cordially and heartily i wired for locke said the old manager i felt sure i could talk sense into his head didnt like to see him make a fool of himself and let a great opportunity slip through his fingers just because of a false notion about loyalty to me but i didnt expect you before tomorrow lefty was a trifle bewildered kennedy had known weegman was coming to indianapolis in fact had arranged to meet him there colliers representative beamed on locke sorry i couldnt wait to see the finish of that game in fernandon he said but i saw enough to satisfy me you did well to beat the wind jammers with that bunch of half invalids behind you and your own arm all to the bad still wiley sort of handed you the game the score was three to two reminded lefty the wind jammers couldnt hit they were a lot of freaks a burlesque baseball team weegman turned again to old jack if you can talk some sense into locke youll succeed where i failed i wasted time money and breath on him gave him up then let me tell you a joke he began to laugh and the southpaw writhed inwardly who do you think wants to manage the blue stockings you cant guess well its skullen yes mit skullen actually came after the job got me cornered and gave me a great game of talk trying to convince me that he could fill the bill i was listening to his spiel when i caught a glimpse of you two passing the door of my room called the desk and asked the number of your room then i shook old mit and came around the idea of mit skullen managing a big league club isnt that funny his whole body shook with merriment as he spoke kennedy seemed to be amused also and joined in weegmans laughter wonder what tom garrity would say to that skullen must have forgotten his old nemesis john barleycorn it was john that put him down and out as a prize fighter and a ball player he says he hasnt looked at the stuff for four months you should have heard him trying to convince me that he had the makings of a great manager lefty knew weegman was lying regarding the nature of the private consultation that had been held in a nearby room but kennedy seemed to be unaware of this you wouldnt take skullen under any conditions would you asked old jack i wouldnt have him if he was ready to pay to manage the team collier would lift my scalp if i fell for anything like that but ive got a line on a good man if if he faltered and looked at locke smiling well settle that right here declared kennedy with a growl lockes the lad i havent had time to talk to him much but i was telling him before you came in that hed have to accept as for me a class aa team aint so worse youre dead sure i can hook up with st paul i wired you about the proposition from byers he wants you but he wasnt going to try to cut in on us did you send him word not yet decided to have my talk with lefty first ive always liked you kennedy said weegman youve been a great man in your day youre a good man now but it needs younger blood especially in this fight against the feds confound them about so often a team needs to change managers especially when it begins to slip the blue stockings began to slip last year and the feds have given us a push lockes young and hes got the energy to build the team up working together we can put it on its feet again hell have the very best counsel and advice hes a favorite with the fans and hell be tolerated where you would be blamed hell come through and win out of that i am certain the feds will blow before the seasons over and the woods will be full of firstclass players begging for jobs next season should see the stockings stronger than ever and the man whos managing the teams bound to be popular hell get a lot of credit lefty had taken a chair he opened his lips to speak but stopped when he caught a warning sign from old jack behind weegmans shoulder is that contract ready for the boy asked kennedy ive got it in my pocket then nail him right now push it at him and well make him sign dont let him get away weegman produced the document then for a moment he seemed to hesitate flashing old jack a look and giving locke a hard stare you understand the conditions he said addressing the latter yes answered lefty you made them plain enough for a child to understand when you talked to me in fernandon course he understands cut in kennedy he told me and i told him to grab on without makin no further talk just as you say weegman with proper advice he can swing the thing it looks pretty big to him and hes doubtful let him look at that paper he took it from weegmans hand and looked it over himself it was practically the same sort of an agreement old jack had signed himself when he took control of the team and the name of charles collier properly witnessed had already been affixed to it with the contract in his possession along with colliers power of attorney weegman could sign up any one he chose to manage the blue stockings for a fleeting instant kennedys face was twisted into an expression of rage which however colliers private secretary did not catch locke saw that flash of anger and understood old jack was playing the fox and losing no time about it skullen will do for the other witness said weegman going to the room telephone hell feel bad of course but i told him he didnt have a show in the world he called the operator and gave the number of a room while weegman was engaged kennedy handed the agreement over to locke you sign it just as it is he directed youve had your talk with mr weegman and you know what he said to you you dont have to chin it over any more by this time weegman had got skullen on the phone and asked him to come round to kennedys room giving him the number locke sat grimly reading the contract until skullen knocked at the door maybe youll feel bad mit said weegman admitting the man but you know i told you there wasnt a show in the world of me signing you up as manager its settled with locke and i want you to witness him put his autograph to the paper now dont make a growl but do as youre wanted skullen kept still as directed but he looked as if weegmans first words had surprised him a trifle kennedy had produced a fountain pen and thrust it into lockes hand sign right here son he urged lets see how pretty you write wait cried weegman his eyes on the southpaw who had promptly moved up to the little table you havent forgotten our talk you understand i havent forgotten a thing asserted lefty boldly and swiftly writing his name there it is chapter xvi the wrong stool pigeon skullen and kennedy attached their names as witnesses the thing was done lefty locke philip hazelton was the name he wrote on the contract was now manager of the blue stockings he received a duplicate copy which he folded and slipped into his pocket now were all set for business said bailey weegman i congratulate you locke one time i was afraid you didnt have sense enough to welcome opportunity when she knocked ill see you later mit if youre around weve got to square away now and have a little conference dont cry because you didnt get the job cry nothin said skullen i wouldnt have taken it if youd handed it to me with twice the salary old mits disappointed chuckled weegman when the door closed behind him but he doesnt want anybody to know it hell deny he came looking for the position of course kennedy had seated himself and weegman drew a chair up to the table producing a packet of papers and running them over until he found the one he wanted heres a list of the men the feds have grabbed off us he said grist orth temple nelson hyland and lewis grist is no particular loss but temple and orth knock a hole in the pitching staff nelson was our reliance behind the bat with dayly and lewis gone the whole side of the infield is wide open we ought to be able to fill hylands place in right garden its a swell team thats left said locke and you told me that dillon was negotiating with the outlaws he hasnt jumped he hasnt had the nerve sneered weegman snapping his fingers instead hes been howling for a contract youd find him waiting if you didnt sign him until the first of april for just a flicker he had actually seemed to betray annoyance because pink dillon had not followed the example of the deserters but he ended with a laugh it seems to me said the new manager that id better get busy and try to save the pieces the men who havent jumped should be signed up without delay of course agreed weegman blandly you must send out the contracts unluckily i havent any blanks with me but ill see that you are furnished with them tomorrow every day counts perhaps every hour by tomorrow we may lose another good man or more not much danger and you dont want to make the mistake of getting into a panic and trying to do things in too much of a hurry weve been farming some clever youngsters more than enough to make up a team but you should consult with kennedy about them and take only the right ones youll have the most trouble getting hold of pitchers youngsters said locke are all right but do you mean to suggest that we should stop the gaps wholly with men who lack big league experience you know how much show that sort of a team would have in the race weve got to make some deals that will give us some players who have ripened itll cost money too right there said weegman is where youre going to need the checkrein charles collier wont stand for needless extravagance in that line i know and i shall not countenance the purchasing of highpriced men the blood rose into leftys face he tingled to tell the rascal something but again a warning flicker of kennedys left eye restrained him there are lots of good youngsters coming on said the veteran soothingly there were three or four i could have used last season if id had room for them well run over the list and see how theyll fit in for another hour they continued in conclave and a dozen times weegman took occasion to impress upon locke that he should do nothing definite without receiving weegmans approval when he seemed to feel that he had driven this into the new managers head he excused himself on the pretext of attending to a pressing matter and departed leaving old jack and lefty together kennedy quietly locked the door lefty jumped to his feet and began pacing the floor like a caged tiger never had such a job to keep my hands off a man he raged only for you id i know said old jack returning and sitting down heavily i wanted to kick him myself and i think i shall do it some day soon hes crooked as a corkscrew and rotten as a last years early apple but he aint shrewd he only thinks he is hes fooled himself you never agreed to his verbal terms and just as i said he didnt dare put them in writing according to that contract youve got as much power as i ever had and you can exercise it its up to you to get busy dont wait for contract forms from weegman theyll be delayed i have plenty wire the old players who are left that contracts will be mailed to them tonight locke stopped by kennedys chair and dropped a hand on the old mans shoulder and youre going to st paul he said youve been handed a wretched deal nix on the st paul business son theres nothing to it that wolf thought i swallowed that guff byers is garritys friend and its plain now that garritys mixed up in this dirty business it was easy enough to ask if id consider hooking up with st paul by the time i got round to saying yes byers could tell me it was off this time lefty im out of the game for good his voice sounded heavy and dull and his shoulders sagged the southpaw was silent words failing him after a few minutes old jack looked up into the face of his youthful companion and smiled wryly youve got a little glimpse of what goes on behind the scenes in baseball he said the fans that pay their money to see the games look on it generally as a fine clean sport which in one way it is that part the public pays to see the game is on the level theres a good reason the crookedest magnate in the business and believe me theres one who can look down the back of his own neck without trying to turn round knows it would spell ruin to put over a frameup on the open field by nature the players themselves are like the average run of human critters honest and dishonest but experience has taught them that they cant pull off any double deals without cutting their own throats people who talk about fixed games especially in the worlds series show up their ignorance it cant be done but when it comes to tricks and holdups and highway robberies and assassination theres always somethin doing off stage what youve seen is only a patch the men who run things are out for the coin and they arent any better as a rule than the high financiers who plunder railroads and loot public treasuries theyll smile in a mans face while theyre whetting the knife for his back some of them have put the knife into charles collier now and they intend to sink it to the hilt youve been picked as a catspaw to help them pull their chestnuts off the coals they intend to fatten their batting average at your expense and when its all over youll be knocked out of the box for good youll get the blame while they pluck the plums kennedy said locke his voice hard as chilled steel theyve picked the wrong stool pigeon my eyes arent sewed up with your help im going to find a way to spoil their villainous schemes i know youll help me the veteran sprang up a bit of the oldtime fire in his face you bet your life son thats why i wired for you to come on and thats why i wanted you to pretend to take the hook and sign up with weegman i knew we could work together and it puts us in position to get the harpoon into them before they wise up to whats doing lets get busy chapter xvii getting into action locke was for open work and defiance of weegman but kennedy argued against it you want to get the jump on that snake said the old man digging a package of contract forms for players out of his traveling bag he wont be looking for you to get into action so sudden and youll gain a lap before he knows it when it comes to fighting a polecat a wise man takes precautions weegmans gone to send word to his pals of the slick job hes put over and hell be coming back to bother us pretty soon we dont want to be here when he comes so for the purpose of conducting their private business another room was engaged and an arrangement made whereby no person no matter how insistent he might be should be told where to find them then a telegraph messenger boy was summoned to that room and telegrams were sent to the still loyal blue stockings players stating that contracts were being mailed for their signatures then the contracts were filled out sealed and dropped into the mail chute a square meal was ordered and served in the private room and for nearly three hours lefty and jack talked they had many things to tell each other but their principal topic was the filling of the frightful gaps made in the team by the federal raids and both agreed that the time had come when the closefisted financial policy of the blue stockings must be abandoned players fully as good as the ones lost or better if possible must be obtained at any cost various team combinations that seemed to balance to a nicety were made up on paper but how to get the men coveted was the problem weve got two catchers left said kennedy but the best of the pair aint in the same class as the man weve lost weve got to have a backstop as good as nelson and when it comes to pitchers say son is it possible there aint any show at all of your coming back i wish i could answer that confessed locke at any rate weve got to have two more firststring men if this mysterious jones i told you of is anywhere near as good as he looked to not one chance in a hundred that hes good enough to carry a regular share of the pitching the first season no matter what he might develop into with experience the wolves have been hurt least by the feds and you might pick something worth while off ben frazer if you paid his price last fall he offered to trade me that youngster keeper for dayly and since then hes bought red callahan from brennan thatll put keeper on the bench you know what keeper is and ive always regretted letting frazer get him off me for five thousand but it was colliers idea the boyd look well on our third cushion about now but dont lose sight of the fact that its pitchers weve got to have locke took the fivefifty train for new york leaving weegman whom he had succeeded in avoiding frothing around the grand in search of him kennedy knew how to reach frazer by wire and he had received a reply to his telegram that the manager of the wolves would meet lefty at the great eastern the following night between kennedy and frazer there had always existed a bond of understanding and friendship despite the burden he had assumed the new manager of the blue stockings slept well it was this faculty of getting sleep and recuperation under any circumstances that had enabled him to become known as the iron man at breakfast the following morning he received a slight shock three tables in front of him with his back turned sat a man with fine shoulders a bull neck and a bullet head mit skullen was traveling eastward by the same train lefty cut his breakfast short and left the diner without having been observed if he should see me hed probably take the first opportunity to wire back to weegman thought locke and im going to follow old jacks advice about leaving weegman in the dark for a while there was a possibility of course that skullen would come wandering through the train and discover him but to his satisfaction nothing of the kind happened all the long forenoon he was whirled through a snowcovered country without being annoyed by the appearance of garritys henchman and he had plenty of time to meditate on the situation and the plans laid by himself and kennedy but it was necessary to eat again and shortly before albany was reached he returned to the diner hoping skullen had already had lunch the man was not there when he sat down but he had scarcely given his order when the fellows hand dropped on his shoulder hully smokes exclaimed mit staring down wideeyed at the southpaw whats this mean i can hardly believe me lamps you must have left indianap same time i did and weeg asked me twice if id seen anything of you weegman said lefty startled but outwardly serene is he on this train nix last i know he was tearing up the grand looking for you hows it happened you skipped without dropping him word im going to see my folks who live in jersey locke answered truthfully enough but youll stop in the big town tonight where do you hang out usually at the prince arthur this was likewise true although the southpaw had now no intention of putting up there on this occasion mit looked at his watch we must be pulling into albany he said i want to get a paper see you later go ahead and shoot your telegram to weegman thought locke any message sent me at the prince arthur is liable to remain unopened for some time he had finished his lunch and was back in the pullman when skullen found him again the man planted himself at leftys side and passed over a newspaper grinning as he pointed out an item on the sporting page even though it was rumored that old jack kennedy was to be let out the selection of locke as his successor is a surprise as a pitcher locke has had an amazingly successful career and has made an enviable reputation but he has had no managerial experience having come to the big league directly from the bushes whether or not he has the stuff of which capable managers are made is a matter of uncertainty but with the blue stockings badly chewed to pieces by the feds collier might have been expected had he decided to drop kennedy to replace the veteran with a man of some practical knowledge in that line the policy of the stockings for the last year or two has been rather queer to say the least and the effect upon the team can be seen in its present rating that was the final paragraph collier sick and absent in europe was credited with the deal not a word about weegman the rascal pulling the wires was keeping himself in the background for a moment lefty thought of jack stillman a reporter friend and felt a desire to give him some inside information which in cold type would be pretty certain to make the interested public sit up and take notice but the time was not ripe for a move like that and he dismissed the thought still grinning skullen jammed his elbow into lockes ribs how do you like that he inquired gloatingly thats the way them cheap newspaper ginks pans you out when they get a chance the southpaw was suddenly attacked by an intense distaste for the company of tom garritys coarse hireling he handed the paper back in silence but the feeling of dislike and antagonism was evidently felt by skullen for after a few minutes silence he got up and walked out of the car and to his satisfaction lefty saw no more of him during the remainder of the journey an uncomfortable storm of rain and sleet was raging when new york was reached shortly after nightfall a taxi bore locke to the great eastern where he learned that frazer had not yet arrived having registered he took the elevator for his room on the seventh floor and as he was borne upward a descending car well filled with people slipped silently past and lefty caught a momentary glimpse of their faces through the iron grillwork one face he saw quite plainly that of a charming young woman in her early twenties a face he recognized at once virginia collier gasped lefty in astonishment he did not leave the car back to the main floor he went after hastily looking around for the young woman he sought he made inquiries at the desk he was informed that no miss collier was stopping in the hotel still confident that he had not been mistaken and thinking it probable she was dining there with friends he had her paged even when the report came that no one answered to the name he did not give up from various vantage points he spent at least twenty minutes looking over the people at dinner in the main dining room the grill and the palm room at the end of that time he was confident that charles colliers daughter was not dining at the great eastern of course he admitted to himself its possible i was mistaken but i would have sworn it was virginia he went up to his room and prepared for dinner burdened by the conviction that he had been baffled that fate had played him a trick he would have given much for fifteen minutes conversation with the daughter of the big chief and he was impressed with the belief that he had passed her almost within an arms reach this feeling was followed by one of uncertainty regarding frazer old jack had assured him that the manager of the wolves would meet him at the great eastern and he had relied on kennedy without attempting to get into direct communication with frazer and perhaps after all he would not come then ill have to run him down considered lefty and i want to get to him before weegman can get to me if i dont hell be sure to try to ball up any deal i attempt to put across choosing to eat in the grill he notified the desk where he could be found should any one ask for him but he had scarcely begun on the first course when he heard his name spoken and looked up to find ben frazer smiling down upon him chapter xviii the first deal just in time to get in on the eats i see said the manager of the famous wolves shaking hands with locke its a rotten night my feet are wet and im awfully hungry only for kennedys message id be on my way to chicago a waiter placed a chair and he sat down took the menu card and quickly gave his order he was a short thickset shrewdfaced man his hair was turning gray on the temples but he seemed to have lost little of the nervous energy and alertness that had been his in the old days when he had been called the swiftest second sacker in the business he had been an umpire baiter then but in later years his methods had changed and never once since becoming a manager had he been given the gate nevertheless while he had gained in diplomacy he had relaxed no whit in aggressiveness led by old ben the wolves fought to the last ditch now tell me about it he requested turning to lefty how in thunder did you happen to let them rope you into such a mess you mean getting tied up as manager of the blue stockings boy youre the goat youve been chosen for the sacrifice somebody had to fall of course but its a shame that you should be the victim id thought you too wise to tumble into that trap then you think it is a trap asked the southpaw feeling the blood hot in his cheeks of course it is the stockings have been undermined and blown wide open theyve got as much show this year as a snowball would have in a bakers oven theyll land in the subcellar with a sickening thud and theres no way of stopping them no way no way under heaven take it from me ive been in the business long enough to know what im talking about it takes years to build up such a fighting machine and when its torn to pieces rebuilding is bound to be another job of years the public wont understand youll get the kicks and the curses as a successful pitcher youve been a favorite as an unsuccessful manager youll be about as popular as a rusty spike in an automobile tire crowds are always fickle when a mans winning they howl their heads off for him but let him strike a losing streak and they scramble like mad to pelt him with mud and brickbats but somebody has to build up a team somebody has to start it and get the blame hes the goat wheres burkett who managed the wolves before i came in out in the border league wheres ashton and gerrish who struggled with the blue stockings before kennedy stepped in on the turn of the tide ones running a cigar store in kewanee the others drinking himself to death in muskegon both left the game with busted reputations and broken hearts wheres mcconnell who tried to make a ball team of the hornets before brennans day he took to the coke and his friends are paying for his keep in a private bughouse wheres decker who had a crack at the panthers but whats the use theres no surer way for a good man to ruin his career than to manage a losing ball team in that case said locke ive got to manage a winner frazer gazed at him pityingly swell chance youve got about one in fifty thousand you havent got the makings of an ordinary seconddivision team left i know the feds have copped off some of our best men but some some i should so remark but dont blame it all on the feds they were practically invited to come in and take their pick the bars were let down all your players knew there was trouble they heard all sorts of rumors that made them nervous and uncertain they didnt see any contracts coming their way to be signed they knew there was something the matter with collier it was even said hed gone crazy they knew kennedy was going to get out from under there was gossip about old men being shunted and new blood taken on what they didnt know was where they were at it was all nicely worked to get them to take the running long jump then you believe there was a plot to smash the team you dont have to be a mind reader to get my opinion but im saying this here private man to man im not goin round talking for publication but youre wrong about kennedy getting out he was dropped was he sure frazer twisted his face into a queer grimace old jack kennedy was too wise to stick on under any such conditions he knew what it meant and ill guarantee that he wouldnt have managed the blue stockings this year for twice the salary he got last what ive got against him is that he didnt put you wise before you tied up it was on his advice that i consented to manage the team replied locke what exclaimed frazer is that straight he advised you to the infernal old scoundrel locke warmed immediately in defense of kennedy the manager of the wolves listened uncertain shaking his head doubtfully he may not have meant it he admitted presently but hes got you in bad boy you havent got a show against the powers youll have to buck and the conditions that were fixed up for you in advance as to that time will tell said lefty im going to make one almighty try first ive got to plug the gaps what have you got to sell that i want nothing that youll pay the price for i know colliers policy collier is in europe and im manager of the team with full authority to make any deals i please heres my contract he placed it before old ben collier will have to stand for any trade i put through ill buy smoke jordan off you you wont i wont sell him then how about jack keeper youve got red callahan and i need a third baseman frazer finished his soup i wont sell you keeper he said but ill trade him i need a center fielder in the place of courtney whos retired ill trade keeper for herman brock at first locke had no relish for a trade that would add to the blue stockings infield at the expense of the outfield even though in his secret heart he knew brock had during last season shown vague symptoms of slowing down then he remembered the list of reserves given him by kennedy on which there was one fast hardhitting youngster who had been sent back to the western canada league and had made a brilliant record covering the middle garden for medicine hat i dont want to trade i want to buy he persisted then as if struck by second thought ill tell you what i will do ill give you brock for two men thatll help we need a catcher after king broke his leg you found a great catcher in darrow ill trade you brock for keeper and king brick king exploded frazer indignantly what do you take me for a business man youve got three firststring catchers now two are all you need you dont even know that kings leg is all right im willing to take a chance on him brock batted over three hundred last season hes the hitter you need to fill that vacancy not brick king said the manager of the wolves if i didnt use him behind the bat for the whole season hes a fancy pinch hitter youve gotter have pitchers how about obrien but locke knew that chick obrien the veteran had cracked already even though on hot days when he could get his wing to work he showed flashes of his former brilliant form and had under such conditions last year pitched three shutout games for the wolves chicks record for the season showed a balance on the wrong side the southpaw held out for king frazer offered one of the secondstring catchers lefty waved the offer aside hang it snapped frazer give me brock and ten thousand dollars and you may have keeper and king you dont want much laughed locke ill give you brock and five thousand all the way through to the dessert they dickered and bargained frazer wanted brock and wanted him bad sympathetic though he might feel toward lefty he never permitted sympathy to interfere with business brock was the man to fill the position left vacant by bob courtney and he was sure the wolves would not be weakened by the loss of keeper but brick king what salary are you paying king lefty suddenly asked five thousand the feds got after him and i had to make it that the southpaw laughed with darrow doing most of the backstopping and larson ready to fill in any moment hes needed youre going to keep a fivethousanddollar catcher on the bench for a pinch hitter i just called you a business man but i feel like taking it back isnt madden likely to kick over a fivethousanddollar pinch hitter madden owned the team madden be hanged rasped frazer biting off the end of a cigar he had taken from his case im the manager madden isnt always butting in and paring down expenses like collier he pulled vigorously at the cigar while the attentive waiter applied a lighted match lefty had declined a cigar he smoked occasionally and would have done so now but to do so would indicate an inclination to settle down and continue the dickering and he had decided to make a bluff at bringing the affair to an end he called for the check and insisted on paying the bill for both sorry ive put you to so much trouble frazer he said it was kennedys idea that i might do business with you but its evident he was mistaken ive got some other cards to play and time is precious he settled the bill and tipped the waiter old ben sat regarding locke thoughtfully rolling out great puffs of smoke the younger man was about to rise hold on requested the manager of the wolves youre a regular mule arent you how do you expect to make a trade without compromising at all you wont even meet me halfway confound you you ill own up that i was a bit hasty said lefty showing a nervous desire to get away i made that fivethousand offer without thinking much but you understand im rather desperate if collier were here hed probably put the kibosh on it if he found out before the trade was closed after that hed have to stand for it no matter how hard he kicked lets forget it then frazer showed that peculiar trait of human nature that makes a person doubly eager for something that seems to be on the point of slipping away in his mind he had already fitted herman brock into that gap in center field that had given him more or less worry the adjustment had pleased him it seemed to balance the team to a hair it would give him renewed assurance of another pennant and a slice of the worlds series money it was courtneys hitting in the last series that had enabled the wolves to divide the big end of that money and like courtney brock was a terror with the ash you mule said frazer lets go up to your room and fix up the papers its a trade chapter xix a fleeting glimpse locke betrayed no sign of the triumph that he felt had frazer held out he would have given the ten thousand asked and considered himself lucky to get a catcher and a third sacker both young men and coming in exchange for an outfielder who could not possibly last more than another season or two collier might squirm when he learned of the trade but perhaps he could be made to see the desperate necessity of it the thought that bailey weegman would gnash his teeth and froth at the mouth gave lefty an added thrill of pleasure the first move to circumvent weegman and the scheming scoundrel behind him garrity had been put through all right he said with something like a sigh if you hold me to my word i suppose its a trade we may as well make out the papers whats that about a trade asked a voice at the southpaws back what are you two ginks cooking up i saw you chinnin and thought there was something in the wind skullen had entered the grill and come up without being observed there was nothing thinskinned about mit and apparently he had forgotten the rebuff given him by locke on the train hello mit said frazer youre just in time to be a witness ive traded king and keeper for herm brock were going up to make out the papers now come on locke rose his eyes on the intruder repressing a laugh as he noted the mans expression of incredulity traded exclaimed skullen with locke say whos backing locke in this deal weeg told me when i talked with him about being manager that any trade that was made would have to be confirmed by him has he agreed to this deal he dont have to said lefty theres nothing in my contract that gives him any authority to interfere with any deal i may choose to make mit followed them from the room and to the elevator he was bursting to say more but he did not know just how to say it when they were in lockes room he began keeper and king for that old skate brock whats the matter with you ben youve got bats in your belfry why youve gone clean off your nut youve frazer cut him short thatll be about enough from you mit dont try to tell me my business im getting five thousand bones in the bargain hey shouted skullen turning on the young manager of the blue stockings five thousand bucks youre coughing up that sum without consulting anybody say youre going in clean over your head youd better hold up and wire weegman what youre thinking about if you dont when i want your advice ill ask for it interrupted locke sharply you seem to be greatly interested in this business for an outsider skullen was choked off but he gurgled and growled while the papers were being filled out he even seemed disposed to refuse to sign as a witness but finally did so muttering theres going to be the devil to pay over this you can bet your sweet life on that lefty didnt care it was settled and neither collier nor his representative could repudiate the bargain let the crooks rage the only thing the southpaw regretted was that weegman would doubtless quickly learn what had been done for it was a practical certainty that skullen would lose little time in wiring to him in fact mit soon made an excuse to take his departure and in fancy locke saw him making haste to send the message frazer was wise also youre going to find yourself bucking a rotten combination locke he said theyre bound to put it over you before youre through i should worry and lose my sleep was the light retort give me a cigar now ben i havent felt so much like smoking in a month locke slept that night in peace in the infield there were two big holes left to be filled short and second but the reserve list afforded a dozen men to pick from and it was leftys theory that a certain number of carefully chosen youngsters mixed in with veterans who could steady them frequently added the needed fire and dash to a team that was beginning to slow down herman brock was gone but out in medicine hat jock sheridan had covered the middle garden like a carpet and had batted four hundred and ten some hitting with welch and hyland on his right and left sheridan might compel the big league fans to give him something more than a casual once over but lockes great pleasure lay in the fact that he had secured a backstop he had not dared to hope for even now he could not understand why frazer had been induced to part with brick king the catcher whose almost uncanny skill in getting the very limit out of secondrate and faltering pitchers had lifted the wolves out of the second division two years ago and made them pennant contenders up to the final game of the season there was the possibility of course that old ben believed that king had not thoroughly recovered from the injury that had sent him to the hospital last august but a broken leg was something that rarely put an athlete down and out indefinitely in my estimation thought lefty serenely as sleep was stealing over him king has got more brains and uses them better than any backstop in the league the morning papers had something to say about the deal the new manager of the blue stockings has been getting busy by good authority we are informed that he has traded center fielder herman brock for two of ben frazers youngsters king and keeper through this deal he has obtained a catcher and a third baseman but has opened up a hole in the outfield big enough to roll an imperator cargo of base hits through of course the gaping wounds of the stockings must be plugged but it seems like bad surgery to inflict further mutilation in order to fill the gashes already made and when it comes to driving in scores when they count we predict that old herman and his swatstick are going to be lamented keeper is more or less of an unknown quantity its true that brick king in condition is an excellent backstop and a good hitter but it must not be forgotten that he has not played since he was injured last august and incidentally it should be remembered that ben frazer has a head as long as a tape measure an expert appraiser should be called in to inspect any property on which frazer shows a disposition to relinquish his grip it is a good evenmoney proposition that old ben and the wolves will get their hooks into the worlds series boodle again this year lefty smiled over this his lips curling a bit scornfully the opening of the real baseball season was yet a long distance away but the newspaper writers were compelled to grind out a required amount of dope each day and were working hard to keep up their average some of them were clever and ingenious in their phrasing but nearly all of them betrayed a lack of originality or courage in forming and expressing individual opinions the wolves had won the pennant and the worlds championship last season and up to date they had been damaged less than any club in organized ball by the raids of the federals some wise pen pusher had therefore predicted that the wolves would cop the bunting again and was supported in this opinion by all the little fellows who ran bleating after the wise one like a flock of sheep chasing a bellwether it was evident that with no apparent exceptions this bleating flock looked on the blue stockings as a drifting derelict that was due to be blown up and sunk for locke they had only pity and mild contempt because he had permitted himself to be dragged into the impossible attempt to salvage the worthless hulk even old ben frazer than whom none was reckoned more keen and astute had expressed such a sentiment without concealment a weak man would have felt some qualms lefty felt none he had not sought the job in a way fate had thrust it upon him and now the more unsurmountable the difficulties appeared the stronger he became to grapple with them like a soldier going into battle exulted and fired by a high and lofty purpose his heart sang within him before going to bed lefty had wired kennedy concerning the deal with frazer and he believed skullen had made haste to telegraph weegman he rose in the morning fully expecting to get a redhot message from colliers private secretary and was surprised when nothing of the sort reached him while at breakfast however he received an answer from old jack good work congratulations keep it up kennedy weegmans silence led locke to do some thinking and suddenly he understood skullen had discovered him on the knickerbocker special just before the train had pulled into albany and immediately mit had hastened away to buy a paper of course he had then sent word to weegman who was now on his way to new york but he cant get here before six oclock tonight thought lefty and my train for the south leaves at threethirtyfour he did not relish running away from weegman and it had gone against the grain when upon the advice of kennedy he had suddenly left indianapolis but he knew old jack was wise and the more he could accomplish without being interfered with by the rascal he despised the stronger his position for open fighting would be when it became necessary to defy him to his face his first duty that day was to visit his parents and shortly after breakfast he took the tube for jersey less than an hours journey brought him to the hazelton home and after something like an hour spent with them he left them in a much more cheerful and hopeful frame of mind on returning to the city he called up the office of franklin parlmee to his disappointment he was informed that parlmee had not returned since leaving for indianapolis he had expected the man could inform him whether or not virginia collier was in new york and if she were how to find her and obtain the brief interview he desired for he was sure that a short talk with charles colliers daughter would serve to clear away many of the uncertainties with which he was surrounded but there were other things to be done and lefty was kept on the jump without time even to snatch a hasty lunch when a person attempts to accomplish a great deal in a brief period in new york he often finds he has shouldered a heavy load by two oclock in the afternoon he realized that it would be impossible for him to take the threethirtyfour southbound from the pennsylvania station there was a slower train leaving at ninethirty that was the best he could do he believed weegman would rush to the great eastern as soon as he arrived locke had left the great eastern and there was little chance of encountering the man elsewhere once or twice he thought of skullen and wondered if he had made an effort to keep track of him if so laughed the southpaw he has been some busy person at six oclock he was appeasing a ravenous appetite in a quiet restaurant with the exception of the fact that he had not been able to find virginia collier he had done everything he had set out to do and he had wired capn wiley that he would soon be on his way with a blue stockings contract for mysterious jones to sign in order to pass the time and obtain a little diversion he went to a motionpicture show after dinner having first secured accommodations on the train and checked his bag at the station he left the theater shortly before nine oclock and had reached broadway and thirtythird street when a lighted limousine containing two persons besides the driver drove past him he obtained a good look at both passengers a man who was talking earnestly and a woman smiling as she listened he knew he was not mistaken this time the man was bailey weegman the woman was virginia collier chapter xx a riddle to solve locke stood still staring after the swiftly receding car he thought of pursuit but as a heavy rain was falling there was no available taxi in the immediate vicinity by the time he could secure one the limousine would have vanished leaving no possible hope of tracing it weegman and virginia collier together and on terms plainly more than usually friendly what was the explanation she had arrived in new york after all and it was apparent that weegman knew where to find her when he reached the city that his company was distinctly agreeable to her was evident from the fleeting glimpse lefty had obtained as parlmees rival the man held the favor of charles collier had the baseball magnate at last succeeded in breaking down the prejudice and opposition of his daughter was it possible that weegman not parlmee was the magnet that had drawn the girl back from europe impossible exclaimed lefty shed never throw over frank for that chuckling scoundrel but was it impossible vaguely he recalled something like a change in the tone of virginias last letters to janet somehow they had not seemed as frank and confiding as former letters and eventually to janets worriment and perplexity virginia had ceased to write at all before locke flashed a picture of parlmee as he had appeared in indianapolis nervous perplexed and by his own admission greatly worried parlmee had confessed that he had received only two very unsatisfactory letters from virginia since she had sailed for europe with her father and more than a month had elapsed since the second of these had come to his hands of itself this was enough to upset a man as much in love with miss collier as parlmee undoubtedly was but at the time lefty had vaguely felt that the automobile salesman was holding something back and now he was sure parlmees pride and his secret hope that he was mistaken had prevented him from confessing that the girl had changed in her attitude toward him true virginia had cabled that she was sailing on the victoria and had asked him to meet her and although she had not sailed on that ship yet she was now in new york here was a riddle to solve did the solution lie in the assumption that having decided to break her tentative engagement in a facetoface talk with parlmee the girls courage had failed her leading her to change her plans the fact that he was with her now seemed to prove that weegmans information regarding her movements and intentions had been more accurate than parlmees it did not appear plausible that such a girl could be persuaded of her own free will to throw over franklin parlmee for bailey weegman but perhaps she was not exercising her own free will perhaps some powerful and mastering influence had been brought to bear upon her was it not possible also that her father whose singular behavior had lately aroused comment and speculation was likewise a victim of this mastering influence while the idea was a trifle bizarre and savored of sensational fiction such things did happen if reports of them to be found almost daily in the newspapers could be believed but when locke tried to imagine the chuckling and oily weegman as a hypnotist dominating both collier and his daughter by the power of an evil spell he failed it was too preposterous one thing however was certain evil powers of a materialistic nature were at work and they had succeeded in making a decided mess of charles colliers affairs to defeat them the strategy and determination of united opposition would be required and in view of the task the opposition seemed weak and insufficient even parlmee who might render some aid was not to be reached he had obtained a months leave from business in order to settle his own suspicions and fears but he had not returned to new york where was he lefty glanced over his shoulder as the herald clock began to hammer out the hour of nine then he set his face westward and made for the pennsylvania station at a brisk pace reaching his destination he wrote and sent to parlmees office address a message that contained in addition to the positive assurance that virginia was in town and had been seen with weegman a statement of the southpaws suspicions which amounted almost to convictions concerning the whole affair there didnt seem to be much more that he could do he had secured his accommodations on the florida mail but he expected to be back on the field of battle in the north within the shortest possible time before going aboard his train he bought the latest edition of an evening newspaper and naturally turned at once to the sporting page almost by instinct his eyes found something of personal concern a statement that manager garrity would strengthen the rockets by securing an unknown dummy pitcher who had been discovered by scout skullen and was said to be a wizard skullen it was intimated was off with a commission from garrity to sign up his find there was no longer any doubt in lockes mind that skullen had watched the work of mysterious jones and intended to nail the mute for the rockets even now he had departed on his mission probably he had left at threethirtyfour on the very train lefty had meant to take if so he would reach florida many hours ahead of the southpaw and would have plenty of time to accomplish his purpose true locke had made a fair and square bargain with wiley and jones but having been unable to get jones signature on a blue stockings contract at the time the deal would not be binding if the mute chose to go back on it not a little apprehensive lefty sent still another message to capn wiley after which he went aboard the train found his berth and turned in chapter xxi the man ahead locke was the first passenger to leap off the train when it stopped at vienna he made for one of the two rickety carriages that were drawn up beside the station platform the whitewooled old negro driver straightened on his seat signaling with his whip and called right dis way sah dis way fo the lithonia house is there a baseball game in this town today uncle asked lefty yes sah dere sho am deys gwine to be some hot game so everbody say our boys gwine buck up against dem wind jabbers an derell be a regler ruction out to de pahk what time does the game begin free oclock am de skaduled hour fo de obsequies sah deys out to de pahk now sah an most everbody could git dere has gone too locke looked at his watch thirty minutes before the game starts how far is your park bout a mile sah mo uh less two dollars if you get me there in a hurry two dollahs sah yes sah step right in sah an watch dis heah streak o locomotion transpose yo over de earth surface set tight an hol fast tossing his overcoat and bag into the rear of the carriage lefty sprang in the old negro gave a shrill yell and cracked his whip with a pistollike report the yell and the crack electrified the rawboned old nag into making a wild leap as if trying to jump out of the thills it was a marvel that the spliced and stringtied harness held the southpaw was flung down upon the rear seat and it was a wonder that he did not go flying over the low back of it and out of the carriage he grabbed hold with both hands and held fast round the corner of the station spun the carriage on two wabbly wheels and away it careened at the heels of the galloping horse the colored driver continuing to yell and crack his whip two dollars the ride from the station to the baseball park was brief but exciting the distance could not have been more than half a mile and considering the conveyance it was made in record time whoa yo nancy hanks shouted the driver surging back on the reins and stopping the animal so abruptly that lefty was nearly pitched into the forward seat did i heah yo say you wanted to git heah in a hurry sah locke jumped out thats the shortest mile i ever traveled he said handing over the price promised but then when it comes to driving barney oldfield has nothing on you carrying his overcoat and bag he hurried to the gate and paid the price of admission a goodly crowd had gathered and the local team was practicing on the field over at one side some of the visitors were getting in a little light batting practice mysterious jones was warming up with schaeffer a short distance behind jones stood capn wiley his legs planted wide his arms folded his ear cocked listening to mit skullen who was talking earnestly lefty strode hastily toward the pair sell him said the marine marvel in reply to the scout as the southpaw approached behind them of course i will but you made one miscue mate you should have come straight to me in the first place instead of superflouing away your time seeking to pilfer him off me by stealth what price do you respectfully tender locke felt a throb of resentful anger regardless of a square bargain already made wiley was ready to negotiate with skullen however mit had not yet succeeded in his purpose and the southpaw was on hand to maintain a prior claim involuntarily he halted waiting for the scouts offer as you arent in any regular league said mit by rights i dont have to give you anything for him but if youll jolly him into putting his fist to a contract ill fork over fifty bones out of my own pocket garrity wont stand for it so ill have to come through with the fifty myself your magnanimous offer staggers me exclaimed wiley allow me a moment to subdue my emotions however and nevertheless i fear me greatly that my bottom price would be slightly more than that well what is your bottom price demanded skullen put it down to the last notch i will ill give you bedrock figures comprehend me mate ill pare it right down to the bone and you cant buy jones a measly lonesome cent less ill sell him to you for just precisely fifty thousand dollars the scouts jaw dropped and he stared at the little man who stared up at him in return one eyelid slightly lowered an oddly provocative expression on his swarthy face slowly the look of incredulous disbelief turned to wrath the purple color surged upward from mits bull neck into his scarred face his huge hands closed what are you trying to hand me you blamed little runt he snarled wheres the joke no joke at all i hasten to postulate said wiley the scandalous fact is that i couldnt sell him to you at all without scuttling and sinking my sacred honor but human nature is frail and prone to temptation and for the sum of fifty thousand dollars id inveigle jones into signing with you even though never again as long as i should dwell on this terrestrial sphere could i look my old college chump lefty locke in the countenance skullens astonishment was a sight to behold he made strange wheezing gurgling sounds in his throat presently one of his paws shot out and fastened on capn wileys shoulder whats that youre saying about lefty locke he demanded what are you giving me straight goods mit stated the southpaw serenely as he stepped forward too bad you wasted so much time making a long and useless trip skullen came round with something like his old deftness of whirling in the ring when engaged in battle never in all his life had his battered face worn an uglier look for a moment however he seemed to doubt the evidence of his eyes locke he gasped here yes indeed returned the new manager of the blue stockings pleasantly i reckoned you would be ahead of me mit but as a man of his word wiley couldnt do business with you and without his aid there was little chance for you to make arrangements with jones skullen planted his clenched fists upon his hips and gazed at the southpaw with an expression of unrepressed hatred his bearing as well as his look threatened assault lefty dropped his traveling bag to the ground and tossed the overcoat he had been compelled to wear in the north upon it he felt that it would be wise for him to have both hands free and ready for use chapter xxii a doubtful victory who sent you here demanded the belligerent individual what business have you got coming poking your nose into my affairs youd better chase yourself sudden instead of exhibiting alarm lefty laughed in the mans face dont make a show of yourself mit he advised bluster wont get you any ball players at least it wont get you this one ive already made a deal for jones you havent got his name on a contract you hadnt time if you had wileyd told me i made a fair trade for him before i went north into skullens eyes there came a look of understanding and satisfaction his lips curled back from his ugly teeth you didnt have any authority to make a trade then for you werent manager of the stockings you cant put anything like that over on me if you dont chase yourself ill throw you over the fence sensing an impending clash with the exception of the mute and the catcher the wind jammers ceased their desultory practice and watched for developments a portion of the spectators also becoming aware that something unusual was taking place turned their attention to the little triangular group not far from the visitors bench you couldnt get jones if you threw me over into georgia said locke unruffled it wont do you any good to start a scrap permit me to impersonate the dove of peace pleaded capn wiley lefty is absolutely voracious in his statement that he made a fair and honorable compact with me by which jones is to become the legitimate chattel of the blue stockings still he added shaking his head and licking his lips flesh is weak and liable to err if i had seen fifty thousand simoleons coming my way in exchange for the greatest pitcher of modern times im afraid i should have lacked the energy to sidestep them the root of all evil has sometimes tempted me from the path of rectitude but now lefty is here and the danger is over its no use skully old top the die is cast you may as well submit gracefully to the inveterable muttering inaudibly skullen turned and walked away i have a contract in my pocket ready for the signature of jones said lefty will you get him to put his name to it before the game starts it will give me a pang of pleasure to do so was the assurance there on the field envied by his teammates mysterious jones used lockes fountain pen to place his signature a b jones was the name he wrote upon the contract that bound him to the blue stockings what the initials stood for not even wiley knew for a moment the mute seemed to hesitate but the marine marvel urged him on and the deed was done if you cater to his little giddyocyncracies said the sailor youll find him a pearl beyond price unless youre afraid skully may return and mar your pleasure you may sit on the bench with us and watch him toy with the local bricabrac it is bound to be a painfully onesided affair skullen laughed lefty has ceased to cause me special apprehension the contract is signed now so locke sat on the bench and watched his new pitcher perform when he walked to the mound jones seemed if possible more somber and tragic than usual and he certainly had his speed with him yet neither the ominous appearance of the mute nor his blinding smoke was sufficient to faze the vienna batters who cracked him for three clean singles in the last half of the opening inning and then failed to score because of foolish base running he seems to be rather hittable today observed locke whats the matter wiley this vienna bunch doesnt look particularly good to me just a lot of amateurs who never saw real players i should say thats it thats what ails them for one thing replied the manager of the wind jammers they have accumulated together no special knowledge of simon poor baseball talent and so they dont know enough to be scared even the great mathewson has confessed that the worst bumping he ever collided with was handed out by a bunch of bushers who stood up to the dish shut their blinkers when he pitched and swung blind at the pill these lobsters dont realize that jonesys fast one would pass right through a batter without pausing perceptibly if it should hit him and so they toddle forth without qualms whatever they are and take a slam at the globule next round ill have to get out there on the turf and warn them ill put the fear of death into their hearts get them to quaking and they wont touch the horsehide but such a program didnt suit locke if all jones has is his speed and the fear it inspires he wont travel far in fast company you ought to know that wiley big league batters will knock the cover off the fast one unless a pitcher puts something else on it sit still once to please me and lets see what jones can do without the assistance of your chatter its hardly a square deal objected the marine marvel the jinx has been keeping company with us ever since we struck fernandon from that occasion up to the present date anno domino we havent won a single consecutive game such bad luck has hurt my feelings it has grieved me to the innermost abscess of my soul do you mean to say that these country teams have been trimming you with jones in the box alas and alack i cant deny it unless i resort to fabrication which i never do the euray browns tapped jonesy for seventeen heartbreaking bingles and the pikeville greyhounds lacerated his delivery even more painfully my own brilliant work in the box has been sadly insufficient to stem the tide of disaster locke frowned what success or lack of it wiley had had as a pitcher was a matter of no moment but the statement that amateur teams of no particular standing had found mysterious jones an easy mark was disturbing was it possible that he had been led with undue haste to fritter away good money for a pitcher who would prove worthless in the big league true the mute had seemed to show something in the fernandon game but in similar contests lefty had seen many a pinheaded worthless country pitcher give a fine imitation of walter johnson in topnotch form the test of the bush was in reality no test at all throughout five innings the southpaw succeeded in restraining wiley and during that portion of the game the viennas found jones for nine singles and two doubles accumulating four runs only for bad judgment on the paths they might have secured twice as many tallies in the same period the local pitcher using a little dinky slow curve held the visitors to one score the mute seemed to be trying hard enough but he could not keep his opponents from hitting with the opening of the sixth wiley broke the leash of restraint ive got to get out and get under he declared you cant expect me to sit still and watch my barkentine go upon the rocks heres where we start something get into em schepps begin doing things well back you up for in onion there is strength schepps led off with a hit and immediately the wind jammers encouraged by wiley leaped out from the bench dancing wildly and tossing the bats into the air locke smiled as he watched them he had seen big league teams do the same thing in an effort to drive away the jinx and break a streak of bad luck but although lefty smiled he was not wholly happy if jones is a quince he thought ive wasted my time trying to brace up our pitching staff even mit skullen will have the laugh on me his anxiety had led him to come straight from new york to vienna without stopping at fernandon he had sent a message to janet telling her that he would be home the following day the wind jammers kept after the local twirler and succeeded in pounding two men round to the registry station then wiley did some wigwagging to jones and the gloomy mute nodded assurance after which he walked out and fanned three batters in a row you see lefty exulted the marine marvel thats what he needs give him proper encouragement and hes there with the damsons temperamental or yellow which speculated the southpaw either sort of a pitcher is worthless in pinches the visitors failed to continue their hitting streak in the seventh whether or not jones was disheartened by this he let down in the last half of the inning and vienna added another score wileys warnings having no impression upon them nor did the mute show any remarkable form in the remainder of the game which terminated with the score six to four in favor of the locals the old jinx is still with us lamented the dejected manager of the wind jammers wouldnt it congeal your pedal extremities it is enough to give one cold feet admitted locke but with jones doing any real pitching today four tallies would have been sufficient for you picking up his overcoat and traveling bag he started to follow the wellsatisfied crowd from the field as he approached the gate mit skullen stood up on the bleachers and singled him out mits face wore a leering grin youre welcome to that lemon locke he cried i wouldnt take him now for a gift youve got stung good and proper lefty walked on without replying chapter xxiii all wrong when locke reached fernandon he found as he expected a furious message from weegman awaiting him in it he was savagely reprimanded and warned under no circumstances to make any further deals without consulting colliers private secretary he was also commanded to report at the office of the blue stockings baseball club without unnecessary delay lefty merely smiled over this but he did not smile over a long telegram from franklin parlmee stating that he had not seen virginia collier nor heard anything further from her parlmee averred that he could not believe virginia was in new york he expressed the conviction that locke had not seen her in the limousine with bailey weegman but had been deceived by a resemblance but if she were not in new york where was she and why had he received no word from her janet watched lefty frowning and biting his lip over parlmees message her own face showed the anxiety she felt what do you think she asked it doesnt seem possible that virginia could have been with that man as you thought you must have been mistaken he shook his head im positive janet i would be willing to wager anything that i made no mistake then what does it mean i cant imagine virginia being in new york without letting frank know its got me guessing locke admitted theres a snarl that needs to be untangled she grabbed his arm you dont suppose what he asked as she hesitated you dont suppose anything terrible could have happened to virginia perhaps that villain has carried her off shut her up somewhere perhaps she is helpless in his power this minute he may be trying to force her into marrying him lefty laughed that sounds too much like a dime novel my dear scoundrel though he is weegman would scarcely have the nerve to try anything like that with the daughter of charles collier thats not the answer but somethings wrong insisted janet no doubt about that her husband replied a lot of things seem to be wrong somebody is dealing the cards under the table i know said janet that virginia didnt care for mr weegman and the more her father sought to influence her the less she thought of him she was proud of franklin because he had proved his business ability and she thought mr collier would give in soon but i cant understand why she stopped writing to me she hasnt written since arriving on this side were not getting anywhere by speculating like this said lefty can you be ready to go north with me tomorrow you are going back so soon just as soon as we can start im thinking i ought to have remained there i only came south at all in order to make sure of mysterious jones and now it looks as though i wasted both time and money by doing so perhaps i would have been better off if skullen had succeeded in getting jones away from me but the cottage our lease runs another full month it cant be helped well have to pay the rental and give it up and your arm you thought another month down here might give you time to work it back into condition ive got plenty to worry about besides my arm ive been told plainly that ive been picked to be the goat by a set of scoundrels who are trying to put over a dirty piece of work and if i fool them ill have to do it with my head not my arm im going to stake everything on my ability to put the kibosh on their crooked game and to stand any chance of succeeding i must be on the field of battle so we must leave fernandon tomorrow my dear to accomplish this necessitated no small amount of hustling but janet did her part with the assistance of her maid and a colored man the work was speedily done there were tears in janets eyes when she looked back at the deserted little cottage as they drove away in a carriage to catch the train it has been pleasant here she said ill never forget it we were so quiet and so happy now somehow i have a feeling that theres nothing but trouble ahead of us youve taken a big contract phil are you afraid he asked she looked up at him and smiled proudly not a bit you are not the sort of man who fails i know youll win out his cheeks glowed and a light leaped into his eyes after hearing you say that i couldnt fail janet dear he said quietly but earnestly its going to be some fight but let it come im ready the journey northward was uneventful locke had wired both kennedy and parlmee when he would arrive in new york asking them to meet him at the great eastern he did not stop off at the home town of the blue stockings choosing to disregard for the present weegmans imperative order for him to report at once at the office of the club by mail he had formally notified the secretary of the club of the trade with frazer and the purchase of mysterious jones directing that checks be sent immediately to the manager of the wolves and to capn wiley he had done this as a matter of formality but he felt sure that weegman would interfere and hold up the payments even though they could sooner or later be legally enforced delay matters as he might the rascal could not bring about the repudiation of business deals entered into by the properly authorized manager of the team locke hoped to have the situation well in hand before he should find it necessary to beard the lion in all his fury the showdown must come before long but ere that time the southpaw hoped to fill his hand on the draw when he had sent out the players contracts from indianapolis he had instructed the men after signing to mail them directly to him in new york he had made this request emphatic warning each man not to return his signed contract to the office of the blue stockings he had kennedy to thank for suggesting this procedure if the contracts go back to the club office old jack had said weegman may get hold of them and hold out on you that would leave you in the dark you wouldnt know who had signed up and who hadnt and so you couldnt tell where you stood it would keep you muddled so you wouldnt know what holes were left to be plugged if you undertook to find out how the land lay by wiring inquiries to the players youd make them uneasy and set them wondering what was doing some of them might even try belated dickering with the feds and while you could hold them by law it would complicate things still more if the newspapers got wise and printed things the stock of the club would slump still more which would help the dirty bunch thats trying to knock the bottom out of it beyond question kennedy was foxy and farseeing and locke looked forward expectantly to another hearttoheart talk with the old man at the great eastern a big bundle of mail was delivered to lefty after he registered at the hotel immediately on reaching his rooms he made haste to open the letters look janet he cried exultantly after he had torn open envelope after envelope here are the contracts grant welsh hyland savage dillon reilley and lumley all have signed as well as the youngsters who didnt attract special attention from the feds not a man lost that the outlaws hadnt gobbled up before weegman so kindly forced the management upon me weve got the makings of a real team left some of the deadwood has been cleared away thats all with scarcely an exception the players had sent along with their contracts brief friendly letters congratulating locke and expressing confidence in his ability to manage the blue stockings successfully he had won the regard of them all in some cases that regard fell little short of genuine affection with him as their leader they would fight with fresh spirit and loyalty its fine lefty exclaimed janet as she read some of those cheery letters there was a time when i could not have believed professional ball players were such a fine lot of men i might have had some doubts myself before i was associated with them he admitted but experience has taught me that they measure up in manhood as well as any other class of course black sheep may be found in every business as he spoke he hurriedly opened a letter that had just attracted his attention among those remaining he read it aloud my dear hazelton i am writing in haste before sailing for liverpool on the northumberland as i thought you were wrong about having seen virginia in new york she is in london and in trouble ive had a cablegram from her which however explains very little she needs me and i am going to her at once if you should wish to communicate with me my address will be the cecil as i know that both you and mrs hazelton feel some anxiety about virginia i shall let you hear from me as soon as i have any news wishing you the success and good fortune you deserve as a baseball manager i remain sincerely yours franklin parlmee when he had finished reading he stood staring at the letter in surprise chapter xxiv wheels within wheels well now what do you know about that cried lefty sailed for liverpool the mans crazy but he says he has had a cable message from virginia said janet she is in trouble in london you were mistaken was i queried the southpaw as if not yet convinced you must have been all along i have thought it likely but you persisted i saw her distinctly in that passing limousine which was brightly lighted true i obtained only one passing glance at her but it was enough to satisfy me you are so persistent phil thats your one fault when you think youre right all the argument and proof in the world cannot change you in short im set as a mule he admitted smiling well there are worse faults a mistake may prove costly or humiliating to an obstinate person who persists in his error but when he is right such a person is pretty well qualified to win over all opposition if i did not see virginia collier in that car she has a perfect double in new york i have great confidence in the reliability of my eyes janet however thoroughly convinced that her husband had been deceived by a resemblance made no reply lefty had looked for some word from kennedy but had found nothing from him in his bundle of mail it was possible of course that old jack had found it inconvenient to make the trip to new york just then but naturally if he could not come on he would have let locke know lefty and janet had not dined on the train preferring to do so after reaching their destination as they were passing the desk on their way to the dining room locke stopped short staring at the back of a slender welldressed young man who was talking to one of the clerks then the southpaw sprang forward and clapped a hand on the young mans shoulder jack stillman he exclaimed impulsively the man turned quickly if it isnt lefty locke he cried grabbing the pitchers hand and youre the one man ive been palpitating to get hold of youre like the nimble flea but ive got you now murder said the southpaw my joy at spotting you caused me to forget i should have passed you by old man for the moment i completely forgot your profession and your knack of digging a column or so of sacred secrets out of any old ball player who knows anything he shouldnt tell stillman was the baseball man of the blade a newspaper with a confirmed habit of putting over scoops with the exception of phil chatterton who was more of a special writer than reporter stillman was almost universally acknowledged to be the best informed pen pusher who made a specialty of dealing with the national game he possessed an almost uncanny intuition and was credited with the faculty of getting wise in advance to most of the big happenings in the baseball world so you would have ducked me would you said the reporter reprovingly well i didnt think that of you i believe i should if id stopped to figure out the proper play in advance confessed lefty i dont care to do much talking for the papers at present hang you for an ungrateful reprobate exclaimed stillman with a touch of earnestness although he continued to laugh why i made you son at least im going to claim the credit when you first emerged from the tangled undergrowth i picked you for a winner and persistently boosted you i gave you fifty thousand dollars worth of free advertising and made my path the harder to climb by getting the fans keyed up to look for a fullfledged wonder after all that puffing if id fallen down in my first game rube marquards year or two of sojourning on the bench would have looked like a brief breathing spell compared to what would have probably happened to me but you didnt fall down i told them you wouldnt and you didnt let the other fellows tout the failures i pick the winners modest as ever i see said locke heres mrs hazelton waiting were just going to have a late dinner wont you join us janet knew stillman well and she shook hands with him mrs hazelton he said smiling by jove i looked round to see who you meant when you said that lefty somehow ive never yet quite got used to the fact that your honestandtruly name isnt locke ill gladly join you at dinner but a cup of coffee is all i care for as i dined a little while ago shant want anything more before two or three oclock in the morning when im likely to stray into johns where the night owls gather when they had seated themselves at a table in the almost deserted dining room lefty warned janet be careful what you say before him my dear he said hes looking for copy every minute that hes awake and nobody knows when he sleeps stillman became serious locke he said ive never yet betrayed a confidence oh yes im a reporter but all the same i have a method of getting my copy in a decent fashion my friends dont have to be afraid of me and close up like clams you should know that i do declared the southpaw promptly i didnt think you were going to take me quite so seriously you have been a square friend to me jack then dont be afraid to talk ill publish only what youre willing i should you can tell me what that is and if youve seen the blade right along you must be aware that its the one paper that hasnt taken a little poke at you since you were tagged to manage the blue stockings nevertheless here to your face im going to say that im afraid youve bitten off more than you can chew lefty shrugged his shoulders as to that time will tell for once your judgment may be at fault i dont mean that you couldnt manage the team successfully if you were given a halfdecent show the reporter hastened to make clear i think you could but im afraid youre going to find yourself in a mess that no man living could crawl out of with credit to himself the southpaw gave the waiter the order then he turned to stillman i thought i might hear something new from you jack he said but youre singing the same old song to be frank with you its getting a bit tiresome if i were dull enough not to know id been picked for a fall guy i could have obtained an inkling of it from the newspapers its plain every baseball scribe knows the fact that theres a putup job although none of them has had the nerve to come out flat and say so theyve said all they really dared to without absolute proof of a conspiracy if you know so much take my advice hand me the proof and give me permission to publish it but it must be real proof i cant do it yet perhaps when the time comes ill pass you what youre asking for just now considering your statement that you never double cross a friend im going to talk freely and tell you how much i know sipping his coffee stillman listened to lockes story that there was sufficient interest in it the attention of the reporter attested janet watched the newspaper man closely and once or twice she caught the flicker of an incredulous smile that passed over his face giving her the impression that stillman had a notion that there were holes in leftys narrative do you mind if i smoke asked the reporter when dinner was over and the dessert had been placed on the table having received janets permission stillman lit a cigarette and for a few moments said nothing being apparently engrossed with his thoughts presently he said i wonder wonder what lefty wanted to know what ive told you is the straight fact weegmans the crook kennedy knew it i knew it when i took the position of manager garritys behind weegman what ails collier and why he was crazy enough to run away and bury himself while his team was wrecked is the unexplained part of the mystery but if we can block weegman we may be able to put the whole game on the fritz i wonder repeated stillman letting the smoke curl from his mouth locke felt a touch of irritation what are you wondering over ive talked now im ready to listen the reporter gave locke a steady look evidently the possibility hasnt occurred to you that you may not even suspect the real crook who is at the bottom of the affair weegman conceived it replied lefty he knew garritys reputation he was sure garrity would jump at the chance to help and to grab a fat thing at the same time by stepping in and gobbling the stockings when the moment came of course weegman will get his for without his undermining work in our camp the thing couldnt be pulled off and weegmans looking to cop the big chiefs daughter when he gets the chief pinched just where he wants him wheels within wheels said stillman and weegman only one of the smallest of them hes one of those egotistical scoundrels who can easily be flattered and fooled into doing scurvy work for a keener mind you mean garrity i wasnt thinking of him when i spoke then who i had a man named parlmee in mind stated the reporter chapter xxv hidden tracks his lips parted his eyes wide and incredulous locke sat up straight on his chair and stared at stillman janet who had been listening attentively gave a little cry and leaned forward one slim protesting hand uplifted the reporter drew his case from his pocket and lit another cigarette presently lefty found his voice youre crazy jack he declared resentfully am i inquired stillman oh its impossible exclaimed janet absolutely ridiculous affirmed the southpaw very likely it seems so to you both admitted the newspaper man his calm and confident manner proclaiming his own settled conviction i listened to leftys story and i know hes wise to only a small part of whats been going on but parlmee oh its too preposterous for once in your career at least youre way off your trolley jack prove it to me why it isnt necessary franklin parlmee is a white man as square as there ever was and as honest as the day is long there are short days in midwinter but his object he couldnt have an object even if he were scoundrel enough to contemplate such a thing couldnt he asked stillman in that odd enigmatical way of his why not why hes practically engaged to virginia collier but without the consent of her father yes but bailey weegman is said to have a great liking for miss collier it was your theory that part of his object in seeking to wreck the blue stockings was to get old man collier in a tight place and force his hand why couldnt parlmee make the same sort of a play the persistence of the reporter began to irritate locke who felt his blood growing hot was his life beginning to tell on stillman was it possible the pace he had traveled had begun to weaken his naturally keen judgment even if parlmee had conceived such a foolish scheme he was in no position to carry it out jack on the other hand weegman was furthermore its perfectly impossible to imagine weegman acting as the tool and assistant of his rival whom he hates bitterly forget it unmoved stillman shook his head didnt i say that weegman was an egotistical dub and an easy mark he is naturally a rascal and he thinks himself very clever and so is just the sort to fall for a still cleverer rascal janets cheeks were hot and her eyes full of resentful anger it was difficult for her to sit there and hear parlmee maligned and she was confident that that was what she was doing she could not remain quiet i know frank parlmee mr stillman she asserted and lefty is right about him theres not a squarer man living how is it possible for parlmee to use weegman as a tool asked locke through garrity answered the reporter without hesitation but i dont see stillman leaned forward listen i am not at liberty to disclose the sources of my information but it has come to me that this idea of wrecking the blue stockings originated in parlmees brain he saw himself losing out in the fight for virginia collier and he became desperate conditions were ripe collier had hit the toboggan financially and otherwise a man of considerable strength of will he had begun to break down parlmee knew of his plan to go abroad for his health and of the arrangement to leave bailey weegman in charge of affairs collier had a great deal of confidence in weegmans ability and this would now be put to the test if weegman should make a grand failure as parlmee intended he should collier would lose all faith in him and probably in his disappointment he would hand him the gb that above all things was most to be desired by parlmee as it would get out of the way the rival who threatened to defeat him how to put the thing across was the question i am willing to give parlmee the credit of a longheaded piece of work he knew weegman must be kept in the dark must never be permitted to suspect that he was being used as a tool by his hated enemy it sounds altogether too impossible said locke but to his annoyance in spite of his persistently expressed faith a shadowy uncertainty a tiny nagging doubt was creeping into his mind stillman seemed so absolutely confident of his ground through his long association with miss collier the reporter pursued calmly parlmee had learned much about inside conditions in baseball he had plenty of opportunities to get at things entirely hidden from or merely suspected by the general public he knew garrity was a grasping scoundrel who had long regarded the blue stockings with a covetous eye and that being utterly unscrupulous he would do anything as long as he could keep in the background to break colliers grip and get his own soiled paws on the property therefore garrity was the man to deal with and to garrity parlmee went they met under cover in chicago and the deal was fixed up between them then garrity got at weegman the real stool pigeon and the fall guy of the whole plot locke was listening without protest now in spite of his desire not to believe stillmans theory seemed possible he would not yet admit even to himself that it was probable janet too was silent the color had left her face and beneath the table her hands were tightly clenched weegman was just ass enough to fall for it continued stillman contemptuously what garrity promised him i cant say but certainly it must have been a satisfactory percentage of the loot maybe an interest in the team when garrity got control and weegman would sell his soul for money the moment collier was out of the way he got to work you know as well as i do what success hes had in order to cover his tracks as far as possible he has picked you for the goat and hell try to shunt all the blame on you leftys face was grim he was endeavoring to look at the matter fairly and without bias to himself he was compelled to admit that his knowledge of parlmee had been obtained through casual association with the man not through business dealings and in no small degree he as well as janet had doubtless been influenced by the sentiments of virginia collier a girl in love may be easily deceived many girls blinded by their own infatuation have made heroes of thoroughbred scoundrels it was practically impossible however for locke to picture parlmee as a scoundrel you have made a statement jack he said without offering a particle of corroborating proof how do you know all this to be true i have the word of a man i trust that parlmee and garrity had that secret meeting in chicago just as i have stated a few days ago parlmee made a flying trip to indianapolis and i know that interrupted lefty i was in indianapolis at the time i met him there and had a brief talk with him on his way back resumed stillman he stopped off at cleveland to see garrity who happened to be in that city how do you know that my own business chanced to call me out to cleveland at that time and i saw parlmee and garrity together at the american house locke took a long breath recalling the fact that parlmee although professing to be in great haste when in indianapolis had not returned to his new york office as soon as expected that may have been an accidental meeting said the southpaw your proof has holes in it the reporter lighted a fresh cigarette how does it happen he asked that parlmee is buying up all the small blocks of the club stock that he can get hold of lefty started as if pricked by the point of a knife parlmee an automobile salesman a man who had found it necessary to get out and show that he could make good in the business world buying the stock of the club is he asked the pitcher he is asserted stillman positively i know of three lots that he has purchased and in each instance he has paid a little more than it was supposed to be worth he he may have bought it as an investment faltered janet the reporter smiled at her as far as i can learn franklin parlmee is not situated financially to invest much money in stock of any kind with his stock depreciating and bound to go lower in value he would be a chump to purchase it as an investment the man who pays more than its market value in order to get hold of it knows something about the doings behind the scenes that is not known to the general public apparently that man is parlmee whos furnishing him the money to buy the stock my own guess is that it is the man whos looking to get control of the club and that man is garrity still janet protested that it was impossible but she looked questioningly at lefty the doubt that she was fighting against was now beginning to creep into her eyes parlmee said the southpaw has gone to europe i have a message from him stating that he would sail on the northumberland if hes behind the plot to wreck the blue stockings why should he leave the field of action at this time if ive got his number returned stillman hes a liar in various ways perhaps he has sailed for europe perhaps he hasnt his message may be nothing more than a little dust for your eyes but if he has sailed theres only one answer to that out with it urged locke of course you think it another move in the rotten game sure as death and taxes he believes the time is ripe to get at collier hes gone across to get at him and twist the control of the club out of his hands probably hell appear before collier in the guise of a friend anxious to save him from complete financial disaster hes got just about enough time to make the trip comfortably get that business through with and return before the regular meeting of the league magnates here in new york then at the meeting tom garrity will bob up serenely as the real owner of the blue stockings chapter xxvi not much show tired out janet went to bed shortly after stillman left but locke knowing he could not sleep sat up to think the situation over the difficulties and problems of his own position seemed greater than ever if the plot was as deep and intricate as the reporter believed and if the men behind it were moving with haste and certainty to the accomplishment of their designs there seemed scarcely a ghost of a chance for him practically alone and unaided to block them for lefty now felt that in a way he was standing alone even kennedy having no power could do little more than offer advice and where was kennedy the southpaw had fancied that he would be given more time to muster his opposing forces for the battle he had even imagined at first that the man he would need to contend against and defeat was weegman but now weegman the blind tool of craftier creatures looked insignificant and weak in order to defeat him it would be necessary to strike higher how was he to strike that was the question locke had suggested to stillman complete exposure of the plot by newspaper publicity and right there the reporter who had seemed so confident of his ground had betrayed that after his usual method he was working by intuition and had no positive and unassailable verification of his conclusions it would not do for his paper to charge criminal conspiracy without proper evidence to back up such an indictment recalling this lefty remembered that stillman having heard all the southpaw could tell had ended by giving his own theory and had offered proof to substantiate it and then he had been compelled to acknowledge that the proof he had to offer was not sound enough to base exposure and open action upon if stillman were right doubtless parlmee had gone abroad with full knowledge of charles colliers whereabouts that knowledge being denied lefty he could not warn collier and the plot would be carried through as arranged then as the reporter had predicted at the annual meeting of the magnates shortly to be held garrity would appear as owner of the blue stockings when that happened the fight would be over and the conspirators would be triumphant with the door to janets chamber closed locke walked the floor striving for a clear conception of what ought to be done he felt like a man bound hand and foot of course he could go on with his project to strengthen the team but the harvest of his success would be reaped by the plotters if they too were successful there was little uncertainty about what would happen to him for he knew that his conscience would not permit him to become an understrapper for garrity he had left fernandon with courage and high hope to do battle but now the helplessness of the situation threatened to appall him if there were only some way to get into communication with collier again he thought of his somewhat shaken conviction that virginia was in new york if that were true some of her family or friends must know it and of course virginia would know how to communicate without delay with her father with this thought came the conviction that in virginia lay his only hope if he had been mistaken and she were not in the united states his chance of doing anything to foil the conspirators was not one in a thousand his work for the morrow was cut out for him he must learn positively if charles colliers daughter was on american soil and if so he must find her the telephone rang and when he answered it he was informed that kennedy was calling the faithful old veteran had come after all lefty said that he was to be sent up at once well son said old jack as he came in how are things moving none too well answered lefty shaking his hand so grunted kennedy i wondered just what was up and i came right along in answer to your call but my train was delayed what are the new developments sit down said locke and ill tell you since i sent you that message ive heard something thats got me guessing and worried the contracts questioned old jack sitting down the boys signed up didnt they every one of them thats not the trouble ive had a talk with jack stillman the only reporter i know with a noodle screwed on right said kennedy his beans packed with sound sense when he gets an idea its generally correct in that case unless hes made a bobble this time the situations worse than we suspected jack give me the dope urged kennedy the old man listened to locke without comment and when lefty had finished he sat thoughtfully plucking at his under lip with his thumb and forefinger well he said after a time stillman usually puts them in the groove when he shoots then you think hes hit it right in this case i havent said so if anybody else had passed this one up id have said it missed the plate by a rod with stillman doing the pitching im not so ready to give a decision against him but you say he finished a lot more confident than he began yes instead of seeking information he finished up by giving it just as though he had talked himself into a settled conviction as he went along thats it then we wont accept his statement as fact until he gets some kind of proof son you know more about parlmee than i do and youve always figured that gent on the level havent you yes but im compelled to admit that i havent had sufficient dealings with him to feel certain that my estimation of his character is correct furthermore my first impression was unfavorable first impressions are sometimes the best but at that time as you know my judgment could hardly be unprejudiced it was when collier first took over the team and i had trouble with carson the manager he put in your place everything seemed going wrong then a grin broke over kennedys face and he chuckled softly a reminiscent expression in his keen old eyes those were some stirring times boy he said collier fired me for al carson and carson made a mess of it hes managing a dub league team now he thought he could get along without you just as collier reckoned he could dispense with me but at the finish it was you and me that came back and saved the day for the stockings you pitched the game of your life that last day of the season now its up to you to come back again and ive got a hunch that you will youll return better than ever youre going to make the wiseacres that think youre down and out look foolish locke shook his head knowing what i do do you suppose i could do that if garrity got hold of the team i wouldnt have the heart to work for that scoundrel back in the time were speaking of it was stillmans cleverness that straightened things out not another newspaper man got wise to the real situation with his usual uncanny intuition he saw through it all and as usual he made no mistake right you are admitted old jack all the more reason to suppose he is right now we cant dodge that fact tomorrow im going to make every effort to find some method of getting into communication with charles collier its my only play in this game if it fails good night again lefty began pacing the floor it seemed that he could not wait patiently for the coming day he was burning with a desire to get to work at once it had been his purpose to seek kennedys advice on other matters but these now seemed secondary and unimportant for the time being his talk with stillman had led him to alter completely his plan of immediate action to prevent the control of the team from falling into the clutches of the conspirators was now his sole purpose as the problem of rebuilding it and restoring it to its former strength and prestige could be solved later kennedy sat thinking plucking at his under lip as was the old mans habit when perplexed yes son he said after a time thats what youre up against old p t barnum had a show but it doesnt look like you have chapter xxvii the suspended ax all the next forenoon locke kept the wires hot he phoned and telegraphed to every one he could think of who might be able to give him the information he desired so desperately he met with one disappointment after another in each instance the reply came back that both charles collier and his daughter were somewhere in europe but no one appeared to know just where if his efforts established anything at all it seemed to be the fact that lefty had been mistaken in thinking he had seen virginia in new york for if she were there surely some of these people would know of it the feeling of helplessness of fighting against greedy and remorseless forces too strong for him to checkmate pressed upon him heavily it was a little after noon when he called the office of the blade he wanted to talk to stillman again if anybody in new york could find a person wanted the reporter was the man to do it and locke believed that for friendships sake stillman would attempt it near the telephone switchboard in the hotel were two long shelves situated a little distance apart at which patrons could consult the different directories at one of these several persons were looking up numbers so locke took his book to the other shelf and found the call for the editorial rooms of the blade a man at the next shelf turned saw the pitcher and listened when lefty gave the number to the operator instead of giving his own number which he had found the man noted down the southpaws call on a card it was the fourth time during the day that this same man had made a record of a number asked for by locke returning the card to his pocket the man pretended to busy himself again over one of the directories keeping his back partly turned toward the pitcher soon he heard the switchboard girl repeat leftys number and direct him to booth no the man closed his book and turned round slowly the southpaw was disappearing into a booth at the end of one of the rows and in closing the door behind him he unintentionally left it slightly open the watching man moved quietly forward until he was close to this booth through the glass of which he could see that leftys back was partly turned toward him there he paused taking some letters and papers from his pocket and running them over as if searching for something while appearing to be absorbed in his own affairs he could hear every word that the pitcher spoke into the receiver getting the editorial rooms of the blade locke asked for stillman after a slight delay he was informed that the reporter was not there no one could say just when he would be in this is important stated lefty a matter in which he is greatly interested i must talk with him as soon as possible will you ask him as soon as he comes in to call philip hazelton at the great eastern yes hazelton thats right why yes im lefty locke all right dont fail to tell him immediately he arrives the man outside slipped the letters and papers into his pocket and turned away after the manner of a person who has suddenly decided upon something he had not walked ten steps however before he turned back the southpaw was paying for the call the man watched him now without further effort to avoid notice and when the pitcher turned from the switchboard he stepped forward deliberately to meet him hello said the man in a voice distinctly husky and unpleasant how are you locke lefty stopped short and stared it was garrity coarse complacent patronizing the owner of the rockets grinned showing the numerous gold fillings in his teeth his features were large and his jaw was square and brutal his clothes were those of a common racetrack follower quite well thank you answered lefty coldly thinking of the pleasure it would be to tell garrity his private opinion of him seems to me you look worried i dont wonder though considering the job theyve handed you some job piecing together the tattered remnants hey its going to make you a busy little manager im busy now said the southpaw moving as if to pass on but garrity detained him youve got some positions to fill the feds got at you hard shame to see a team like the stockings shot to pieces youve got three or four bad holes and id like to help you you would sure ive got the very lads you need too mundy and pendexter both fast men they work together like two parts of a machine mundy covers the short field like maranville and pendexter sure can play that keystone cushion theyre the boys for you hows it happen you are willing to let go of them asked locke feeling some curiosity to know what lay behind this particular proposition well this is between us mind id just about as soon give up an eye as part with either mundy or pendexter but its easier to lose them than dispense with pressly my third sacker thats been the trouble with my team pressly loves mundy and pendexter as he loves aconite and they reciprocate you know what a feud like that means it knocks the bottom out of any team i cant fill presslys place but ive got a couple of youngsters that i can work in at short and second im not going through another season with those three scrapping you need the very players im willing to part with and there we are locke knew the man was not honest and that he was holding something up his sleeve in order to make him show his hand the southpaw asked what do you want for mundy and pendexter garrity considered for a minute well he answered slowly ill trade them with you for spider grant and cash lefty stared at him in amazement was it possible the man could think he was such a soft mark he laughed loudly you dont want much do you garrity the and cash was a capper man i wouldnt trade you spider grant for your whole team and cash the owner of the rockets scowled glaring at locke the corners of his thicklipped mouth drooping oh you wouldnt hey he growled huskily i suppose you think thats a joke not at all its serious i couldnt use the players you offer anyhow mundy does cover the short field like rabbit maranville sometimes but hes got a yellow streak and he quits pendexter knows how to play second and at the beginning of last season he hit like old sockalexis when the indian first broke into the league but the pitchers all got wise to his weak spot close and across the knees and from a threehundredandsixty batter he slumped into the twohundred class you were thinking of asking for waivers on him spider grant and cash for that pair i didnt imagine that even you could think me such a boob as he listened garritys face showed his anger his breath came short and quick his eyes were blazing with the fury of a wild animal have you got that all out of your system he asked when lefty stopped youre a wise gazabo aint you you know all about baseball and players and such things youve got a head bigger than a balloon but itll shrink give it time its plain you think you really know how to manage a team by the middle of the season and maybe considerable before that your head will be about the size of a bird shot and youll know a lot more then than you do now believe me the southpaw laughed in his face dont lose your temper he advised just because you couldnt put a raw one over on me go ahead and ask waivers on pendexter youll get mine i wouldnt carry him on my team if you agreed to pay his seasons salary for me my trade with frazer gave you the notion that you could pick another good man off me and weaken the stockings still more you fooled yourself that time garrity perhaps youll find out before long that you are fooling yourself in other ways what do you mean by that ill let you guess but just remember what bobby burns said about the bestlaid plans o mice and men with this locke passed on leaving the wrathy owner of the rockets glaring after him you poor fool muttered garrity ill have you whimpering like a whipped dog before im done with you your heads liable to roll into the basket before the season opens when the time comes ill lift my finger and the axll fall chapter xxviii the gage of war janet had let some friends know that she was in the city and had been invited out to a matinйe performance at one of the theaters lefty urged her to go thats better than sitting around the rooms alone he said and ill be so busy that i cant be with you so when shortly after lunch her friends appeared in a comfortable limousine they had little trouble in persuading her to join them kennedy dropped in a little later and locke told him of garritys proposed trade he sure did pick you for a mark said the exmanager you handed it to him straight about mundy and pendexter youre going to need a pair of fast boys to stop the holes but theres better men in the minors than those two youve got better ones on the reserve list besides that im doin a little free scouting on my own hook ive got friends scattered all over the country whenever an old player gone to the scraps has touched me up for a five or a ten ive stood for the touch asking him to keep his eyes open for anything good he might run across in the sticks that way ive got a good deal of inexpensive scouting done for me maybe itll be worth something in this pinch im going to interview an old friend over in jersey this afternoon im not worrying over players just now said lefty im anxious to get hold of stillman youll hear from him in time and weegman too what garrity knows weegman knows and so hes wise that youre right here be ready for him when he shows up kennedy had only just gone when weegman appeared he laughed when he saw locke but it was an ugly laugh what do you think youre trying to do he demanded didnt you get my telegram ordering you to report at the office of the club yes well why didnt you obey what did you mean by coming right through without even sending me word i had immediate business here in new york business i had business for you to attend to youve been doing a lot of things without consulting me why didnt you wait until i gave you the contracts for the old players there had been too much waiting and time was precious kennedy had plenty of blanks so i got them from him filled them out and sent them to the boys without further delay it was the proper thing to do dont tell me whats proper to do ill tell you that was the distinct understanding and you know it sent out the contracts did you well some of them ought to be coming back by this time theyve all come back what every one of them the federalsll get no more players off us this year weegman choked and the sound that came from his lips was not a laugh i havent seen anything of them they didnt come to the office no certainly not certainly not then where where are they i have them in my pocket lefty said it quietly not at all disturbed by the wrath of the outraged schemer it gave him much satisfaction to see bailey weegman shake and squirm in your pocket spluttered the rascal you had them returned to a different address confound your crust howd you ever have the nerve to do a thing like that lets see them hand them over locke made no move to obey i think ill keep them a while he answered coolly ill deliver them personally to be locked in the club safe for a moment it seemed that weegman would lose all control of himself and attack the southpaw you fool he raged do you think youre going to get by with this stuff ive made a pretty fair start at it so you never meant to stand by the private agreement between us when you signed as manager thats it eh there never was any private agreement between us i signed to handle the team but i did not agree to become your puppet you did you said that that i understood the conditions you had proposed but i did not say that i consented to them i had no intention of letting you dictate to me fool fool snarled weegman how long do you think youll last and you made that crazy trade with frazer do you know what ive done well ive notified frazer that the deal was irregular and wont be recognized by the club not a dollar of that five thousand will he ever get you know better than that the trade was legitimate and it will stand frazer can collect by law any other deal that i make will go through too whether you are aware of it at the time or not until charles collier himself takes away my authority im manager of the team with the legal right to carry out my own plans and i intend to do so i shall ask no advice from you and any suggestion you may make i shall look upon with distrust they fought it out eye to eye and presently weegmans gaze wavered before that of the unawed southpaw the man he had sought to make his blind tool was defying him to his face i see your finish he declared and i see yours countered locke you think youre a clever crook youre merely an instrument in the hands of a bigger and cleverer scoundrel who doesnt care a rap what happens to you if he can put his own miserable scheme over your partnership with him will be your ruin anyhow if you had half the sense you think you possess youd break with him without losing any time what are you talking about ive only planned to do my best to save a team that has been raided by the feds youre killing the last chance for the blue stockings tell it to sweeny exclaimed lefty youre trying to deliver the team into the hands of tom garrity deny it if you wish but it isnt necessary to lie youve played judas with collier be careful better take that back lefty laughed im ready to add more to it i havent told you half what i know if i were to do so youd realize what a dumb fool you have made of yourself you think youre wise to all that was planned but youve been let in on only a very little of it youll tear your hair when you get a squint at the foundation stone of this neat little conspiracy i i dont know what you mean thats right you dont but you will know in time youll be kept in the dark as long as it suits tom garrity whats garrity got to do with it locke smiled on him pityingly dont be childish weegman that sort of a bluff is too thin i was wise when i signed to manage the team in vain the man stormed threatened coaxed cajoled he could not bend lefty in the least and at last he realized that he had made a big blunder in estimating the character of the southpaw so its war between us is it he finally asked i have looked for nothing else answered the pitcher weegman snapped his fingers in lockes face all right he cried you would have it just you wait youre going to regret it well see how long you last and turning round he strode away muttering to himself chapter xxix the jaws of the trap lefty had defied weegman henceforth it was to be open war and he was glad of it what the rascal would attempt to do he did not know and cared less it did not seem likely that he could do much if anything that he had not already made preparations to do of course he might call collier into the affair and that should it bring the owner of the blue stockings back to his own country was something earnestly to be desired could he but get collier in private for twenty minutes locke felt sure he could make him realize that he was the victim of a conspiracy and that his trusted private secretary had sought to sell him out into the hands of a rival owner the telephone rang and thinking stillman was calling at last he hastened to answer it was not the reporters voice that he heard but he was informed that some one was speaking from the office of the blade and that after making a fruitless effort to get locke on the wire stillman had found it necessary to hustle away to keep an important appointment but where can i find him asked the disappointed pitcher how can i get hold of him he wants to talk to you as much as you do to him was the answer said it was absolutely necessary thats why he had me call you says he has something to tell you personally and privately hell try to be at mikes saloon thompson street near broome at three oclock if you get there first wait for him and dont fail to come for hell have important information got that straight yes but all right ive done my duty goodby there was a click and the wire was silent lefty looked at his watch as he left the phone it was twentytwo minutes to three just about time enough to make it comfortably he decided stillman must be on the track of something the subway being convenient he chose it instead of a taxi getting off at spring street five minutes ahead of time he found mikes saloon a somewhat disreputablelooking place when viewed from the exterior the neighborhood likewise seemed sinister however a reporters business thought locke carried him into all sorts of places within the saloon a single patron who looked like a vagrant was picking at the crumbs of a sickly free lunch in a dark corner a huskylooking redheaded bartender was removing an emptied beer schooner and mopping up the counter he surveyed the southpaw from head to foot with apparent interest im looking for a man named stillman who made an appointment to meet me here at three explained lefty i was to wait for him if i got here first jacks here stated the man behind the bar in a manner that bespoke considerable familiarity with the reporter came in three or four minutes ago reckon youre lefty locke thats right he told me you might come round hes in the back room walk right in the speaker jerked a heavy thumb toward a closed door at the far end of the bar at the sound of lockes name the vagrant who had been picking at the free lunch turned to look the famous pitcher over with apparent curiosity and interest lefty locke he mumbled huskily lemme shake hans ruther shake hans with lefty locke than any man livin locke pushed past him and placed his hand on the knob of the door the fellow followed insisting upon shaking hands and as lefty opened the door the vagrant staggered lurched against the pitcher and thrust him forward the door closing behind him with the snap of a spring lock it is remarkable how seldom any one ever heeds premonitions even as he opened that door lefty was aware that ever since the telephone call had come to him some subtle intuition thus far wholly disregarded had been seeking to sound a warning it had caused him to hesitate at last too late the push delivered by the vagrant had pitched him forward into the snare while the sound of the clicking spring lock notified him that his retreat was cut off through a dirty skylight above another door that probably opened upon a back alley some weak and sickly rays of daylight crept into the room a single gas jet suspended from the center of the cracked and smoky ceiling gave a feeble flickering light filling the corners with fluttering shadows the furniture in the room consisted of a table and a few chairs at the table three men were sitting drinking and smoking locke recovering from the push he had received stepped back against the closed door and looked at them hello said mit skullen dont hurry away lefty folks that come in by that door sometimes go out by the other one he was grinning viciously triumphantly the look upon his face was one of satisfaction and brutal anticipation and amply proclaimed his purpose skullens companions were tough characters fit associates and abettors of such a man that they were thugs of the lowest type who would not hesitate at any act of violence there could be no question one looked like a prize fighter who had gone to the bad his drinkinflamed face and bleary eyes advertising the cause of his downfall the other had the appearance of a coke fiend and the criminally bent habitual user of that drug has neither scruples nor fear of consequences locke regarded them in silence his pulses were throbbing somewhat faster yet he was cool and selfpossessed and his brain was keenly active he knew precisely what he was up against slipping one hand behind him he tried the knob of the door but as he had expected the door held fast skullen continued to grin gloatingly fancying that lockes inactivity was evidence that he was practically paralyzed by amazement and fear your friend stillman was too busy to come he said and so i kept the appointment for him maybe ill do just as well anyhow ill do for you he had risen to his feet and the light of the flickering gas jet played over his evil face lefty flashed another look around taking in the surroundings to his ears came the distant muffled sound of an elevated train rumbling along the trestle behind him in the front of the saloon all was still probably the door leading to the street was now also locked to prevent any one from entering and hearing any disturbance that might take place in the back room the jaws of the trap held him fast oh it aint any use to think about runnin away lefty croaked mit not a chance in the world i fixed it sos we could have our little settlement without any one buttin in to bother us you remember i told you i had a score to settle with you as locke spoke his voice was calm and steady and you engaged a pair of worthy pals to assist you youre a brave man skullen aw these lads are only here to see fair play thats all they wont mix in they wont have to last time we met you reckoned you put it all over me didnt you maybe i ought to thank you for keepin me from gettin a rotter on me hands for thats what you got in dummy jones youre welcome to that piece of cheese the southpaw made no retort he was measuring his chances against all three of the ruffians having no doubt that he must soon find himself pitted against such odds some baseball manager thats what you are scoffed mit taking keen delight in prolonging the suspense that he fancied must be getting the nerve of the intended victim youre rattlin around like a buckshot inside a bass drum a busy little person you are but you wont be so busy after i finish with you youll find it convenient to take a nice long rest in a hospital you fight a lot with your mouth mit said locke contemptuously go ahead an sail inter him skully urged the ruffian who looked like a brokendown prize fighter you been itchin fer him to show up so you could get inter action go to it plenty of time bill i enjoy seein him try to push that door down with his back wasnt he a mut to walk right into this im goin to change the look of his face so that his handsome wife wont know him when she sees him next he began to remove his coat and lefty knew the time for action had come for an instant his imagination had sought to unnerve him by presenting a vivid picture of himself as he would appear battered bleeding beaten up if the trio of thugs carried out their evil design but he put the vision aside promptly in cases where a smaller force is compelled to contend with a greater the advantage is frequently obtained through swift and sudden assault knowing this locke did not wait to be attacked he hurled himself forward with the spring of a panther and the force of a catapult chapter xxx one against three skullen in the act of removing his coat was caught unprepared before he could fling the garment aside locke was upon him aiming a wellmeant blow for the point of mits jaw skullen realized that it was no trifling thing to stop such a blow as that and he jerked his head aside as he dropped his coat the blow caught him glancingly and sent him staggering upsetting the chair from which he had recently risen locke grabbed the edge of the table and pitched it against the ruffians two companions who had hastily started to get up they fell over with the table on top of them lefty followed up his advantage and kept right on after skullen uttering a snarl of astonished rage the latter sought to grapple but the southpaw knew that he could not afford to waste time in that sort of a struggle whatever he did must be done swiftly effectively and thoroughly delay meant only disaster to him avoiding the clutching hands of his antagonist he struck mit on the neck below the ear staggering him again skullen had not looked for such a whirlwind assault he had fancied the trapped man would wait until set upon and he had believed he would have little trouble in beating lefty to the full satisfaction of his revengeful heart he was strong and ponderous and he could still strike a terrible blow but years had slowed him down his lack of exercise had softened his muscles his eye had lost its quickness while indulgence in drink and dissipation had taken the snap and ginger out of him he had not realized before how much he had deteriorated but now witnessing the lightninglike movements of lefty locke he began to understand and sudden apprehension overcame him bill snuff he roared get into it get at him you snails soak him his appeal to his companions was an unintentional admission that he suddenly realized he was no match for the man he had attempted to beat the flickering gaslight had given him a glimpse of a terrible blazing look in lockes eyes once in the ring he had seen a look like that in the eyes of an opponent who had apparently gone crazy and he had been knocked out by him scrambling up from beneath the capsized table bill and snuff responded lefty knew that in a moment they would take a hand in the fight and then the odds would be three against one and none of the three would hesitate at any brutal methods to smash the one once he was beaten down they would kick and stamp him into insensibility and later perhaps he would be found outside somewhere in the back alley with broken bones possibly maimed and disfigured for life the knowledge of what would happen to him if defeated made him doubly strong and fierce he endeavored to dispose of skullen first believing that by doing so he would have half the battle won skullens howls to his companions came to an abrupt termination like an irresistible engine of destruction locke had smashed through the defense of the ruffian and reaching him with a terrible blow sent him spinning and crashing into a corner of the room at the same instant bill joining in was met by a back kick in the pit of his stomach and with a grunt he doubled up clutching at his middle with both hands this gave the southpaw a chance to turn on snuff who had not so far shown any great desire to help his pals the creature had seemed physically insignificant sitting at the table but now in action he moved with the quickness of a wild cat in great contrast to the ponderousness of skullen and he had a weapon in his hand a blackjack the southpaw realized that of his three antagonists the creature springing at him like a deadly tarantula was the most to be dreaded insanity blazed in the fellows eyes he struck with the blackjack and lefty barely avoided the blow locke snapped out his left foot and caught the toe of the man plunging past him sending him spinning to the floor snuffs body struck a leg of the overturned table and broke it off short but the shock of the fall seemed to have absolutely no effect upon him for he rebounded from the floor like a rubber ball and was on his feet again in a flash panting and snarling get him snuff get him urged skullen coming up out of the corner where he had been thrown bill recovering his breath was straightening up all three of the thugs would be at the southpaw again in another jiffy lefty darted round the table avoiding the blackjack but realizing what a small chance he had with his bare hands he could not keep up the dodging long then he saw the broken table leg and snatched it up with an upward swing he landed a blow on snuffs elbow breaking his arm the blackjack flew to the smoky ceiling and then thudded back to the floor feeling sure he had checked his most dangerous antagonist lefty turned swinging the table leg and gave skullen a crack on the shoulder that dropped him to his knees he had aimed at mits head but the fellow had partially succeeded in dodging the blow another blow and the cry of alarm that rose to bills lips was broken short bill went down knocked senseless but snuff in spite of his broken arm was charging again he was seeking to get at the southpaw with his bare left hand the pitcher however had no compunction and he beat the madman down instantly groaning and clinging to his injured shoulder skullen retreated hastily to the wall staring in amazement and incomprehension at the breathless but triumphant man he had lured into this trap in all his experience he had never encountered such a fighter there being no one to stop him now lefty walked to the door leading into the alley found the key in the lock and turned it one backward look he cast at the two figures on the floor and the man who leaned against the wall clutching at his shoulder policemen seemed to be scarce in that neighborhood and locke found one with difficulty the officer listened incredulously to leftys story mikes is a quiet place he said didnt make a mistake about where this happened did you well come on well go round there and see about it the saloon was open when they reached it the redheaded bartender was serving beer to an italian and a swede the vagrant had vanished the man behind the bar listened with a wellsimulated air of growing indignation when the policeman questioned him he glared at the pitcher what are you tryin to put across bo he demanded fiercely you never were in here before in your life tryin to give my place a bad name nothin like what you say ever happened around here nice little yarn about bein decoyed here by some coves that tried to beat you up say officer is this a holdup ive told you what he told me said the policeman in my back room raged the barkeeper there aint been nobody in there for the last two hours come here an have a look he walked to the door and flung it open skullen and his partners were gone even the broken table had been removed there was nothing to indicate that a desperate encounter had taken place there a short time before you cleaned up in a hurry said lefty at this the barkeeper became still more furious and was restrained by the officer who scowled at the pitcher even as he held the other back you dont look like youd been hitting the pipe young feller growled the representative of the law but that yarn about being attacked by three men looks funny dont notice any marks of the scrap on you they didnt do you much damage did they say you must have had a dream locke saw the utter folly of any attempt to press the matter as long as you insist upon looking at it in that way officer he returned with a touch of contempt that he could not repress well have to let it go at that but ill guarantee that there are three men somewhere in this neighborhood wholl have to have various portions of their anatomies patched up by a doctor as the aftermath of that dream chapter xxxi light on a dark spot janet returned from the matinйe in a state of great excitement shes here she cried bursting in on lefty you were right about it ive seen her the southpaw gazed in surprise at the flushed face of his charming wife you mean virginia i tell you ive seen her when where as we were leaving the theater the lobby was crowded and we were in the back of the jam suddenly i saw her over the heads of the people she was just getting into an auto that was occupied by a handsome woman with snowwhite hair i wasnt mistaken it was virginia i couldnt get to her i tried to call to her but she didnt hear me ill never say you were mistaken again lefty somehow you seem always to be right locke scarcely heard these final words he was thinking rapidly a sudden ray of hope had struck upon him confound it where was stillman he sprang to the telephone and called the blade office again jack is the one best bet in this emergency he said as he waited for the connections to be made he got the reporter on the wire and stillman stated that he had not been in the office ten minutes and was about to call lefty could he come up to the great eastern right away sure the feeling of depression and helplessness that had threatened to crush locke began to fall away the door he had sought the one door by which there seemed any chance of passing on to success appeared to be almost within reach of his hand in her excitement at the theater janet had not possessed the presence of mind to call the attention of her friends to the snowyhaired woman but he knew that she could describe her with some minuteness stillman knows everybody lefty said it may be clew enough for him there was a rap on the door a messenger boy appeared with a telegram locke ripped it open and read jones sick team busted im busted signal of distress how about that five hundred i knead the dough dont shoot wire cash wiley trouble in another quarter muttered lefty handing the message over to janet how am i going to send him that money i cant force weegman to do it wiley has a right to demand it if i dont come across hell have a right to call the deal off but jones is sick said janet still it was a square bargain and i mean to stand by it jones is sick he was sick that day in vienna that was what ailed him he showed flashes of form when he braced up but he was too ill to brace up long ive wondered what was the explanation now i have it get him on his feet again and hell be all right ive got to hold my grip on jones somehow kennedy and stillman appeared at the great eastern together first lefty showed them the message from capn wiley over it the former manager screwed up his face casting a sharp look at his successor if you can trust this wiley he said send him two hundred and tell him to bring jones north as soon as jones can travel dont worry wileys outfit didnt come under the national agreement and jones name on a stockings contract ties him up but without drawing money from the club i havent the two hundred to spare now i cant draw ill fix that ive got two hundred or more that you can borrow after the training season opens youll pretty soon find out whether or not youve picked a dill pickle in your dummy pitcher janet told stillman about seeing virginia collier and gave him a fairly minute description of the woman virginia was with the reporter smoked a cigarette and considered i think i can find that lady with the snowwhite hair he said after a time leave it to me youll hear from me just as soon as i have something to tell with a promising air of confidence he took his departure leaving kennedy and locke to attend to the matter of wiley and mysterious jones of course the southpaw told the old manager all about skullens attempt at revenge but he did not do so within the hearing of janet whom he did not care to alarm the veteran chuckled over the result of the encounter in the back room of mikes saloon right from the first he said you was picked for something soft and easy i knew you was a fighter son but weegman and his gang didnt know it mebbe theyll begin to guess the fact pretty soon a few minutes after eight that evening stillman returned to the hotel and found locke waiting with what patience he could command the reporter wore a smile but he declined to answer questions mrs james a vanderpools private car is waiting for us at the door he said bring mrs hazelton lefty were going to make a call mrs vanderpool the widow of the traction magnate why what now dont waste time somebody else can gratify your curiosity a great deal better than i in fact i know so little about the facts at the bottom of this queer business that any explanations id make would be likely to ball things up the magnificent residence of the late james vanderpool was on upper fifth avenue they were ushered into a splendid reception room in a few minutes an aristocraticlooking woman with white hair entered her appearance bringing an involuntary exclamation to janets lips its the very one she breathed excitedly her fingers gripping leftys arm stillman introduced them to mrs vanderpool who met them graciously virginia will be down in a minute or two said the lady for reasons she has been staying with me since she returned from abroad ill let her tell you about it she regarded locke with frank interest yet in a manner that was not at all embarrassing for it plainly contained a great deal of friendliness virginia has told me much about you she stated it has never before been my good fortune to meet a professional baseball player my niece is very fond of mrs hazelton your niece exclaimed lefty virginia is my niece although i have scarcely seen her since she was a very small child here she is now virginia ran laughing to meet janet after the manner of girl friends they hugged and kissed each other really said virginia i should give you a good shaking for not answering all my letters your letters cried janet ive received only two letters from you in goodness knows how long i answered them and wrote you a dozen to which i got not a word of reply they gazed at each other in blank uncertainty for a minute or two and every trace of laughter died from miss colliers face her blue eyes began to flash then she said our letters were intercepted i cant remember whether i posted any of mine or not but i was so worried over father that it is doubtful if i did i let my maid attend to that she nearly always brought the mail to me too when i obtained positive proof that she was dishonest i discharged her even now its hard to believe she was so treacherous but why should she intercept our letters i dont understand virginia there has been a dreadful plot to ruin my father youll hardly believe it when i tell you i find it difficult to believe even now she shivered some of the color leaving her face it was necessary to cut us off from any true information of what was happening to his business interests letters from you might have given me an inkling janet and so they were secured and destroyed before they ever reached my hands other letters met the same fate mr weegman declared he wrote several which i know my father never got weegman exclaimed locke incredulously why he doctor dalmers warned mr weegman that father must not be disturbed or excited in the least over business matters he said such a thing might have a fatal effect on his heart still weegman says he wrote guardedly several times mildly hinting that things were not going right the liar whispered lefty to himself a bit in the background jack stillman was listening with keen interest thinking what a sensational special article the truth regarding this affair would make we were surrounded by wretches who had no compunction declared virginia collier it was i who first suspected them my father was too ill and the doctor kept him under opiates almost all the time so that his mind was dulled after i discharged annette i became suspicious of the nurse i spoke to doctor dalmers about her but he insisted that she was all right he insisted too earnestly i began to watch him without letting him realize i was doing so once or twice i found a chance to change fathers medicine for harmless powders and clear water and it seemed to me that he was better than when he took the medicine he was very weak and ill but his mind seemed clearer i kept the medicine away from him for two days in succession and got an opportunity to talk to him alone i succeeded in convincing him that the change of climate the baths and the stuff the doctor had given him were doing him no good at all in london there was a physician whom he knew and in whom he had confidence doctor robert fitzgerald i urged him to go to doctor fitzgerald but not to tell doctor dalmers of his intention and i begged him to refuse to take any more of doctor dalmers medicine we were in luchon and all the way to london i had to watch like a hawk to keep that medicine from father but i succeeded although i became extremely unpopular with doctor dalmers the minute we reached london i went to doctor fitzgerald and told him all that i suspected although he could not believe such a thing possible he accompanied me at once to our hotel doctor dalmers was taken by surprise for he had not anticipated this move when i discharged both him and the nurse he gave me a terrible look of course i could not have carried this through had not doctor fitzgerald been a close friend of my father dalmers called fitzgeralds action unprofessional and made threats but we got rid of him despite the fact that she was such a mere slip of a girl it was evident that she possessed brains and the courage and resourcefulness to use them mrs vanderpool seemed very proud of her lefty expressed his admiration i knew virginia continued that there must be something behind such a plot i did not believe dalmers had put it through merely to bleed my father while keeping him ill i was worried over the fact that we knew so very little concerning how fathers affairs were going over here what information we could get by cable or otherwise might be unsatisfactory so i determined to come home and investigate for myself i got fathers consent and i left him in doctor fitzgeralds care i intended to sail by the victoria but there was a misunderstanding about accommodations and i was forced to take a later ship i find fathers affairs involved and ive sent a statement of conditions as they appear to be of course she concluded smiling a little i was greatly relieved to learn from mr weegman that he felt sure he had blocked the contemptible efforts to smash the blue stockings he felt highly elated over signing lefty locke as manager miss collier said the pitcher did weegman offer an explanation of the raid on the team did he say who was at the bottom of it instantly a little cloud came to her face and an expression of regret appeared in her eyes yes she answered he told me at first i could not believe it stillman leaned forward listening his lips slightly parted locke turned toward him but turned back quickly with another question on his lips virginia was speaking again however i can scarcely believe it now she said sadly it seems too utterly impossible i cant imagine any one being such a scoundrel much less him but weegman has made sure he has the proof of course he has told you all about it lefty it was necessary that you should know her manner had grown deeply dejected what did weegman tell you asked the southpaw who did he say was responsible for what had happened to the blue stockings with an effort the girl answered franklin parlmee chapter xxxii one chance it was like a staggering blow while it confirmed stillmans theory that parlmee was the chief rascal of the conspiracy it shattered the supposition that weegman a blind dupe wholly unaware of the truth was being cleverly manipulated as an unconscious tool the foundation of that hypothesis melted away like sand before hydrolytic force locke turned again and looked at the reporter the latter standing like an image of stone was staring questioningly and incredulously at virginia collier he too realized that this confirmation of his belief had brought a portion of the postulation fluttering down like a house of cards and he was seeking a mental readjustment janet frozen with lips slightly parted and eyes wide was aware of it also she was about to speak impulsively when lefty detected her and made a repressing gesture miss collier felt that she knew the reason for the sudden silence that had fallen on every one and a faint flush crept back into her cheeks she appeared to be humiliated and ashamed as well as sorrowful i understand she said in a low tone how it must seem to you to hear me say such a thing about mr parlmee i have trusted him i believed in him even when my father was losing faith and confidence i clung to my own faith and it hasnt been easy to abandon it even in the face of proof my conscience or something taunts me occasionally i ive cried over it and ive fought against it i havent dared see him since my return since i found out the truth for i knew i should listen to him and believe in him in spite of everything i wanted to face him and accuse him but weegman persuaded me to wait he said it would merely hasten the crash if we let the scoundrels know they were suspected the scoundrels exclaimed locke then he told you that more than one was concerned he claims that a man named garrity is operating in conjunction with franklin parlmee another staggerer to virginia weegman had accused garrity mutely the southpaw appealed to stillman the reporters forehead was puckered in a puzzled manner he caught leftys glance and shook his head slowly when did he name garrity miss collier he asked when he called on me today this afternoon was the answer he has been at work trying to get at the truth locke improved the opportunity to whisper in janets ear keep still dont say a word now although she did not understand why he wished her to keep silent she nodded he had been right in other matters it was best to let him have his way in this my niece has been very much upset said mrs vanderpool it has practically made her ill she hasnt felt much like seeing people and therefore mr weegmans advice to keep quiet was easy to follow weegman had urged virginia to remain in obscurity not to let her friends know she was in new york that was evident he had convinced her that by doing so she could best assist him in his pretended task of trapping the conspirators and while she kept quiet those conspirators were hastening to carry through the work they had planned miss collier said lefty do you think it would be possible for your father to come home at once do you think he is strong enough to stand the voyage if he can do so he had better come he should be here now i dont know she replied give me his address and let me communicate with him locke urged he should know something of the truth at least virginia was persuaded for mrs vanderpool agreed that it was the best course to pursue the southpaw was elated he felt that at last he was getting a grip that would enable him to accomplish something if he could baffle the rascals now it would be a feat worth while mrs vanderpool was called away to the telephone auntie has been very kind to me in spite of her quarrel with father said virginia when the lady had left the room they have not spoken to each other for years it is so ridiculous so childish for a brother and sister who have been devoted both are stubborn and yet aunt elizabeth is the kindest gentlest woman in the world she lost an only daughter and she says i seem to fill the vacant place she has made me feel very much at home then she began chatting with janet about things of mutual interest locke joined stillman who had walked to the far end of the room this weegman is either a fool or much cleverer than we thought him said the reporter swiftly in a low tone i dont believe hes a fool how have you figured it out lefty questioned it was a mistake to think him not wise to parlmee and why if he is hand in glove with garrity did he tell her that garrity was concerned in the miserable business he told her that today yes why didnt he tell her before weegman is in town have you seen him the pitcher told of his meeting with both weegman and garrity and how he had defied them stillmans face cleared a little look here locke that fellow weegman will double cross any one you put him next to the fact that you were wise to garrity the whole bunch must know that collier has fired his crooked doctor of course dalmers notified them after talking with you weegman began to realize that the whole plot might fall through he lost no time in beginning to hedge his bets hes trying to fix it so that hell fall safe if the business blows up but why did he tell her of parlmee we thought he didnt know about that im not as sure about parlmee as i was admitted the reporter frankly weegman has been trying to blacken him to her right along ill own up now that it was an anonymous communication that first put me on the track of parlmee there have been others of the same sort tending to incriminate him ive wondered where they came from now i think i know weegman is the answer by jove exclaimed lefty you believe it was he who directed suspicion toward parlmee in the first place youve got me that being the case instead of being a dupe this weegman has put something over that we didnt suspect him of hes after colliers daughter and it would help him if he could turn her against his rival lockes face cleared his relief was evident this is all speculation said the reporter hastily dont be too quick to accept it as a settled fact parlmees behavior has been suspicious enough to require some explaining from him perhaps he can clear it up we know weegman has tried to put the blue stockings on the blink and were dead certain he hasnt knowingly done so as the assistant of parlmee now how do you figure on that parlmees innocent as i fancied weegman is the chief rascal stillman smiled in which case hes beginning to find himself caught in a quicksand and hes trying to save himself by climbing out over his pal garrity hell swear he had no finger in it garrity wont dare accuse weegman of being an accomplice for by doing that he would acknowledge that there was a conspiracy weegman is in no danger in that direction of anything further than such private revenge as garrity may seek to take lefty turned back and approached virginia and janet addressing the former miss collier i want you to promise me that for the present at least youll say nothing to bailey weegman about having seen and talked with me the girl looked surprised i was just proposing that janet should leave the hotel and stay here with me i know my aunt will approve i approve anything you may wish my dear said mrs vanderpool reлntering the room it would give me great pleasure to have mrs hazelton visit us and remain as long as possible locke looked doubtful for should that arrangement be carried out janet might easily be led into telling virginia more than it seemed advisable for her to know at the present time but mrs vanderpool made her invitation most cordial and janet gave him a beseeching glance he wavered weegman calls here if he should janets hand fell on his arm trust me she urged significantly you cant hope to keep him long in the dark for the present if he calls ill not be in evidence youre so busy that i see very little of you during the day anyway so he was won over janet returned with him to the hotel to gather up the belongings she would need and stillman accompanied them lefty made his wife understand how desirous it was to keep weegman blinded as long as possible explaining that he feared miss colliers indignation would lead her into betraying everything should she learn the whole truth regarding the twofaced schemer if you can get collier home quickly enough locke said stillman theres a chance that you may be able to spike the enemys guns even at this late hour im going to make a swift play for that chance returned lefty chapter xxxiii one in a million the clerk of the great eastern surveyed with interest the swarthy small man in the bright green suit and the plaid raglan overcoat who leaned an elbow on the desk and jauntily twirled a light cane puffing at an excellent havana cigar beyond a modicum of a doubt you have me your excellency said the stranger im the real thing the only and original capn wiley it is frequently embarrassing to be encumbered by fame and my modesty often compels me to travel incognito but just now having a yearning desire to hobnob with my old college chump lefty locke i am blushingly compelled to reveal my identity when lefty learns that i am here he will fly like a bird to greet me notify one of yon brassbuttoned minions to inform him of my immediate proximity mr locke is out at present said the man behind the desk winking slyly at a fellow clerk but if you will leave your card if one isnt sufficient ill leave the whole pack of fiftytwo it is my habit to carry a deck with me for emergencies perchance however you can tell me when lefty is liable to return at that moment locke coming in saw the sailor and hurried forward the marine marvel teetered to meet him beaming broadly they shook hands and locke drew the sailor toward two vacant chairs jones questioned lefty as they sat down where is he how is he hes right here in this little old burg was the answer nothing short of his demise could have prevented me from keeping my agreement to deliver him to you he is on the mend and it is probable that hell soon be as frisky and formidable as ever but i have qualms i fear greatly that something has happened to cause jonesy to lose interest in baseball forever and for aye were i in his boots id go on one long spree that would reach from here to hongkong and even farther hold your breath lefty and hold it hard jones has come into a modest little fortune of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or thereabouts quite a joke said the pitcher i dont blame you for doubting me in your place id have made a remark a shade more violent but the seal of voracity is on my lips i didnt know it when i saw you last but at that time he had practically sold his interest in his alaska possessions i have stated the sum he received for his share in that pretty bit of property enough to keep him in pin money for some time replied lefty still skeptical if he could be induced to use it for his own wants he could dodge becoming a pauper for quite a while but lefty you cant guess what hes going to do with it excuse me while i sigh i have argued and pleaded until my fingers became tonguetied but ive failed to move him from his fixed determination he is going to give every dollar of that money away of course locke thought that wiley was drawing the long bow as usual i hope he wont overlook his friends when he passes it around he said smiling his friends wont get a dollar declared wiley hes going to give it to his enemies this was too much for the southpaw lets cut the comedy he urged the sailor gave him a chastening look it isnt comedy its tragedy lefty he believes it his duty he believes he is bound as a man of honor to do it listen and i will elucidate did you ever hear of the central yucatan rubber company i dont think so well it was a fraudulent concern that flourished like a green bay tree some seven or eight years ago and withered like a fragile plant when the government got after it for fraudulent use of the mails like many such grafting stockselling companies it had a dummy board of officers who appeared to be in control while the real rogues who were harvesting the coin kept in the background jones was president of that company he believed it to be on the level and he had invested some of his own money superficially all he had in it when the government got busy jones was indicted as the head of the concern he was thought to be the originator of the scheme the real crook had fixed it so that he seemed to be one of the innocent victims and he helped swear jones into prison jones got five years he served his time at last locke was impressed he had never seen wiley so serious for once the flippant and superficial manner of the swarthy little man had been discarded his flamboyant style of speech had been dropped ordinarily he gave one the impression that he was gleefully fabricating now of a sudden the listener was convinced that he was hearing the naked truth it explained the atmosphere of somber sadness the appearance of brooding over a great injustice which had infolded the mysterious dumb pitcher of the wind jammers for jones lefty felt a throb of genuine sympathy with the unclothed eye i can perceive that you get me the sailor continued you can imagine how you would feel if you had been sent to the jug for five years as punishment for a crime perpetrated by somebody else what if the one who concocted the scheme and benefited by it swore your liberty away and escaped scotfree himself it was monstrous exclaimed the pitcher precisely so in prison jones took a foolish oath he registered a vow to pay back every dollar to those who had lost their good money in that fake rubber company he didnt know how he was going to do it but he was determined that he would in a way they were his enemies for they had helped prosecute him the courts had adjudged him guilty and he felt that he could never hold up his head as an honest man until those who had been defrauded got the last cent of coin back in some way he must acquire a huge amount of filthy lucre and acquire it honestly he dreamed of gold mines when the prison spat him forth he made his way up into alaska there his dream came true for with his partners he located and developed a great mine they could have sold out a dozen times but never for a sum that would permit jones to accomplish his purpose with his share of the price so he held on and at last a syndicate made an offer that was sufficient jones was notified by his partners he accepted but not until the deal was put through and he had the certified check for his interest in his clutches did he breathe a word of it to any one then he told me he was sick but his success helped cure him he was eager to hurry north and set into action the machinery for distributing that money to the rubber companys victims at this very moment he is interviewing a reputable firm of lawyers and giving them instructions to proceed about the work he can supply a full list of the persons defrauded theyll get back what they lost and jones will find himself poor again but satisfied leftys eyes were shining in these days of the great american idea of grafting and fraud he said a man with a conscience like jones is one in ten thousand say rather one in a million mate i have reviled him extemporaneously i have told him that he is a fool im honest myself when its absolutely necessary but to part with a scandalous sum like two hundred and fifty thousand without being positively compelled to do so oh pardon me while i sob a man with such principles and jones ability to pitch will not come to grief he has a job before him with the blue stockings wiley shook his head apprehension percheth upon me lefty jones has accomplished the great purpose of his life it was what fired him and spurred him on i regret to elucidate that since that money came to him he has displayed no interest whatever in baseball when i sought to make him talk about it he wouldnt even wigwag a finger on the subject something seems to tell me that hell never again ascend the mound and shoot the horsehide over the pentagon chapter xxxiv weegmans proposal for four days weegman had not troubled locke four days during which lefty sought in vain to get some word from charles collier his cablegrams remained unanswered at the time when he had felt the most sanguine he seemed to find himself blocked again he did not seek to delude himself with the belief that silence on the part of the conspirators meant they were inactive doubtless they were at work harder than ever what were they doing he confessed that he would give a great deal to know then weegman reappeared his manner was ingratiating his chuckle seemed intended to be genial and friendly a private room where we can talk without the slightest chance of being overheard thats what we want he said your own room should be all right as long as your wife is stopping with miss collier and her aunt he knew about that how long he had known was a question locke felt like turning the rascal down flatly he was on the verge of doing so when something led him to decide differently perhaps a little patience and cleverness would enable him to get an inkling of what the enemy was doing he took weegman to his room and shot the door bolt behind them when they had entered thats right said colliers private secretary we dont want to be interrupted by anybody i took a great deal of pains that no one who knew me should see me come here garrity mustnt get wise he ordered me to keep away from you laughing he flung himself down on a chair garrity cried lefty astonished at the confession then you admit that you are taking your orders from him he thinks i am was the grinning answer perhaps hell find himself fooled if you and i can get together im sure he will locke stifled a sense of repulsion the man was more detestable than ever it did not appear possible and yet he still seemed to think that locke would accept a proposal from him how do you mean asked the pitcher with masterly selfcontrol get together how i hope you realize you cant do anything alone the combination against you is too strong and too much had been done before you began to get wise to the situation let me tell you now that i didnt expect this affair would go as far as it has when i entered into it the creature was shamelessly acknowledging his participation in the plot chuckling as he did so lefty waited of course pursued weegman youve been aware for some time of my unbounded admiration and regard for miss collier the old man favored me but i couldnt bring her round to do so i decided it would be necessary for me to accomplish a coup if i could apparently save her father from ruin she might alter her views out of gratitude she might marry me im a man who gets what he wants by hook or crook garrity approached me with a scheme i listened to it i believed i saw a way to turn that scheme to my own advantage with virginia but ill tell you now that it never was my intention to put charles collier wholly on the blink at that time even i didnt know how badly involved he was even while he told the truth in a way weegman was lying in the effort to palliate his act to some degree his conscience was warped to such an extent that he seemed to believe there could be an excuse for the milder forms of conspiracy and crime in a bungling way he was actually making a bid for lockes sympathy you must have known of the dastardly arrangement with a crooked doctor to keep mr collier drugged into apparent illness and detain him in europe beyond reach of the friends who might tell him weegman who got to that doctor and bought him up not i was the denial i didnt have the money was it garrity of course garrity had something on dalmers who was concerned in some mighty shady practices at one time but he told me that dalmers was simply going to keep watch of the old man i didnt know anything about the drugging business when i found that out i was mad as blazes the southpaw fought to prevent his lips from curling with scorn and to suppress a look of triumph in his eyes whats your proposition to me weegman the selfacknowledged rascal seemed to hesitate youre sure no one can hear us he asked his eyes roving around the room you can see that were quite alone weegman drummed nervously on the arm of his chair im sorry this thing has gone so far he protested i didnt look for it to at first i got involved and couldnt back out in fact garrity threatened me when i showed signs of holding back that he declared with an attempt at indignant resentment made me sore without my help in the beginning he never could have done a thing now he thinks hes got me foul hes going to gobble everything well see about that perhaps it isnt too late to stop him maybe we can do it you and i id like to show him so the rascals had quarreled over the division of the spoils as rascals so often do and now one of them was ready to betray the other if he could do so without disaster to himself at the same time he hoped to make an alliance with lefty by which he might reap some actual benefit from his underhanded work suddenly locke thought of another man who had been suspected of complicity how about parlmee he asked where does he fit in did garrity send him over the pond to wrench the control of the blue stockings from collier i dont know what garrity has been doing with parlmee weegman confessed it was natural that i should want to turn virginia against parlmee but i swear i didnt know he was in this thing when i got the idea of making her believe he was that was an inspiration that came to me all of a sudden i had to keep her away from him i faked up some evidence she refused to believe at first then by jove i found out that garrity and parlmee were really up to something theyve had dealings leftys heart which had bounded high for a moment sank heavily after all could it be true that two cleverer scoundrels had combined to work weegman as a dupe had the confirmation of this fact helped weegman to make up his mind to go back on garrity was it not possible that this was the real cause of the quarrel between the worthy pair the southpaw continued to lead the other on what is garritys scheme what has he told you that he proposed to do unless collier receives outside assistance garritys got him cornered collier has met reverses generally garrity has got hold of a certain amount of blue stocking stock collier still holds enough to keep the balance of power but he wont hold it long if he tries to his interest in the northern can company will go to glory garrity has placed himself in a position to shake the old man out of that concern if collier loses that hes broke a pauper he cant hang on because he hasnt the ready resources hell have to sell his blue stockings stock to save northern can if he had a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ready cash he could pull through itll take half of that to oust garrity from northern can and the other half is needed for the team garrity will put it up to him tomorrow in the meantime can you and i raise one hundred and fifty thousand you and i cried lefty not a dollar not a cent how will garrity put it up to collier tomorrow collier is in philadelphia cut in weegman sharply the southpaw stared thunderstruck philadelphia you mean that hes in this country he arrived today and took a train at once for philadelphia i cabled him to come and to keep his coming secret those were garritys orders locke sat down heavily still staring at weegman chapter xxxv the shattering stroke that explained it now lefty knew why he had received no answer to his cablegrams before the first was sent charles collier was on the high seas bound for america he was home and garrity held him in the hollow of his hand on the morrow the owner of the blue stockings was to feel the crushing grip of the triumphant schemer weegman watched the southpaws face noting the look of consternation upon it suddenly snapping his fingers he began speaking again thats why i came to you locke whats done must be done quickly after eleven oclock tomorrow it will be too late you know what that means for you garrity hates you like poison and you wont last any time after he gets control you can raise that money a hundred and fifty thousand dollars youre crazy you can do it and save yourself if youll do the right thing by me ill tell you how to raise the needful together well hand garrity his bumps what do you say is it a go he sprang up and approached his hand extended locke rose and faced him the scorn and contempt upon his face would have withered a man less calloused weegman recoiled a little and his hand dropped to his side weegman lefty said youre the most treacherous scoundrel i ever had the bad fortune to meet youre just about as trustworthy as a rattlesnake heaven knows i need money and i certainly want to hold my job but not even to save my own father and mother from being turned out of the home that has sheltered them so long would i enter into any sort of partnership with you a look of astonished wrath contorted weegmans features and a snarling laugh broke from his lips you poor fool he cried youve thrown away your last chance i did think you would know enough to save yourself but i see you havent an atom of sense in your head there was something almost pitying in the smile lefty gave him something also that caused the man a sudden throb of apprehension youre the fool weegman returned the southpaw you have confessed the whole rotten scheme you have betrayed yourself and your fellow conspirator garrity bah the rascal flung back snapping his fingers again what good will it do you ill deny everything you cant prove a thing i was careful that there should be no witnesses no one to hear a word that passed between us locke grabbed him by the wrist and snapped him round with a jerk facing one wall of the room and i he cried took care that every word we uttered should be heard by two reliable persons i set the trap for garrity but i have been unable to decoy him into it you walked into it unbidden look with two strides he reached a dresser that stood against the wall he seized it and moved it aside with one finger he pointed to a small square black object that clung to the wall two feet from the floor look he commanded again weegman stared uncomprehendingly yet with the perspiration of dread beginning to bead his forehead what is it he asked huskily a dictograph answered lefty i had it put in two days ago when you met me a short time ago and asked for a private interview i started to turn you down then i saw old jack kennedy and stillman the reporter in the background they gave me a signal thirty seconds after we entered this room they were in the room adjoining listening by means of that dictograph to every word that passed between us weve got you weegman and weve got garrity too criminal conspiracy is a rather serious matter all the defiance had faded from bailey weegmans eyes he trembled he could not command even a ghost of a laugh he started violently and gasped as there came a sharp rap on the door they want to take another good look at you to clinch matters so that they can make oath to your identity said locke swiftly crossing and flinging the door open come in gentlemen kennedy and stillman entered weegman cowered before them they regarded him disdainfully you beaned him all right lefty said the exmanager he wasnt looking for the curve you put over that time the reporter paused to light a cigarette after your arrest weegman he said i advise you to make haste to turn states evidence its your only chance to escape doing a nice long bit in the stone jug he turned closed the door behind him and shot the bolt again in the meantime he added i think we can persuade you to refrain from warning garrity regarding what is coming to him shortly after eleven oclock tomorrow looking feeble and broken charles collier sat at his desk in the office of the blue stockings baseball club on the desk before him lay the books of the club and a mass of letters and documents at one end of the desk sat tom garrity smoking a big cigar and looking like a napoleon who dreamed of no impending waterloo he was speaking his words and manner were those of a conqueror you can see how the land lies collier you should have sold out your interest in the team before going abroad weegman made a mess of it today you cant realize fifty cents on the dollar ive offered you my northern can stock for your holdings thats the best way out for you now if you refuse youll lose northern can and the team both better save one by sacrificing the other collier wearily lifted a protesting hand you dont have to repeat it garrity i know youve got me cornered im merely waiting for weegman he promised to be here at eleven its past that hour without asking permission garrity reached for the desk phone ill call in my lawyers he said theyll be here in a few minutes before he could lift the receiver from the hook the door swung open and weegman came in pale and shrinking at his heels followed locke kennedy and stillman with an astonished exclamation garrity put the instrument down i hope we dont intrude said lefty smiling on the startled owner of the rockets having learned from weegman of this little business meeting we decided to drop in im very glad to see that you have arrived home in time mr collier too late sighed the hopeless man at the desk too late youre just in time to witness the transference of the blue stockings to garrity on the contrary returned the southpaw easily we have come to purchase mr garritys blue stockings stock at the prevailing price likewise his interest in northern can garrity rose his face purple with wrath a tremendously explosive ejaculation burst from his lips what in blazes do you mean he roared just what i have said locke answered calmly since arriving in town i have made arrangements for this little business matter i have opened an account with the new market national by depositing a certified check for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars which is more than enough to make the purchases mentioned mr colliers attorney will arrive in ten minutes or so to see that everything is done in a legal manner but you cant buy a dollars worth of my holdings in either concern you may think so now im sure youll change your mind in a few moments it is also reported that for the good of the game youll get out of organized baseball have you brought a copy of the second edition of the morning blade with you stillman show it to mr garrity please the reporter drew a newspaper from his pocket opened it passed it to garrity one finger indicated a halfcolumn article with headlines garrity to get out will dispose of his interests in the rockets and abandon baseball hints of a conspiracy to wreck the blue stockings garritys eyes glared his breath whistled through his nostrils his wrath was volcanic somebodyll pay for that he shouted swinging his ponderous fist above his head like a sledge hammer whats it mean it means answered stillman that more will follow giving complete details of the conspiracy unless you decide to quit baseball for the good of the game ill institute a suit for libel no you wont you wont dare weve got the goods on you let me tell you how it happened he did so with unrepressed satisfaction and the mans air of bluster gradually evaporated as he listened but he gave weegman a murderous look the door swung open again and a sharpfaced little man entered briskly heres mr colliers attorney said lefty now we can get down to real business chapter xxxvi the test of mysterious jones the unscrupulous garrity had long been a menace to organized baseball but such efforts as had been made to jar him loose from it had failed at last however like a remorseless hunter he was caught in a trap of his own setting twist and squirm as he might the jaws of that trap held him fast even when the representatives of a syndicate met him by agreement to take the team over at a liberal price he showed a disposition to balk stillman was there he handed garrity a carbon copy of a special article giving a complete and accurate statement of the conspiracy if you own the rockets tomorrow morning said the reporter that will appear word for word in the blade criminal action against you will be begun at the same time upon the following day garrity was no longer interested in the rockets the blade had put over a scoop by being the first paper to announce that garrity would retire it could have created a tremendous sensation by publishing the inside facts relative to the method by which he had been forced out but organized baseball was under fire and already the suspicious public was beginning to regard it askance the menacing federals were making no end of trouble the cry of rottenness was in the air through the publication of the story thousands of hasty unthinking patrons could be led to believe that square and honest though it seemed to be on the field the game was really rotten at the core stillman knew how that would hurt and he loved the game he was tempted to the limit but he resisted not even his editor ever found out just how much he knew and suppressed on the usual date the blue stockings went south for spring training old jack kennedy was among the very first to arrive at the camp he had been engaged as coach and trainer the newspapers had a great deal to say about how the federals had taken the heart out of the once great machine collier controlled few of them seemed to think that locke the new manager could repair the damages in less than a year or two he would do well they declared if he could keep the club well up in the second division for it was said that lefty himself would pitch no more and the rest of his staff filled out with new men and youngsters must necessarily be weak and wabbly occasionally a new deafmute pitcher jones was mentioned as showing great speed but who had ever heard of jones of course he would lack the experience and steadiness a pitcher must possess to make good in fast company behind the bat the stockings seemed all right for brick king would be there still it was strange that frazer had let king go old ben was wise as the serpent and he certainly had his reasons the stockings were trying out a young fellow named sheridan in center field but surely herman brock was worth a dozen ordinary youngsters some of the papers had a habit of speaking of all youngsters as ordinary jack keeper who seemed slated to hold down the far cushion for the stockings was also a youngster frazer had not seen fit to retain in the few games he had played with the wolves keeper had made a good showing but the general impression was that the manager had not considered him quite up to big league caliber various other youngsters who had been farmed out to the minors were being used at second and short and two of them blount and armstrong from the cotton states league seemed to be the most promising but what an infield it would be with threefourths of the players unripened the interest of the fans who read this sort of dope turned to the wolves who were almost universally picked as probable pennant winners all this was natural enough the wolves had held together before the federal raids better than any team in the league certainly no one who knew much about baseball would have chosen the blue stockings in advance for a comeback but in baseball and nearly everything else there is no fixed rule of reckoning that cant be smashed plenty of oldtimers will say this is not so just as men assert that there is nothing like luck in the game the stockings continued to attract little attention during their tour north although they won exhibition games regularly and with ease jones pitched in some of these games locke did not all the same no day passed that lefty failed to get out and warm up with his pitchers dillon reilley lumley and savage were the old flingers left with the staff the glass arm brigade it was called savage was regarded as the only one of the quartet who possessed the stamina to work through nine hard innings counting him out the team would have to depend on young twirlers of course locke warmed up merely from habit and as an example for the others otherwise he would try to pitch sometimes in a game the season opened with the blue stockings playing against the dodgers away from home mysterious jones pitched and shut the dodgers out his team making five runs behind him even that created no more than a slight flurry for the dodgers were chronic subcellar champions jones had speed and it had dazzled them but wait until he went up against real batters reilley and lumley taking turns on the mound succeeded in handing the dodgers the second game by a onesided score savage went in and captured the third contest but pink dillon dropped the fourth after making a fight for it up to the eighth inning if that was the best the blue stockings could get an even break when facing the habitual tailenders what would happen to them when they tackled the wolves in the series to follow the crowd turned out loyally to witness the opening game on the home grounds but even the most hopeful among the fans permitted their courage to be tinged with pessimism they were in that state of mind that would lead their sympathies easily to turn to the opposition true they hailed lefty cheerfully and encouragingly from the stands and bleachers but they could not have the faith in him as a manager that they had had as a pitcher they were stirred however by the sight of old jack kennedy and they gave him a rousing cheer it warmed the cockles of the veterans heart he doffed his cap to them frazer came over from the visitors bench and shook hands with locke and kennedy i hope said ben that youre going to give us a crack at that dummy speed merchant today lefty we want to see if he is a real pitcher coming forth from the home teams dugout a swarthy small man who wore knickerbockers and a wrist watch overheard these words bolieve me frazy said capn wiley youll never ask for him again with any great avidity after you face him once i hope youll excuse me for butting in and making that statement without the polite formality of an introduction to you but i am so impetuous im the proud party who sold jonesy to lefty shortly after that little transaction i was unnecessarily worried lest he should decide to abandon baseball but he has just informed me that having succeeded in giving away the last of an infinitesimal fortune of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars he is now excruciatingly happy and ready to follow pitching as a profession frazer looked the odd character over tolerantly so youre the party who bunkoed lefty are you he laughed youre very much in evidence before the game begins but i fancy itll be difficult to find you with a microscope when its finished if locke has the nerve to pitch your dummy wonder i think ill start him on the hill at any rate said the manager of the blue stockings apparently wiley started to cheer but checked himself abruptly ill conserve my vocal cords he tittered i doubt not that my voice will be frazzled to a husky whisper before the contest terminates take a tip from me mr frazer and send your premier twirler on to the firing line smoke jordans the only pitcher you have who can make the game interesting with jones pastiming for the stockings jordan has asked to pitch returned ben but i have half a dozen others who would do just as well locke was passing in front of the section occupied by the newspaper men when stillman called to him i dont see your wife here nor miss collier said the reporter i looked for both to be on hand for the opening game on the home grounds unfortunately neither was able to get here although they planned to do so explained lefty you know they have been spending the past eight weeks in southern california with virginias aunt who invited them to accompany her and would not take no for an answer theyll be on hand tomorrow however stillman leaned toward the wire netting and lowered his voice has collier ever caught on to the fact that the sister with whom he had quarreled furnished the capital to save him from going to smash he questioned not yet its still a mystery to him how i was able to come forward at the psychological moment with that loan the newspaper man laughed softly he came near passing away from heart failure that day he was shocked almost as much as garrity but in a different way his manner changed to one of concern youre going to use jones today arent you think you have any chance to win unless ive made a mistake in estimating that man replied locke it wont be his fault if we lose but itll be a test for the whole team as well as jones it was truly a test a pitcher who was merely a speed merchant could not have lasted three innings against the wolves who ate speed it was not long however before the anxious crowd and the visiting team as well began to realize that the mute twirler had something more than speed now and then he mixed in a sharpbreaking curve and his hopper was something to wonder at something that made the batters mutter and growl as they slashed at it fruitlessly but best of all besides coolness and judgment he had that prime essential of all pitchers control with neverfailing and almost monotonous regularity he seemed to put the sphere precisely where he tried to put it in brick king jones had a valuable aid king knew his old associates if any one of them had a batting weakness he was aware of it and not once during the game did jones question a signal given him by king what brick called for he pitched and put it just where it should be put with such rifle accuracy the work of the man behind the bat seemed easy save for the fact that occasionally jones smokers appeared almost to lift the backstop off his feet but king held them as if his big mitt had been smeared with paste smoke jordan was also in fine fettle it was a pitchers battle with the crowd watching and gasping and waiting for the break it must not be imagined that the wolves did not hit the ball at all but for a long time they could not seem to hit it safely and for four innings they could not get a runner on in the first of the fifth however a cracking single and two errors permitted them to score an unearned run if i know what im talking about said ben frazer we had no license to get that tally now smoke youve got to hold em if that dummy dont crack ill acknowledge that hes a real pitcher ill hold em promised jordan but he couldnt keep his promise in the sixth with one down king beat out an infield hit reaching the initial sack safely by an eyelash he stole second on the catcher for whom he had been discarded to the disgust of frazer the crowd seemed to forget that jones was deaf and dumb for it entreated him to smash one out and capn wiley from his place in a box howled louder than any ten others combined jones drove a long fly into left but the fielder was there and king was held at second hyland followed jordan a bit unsteady bored him in the ribs then keeper another wolf discard came up and singled to right field covering ground like a hundred yards sprinter king registered from second on that hit tying the score up the crowd went wild the blue stockings and mysterious jones had the fans with them after that constantly that great gathering rooted for another run just one more hyland perished on third when spider grant popped weakly if possible the wolves were fiercer than ever in the first of the eighth they got jones into a hole again through another hit and errors which peopled the corners with not a man down then jones won a roaring ovation from the standing multitude by striking out three men in succession the game was settled in the last of the ninth and again jack keeper figured in the play he had reached second with one out when grant hit into the diamond the ball took an amazingly high bound the shortstop went for it at the same time seeing keeper scudding for third and realizing that it would be impossible to get him at that sack the moment he got the ball the shortstop whipped it to first catching grant by a foot there was a shout of warning keeper had not stopped at third over the sack at full speed he had flashed and on toward home the first baseman lined the sphere to the catcher who had leaped into position keeper hit the dirt twisting his body away from the catcher who got the ball and jabbed at him a fraction of a second too late keeper had accomplished a feat that is the desire of every base runners heart he had scored from second on an infield out and that performance gave the blue stockings the game while the crowd was still shouting its rejoicing capn wiley found frazer shaking hands with lefty i demand an apology croaked wiley barely able to speak i apologize said frazer your dummy can pitch but a team with one real pitcher is scarcely equipped to cut much figure in the race wholl you use tomorrow locke i am thinking of trying out another one of our uncertainties answered the southpaw with an enigmatical smile chapter xxxvii the return of lefty the work of patching up his team and whipping it into shape had kept lefty locke busy pretty nearly every minute of his time while awake since the beginning of the training season with that task before him and knowing how little attention he could spare for janet he had raised no objections when she had asked to accompany mrs vanderpool and virginia on the california trip while he was not foolish enough to believe that the reconstructed team could become a pennant contender that season he did have hopes of finishing in the first division which under the circumstances would be a triumph indeed he had found janets letters interesting enough but his concentration on other matters had prevented him from giving them much thought once they were read through she had told him of the rumor that bailey weegman having been lucky in escaping prosecution for his part in the conspiracy had started some sort of mailorder business and was said to be taking in money hand over fist far more interesting however although almost as quickly forgotten was the gossip about virginia and franklin parlmee having returned from his hasty and fruitless voyage across the pond parlmee had felt not only injured but outraged by the treatment he had received it was impossible for virginia honestly to deny that she had been led to distrust him and by weegman that cut the deepest she had kept him ignorant of the fact that she had returned home thus allowing him to go rushing off to europe in an attempt to find her that had been his sole purpose he had been in no way concerned with garrity in a scheme to wrest the control of the blue stockings from collier it was true that having come into a limited inheritance he had purchased two or three small lots of the clubs stock his judgment had told him that the price to which it had dropped made it a good investment garrity had been anxious to get hold of that stock he had pursued parlmee and endeavored to buy the certificates at a price that would have permitted the holder of them to realize a good profit but what garrity had wanted so badly parlmee had considered still more valuable and he had refused to part with a single share a sense of injury on one side and shame and false pride on the other had prevented complete reconciliation between parlmee and virginia but janet wrote that miss collier was not happy although she made a brave pretense of being so once or twice janet had detected her alone crying lefty had practically forgotten about these things until on that second day of battle with the wolves only a few minutes before the game was to begin he looked toward the club owners box occupied as he knew by virginia and janet and made the discovery that franklin parlmee was likewise there the southpaw stood still in his tracks and stared smiling for he saw that parlmee and virginia were chatting and laughing while janet watched them with an expression of complete satisfaction and pleasure patched it up at last thank goodness muttered locke i think ill keep away until after this game is over plenty of time to congratulate them then he had been warming up as usual but today it was observed that he did so alone with brick king many of those who took note of this were led to speculate jack stillman saw it and smiled wisely to himself a crowd bigger than that of the previous day had turned out the blue stockings unexpected opening victory over the wolves was the cause perhaps that had been no more than a flash in the pan but the fans wanted to see for themselves deep down in the hearts of most of them was a sprouting hope that it presaged something more practice was over the home team was spreading out on the field and making ready scrappy betts first man up for the visitors was swinging two bats prepared to drop one of them and advance to the plate the announcer lifted his megaphone and sitting forward on the edges of their seats the crowd strained their ears to catch the names of the battery men whos going to pitch for us was the question they had been asking through the megaphone came the usual hoarse bellow for an instant it seemed to strike the great gathering dumb then a wild yell of astonishment and delight went up everywhere in the stands and on the bleachers fans turned to their neighbors and shouted locke its lefty good old lefty yow yeee they rose as one person and roared at him in a mighty chorus when he walked out to the mound if he believed in himself if he had the courage to go in there against frazers hungry wolves they believed in him the umpire adjusted his wind pad betts dropped one bat and came forward pausing a moment a few feet from the plate while locke sent two or three across to get the range that good left arm swung free and unrestrained without a single sign to indicate that there had ever been anything the matter with it smiling the southpaw nodded to betts as king pulled on the wire cage you can patch up crockery lefty old man said scrappy as he stepped into the box but you never can make it as good as new then having tried to work the portsider to the limit he finally whaled out a safety i knew it he cried from first bluff wont mend a busted wing old boy whether or not locke was nervous he passed the next man the cheering of the crowd died away disappointment and apprehension brought silence save for the confident chattering of the wolf coachers and the attempted encouragement of the players behind the southpaw hope began to sicken and wilt cool and unruffled brick king smiled an accidental hit and a pass wont count in the result today he said show kipper the ball in your hand he wont see it again kipper whiffed three times without making as much as a foul tip the crowd began to wake up again herman brock sauntered out frazer had given him bob courtneys position in the batting order the cleanup place no man knew herman better than lefty and the efforts of the german were quite as futile as those of kipper the crowd was cheering again as brock retired disgustedly confidence had been restored suddenly oh you lefty was the cry youre there locke easily forced the following batter to pop to the infield he had settled into his stride if he could keep it up the shouting throng knew he had indeed come back as strong as ever already they were telling one another what that meant with three firststring pitchers like lefty and jones and savage the team would have a fighting chance the principal question was whether the southpaw could go the distance not only did lefty make it but as the game progressed he seemed to take it more and more easily the desperate wolves could not get at him effectively he certainly had everything he had ever possessed some claimed that he had more his arm showed no sign of weakening but he used his head quite as much as his arm with the support of a catcher who also had brains and who worked with him perfectly he made the snarling snapping wolves appear about as dangerous as tame rabbits before the ninth inning was reached he knew that in brick king he had found the one catcher with whom he could do the best work of his career the blue stockings won by a score of two to nothing what fortune the season brought them in their fight for the pennant is told in the following volume of the big league series which is entitled guarding the keystone sack the moment it was over locke made a dash for the clubhouse getting away from the furiously rejoicing fans who came pouring down upon the field jones was there ahead of him as he panted in lefty saw the man of mystery standing in a peculiar attitude not far from the closed door of charles colliers office he seemed to be listening involuntarily the southpaw paused and listened himself from beyond the door came the sound of voices he heard a man speaking and then suddenly another man who appeared to be both excited and distressed then he saw jones spring like a panther toward that door and hurl it open astonished lefty quickly followed jones into the office they burst in upon four persons two of them who looked like plainclothes officers seemed to have a third in charge this man was desperately and wildly appealing to charles collier it was bailey weegman its an outrage i tell you weegman was crying its a lie i havent used the mails to defraud i learned an hour ago that officers were after me on that charge and i hurried to you mr collier they followed me here you must help me i served you you served me a crooked turn interrupted collier coldly you have your nerve to come to me lockes eyes were on jones the mans face was aflame with triumph and joy and fathomless satisfaction he flung out his hand his finger pointing like a pistol at weegman hanson gilmore he cried in a terrible voice the mute had spoken frozen with amazement lefty saw weegman twist round saw a light of terror come into his eyes saw him cower and cringe pale as death and shaking like an aspen you swore away my liberty you dog the voice of jones rang through the room you were the scoundrel who conceived the central yucatan rubber company and profited by it when the prison doors closed upon me i swore id never speak again until every dollar you had taken from the victims of that concern was paid back until you were brought to book for your crime ive kept that vow ive searched for you determined to bring you to justice somehow now you have brought justice upon yourself crouching like a creature stung by the pitiless lashing of a whip the accused wretch appealed chokingly to the officers who had arrested him dont let him touch me look at his eyes hes mad keep him off take me away yes take him away said jones and if he doesnt get a prison sentence for this last piece of work ill keep after him until hes punished for his other crimes take him away said charles collier with a wave of his hand tottering weakly the rascal who had met retribution at last was led out the rejoicing players were stripping for their showers locke and jones appeared among them boys said lefty let me introduce martin bowman whom you have hitherto known as jones for reasons of his own he made a vow never to speak until a certain thing should happen happily events now make it possible for him to talk for which i am very thankful said martin bowman quietly they stared at him in limitless astonishment at last spider grant said well this game today was enough to make a deafanddumb man talk eph the colored rubber touched
