lives of the poets addison etc introduction johnsons lives of the poets were written to serve as introductions to a trade edition of the works of poets whom the booksellers selected for republication sometimes therefore they dealt briefly with men in whom the public at large has long ceased to be interested richard savage would be of this number if johnsons account of his life had not secured for him lasting remembrance johnsons life of savage in this volume has not less interest than the lives of addison and swift between which it is set although savage himself has no right at all to be remembered in such company johnson published this piece of biography when his age was thirtyfive his other lives of poets appeared when that age was about doubled he was very poor when the life of savage was written for cave soon after its publication we are told mr harte dined with cave and incidentally praised it meeting him again soon afterwards cave said to mr harte you made a man very happy tother day how could that be asked harte nobody was there but ourselves cave answered by reminding him that a plate of victuals was sent behind a screen which was to johnson dressed so shabbily that he did not choose to appear johnson struggling found savage struggling and was drawn to him by faith in the tale he told we have seen in our own time how even an arthur orton could find sensible and good people to believe the tale with which he sought to enforce claim upon the tichborne baronetcy savage had literary skill and he could personate the manners of a gentleman in days when there were still gentlemen of fashion who drank lied and swaggered into midnight brawls i have no doubt whatever that he was the son of the nurse with whom the countess of macclesfield had placed a child that died and that after his mothers death he found the papers upon which he built his plot to personate the child extort money from the countess and her family and bring himself into a profitable notoriety johnsons simple truthfulness and ready sympathy made it hard for him to doubt the story told as savage told it to him but when he told it again himself though he denounced one whom he believed to be an unnatural mother and dealt gently with his friend he did not translate evil into good through all the generous and kindly narrative we may see clearly that savage was an impostor there is the heart of johnson in the noble appeal against judgment of the selfrighteous who have never known the harder trials of the world when he says of savage those are no proper judges of his conduct who have slumbered away their time on the down of plenty nor will any wise man easily presume to say had i been in savages condition i should have lived or written better than savage but johnson who made large allowance for temptations pressing on the poor himself suffered and overcame the hardest trials firm always to his duty true servant of god and friend of man richard savages whole public life was built upon a lie his base nature foiled any attempt made to befriend him and the friends he lost he slandered richard steele among them samuel johnson was a friend easy to make and difficult to lose there was no money to be got from him for he was altogether poor in everything but the large spirit of human kindness savage drew largely on him for sympathy and had it although johnson was too clearsighted to be much deceived except in judgment upon the fraudulent claims which then gave rise to division of opinion the life of savage is a noble piece of truth although it rests on faith put in a fraud h m addison joseph addison was born on the st of may at milston of which his father lancelot addison was then rector near ambrosebury in wiltshire and appearing weak and unlikely to live he was christened the same day after the usual domestic education which from the character of his father may be reasonably supposed to have given him strong impressions of piety he was committed to the care of mr naish at ambrosebury and afterwards of mr taylor at salisbury not to name the school or the masters of men illustrious for literature is a kind of historical fraud by which honest fame is injuriously diminished i would therefore trace him through the whole process of his education in in the beginning of his twelfth year his father being made dean of lichfield naturally carried his family to his new residence and i believe placed him for some time probably not long under mr shaw then master of the school at lichfield father of the late dr peter shaw of this interval his biographers have given no account and i know it only from a story of a barringout told me when i was a boy by andrew corbet of shropshire who had heard it from mr pigot his uncle the practice of barringout was a savage licence practised in many schools to the end of the last century by which the boys when the periodical vacation drew near growing petulant at the approach of liberty some days before the time of regular recess took possession of the school of which they barred the doors and bade their master defiance from the windows it is not easy to suppose that on such occasions the master would do more than laugh yet if tradition may be credited he often struggled hard to force or surprise the garrison the master when pigot was a schoolboy was barred out at lichfield and the whole operation as he said was planned and conducted by addison to judge better of the probability of this story i have inquired when he was sent to the chartreux but as he was not one of those who enjoyed the founders benefaction there is no account preserved of his admission at the school of the chartreux to which he was removed either from that of salisbury or lichfield he pursued his juvenile studies under the care of dr ellis and contracted that intimacy with sir richard steele which their joint labours have so effectually recorded of this memorable friendship the greater praise must be given to steele it is not hard to love those from whom nothing can be feared and addison never considered steele as a rival but steele lived as he confesses under an habitual subjection to the predominating genius of addison whom he always mentioned with reverence and treated with obsequiousness addison who knew his own dignity could not always forbear to show it by playing a little upon his admirer but he was in no danger of retort his jests were endured without resistance or resentment but the sneer of jocularity was not the worst steele whose imprudence of generosity or vanity of profusion kept him always incurably necessitous upon some pressing exigence in an evil hour borrowed a hundred pounds of his friend probably without much purpose of repayment but addison who seems to have had other notions of a hundred pounds grew impatient of delay and reclaimed his loan by an execution steele felt with great sensibility the obduracy of his creditor but with emotions of sorrow rather than of anger in he was entered into queens college in oxford where in the accidental perusal of some latin verses gained him the patronage of dr lancaster afterwards provost of queens college by whose recommendation he was elected into magdalen college as a demy a term by which that society denominates those who are elsewhere called scholars young men who partake of the founders benefaction and succeed in their order to vacant fellowships here he continued to cultivate poetry and criticism and grew first eminent by his latin compositions which are indeed entitled to particular praise he has not confined himself to the imitation of any ancient author but has formed his style from the general language such as a diligent perusal of the productions of different ages happened to supply his latin compositions seem to have had much of his fondness for he collected a second volume of the musae anglicanae perhaps for a convenient receptacle in which all his latin pieces are inserted and where his poem on the peace has the first place he afterwards presented the collection to boileau who from that time conceived says tickell an opinion of the english genius for poetry nothing is better known of boileau than that he had an injudicious and peevish contempt of modern latin and therefore his profession of regard was probably the effect of his civility rather than approbation three of his latin poems are upon subjects on which perhaps he would not have ventured to have written in his own language the battle of the pigmies and cranes the barometer and a bowlinggreen when the matter is low or scanty a dead language in which nothing is mean because nothing is familiar affords great conveniences and by the sonorous magnificence of roman syllables the writer conceals penury of thought and want of novelty often from the reader and often from himself in his twentysecond year he first showed his power of english poetry by some verses addressed to dryden and soon after published a translation of the greater part of the fourth georgic upon bees after which says dryden my latter swarm is scarcely worth the hiving about the same time he composed the arguments prefixed to the several books of drydens virgil and produced an essay on the georgics juvenile superficial and uninstructive without much either of the scholars learning or the critics penetration his next paper of verses contained a character of the principal english poets inscribed to henry sacheverell who was then if not a poet a writer of verses as is shown by his version of a small part of virgils georgics published in the miscellanies and a latin encomium on queen mary in the musae anglicanae these verses exhibit all the fondness of friendship but on one side or the other friendship was afterwards too weak for the malignity of faction in this poem is a very confident and discriminate character of spenser whose work he had then never read so little sometimes is criticism the effect of judgment it is necessary to inform the reader that about this time he was introduced by congreve to montague then chancellor of the exchequer addison was then learning the trade of a courtier and subjoined montague as a poetical name to those of cowley and of dryden by the influence of mr montague concurring according to tickell with his natural modesty he was diverted from his original design of entering into holy orders montague alleged the corruption of men who engaged in civil employments without liberal education and declared that though he was represented as an enemy to the church he would never do it any injury but by withholding addison from it soon after in he wrote a poem to king william with a rhyming introduction addressed to lord somers king william had no regard to elegance or literature his study was only war yet by a choice of ministers whose disposition was very different from his own he procured without intention a very liberal patronage to poetry addison was caressed both by somers and montague in appeared his latin verses on the peace of ryswick which he dedicated to montague and which was afterwards called by smith the best latin poem since the aeneid praise must not be too rigorously examined but the performance cannot be denied to be vigorous and elegant having yet no public employment he obtained in a pension of three hundred pounds a year that he might be enabled to travel he stayed a year at blois probably to learn the french language and then proceeded in his journey to italy which he surveyed with the eyes of a poet while he was travelling at leisure he was far from being idle for he not only collected his observations on the country but found time to write his dialogues on medals and four acts of cato such at least is the relation of tickell perhaps he only collected his materials and formed his plan whatever were his other employments in italy he there wrote the letter to lord halifax which is justly considered as the most elegant if not the most sublime of his poetical productions but in about two years he found it necessary to hasten home being as swift informs us distressed by indigence and compelled to become the tutor of a travelling squire because his pension was not remitted at his return he published his travels with a dedication to lord somers as his stay in foreign countries was short his observations are such as might be supplied by a hasty view and consist chiefly in comparisons of the present face of the country with the descriptions left us by the roman poets from whom he made preparatory collections though he might have spared the trouble had he known that such collections had been made twice before by italian authors the most amusing passage of his book is his account of the minute republic of san marino of many parts it is not a very severe censure to say that they might have been written at home his elegance of language and variegation of prose and verse however gain upon the reader and the book though awhile neglected became in time so much the favourite of the public that before it was reprinted it rose to five times its price when he returned to england in with a meanness of appearance which gave testimony of the difficulties to which he had been reduced he found his old patrons out of power and was therefore for a time at full leisure for the cultivation of his mind and a mind so cultivated gives reason to believe that little time was lost but he remained not long neglected or useless the victory at blenheim spread triumph and confidence over the nation and lord godolphin lamenting to lord halifax that it had not been celebrated in a manner equal to the subject desired him to propose it to some better poet halifax told him that there was no encouragement for genius that worthless men were unprofitably enriched with public money without any care to find or employ those whose appearance might do honour to their country to this godolphin replied that such abuses should in time be rectified and that if a man could be found capable of the task then proposed he should not want an ample recompense halifax then named addison but required that the treasurer should apply to him in his own person godolphin sent the message by mr boyle afterwards lord carlton and addison having undertaken the work communicated it to the treasury while it was yet advanced no further than the simile of the angel and was immediately rewarded by succeeding mr locke in the place of commissioner of appeals in the following year he was at hanover with lord halifax and the year after he was made under secretary of state first to sir charles hedges and in a few months more to the earl of sunderland about this time the prevalent taste for italian operas inclined him to try what would be the effect of a musical drama in our own language he therefore wrote the opera of rosamond which when exhibited on the stage was either hissed or neglected but trusting that the readers would do him more justice he published it with an inscription to the duchess of marlborough a woman without skill or pretensions to skill in poetry or literature his dedication was therefore an instance of servile absurdity to be exceeded only by joshua barness dedication of a greek anacreon to the duke his reputation had been somewhat advanced by the tender husband a comedy which steele dedicated to him with a confession that he owed to him several of the most successful scenes to this play addison supplied a prologue when the marquis of wharton was appointed lord lieutenant of ireland addison attended him as his secretary and was made keeper of the records in birminghams tower with a salary of three hundred pounds a year the office was little more than nominal and the salary was augmented for his accommodation interest and faction allow little to the operation of particular dispositions or private opinions two men of personal characters more opposite than those of wharton and addison could not easily be brought together wharton was impious profligate and shameless without regard or appearance of regard to right and wrong whatever is contrary to this may be said of addison but as agents of a party they were connected and how they adjusted their other sentiments we cannot know addison must however not be too hastily condemned it is not necessary to refuse benefits from a bad man when the acceptance implies no approbation of his crimes nor has the subordinate officer any obligation to examine the opinions or conduct of those under whom he acts except that he may not be made the instrument of wickedness it is reasonable to suppose that addison counteracted as far as he was able the malignant and blasting influence of the lieutenant and that at least by his intervention some good was done and some mischief prevented when he was in office he made a law to himself as swift has recorded never to remit his regular fees in civility to his friends for said he i may have a hundred friends and if my fee be two guineas i shall by relinquishing my right lose two hundred guineas and no friend gain more than two there is therefore no proportion between the good imparted and the evil suffered he was in ireland when steele without any communication of his design began the publication of the tatler but he was not long concealed by inserting a remark on virgil which addison had given him he discovered himself it is indeed not easy for any man to write upon literature or common life so as not to make himself known to those with whom he familiarly converses and who are acquainted with his track of study his favourite topic his peculiar notions and his habitual phrases if steele desired to write in secret he was not lucky a single month detected him his first tatler was published april and addisons contribution appeared may tickell observes that the tatler began and was concluded without his concurrence this is doubtless literally true but the work did not suffer much by his unconsciousness of its commencement or his absence at its cessation for he continued his assistance to december and the paper stopped on january he did not distinguish his pieces by any signature and i know not whether his name was not kept secret till the papers were collected into volumes to the tatler in about two months succeeded the spectator a series of essays of the same kind but written with less levity upon a more regular plan and published daily such an undertaking showed the writers not to distrust their own copiousness of materials or facility of composition and their performance justified their confidence they found however in their progress many auxiliaries to attempt a single paper was no terrifying labour many pieces were offered and many were received addison had enough of the zeal of party but steele had at that time almost nothing else the spectator in one of the first papers showed the political tenets of its authors but a resolution was soon taken of courting general approbation by general topics and subjects on which faction had produced no diversity of sentiments such as literature morality and familiar life to this practice they adhered with few deviations the ardour of steele once broke out in praise of marlborough and when dr fleetwood prefixed to some sermons a preface overflowing with whiggish opinions that it might be read by the queen it was reprinted in the spectator to teach the minuter decencies and inferior duties to regulate the practice of daily conversation to correct those depravities which are rather ridiculous than criminal and remove those grievances which if they produce no lasting calamities impress hourly vexation was first attempted by casa in his book of manners and castiglione in his courtier two books yet celebrated in italy for purity and elegance and which if they are now less read are neglected only because they have effected that reformation which their authors intended and their precepts now are no longer wanted their usefulness to the age in which they were written is sufficiently attested by the translations which almost all the nations of europe were in haste to obtain this species of instruction was continued and perhaps advanced by the french among whom la bruyeres manners of the age though as boileau remarked it is written without connection certainly deserves praise for liveliness of description and justness of observation before the tatler and spectator if the writers for the theatre are excepted england had no masters of common life no writers had yet undertaken to reform either the savageness of neglect or the impertinence of civility to show when to speak or to be silent how to refuse or how to comply we had many books to teach us our more important duties and to settle opinions in philosophy or politics but an arbiter elegantiarum a judge of propriety was yet wanting who should survey the track of daily conversation and free it from thorns and prickles which tease the passer though they do not wound him for this purpose nothing is so proper as the frequent publication of short papers which we read not as study but amusement if the subject be slight the treatise is short the busy may find time and the idle may find patience this mode of conveying cheap and easy knowledge began among us in the civil war when it was much the interest of either party to raise and fix the prejudices of the people at that time appeared mercurius aulicus mercurius rusticus and mercurius civicus it is said that when any title grew popular it was stolen by the antagonist who by this stratagem conveyed his notions to those who would not have received him had he not worn the appearance of a friend the tumult of those unhappy days left scarcely any man leisure to treasure up occasional compositions and so much were they neglected that a complete collection is nowhere to be found these mercuries were succeeded by lestranges observator and that by lesleys rehearsal and perhaps by others but hitherto nothing had been conveyed to the people in this commodious manner but controversy relating to the church or state of which they taught many to talk whom they could not teach to judge it has been suggested that the royal society was instituted soon after the restoration to divert the attention of the people from public discontent the tatler and spectator had the same tendency they were published at a time when two parties loud restless and violent each with plausible declarations and each perhaps without any distinct termination of its views were agitating the nation to minds heated with political contest they supplied cooler and more inoffensive reflections and it is said by addison in a subsequent work that they had a perceptible influence upon the conversation of that time and taught the frolic and the gay to unite merriment with decency an effect which they can never wholly lose while they continue to be among the first books by which both sexes are initiated in the elegances of knowledge the tatler and spectator adjusted like casa the unsettled practice of daily intercourse by propriety and politeness and like la bruyere exhibited the characters and manners of the age the personages introduced in these papers were not merely ideal they were then known and conspicuous in various stations of the tatler this is told by steele in his last paper and of the spectator by budgell in the preface to theophrastus a book which addison has recommended and which he was suspected to have revised if he did not write it of those portraits which may be supposed to be sometimes embellished and sometimes aggravated the originals are now partly known and partly forgotten but to say that they united the plans of two or three eminent writers is to give them but a small part of their due praise they superadded literature and criticism and sometimes towered far above their predecessors and taught with great justness of argument and dignity of language the most important duties and sublime truths all these topics were happily varied with elegant fictions and refined allegories and illuminated with different changes of style and felicities of invention it is recorded by budgell that of the characters feigned or exhibited in the spectator the favourite of addison was sir roger de coverley of whom he had formed a very delicate and discriminate idea which he would not suffer to be violated and therefore when steele had shown him innocently picking up a girl in the temple and taking her to a tavern he drew upon himself so much of his friends indignation that he was forced to appease him by a promise of forbearing sir roger for the time to come the reason which induced cervantes to bring his hero to the grave para mi sola nacio don quixote y yo para el made addison declare with undue vehemence of expression that he would kill sir roger being of opinion that they were born for one another and that any other hand would do him wrong it may be doubted whether addison ever filled up his original delineation he describes his knight as having his imagination somewhat warped but of this perversion he has made very little use the irregularities in sir rogers conduct seem not so much the effects of a mind deviating from the beaten track of life by the perpetual pressure of some overwhelming idea as of habitual rusticity and that negligence which solitary grandeur naturally generates the variable weather of the mind the flying vapours of incipient madness which from time to time cloud reason without eclipsing it it requires so much nicety to exhibit that addison seems to have been deterred from prosecuting his own design to sir roger who as a country gentleman appears to be a tory or as it is gently expressed an adherent to the landed interest is opposed sir andrew freeport a new man a wealthy merchant zealous for the moneyed interest and a whig of this contrariety of opinions it is probable more consequences were at first intended than could be produced when the resolution was taken to exclude party from the paper sir andrew does but little and that little seems not to have pleased addison who when he dismissed him from the club changed his opinions steele had made him in the true spirit of unfeeling commerce declare that he would not build an hospital for idle people but at last he buys land settles in the country and builds not a manufactory but an hospital for twelve old husbandmen for men with whom a merchant has little acquaintance and whom he commonly considers with little kindness of essays thus elegant thus instructive and thus commodiously distributed it is natural to suppose the approbation general and the sale numerous i once heard it observed that the sale may be calculated by the product of the tax related in the last number to produce more than twenty pounds a week and therefore stated at oneand twenty pounds or three pounds ten shillings a day this at a halfpenny a paper will give sixteen hundred and eighty for the daily number this sale is not great yet this if swift be credited was likely to grow less for he declares that the spectator whom he ridicules for his endless mention of the fair sex had before his recess wearied his readers the next year in which cato came upon the stage was the grand climacteric of addisons reputation upon the death of cato he had as is said planned a tragedy in the time of his travels and had for several years the four first acts finished which were shown to such as were likely to spread their admiration they were seen by pope and by cibber who relates that steele when he took back the copy told him in the despicable cant of literary modesty that whatever spirit his friend had shown in the composition he doubted whether he would have courage sufficient to expose it to the censure of a british audience the time however was now come when those who affected to think liberty in danger affected likewise to think that a stageplay might preserve it and addison was importuned in the name of the tutelary deities of britain to show his courage and his zeal by finishing his design to resume his work he seemed perversely and unaccountably unwilling and by a request which perhaps he wished to be denied desired mr hughes to add a fifth act hughes supposed him serious and undertaking the supplement brought in a few days some scenes for his examination but he had in the meantime gone to work himself and produced half an act which he afterwards completed but with brevity irregularly disproportionate to the foregoing parts like a task performed with reluctance and hurried to its conclusion it may yet be doubted whether cato was made public by any change of the authors purpose for dennis charged him with raising prejudices in his own favour by false positions of preparatory criticism and with poisoning the town by contradicting in the spectator the established rule of poetical justice because his own hero with all his virtues was to fall before a tyrant the fact is certain the motives we must guess addison was i believe sufficiently disposed to bar all avenues against all danger when pope brought him the prologue which is properly accommodated to the play there were these words britains arise be worth like this approved meaning nothing more than britons erect and exalt yourselves to the approbation of public virtue addison was frighted lest he should be thought a promoter of insurrection and the line was liquidated to britains attend now heavily in clouds came on the day the great the important day when addison was to stand the hazard of the theatre that there might however be left as little hazard as was possible on the first night steele as himself relates undertook to pack an audience this says pope had been tried for the first time in favour of the distressed mother and was now with more efficacy practised for cato the danger was soon over the whole nation was at that time on fire with faction the whigs applauded every line in which liberty was mentioned as a satire on the tories and the tories echoed every clap to show that the satire was unfelt the story of bolingbroke is well known he called booth to his box and gave him fifty guineas for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator the whigs says pope design a second present when they can accompany it with as good a sentence the play supported thus by the emulation of factious praise was acted night after night for a longer time than i believe the public had allowed to any drama before and the author as mrs porter long afterwards related wandered through the whole exhibition behind the scenes with restless and unappeasable solicitude when it was printed notice was given that the queen would be pleased if it was dedicated to her but as he had designed that compliment elsewhere he found himself obliged says tickell by his duty on the one hand and his honour on the other to send it into the world without any dedication human happiness has always its abatements the brightest sunshine of success is not without a cloud no sooner was cato offered to the reader than it was attacked by the acute malignity of dennis with all the violence of angry criticism dennis though equally zealous and probably by his temper more furious than addison for what they called liberty and though a flatterer of the whig ministry could not sit quiet at a successful play but was eager to tell friends and enemies that they had misplaced their admirations the world was too stubborn for instruction with the fate of the censurer of corneilles cid his animadversions showed his anger without effect and cato continued to be praised pope had now an opportunity of courting the friendship of addison by vilifying his old enemy and could give resentment its full play without appearing to revenge himself he therefore published a narrative of the madness of john dennis a performance which left the objections to the play in their full force and therefore discovered more desire of vexing the critic than of defending the poet addison who was no stranger to the world probably saw the selfishness of popes friendship and resolving that he should have the consequences of his officiousness to himself informed dennis by steele that he was sorry for the insult and that whenever he should think fit to answer his remarks he would do it in a manner to which nothing could be objected the greatest weakness of the play is in the scenes of love which are said by pope to have been added to the original plan upon a subsequent review in compliance with the popular practice of the stage such an authority it is hard to reject yet the love is so intimately mingled with the whole action that it cannot easily be thought extrinsic and adventitious for if it were taken away what would be left or how were the four acts filled in the first draft at the publication the wits seemed proud to pay their attendance with encomiastic verses the best are from an unknown hand which will perhaps lose somewhat of their praise when the author is known to be jeffreys cato had yet other honours it was censured as a partyplay by a scholar of oxford and defended in a favourable examination by dr sewel it was translated by salvini into italian and acted at florence and by the jesuits of st omers into latin and played by their pupils of this version a copy was sent to mr addison it is to be wished that it could be found for the sake of comparing their version of the soliloquy with that of bland a tragedy was written on the same subject by des champs a french poet which was translated with a criticism on the english play but the translator and the critic are now forgotten dennis lived on unanswered and therefore little read addison knew the policy of literature too well to make his enemy important by drawing the attention of the public upon a criticism which though sometimes intemperate was often irrefragable while cato was upon the stage another daily paper called the guardian was published by steele to this addison gave great assistance whether occasionally or by previous engagement is not known the character of guardian was too narrow and too serious it might properly enough admit both the duties and the decencies of life but seemed not to include literary speculations and was in some degree violated by merriment and burlesque what had the guardian of the lizards to do with clubs of tall or of little men with nests of ants or with stradas prolusions of this paper nothing is necessary to be said but that it found many contributors and that it was a continuation of the spectator with the same elegance and the same variety till some unlucky sparkle from a tory paper set steeles politics on fire and wit at once blazed into faction he was soon too hot for neutral topics and quitted the guardian to write the englishman the papers of addison are marked in the spectator by one of the letters in the name of clio and in the guardian by a hand whether it was as tickell pretends to think that he was unwilling to usurp the praise of others or as steele with far greater likelihood insinuates that he could not without discontent impart to others any of his own i have heard that his avidity did not satisfy itself with the air of renown but that with great eagerness he laid hold on his proportion of the profits many of these papers were written with powers truly comic with nice discrimination of characters and accurate observation of natural or accidental deviations from propriety but it was not supposed that he had tried a comedy on the stage till steele after his death declared him the author of the drummer this however steele did not know to be true by any direct testimony for when addison put the play into his hands he only told him it was the work of a gentleman in the company and when it was received as is confessed with cold disapprobation he was probably less willing to claim it tickell omitted it in his collection but the testimony of steele and the total silence of any other claimant has determined the public to assign it to addison and it is now printed with other poetry steele carried the drummer to the playhouse and afterwards to the press and sold the copy for fifty guineas to the opinion of steele may be added the proof supplied by the play itself of which the characters are such as addison would have delineated and the tendency such as addison would have promoted that it should have been ill received would raise wonder did we not daily see the capricious distribution of theatrical praise he was not all this time an indifferent spectator of public affairs he wrote as different exigences required in the present state of the war and the necessity of an augmentation which however judicious being written on temporary topics and exhibiting no peculiar powers laid hold on no attention and has naturally sunk by its own weight into neglect this cannot be said of the few papers entitled the whig examiner in which is employed all the force of gay malevolence and humorous satire of this paper which just appeared and expired swift remarks with exultation that it is now down among the dead men he might well rejoice at the death of that which he could not have killed every reader of every party since personal malice is past and the papers which once inflamed the nation are read only as effusions of wit must wish for more of the whig examiners for on no occasion was the genius of addison more vigorously exerted and on none did the superiority of his powers more evidently appear his trial of count tariff written to expose the treaty of commerce with france lived no longer than the question that produced it not long afterwards an attempt was made to revive the spectator at a time indeed by no means favourable to literature when the succession of a new family to the throne filled the nation with anxiety discord and confusion and either the turbulence of the times or the satiety of the readers put a stop to the publication after an experiment of eighty numbers which were actually collected into an eighth volume perhaps more valuable than any of those that went before it addison produced more than a fourth part and the other contributors are by no means unworthy of appearing as his associates the time that had passed during the suspension of the spectator though it had not lessened his power of humour seems to have increased his disposition to seriousness the proportion of his religious to his comic papers is greater than in the former series the spectator from its recommencement was published only three times a week and no discriminative marks were added to the papers to addison tickell has ascribed twentythree the spectator had many contributors and steele whose negligence kept him always in a hurry when it was his turn to furnish a paper called loudly for the letters of which addison whose materials were more made little use having recourse to sketches and hints the product of his former studies which he now reviewed and completed among these are named by tickell the essays on wit those on the pleasures of the imagination and the criticism on milton when the house of hanover took possession of the throne it was reasonable to expect that the zeal of addison would be suitably rewarded before the arrival of king george he was made secretary to the regency and was required by his office to send notice to hanover that the queen was dead and that the throne was vacant to do this would not have been difficult to any man but addison who was so overwhelmed with the greatness of the event and so distracted by choice of expression that the lords who could not wait for the niceties of criticism called mr southwell a clerk in the house and ordered him to despatch the message southwell readily told what was necessary in the common style of business and valued himself upon having done what was too hard for addison he was better qualified for the freeholder a paper which he published twice a week from december to the middle of the next year this was undertaken in defence of the established government sometimes with argument and sometimes with mirth in argument he had many equals but his humour was singular and matchless bigotry itself must be delighted with the tory foxhunter there are however some strokes less elegant and less decent such as the pretenders journal in which one topic of ridicule is his poverty this mode of abuse had been employed by milton against king charles ii jacoboei centum exulantis viscera marsupii regis and oldmixon delights to tell of some alderman of london that he had more money than the exiled princes but that which might be expected from miltons savageness or oldmixons meanness was not suitable to the delicacy of addison steele thought the humour of the freeholder too nice and gentle for such noisy times and is reported to have said that the ministry made use of a lute when they should have called for a trumpet this year he married the countess dowager of warwick whom he had solicited by a very long and anxious courtship perhaps with behaviour not very unlike that of sir roger to his disdainful widow and who i am afraid diverted herself often by playing with his passion he is said to have first known her by becoming tutor to her son he formed said tonson the design of getting that lady from the time when he was first taken into the family in what part of his life he obtained the recommendation or how long and in what manner he lived in the family i know not his advances at first were certainly timorous but grew bolder as his reputation and influence increased till at last the lady was persuaded to marry him on terms much like those on which a turkish princess is espoused to whom the sultan is reported to pronounce daughter i give thee this man for thy slave the marriage if uncontradicted report can be credited made no addition to his happiness it neither found them nor made them equal she always remembered her own rank and thought herself entitled to treat with very little ceremony the tutor of her son rowes ballad of the despairing shepherd is said to have been written either before or after marriage upon this memorable pair and it is certain that addison has left behind him no encouragement for ambitious love the year after he rose to his highest elevation being made secretary of state for this employment he might be justly supposed qualified by long practice of business and by his regular ascent through other offices but expectation is often disappointed it is universally confessed that he was unequal to the duties of his place in the house of commons he could not speak and therefore was useless to the defence of the government in the office says pope he could not issue an order without losing his time in quest of fine expressions what he gained in rank he lost in credit and finding by experience his own inability was forced to solicit his dismission with a pension of fifteen hundred pounds a year his friends palliated this relinquishment of which both friends and enemies knew the true reason with an account of declining health and the necessity of recess and quiet he now returned to his vocation and began to plan literary occupations for his future life he purposed a tragedy on the death of socrates a story of which as tickell remarks the basis is narrow and to which i know not how love could have been appended there would however have been no want either of virtue in the sentiments or elegance in the language he engaged in a nobler work a defence of the christian religion of which part was published after his death and he designed to have made a new poetical version of the psalms these pious compositions pope imputed to a selfish motive upon the credit as he owns of tonson who having quarrelled with addison and not loving him said that when he laid down the secretarys office he intended to take orders and obtain a bishopric for said he i always thought him a priest in his heart that pope should have thought this conjecture of tonson worth remembrance is a proof but indeed so far as i have found the only proof that he retained some malignity from their ancient rivalry tonson pretended to guess it no other mortal ever suspected it and pope might have reflected that a man who had been secretary of state in the ministry of sunderland knew a nearer way to a bishopric than by defending religion or translating the psalms it is related that he had once a design to make an english dictionary and that he considered dr tillotson as the writer of highest authority there was formerly sent to me by mr locker clerk of the leathersellers company who was eminent for curiosity and literature a collection of examples selected from tillotsons works as locker said by addison it came too late to be of use so i inspected it but slightly and remember it indistinctly i thought the passages too short addison however did not conclude his life in peaceful studies but relapsed when he was near his end to a political dispute it so happened that a controversy was agitated with great vehemence between those friends of long continuance addison and steele it may be asked in the language of homer what power or what cause should set them at variance the subject of their dispute was of great importance the earl of sunderland proposed an act called the peerage bill by which the number of peers should be fixed and the king restrained from any new creation of nobility unless when an old family should be extinct to this the lords would naturally agree and the king who was yet little acquainted with his own prerogative and as is now well known almost indifferent to the possessions of the crown had been persuaded to consent the only difficulty was found among the commons who were not likely to approve the perpetual exclusion of themselves and their posterity the bill therefore was eagerly opposed and among others by sir robert walpole whose speech was published the lords might think their dignity diminished by improper advancements and particularly by the introduction of twelve new peers at once to produce a majority of tories in the last reign an act of authority violent enough yet certainly legal and by no means to be compared with that contempt of national right with which some time afterwards by the instigation of whiggism the commons chosen by the people for three years chose themselves for seven but whatever might be the disposition of the lords the people had no wish to increase their power the tendency of the bill as steele observed in a letter to the earl of oxford was to introduce an aristocracy for a majority in the house of lords so limited would have been despotic and irresistible to prevent this subversion of the ancient establishment steele whose pen readily seconded his political passions endeavoured to alarm the nation by a pamphlet called the plebeian to this an answer was published by addison under the title of the old whig in which it is not discovered that steele was then known to be the advocate for the commons steele replied by a second plebeian and whether by ignorance or by courtesy confined himself to his question without any personal notice of his opponent nothing hitherto was committed against the laws of friendship or proprieties of decency but controvertists cannot long retain their kindness for each other the old whig answered the plebeian and could not forbear some contempt of little dicky whose trade it was to write pamphlets dicky however did not lose his settled veneration for his friend but contented himself with quoting some lines of cato which were at once detection and reproof the bill was laid aside during that session and addison died before the next in which its commitment was rejected by two hundred and sixtyfive to one hundred and seventyseven every reader surely must regret that these two illustrious friends after so many years passed in confidence and endearment in unity of interest conformity of opinion and fellowship of study should finally part in acrimonious opposition such a controversy was bellum plusquam civile as lucan expresses it why could not faction find other advocates but among the uncertainties of the human state we are doomed to number the instability of friendship of this dispute i have little knowledge but from the biographia britannica the old whig is not inserted in addisons works nor is it mentioned by tickell in his life why it was omitted the biographers doubtless give the true reason the fact was too recent and those who had been heated in the contention were not yet cool the necessity of complying with times and of sparing persons is the great impediment of biography history may be formed from permanent monuments and records but lives can only be written from personal knowledge which is growing every day less and in a short time is lost for ever what is known can seldom be immediately told and when it might be told it is no longer known the delicate features of the mind the nice discriminations of character and the minute peculiarities of conduct are soon obliterated and it is surely better that caprice obstinacy frolic and folly however they might delight in the description should be silently forgotten than that by wanton merriment and unseasonable detection a pang should be given to a widow a daughter a brother or a friend as the process of these narratives is now bringing me among my contemporaries i begin to feel myself walking upon ashes under which the fire is not extinguished and coming to the time of which it will be proper rather to say nothing that is false than all that is true the end of this useful life was now approaching addison had for some time been oppressed by shortness of breath which was now aggravated by a dropsy and finding his danger pressing he prepared to die conformably to his own precepts and professions during this lingering decay he sent as pope relates a message by the earl of warwick to mr gay desiring to see him gay who had not visited him for some time before obeyed the summons and found himself received with great kindness the purpose for which the interview had been solicited was then discovered addison told him that he had injured him but that if he recovered he would recompense him what the injury was he did not explain nor did gay ever know but supposed that some preferment designed for him had by addisons intervention been withheld lord warwick was a young man of very irregular life and perhaps of loose opinions addison for whom he did not want respect had very diligently endeavoured to reclaim him but his arguments and expostulations had no effect one experiment however remained to be tried when he found his life near its end he directed the young lord to be called and when he desired with great tenderness to hear his last injunctions told him i have sent for you that you may see how a christian can die what effect this awful scene had on the earl i know not he likewise died himself in a short time in tickells excellent elegy on his friend are these lines he taught us how to live and oh too high the price of knowledge taught us how to die in which he alludes as he told dr young to this moving interview having given directions to mr tickell for the publication of his works and dedicated them on his deathbed to his friend mr craggs he died june at holland house leaving no child but a daughter of his virtue it is a sufficient testimony that the resentment of party has transmitted no charge of any crime he was not one of those who are praised only after death for his merit was so generally acknowledged that swift having observed that his election passed without a contest adds that if he proposed himself for king he would hardly have been refused his zeal for his party did not extinguish his kindness for the merit of his opponents when he was secretary in ireland he refused to intermit his acquaintance with swift of his habits or external manners nothing is so often mentioned as that timorous or sullen taciturnity which his friends called modesty by too mild a name steele mentions with great tenderness that remarkable bashfulness which is a cloak that hides and muffles merit and tells us that his abilities were covered only by modesty which doubles the beauties which are seen and gives credit and esteem to all that are concealed chesterfield affirms that addison was the most timorous and awkward man that he ever saw and addison speaking of his own deficiency in conversation used to say of himself that with respect to intellectual wealth he could draw bills for a thousand pounds though he had not a guinea in his pocket that he wanted current coin for ready payment and by that want was often obstructed and distressed and that he was often oppressed by an improper and ungraceful timidity every testimony concurs to prove but chesterfields representation is doubtless hyperbolical that man cannot be supposed very unexpert in the arts of conversation and practice of life who without fortune or alliance by his usefulness and dexterity became secretary of state and who died at fortyseven after having not only stood long in the highest rank of wit and literature but filled one of the most important offices of state the time in which he lived had reason to lament his obstinacy of silence for he was says steele above all men in that talent called humour and enjoyed it in such perfection that i have often reflected after a night spent with him apart from all the world that i had had the pleasure of conversing with an intimate acquaintance of terence and catullus who had all their wit and nature heightened with humour more exquisite and delightful than any other man ever possessed this is the fondness of a friend let us hear what is told us by a rival addisons conversation says pope had something in it more charming than i have found in any other man but this was only when familiar before strangers or perhaps a single stranger he preserved his dignity by a stiff silence this modesty was by no means inconsistent with a very high opinion of his own merit he demanded to be the first name in modern wit and with steele to echo him used to depreciate dryden whom pope and congreve defended against them there is no reason to doubt that he suffered too much pain from the prevalence of popes poetical reputation nor is it without strong reason suspected that by some disingenuous acts he endeavoured to obstruct it pope was not the only man whom he insidiously injured though the only man of whom he could be afraid his own powers were such as might have satisfied him with conscious excellence of very extensive learning he has indeed given no proofs he seems to have had small acquaintance with the sciences and to have read little except latin and french but of the latin poets his dialogues on medals show that he had perused the works with great diligence and skill the abundance of his own mind left him little indeed of adventitious sentiments his wit always could suggest what the occasion demanded he had read with critical eyes the important volume of human life and knew the heart of man from the depths of stratagem to the surface of affectation what he knew he could easily communicate this says steele was particular in this writer that when he had taken his resolution or made his plan for what he designed to write he would walk about a room and dictate it into language with as much freedom and ease as any one could write it down and attend to the coherence and grammar of what he dictated pope who can be less suspected of favouring his memory declares that he wrote very fluently but was slow and scrupulous in correcting that many of his spectators were written very fast and sent immediately to the press and that it seemed to be for his advantage not to have time for much revisal he would alter says pope anything to please his friends before publication but would not retouch his pieces afterwards and i believe not one word of cato to which i made an objection was suffered to stand the last line of cato is popes having been originally written and oh twas this that ended catos life pope might have made more objections to the six concluding lines in the first couplet the words from hence are improper and the second line is taken from drydens virgil of the next couplet the first verse being included in the second is therefore useless and in the third discord is made to produce strife of the course of addisons familiar day before his marriage pope has given a detail he had in the house with him budgell and perhaps philips his chief companions were steele budgell philips ambrose carey davenant and colonel brett with one or other of these he always breakfasted he studied all morning then dined at a tavern and went afterwards to buttons button had been a servant in the countess of warwicks family who under the patronage of addison kept a coffeehouse on the south side of russell street about two doors from covent garden here it was that the wits of that time used to assemble it is said when addison had suffered any vexation from the countess he withdrew the company from buttons house from the coffeehouse he went again to a tavern where he often sat late and drank too much wine in the bottle discontent seeks for comfort cowardice for courage and bashfulness for confidence it is not unlikely that addison was first seduced to excess by the manumission which he obtained from the servile timidity of his sober hours he that feels oppression from the presence of those to whom he knows himself superior will desire to set loose his powers of conversation and who that ever asked succours from bacchus was able to preserve himself from being enslaved by his auxiliary among those friends it was that addison displayed the elegance of his colloquial accomplishments which may easily be supposed such as pope represents them the remark of mandeville who when he had passed an evening in his company declared that he was a parson in a tiewig can detract little from his character he was always reserved to strangers and was not incited to uncommon freedom by a character like that of mandeville from any minute knowledge of his familiar manners the intervention of sixty years has now debarred us steele once promised congreve and the public a complete description of his character but the promises of authors are like the vows of lovers steele thought no more on his design or thought on it with anxiety that at last disgusted him and left his friend in the hands of tickell one slight lineament of his character swift has preserved it was his practice when he found any man invincibly wrong to flatter his opinions by acquiescence and sink him yet deeper in absurdity this artifice of mischief was admired by stella and swift seems to approve her admiration his works will supply some information it appears from the various pictures of the world that with all his bashfulness he had conversed with many distinct classes of men had surveyed their ways with very diligent observation and marked with great acuteness the effects of different modes of life he was a man in whose presence nothing reprehensible was out of danger quick in discerning whatever was wrong or ridiculous and not unwilling to expose it there are says steele in his writings many oblique strokes upon some of the wittiest men of the age his delight was more to excite merriment than detestation and he detects follies rather than crimes if any judgment be made from his books of his moral character nothing will be found but purity and excellence knowledge of mankind indeed less extensive than that of addison will show that to write and to live are very different many who praise virtue do no more than praise it yet it is reasonable to believe that addisons professions and practice were at no great variance since amidst that storm of faction in which most of his life was passed though his station made him conspicuous and his activity made him formidable the character given him by his friends was never contradicted by his enemies of those with whom interest or opinion united him he had not only the esteem but the kindness and of others whom the violence of opposition drove against him though he might lose the love he retained the reverence it is justly observed by tickell that he employed wit on the side of virtue and religion he not only made the proper use of wit himself but taught it to others and from his time it has been generally subservient to the cause of reason and of truth he has dissipated the prejudice that had long connected gaiety with vice and easiness of manners with laxity of principles he has restored virtue to its dignity and taught innocence not to be ashamed this is an elevation of literary character above all greek above all roman fame no greater felicity can genius attain than that of having purified intellectual pleasure separated mirth from indecency and wit from licentiousness of having taught a succession of writers to bring elegance and gaiety to the aid of goodness and if i may use expressions yet more awful of having turned many to righteousness addison in his life and for some time afterwards was considered by a greater part of readers as supremely excelling both in poetry and criticism part of his reputation may be probably ascribed to the advancement of his fortune when as swift observes he became a statesman and saw poets waiting at his levee it was no wonder that praise was accumulated upon him much likewise may be more honourably ascribed to his personal character he who if he had claimed it might have obtained the diadem was not likely to be denied the laurel but time quickly puts an end to artificial and accidental fame and addison is to pass through futurity protected only by his genius every name which kindness or interest once raised too high is in danger lest the next age should by the vengeance of criticism sink it in the same proportion a great writer has lately styled him an indifferent poet and a worse critic his poetry is first to be considered of which it must be confessed that it has not often those felicities of diction which give lustre to sentiments or that vigour of sentiment that animates diction there is little of ardour vehemence or transport there is very rarely the awfulness of grandeur and not very often the splendour of elegance he thinks justly but he thinks faintly this is his general character to which doubtless many single passages will furnish exception yet if he seldom reaches supreme excellence he rarely sinks into dulness and is still more rarely entangled in absurdity he did not trust his powers enough to be negligent there is in most of his compositions a calmness and equability deliberate and cautious sometimes with little that delights but seldom with anything that offends of this kind seem to be his poems to dryden to somers and to the king his ode on st cecilia has been imitated by pope and has something in it of drydens vigour of his account of the english poets he used to speak as a poor thing but it is not worse than his usual strain he has said not very judiciously in his character of waller thy verse could show even cromwells innocence and compliment the storms that bore him hence oh had thy muse not come an age too soon but seen great nassau on the british throne how had his triumph glittered in thy page what is this but to say that he who could compliment cromwell had been the proper poet for king william addison however printed the piece the letter from italy has been always praised but has never been praised beyond its merit it is more correct with less appearance of labour and more elegant with less ambition of ornament than any other of his poems there is however one broken metaphor of which notice may properly be taken fired with that name i bridle in my struggling muse with pain that longs to launch into a nobler strain to bridle a goddess is no very delicate idea but why must she be bridled because she longs to launch an act which was never hindered by a bridle and whither will she launch into a nobler strain she is in the first line a horse in the second a boat and the care of the poet is to keep his horse or his boat from singing the next composition is the farfamed campaign which dr warton has termed a gazette in rhyme with harshness not often used by the goodnature of his criticism before a censure so severe is admitted let us consider that war is a frequent subject of poetry and then inquire who has described it with more justice and force many of our own writers tried their powers upon this year of victory yet addisons is confessedly the best performance his poem is the work of a man not blinded by the dust of learning his images are not borrowed merely from books the superiority which he confers upon his hero is not personal prowess and mighty bone but deliberate intrepidity a calm command of his passions and the power of consulting his own mind in the midst of danger the rejection and contempt of fiction is rational and manly it may be observed that the last line is imitated by pope marlbroughs exploits appear divinely bright raised of themselves their genuine charms they boast and those that paint them truest praise them most this pope had in his thoughts but not knowing how to use what was not his own he spoiled the thought when he had borrowed it the wellsung woes shall soothe my pensive ghost he best can paint them who shall feel them most martial exploits may be painted perhaps woes may be painted but they are surely not painted by being well sung it is not easy to paint in song or to sing in colours no passage in the campaign has been more often mentioned than the simile of the angel which is said in the tatler to be one of the noblest thoughts that ever entered into the heart of man and is therefore worthy of attentive consideration let it be first inquired whether it be a simile a poetical simile is the discovery of likeness between two actions in their general nature dissimilar or of causes terminating by different operations in some resemblance of effect but the mention of another like consequence from a like cause or of a like performance by a like agency is not a simile but an exemplification it is not a simile to say that the thames waters fields as the po waters fields or that as hecla vomits flames in iceland so aetna vomits flames in sicily when horace says of pindar that he pours his violence and rapidity of verse as a river swollen with rain rushes from the mountain or of himself that his genius wanders in quest of poetical decorations as the bee wanders to collect honey he in either case produces a simile the mind is impressed with the resemblance of things generally unlike as unlike as intellect and body but if pindar had been described as writing with the copiousness and grandeur of homer or horace had told that he reviewed and finished his own poetry with the same care as isocrates polished his orations instead of similitude he would have exhibited almost identity he would have given the same portraits with different names in the poem now examined when the english are represented as gaining a fortified pass by repetition of attack and perseverance of resolution their obstinacy of courage and vigour of onset are well illustrated by the sea that breaks with incessant battery the dykes of holland this is a simile but when addison having celebrated the beauty of marlboroughs person tells us that achilles thus was formed of every grace here is no simile but a mere exemplification a simile may be compared to lines converging at a point and is more excellent as the lines approach from greater distance an exemplification may be considered as two parallel lines which run on together without approximation never far separated and never joined marlborough is so like the angel in the poem that the action of both is almost the same and performed by both in the same manner marlborough teaches the battle to rage the angel directs the storm marlborough is unmoved in peaceful thought the angel is calm and serene marlborough stands unmoved amidst the shock of hosts the angel rides calm in the whirlwind the lines on marlborough are just and noble but the simile gives almost the same images a second time but perhaps this thought though hardly a simile was remote from vulgar conceptions and required great labour and research or dexterity of application of this dr madden a name which ireland ought to honour once gave me his opinion if i had set said he ten schoolboys to write on the battle of blenheim and eight had brought me the angel i should not have been surprised the opera of rosamond though it is seldom mentioned is one of the first of addisons compositions the subject is well chosen the fiction is pleasing and the praise of marlborough for which the scene gives an opportunity is what perhaps every human excellence must be the product of good luck improved by genius the thoughts are sometimes great and sometimes tender the versification is easy and gay there is doubtless some advantage in the shortness of the lines which there is little temptation to load with expletive epithets the dialogue seems commonly better than the songs the two comic characters of sir trusty and grideline though of no great value are yet such as the poet intended sir trustys account of the death of rosamond is i think too grossly absurd the whole drama is airy and elegant engaging in its process and pleasing in its conclusion if addison had cultivated the lighter parts of poetry he would probably have excelled the tragedy of cato which contrary to the rule observed in selecting the works of other poets has by the weight of its character forced its way into the late collection is unquestionably the noblest production of addisons genius of a work so much read it is difficult to say anything new about things on which the public thinks long it commonly attains to think right and of cato it has been not unjustly determined that it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a representation of natural affections or of any state probable or possible in human life nothing here excites or assuages emotion here is no magical power of raising phantastic terror or wild anxiety the events are expected without solicitude and are remembered without joy or sorrow of the agents we have no care we consider not what they are doing or what they are suffering we wish only to know what they have to say cato is a being above our solicitude a man of whom the gods take care and whom we leave to their care with heedless confidence to the rest neither gods nor men can have much attention for there is not one amongst them that strongly attracts either affection or esteem but they are made the vehicles of such sentiments and such expression that there is scarcely a scene in the play which the reader does not wish to impress upon his memory when cato was shown to pope he advised the author to print it without any theatrical exhibition supposing that it would be read more favourably than heard addison declared himself of the same opinion but urged the importunity of his friends for its appearance on the stage the emulation of parties made it successful beyond expectation and its success has introduced or confirmed among us the use of dialogue too declamatory of unaffecting elegance and chill philosophy the universality of applause however it might quell the censure of common mortals had no other effect than to harden dennis in fixed dislike but his dislike was not merely capricious he found and showed many faults he showed them indeed with anger but he found them indeed with acuteness such as ought to rescue his criticism from oblivion though at last it will have no other life than it derives from the work which it endeavours to oppress why he pays no regard to the opinion of the audience he gives his reason by remarking that a deference is to be paid to a general applause when it appears that the applause is natural and spontaneous but that little regard is to be had to it when it is affected or artificial of all the tragedies which in his memory have had vast and violent runs not one has been excellent few have been tolerable most have been scandalous when a poet writes a tragedy who knows he has judgment and who feels he has genius that poet presumes upon his own merit and scorns to make a cabal that people come coolly to the representation of such a tragedy without any violent expectation or delusive imagination or invincible prepossession that such an audience is liable to receive the impressions which the poem shall naturally make on them and to judge by their own reason and their own judgments and that reason and judgment are calm and serene not formed by nature to make proselytes and to control and lord it over the imagination of others but that when an author writes a tragedy who knows he has neither genius nor judgment he has recourse to the making a party and he endeavours to make up in industry what is wanting in talent and to supply by poetical craft the absence of poetical art that such an author is humbly contented to raise mens passions by a plot without doors since he despairs of doing it by that which he brings upon the stage that party and passion and prepossession are clamorous and tumultuous things and so much the more clamorous and tumultuous by how much the more erroneous that they domineer and tyrannise over the imaginations of persons who want judgment and sometimes too of those who have it and like a fierce and outrageous torrent bear down all opposition before them he then condemns the neglect of poetical justice which is one of his favourite principles tis certainly the duty of every tragic poet by the exact distribution of poetical justice to imitate the divine dispensation and to inculcate a particular providence tis true indeed upon the stage of the world the wicked sometimes prosper and the guiltless suffer but that is permitted by the governor of the world to show from the attribute of his infinite justice that there is a compensation in futurity to prove the immortality of the human soul and the certainty of future rewards and punishments but the poetical persons in tragedy exist no longer than the reading or the representation the whole extent of their enmity is circumscribed by those and therefore during that reading or representation according to their merits or demerits they must be punished or rewarded if this is not done there is no impartial distribution of poetical justice no instructive lecture of a particular providence and no imitation of the divine dispensation and yet the author of this tragedy does not only run counter to this in the fate of his principal character but everywhere throughout it makes virtue suffer and vice triumph for not only cato is vanquished by caesar but the treachery and perfidiousness of syphax prevail over the honest simplicity and the credulity of juba and the sly subtlety and dissimulation of portius over the generous frankness and openheartedness of marcus whatever pleasure there may be in seeing crimes punished and virtue rewarded yet since wickedness often prospers in real life the poet is certainly at liberty to give it prosperity on the stage for if poetry has an imitation of reality how are its laws broken by exhibiting the world in its true form the stage may sometimes gratify our wishes but if it be truly the mirror of life it ought to show us sometimes what we are to expect dennis objects to the characters that they are not natural or reasonable but as heroes and heroines are not beings that are seen every day it is hard to find upon what principles their conduct shall be tried it is however not useless to consider what he says of the manner in which cato receives the account of his sons death nor is the grief of cato in the fourth act one jot more in nature than that of his son and lucia in the third cato receives the news of his sons death not only with dry eyes but with a sort of satisfaction and in the same page sheds tears for the calamity of his country and does the same thing in the next page upon the bare apprehension of the danger of his friends now since the love of ones country is the love of ones countrymen as i have shown upon another occasion i desire to ask these questions of all our countrymen which do we love most those whom we know or those whom we know not and of those whom we know which do we cherish most our friends or our enemies and of our friends which are the dearest to us those who are related to us or those who are not and of all our relations for which have we most tenderness for those who are near to us or for those who are remote and of our near relations which are the nearest and consequently the dearest to us our offspring or others our offspring most certainly as nature or in other words providence has wisely contrived for the preservation of mankind now does it not follow from what has been said that for a man to receive the news of his sons death with dry eyes and to weep at the same time for the calamities of his country is a wretched affectation and a miserable inconsistency is not that in plain english to receive with dry eyes the news of the deaths of those for whose sake our country is a name so dear to us and at the same time to shed tears for those for whose sakes our country is not a name so dear to us but this formidable assailant is less resistible when he attacks the probability of the action and the reasonableness of the plan every critical reader must remark that addison has with a scrupulosity almost unexampled on the english stage confined himself in time to a single day and in place to rigorous unity the scene never changes and the whole action of the play passes in the great hall of catos house at utica much therefore is done in the hall for which any other place had been more fit and this impropriety affords dennis many hints of merriment and opportunities of triumph the passage is long but as such disquisitions are not common and the objections are skilfully formed and vigorously urged those who delight in critical controversy will not think it tedious upon the departure of portius sempronius makes but one soliloquy and immediately in comes syphax and then the two politicians are at it immediately they lay their heads together with their snuffboxes in their hands as mr bayes has it and feague it away but in the midst of that wise scene syphax seems to give a seasonable caution to sempronius syph but is it true sempronius that your senate is called together gods thou must be cautious cato has piercing eyes there is a great deal of caution shown indeed in meeting in a governors own hall to carry on their plot against him whatever opinion they have of his eyes i suppose they have none of his ears or they would never have talked at this foolish rate so near gods thou must be cautious oh yes very cautious for if cato should overhear you and turn you off for politicians caesar would never take you when cato act ii turns the senators out of the hall upon pretence of acquainting juba with the result of their debates he appears to me to do a thing which is neither reasonable nor civil juba might certainly have better been made acquainted with the result of that debate in some private apartment of the palace but the poet was driven upon this absurdity to make way for another and that is to give juba an opportunity to demand marcia of her father but the quarrel and rage of juba and syphax in the same act the invectives of syphax against the romans and cato the advice that he gives juba in her fathers hall to bear away marcia by force and his brutal and clamorous rage upon his refusal and at a time when cato was scarcely out of sight and perhaps not out of hearing at least some of his guards or domestics must necessarily be supposed to be within hearing is a thing that is so far from being probable that it is hardly possible sempronius in the second act comes back once more in the same morning to the governors hall to carry on the conspiracy with syphax against the governor his country and his family which is so stupid that it is below the wisdom of the o s the macs and the teagues even eustace commins himself would never have gone to justicehall to have conspired against the government if officers at portsmouth should lay their heads together in order to the carrying off j g s niece or daughter would they meet in j g s hall to carry on that conspiracy there would be no necessity for their meeting there at least till they came to the execution of their plot because there would be other places to meet in there would be no probability that they should meet there because there would be places more private and more commodious now there ought to be nothing in a tragical action but what is necessary or probable but treason is not the only thing that is carried on in this hall that and love and philosophy take their turns in it without any manner of necessity or probability occasioned by the action as duly and as regularly without interrupting one another as if there were a triple league between them and a mutual agreement that each should give place to and make way for the other in a due and orderly succession we now come to the third act sempronius in this act comes into the governors hall with the leaders of the mutiny but as soon as cato is gone sempronius who but just before had acted like an unparalleled knave discovers himself like an egregious fool to be an accomplice in the conspiracy semp know villains when such paltry slaves presume to mix in treason if the plot succeeds theyre thrown neglected by but if it fails theyre sure to die like dogs as you shall do here take these factious monsters drag them forth to sudden death tis true indeed the second leader says there are none there but friends but is that possible at such a juncture can a parcel of rogues attempt to assassinate the governor of a town of war in his own house in midday and after they are discovered and defeated can there be none near them but friends is it not plain from these words of sempronius here take these factious monsters drag them forth to sudden death and from the entrance of the guards upon the word of command that those guards were within earshot behold sempronius then palpably discovered how comes it to pass then that instead of being hanged up with the rest he remains secure in the governors hall and there carries on his conspiracy against the government the third time in the same day with his old comrade syphax who enters at the same time that the guards are carrying away the leaders big with the news of the defeat of sempronius though where he had his intelligence so soon is difficult to imagine and now the reader may expect a very extraordinary scene there is not abundance of spirit indeed nor a great deal of passion but there is wisdom more than enough to supply all defects syph our first design my friend has proved abortive still there remains an aftergame to play my troops are mounted their numidian steeds snuff up the winds and long to scour the desert let but sempronius lead us in our flight well force the gate where marcus keeps his guard and hew down all that would oppose our passage a day will bring us into caesars camp semp confusion i have failed of half my purpose marcia the charming marcias left behind well but though he tells us the halfpurpose he has failed of he does not tell us the half that he has carried but what does he mean by marcia the charming marcias left behind he is now in her own house and we have neither seen her nor heard of her anywhere else since the play began but now let us hear syphax what hinders then but that you find her out and hurry her away by manly force but what does old syphax mean by finding her out they talk as if she were as hard to be found as a hare in a frosty morning semp but how to gain admission oh she is found out then it seems but how to gain admission for access is givn to none but juba and her brothers but raillery apart why access to juba for he was owned and received as a lover neither by the father nor by the daughter well but let that pass syphax puts sempronius out of pain immediately and being a numidian abounding in wiles supplies him with a stratagem for admission that i believe is a nonpareil syph thou shalt have jubas dress and jubas guards the doors will open when numidias prince seems to appear before them sempronius is it seems to pass for juba in full day at catos house where they were both so very well known by having jubas dress and his guards as if one of the marshals of france could pass for the duke of bavaria at noonday at versailles by having his dress and liveries but how does syphax pretend to help sempronius to young jubas dress does he serve him in a double capacity as general and master of his wardrobe but why jubas guards for the devil of any guards has juba appeared with yet well though this is a mighty politic invention yet methinks they might have done without it for since the advice that syphax gave to sempronius was to hurry her away by manly force in my opinion the shortest and likeliest way of coming at the lady was by demolishing instead of putting on an impertinent disguise to circumvent two or three slaves but sempronius it seems is of another opinion he extols to the skies the invention of old syphax semp heavens what a thought was there now i appeal to the reader if i have not been as good as my word did i not tell him that i would lay before him a very wise scene but now let us lay before the reader that part of the scenery of the fourth act which may show the absurdities which the author has run into through the indiscreet observance of the unity of place i do not remember that aristotle has said anything expressly concerning the unity of place tis true implicitly he has said enough in the rules which he has laid down for the chorus for by making the chorus an essential part of tragedy and by bringing it on the stage immediately after the opening of the scene and retaining it there till the very catastrophe he has so determined and fixed the place of action that it was impossible for an author on the grecian stage to break through that unity i am of opinion that if a modern tragic poet can preserve the amity of place without destroying the probability of the incidents tis always best for him to do it because by the preservation of that unity as we have taken notice above he adds grace and clearness and comeliness to the representation but since there are no express rules about it and we are under no compulsion to keep it since we have no chorus as the grecian poet had if it cannot be preserved without rendering the greater part of the incidents unreasonable and absurd and perhaps sometimes monstrous tis certainly better to break it now comes bully sempronius comically accoutred and equipped with his numidian dress and his numidian guards let the reader attend to him with all his ears for the words of the wise are precious semp the deer is lodged ive tracked her to her covert now i would fain know why this deer is said to be lodged since we have not heard one word since the play began of her being at all out of harbour and if we consider the discourse with which she and lucia begin the act we have reason to believe that they had hardly been talking of such matters in the street however to pleasure sempronius let us suppose for once that the deer is lodged the deer is lodged ive tracked her to her covert if he had seen her in the open field what occasion had he to track her when he had so many numidian dogs at his heels which with one halloo he might have set upon her haunches if he did not see her in the open field how could he possibly track her if he had seen her in the street why did he not set upon her in the street since through the street she must be carried at last now here instead of having his thoughts upon his business and upon the present danger instead of meditating and contriving how he shall pass with his mistress through the southern gate where her brother marcus is upon the guard and where he would certainly prove an impediment to him which is the roman word for the baggage instead of doing this sempronius is entertaining himself with whimsies semp how will the young numidian rave to see his mistress lost if aught could glad my soul beyond th enjoyment of so bright a prize twould be to torture that young gay barbarian but hark what noise death to my hopes tis he tis jubas self there is but one way left he must be murdered and a passage cut through those his guards pray what are those guards i thought at present that jubas guards had been semproniuss tools and had been dangling after his heels but now let us sum up all these absurdities together sempronius goes at noonday in jubas clothes and with jubas guards to catos palace in order to pass for juba in a place where they were both so very well known he meets juba there and resolves to murder him with his own guards upon the guards appearing a little bashful he threatens them hah dastards do you tremble or act like men or by yon azure heavn but the guards still remaining restive sempronius himself attacks juba while each of the guards is representing mr spectators sign of the gaper awed it seems and terrified by semproniuss threats juba kills sempronius and takes his own army prisoners and carries them in triumph away to cato now i would fain know if any part of mr bayess tragedy is so full of absurdity as this upon hearing the clash of swords lucia and marcia come in the question is why no men come in upon hearing the noise of swords in the governors hall where was the governor himself where were his guards where were his servants such an attempt as this so near the governor of a place of war was enough to alarm the whole garrison and yet for almost half an hour after sempronius was killed we find none of those appear who were the likeliest in the world to be alarmed and the noise of swords is made to draw only two poor women thither who were most certain to run away from it upon lucia and marcias coming in lucia appears in all the symptoms of an hysterical gentlewoman luc sure twas the clash of swords my troubled heart is so cast down and sunk amidst its sorrows it throbs with fear and aches at every sound and immediately her old whimsy returns upon her o marcia should thy brothers for my sake i die away with horror at the thought she fancies that there can be no cutting of throats but it must be for her if this is tragical i would fain know what is comical well upon this they spy the body of sempronius and marcia deluded by the habit it seems takes him for juba for says she the face is muffled up within the garment now how a man could fight and fall with his face muffled up in his garment is i think a little hard to conceive besides juba before he killed him knew him to be sempronius it was not by his garment that he knew this it was by his face then his face therefore was not muffled upon seeing this man with his muffled face marcia falls araving and owning her passion for the supposed defunct begins to make his funeral oration upon which juba enters listening i suppose on tiptoe for i cannot imagine how any one can enter listening in any other posture i would fain know how it came to pass that during all this time he had sent nobody no not so much as a candlesnuffer to take away the dead body of sempronius well but let us regard him listening having left his apprehension behind him he at first applies what marcia says to sempronius but finding at last with much ado that he himself is the happy man he quits his eavesdropping and discovers himself just time enough to prevent his being cuckolded by a dead man of whom the moment before he had appeared so jealous and greedily intercepts the bliss which was fondly designed for one who could not be the better for it but here i must ask a question how comes juba to listen here who had not listened before throughout the play or how comes he to be the only person of this tragedy who listens when love and treason were so often talked in so public a place as a hall i am afraid the author was driven upon all these absurdities only to introduce this miserable mistake of marcia which after all is much below the dignity of tragedy as anything is which is the effect or result of trick but let us come to the scenery of the fifth act cato appears first upon the scene sitting in a thoughtful posture in his hand platos treatise on the immortality of the soul a drawn sword on the table by him now let us consider the place in which this sight is presented to us the place forsooth is a long hall let us suppose that any one should place himself in this posture in the midst of one of our halls in london that he should appear solus in a sullen posture a drawn sword on the table by him in his hand platos treatise on the immortality of the soul translated lately by bernard lintot i desire the reader to consider whether such a person as this would pass with them who beheld him for a great patriot a great philosopher or a general or some whimsical person who fancied himself all these and whether the people who belonged to the family would think that such a person had a design upon their midriffs or his own in short that cato should sit long enough in the aforesaid posture in the midst of this large hall to read over platos treatise on the immortality of the soul which is a lecture of two long hours that he should propose to himself to be private there upon that occasion that he should be angry with his son for intruding there then that he should leave this hall upon the pretence of sleep give himself the mortal wound in his bedchamber and then be brought back into that hall to expire purely to show his good breeding and save his friends the trouble of coming up to his bedchamber all this appears to me to be improbable incredible impossible such is the censure of dennis there is as dryden expresses it perhaps too much horseplay in his railleries but if his jests are coarse his arguments are strong yet as we love better to be pleased than to be taught cato is read and the critic is neglected flushed with consciousness of these detections of absurdity in the conduct he afterwards attacked the sentiments of cato but he then amused himself with petty cavils and minute objections of addisons smaller poems no particular mention is necessary they have little that can employ or require a critic the parallel of the princes and gods in his verses to kneller is often happy but is too well known to be quoted his translations so far as i compared them want the exactness of a scholar that he understood his authors cannot be doubted but his versions will not teach others to understand them being too licentiously paraphrastical they are however for the most part smooth and easy and what is the first excellence of a translator such as may be read with pleasure by those who do not know the originals his poetry is polished and pure the product of a mind too judicious to commit faults but not sufficiently vigorous to attain excellence he has sometimes a striking line or a shining paragraph but in the whole he is warm rather than fervid and shows more dexterity than strength he was however one of our earliest examples of correctness the versification which he had learned from dryden he debased rather than refined his rhymes are often dissonant in his georgic he admits broken lines he uses both triplets and alexandrines but triplets more frequently in his translation than his other works the mere structure of verses seems never to have engaged much of his care but his lines are very smooth in rosamond and too smooth in cato addison is now to be considered as a critic a name which the present generation is scarcely willing to allow him his criticism is condemned as tentative or experimental rather than scientific and he is considered as deciding by taste rather than by principles it is not uncommon for those who have grown wise by the labour of others to add a little of their own and overlook their masters addison is now despised by some who perhaps would never have seen his defects but by the lights which he afforded them that he always wrote as he would think it necessary to write now cannot be affirmed his instructions were such as the characters of his readers made proper that general knowledge which now circulates in common talk was in his time rarely to be found men not professing learning were not ashamed of ignorance and in the female world any acquaintance with books was distinguished only to be censured his purpose was to infuse literary curiosity by gentle and unsuspected conveyance into the gay the idle and the wealthy he therefore presented knowledge in the most alluring form not lofty and austere but accessible and familiar when he showed them their defects he showed them likewise that they might be easily supplied his attempt succeeded inquiry was awakened and comprehension expanded an emulation of intellectual elegance was excited and from this time to our own life has been gradually exalted and conversation purified and enlarged dryden had not many years before scattered criticism over his prefaces with very little parsimony but though he sometimes condescended to be somewhat familiar his manner was in general too scholastic for those who had yet their rudiments to learn and found it not easy to understand their master his observations were framed rather for those that were learning to write than for those that read only to talk an instructor like addison was now wanting whose remarks being superficial might be easily understood and being just might prepare the mind for more attainments had he presented paradise lost to the public with all the pomp of system and severity of science the criticism would perhaps have been admired and the poem still have been neglected but by the blandishments of gentleness and facility he has made milton an universal favourite with whom readers of every class think it necessary to be pleased he descended now and then to lower disquisitions and by a serious display of the beauties of chevy chase exposed himself to the ridicule of wagstaff who bestowed a like pompous character on tom thumb and to the contempt of dennis who considering the fundamental position of his criticism that chevy chase pleases and ought to please because it is natural observes that there is a way of deviating from nature by bombast or tumour which soars above nature and enlarges images beyond their real bulk by affectation which forsakes nature in quest of something unsuitable and by imbecility which degrades nature by faintness and diminution by obscuring its appearances and weakening its effects in chevy chase there is not much of either bombast or affectation but there is chill and lifeless imbecility the story cannot possibly be told in a manner that shall make less impression on the mind before the profound observers of the present race repose too securely on the consciousness of their superiority to addison let them consider his remarks on ovid in which may be found specimens of criticism sufficiently subtle and refined let them peruse likewise his essays on wit and on the pleasures of imagination in which he founds art on the base of nature and draws the principles of invention from dispositions inherent in the mind of man with skill and elegance such as his contemners will not easily attain as a describer of life and manners he must be allowed to stand perhaps the first of the first rank his humour which as steele observes is peculiar to himself is so happily diffused as to give the grace of novelty to domestic scenes and daily occurrences he never oersteps the modesty of nature nor raises merriment or wonder by the violation of truth his figures neither divert by distortion nor amaze by aggravation he copies life with so much fidelity that he can be hardly said to invent yet his exhibitions have an air so much original that it is difficult to suppose them not merely the product of imagination as a teacher of wisdom he may be confidently followed his religion has nothing in it enthusiastic or superstitious he appears neither weakly credulous nor wantonly sceptical his morality is neither dangerously lax nor impracticably rigid all the enchantment of fancy and all the cogency of argument are employed to recommend to the reader his real interest the care of pleasing the author of his being truth is shown sometimes as the phantom of a vision sometimes appears halfveiled in an allegory sometimes attracts regard in the robes of fancy and sometimes steps forth in the confidence of reason she wears a thousand dresses and in all is pleasing mille habet ornatus mille decenter habet his prose is the model of the middle style on grave subjects not formal on light occasions not grovelling pure without scrupulosity and exact without apparent elaboration always equable and always easy without glowing words or pointed sentences addison never deviates from his track to snatch a grace he seeks no ambitious ornaments and tries no hazardous innovations his page is always luminous but never blazes in unexpected splendour it was apparently his principal endeavour to avoid all harshness and severity of diction he is therefore sometimes verbose in his transitions and connections and sometimes descends too much to the language of conversation yet if his language had been less idiomatical it might have lost somewhat of its genuine anglicism what he attempted he performed he is never feeble and he did not wish to be energetic he is never rapid and he never stagnates his sentences have neither studied amplitude nor affected brevity his periods though not diligently rounded are voluble and easy whoever wishes to attain an english style familiar but not coarse and elegant but not ostentatious must give his days and nights to the volumes of addison savage it has been observed in all ages that the advantages of nature or of fortune have contributed very little to the promotion of happiness and that those whom the splendour of their rank or the extent of their capacity has placed upon the summit of human life have not often given any just occasion to envy in those who look up to them from a lower station whether it be that apparent superiority incites great designs and great designs are naturally liable to fatal miscarriages or that the general lot of mankind is misery and the misfortunes of those whose eminence drew upon them universal attention have been more carefully recorded because they were more generally observed and have in reality been only more conspicuous than those of others not more frequent or more severe that affluence and power advantages extrinsic and adventitious and therefore easily separable from those by whom they are possessed should very often flatter the mind with expectations of felicity which they cannot give raises no astonishment but it seems rational to hope that intellectual greatness should produce better effects that minds qualified for great attainments should first endeavour their own benefit and that they who are most able to teach others the way to happiness should with most certainty follow it themselves but this expectation however plausible has been very frequently disappointed the heroes of literary as well as civil history have been very often no less remarkable for what they have suffered than for what they have achieved and volumes have been written only to enumerate the miseries of the learned and relate their unhappy lives and untimely deaths to these mournful narratives i am about to add the life of richard savage a man whose writings entitle him to an eminent rank in the classes of learning and whose misfortunes claim a degree of compassion not always due to the unhappy as they were often the consequences of the crimes of others rather than his own in the year anne countess of macclesfield having lived some time upon very uneasy terms with her husband thought a public confession of adultery the most obvious and expeditious method of obtaining her liberty and therefore declared that the child with which she was then great was begotten by the earl rivers this as may be imagined made her husband no less desirous of a separation than herself and he prosecuted his design in the most effectual manner for he applied not to the ecclesiastical courts for a divorce but to the parliament for an act by which his marriage might be dissolved the nuptial contract annulled and the children of his wife illegitimated this act after the usual deliberation he obtained though without the approbation of some who considered marriage as an affair only cognisable by ecclesiastical judges and on march rd was separated from his wife whose fortune which was very great was repaid her and who having as well as her husband the liberty of making another choice she in a short time married colonel brett while the earl of macclesfield was prosecuting this affair his wife was on the th of january sic delivered of a son and the earl rivers by appearing to consider him as his own left none any reason to doubt of the sincerity of her declaration for he was his godfather and gave him his own name which was by his direction inserted in the register of st andrews parish in holborn but unfortunately left him to the care of his mother whom as she was now set free from her husband he probably imagined likely to treat with great tenderness the child that had contributed to so pleasing an event it is not indeed easy to discover what motives could be found to overbalance that natural affection of a parent or what interest could be promoted by neglect or cruelty the dread of shame or of poverty by which some wretches have been incited to abandon or murder their children cannot be supposed to have affected a woman who had proclaimed her crimes and solicited reproach and on whom the clemency of the legislature had undeservedly bestowed a fortune which would have been very little diminished by the expenses which the care of her child could have brought upon her it was therefore not likely that she would be wicked without temptation that she would look upon her son from his birth with a kind of resentment and abhorrence and instead of supporting assisting and defending him delight to see him struggling with misery or that she would take every opportunity of aggravating his misfortunes and obstructing his resources and with an implacable and restless cruelty continue her persecution from the first hour of his life to the last but whatever were her motives no sooner was her son born than she discovered a resolution of disowning him and in a very short time removed him from her sight by committing him to the care of a poor woman whom she directed to educate him as her own and enjoined never to inform him of his true parents such was the beginning of the life of richard savage born with a legal claim to honour and to affluence he was in two months illegitimated by the parliament and disowned by his mother doomed to poverty and obscurity and launched upon the ocean of life only that he might be swallowed by its quicksands or dashed upon its rocks his mother could not indeed infect others with the same cruelty as it was impossible to avoid the inquiries which the curiosity or tenderness of her relations made after her child she was obliged to give some account of the measures she had taken and her mother the lady mason whether in approbation of her design or to prevent more criminal contrivances engaged to transact with the nurse to pay her for her care and to superintend the education of the child in this charitable office she was assisted by his godmother mrs lloyd who while she lived always looked upon him with that tenderness which the barbarity of his mother made peculiarly necessary but her death which happened in his tenth year was another of the misfortunes of his childhood for though she kindly endeavoured to alleviate his loss by a legacy of three hundred pounds yet as he had none to prosecute his claim to shelter him from oppression or call in law to the assistance of justice her will was eluded by the executors and no part of the money was ever paid he was however not yet wholly abandoned the lady mason still continued her care and directed him to be placed at a small grammar school near st albans where he was called by the name of his nurse without the least intimation that he had a claim to any other here he was initiated in literature and passed through several of the classes with what rapidity or with what applause cannot now be known as he always spoke with respect of his master it is probable that the mean rank in which he then appeared did not hinder his genius from being distinguished or his industry from being rewarded and if in so low a state he obtained distinctions and rewards it is not likely that they were gained but by genius and industry it is very reasonable to conjecture that his application was equal to his abilities because his improvement was more than proportioned to the opportunities which he enjoyed nor can it be doubted that if his earliest productions had been preserved like those of happier students we might in some have found vigorous sallies of that sprightly humour which distinguishes the author to be let and in others strong touches of that imagination which painted the solemn scenes of the wanderer while he was thus cultivating his genius his father the earl rivers was seized with a distemper which in a short time put an end to his life he had frequently inquired after his son and had always been amused with fallacious and evasive answers but being now in his own opinion on his deathbed he thought it his duty to provide for him among his other natural children and therefore demanded a positive account of him with an importunity not to be diverted or denied his mother who could no longer refuse an answer determined at least to give such as should cut him off for ever from that happiness which competence affords and therefore declared that he was dead which is perhaps the first instance of a lie invented by a mother to deprive her son of a provision which was designed him by another and which she could not expect herself though he should lose it this was therefore an act of wickedness which could not be defeated because it could not be suspected the earl did not imagine that there could exist in a human form a mother that would ruin her son without enriching herself and therefore bestowed upon some other person six thousand pounds which he had in his will bequeathed to savage the same cruelty which incited his mother to intercept this provision which had been intended him prompted her in a short time to another project a project worthy of such a disposition she endeavoured to rid herself from the danger of being at any time made known to him by sending him secretly to the american plantations by whose kindness this scheme was counteracted or by whose interposition she was induced to lay aside her design i know not it is not improbable that the lady mason might persuade or compel her to desist or perhaps she could not easily find accomplices wicked enough to concur in so cruel an action for it may be conceived that those who had by a long gradation of guilt hardened their hearts against the sense of common wickedness would yet be shocked at the design of a mother to expose her son to slavery and want to expose him without interest and without provocation and savage might on this occasion find protectors and advocates among those who had long traded in crimes and whom compassion had never touched before being hindered by whatever means from banishing him into another country she formed soon after a scheme for burying him in poverty and obscurity in his own and that his station of life if not the place of his residence might keep him for ever at a distance from her she ordered him to be placed with a shoemaker in holborn that after the usual time of trial he might become his apprentice it is generally reported that this project was for some time successful and that savage was employed at the awl longer than he was willing to confess nor was it perhaps any great advantage to him that an unexpected discovery determined him to quit his occupation about this time his nurse who had always treated him as her own son died and it was natural for him to take care of those effects which by her death were as he imagined become his own he therefore went to her house opened her boxes and examined her papers among which he found some letters written to her by the lady mason which informed him of his birth and the reasons for which it was concealed he was no longer satisfied with the employment which had been allotted him but thought he had a right to share the affluence of his mother and therefore without scruple applied to her as her son and made use of every art to awaken her tenderness and attract her regard but neither his letters nor the interposition of those friends which his merit or his distress procured him made any impression on her mind she still resolved to neglect though she could no longer disown him it was to no purpose that he frequently solicited her to admit him to see her she avoided him with the most vigilant precaution and ordered him to be excluded from her house by whomsoever he might be introduced and what reason soever he might give for entering it savage was at the same time so touched with the discovery of his real mother that it was his frequent practice to walk in the dark evenings for several hours before her door in hopes of seeing her as she might come by accident to the window or cross her apartment with a candle in her hand but all his assiduity and tenderness were without effect for he could neither soften her heart nor open her hand and was reduced to the utmost miseries of want while he was endeavouring to awaken the affection of a mother he was therefore obliged to seek some other means of support and having no profession became by necessity an author at this time the attention of the literary world was engrossed by the bangorian controversy which filled the press with pamphlets and the coffeehouses with disputants of this subject as most popular he made choice for his first attempt and without any other knowledge of the question than he had casually collected from conversation published a poem against the bishop what was the success or merit of this performance i know not it was probably lost among the innumerable pamphlets to which that dispute gave occasion mr savage was himself in a little time ashamed of it and endeavoured to suppress it by destroying all the copies that he could collect he then attempted a more gainful kind of writing and in his eighteenth year offered to the stage a comedy borrowed from a spanish plot which was refused by the players and was therefore given by him to mr bullock who having more interest made some slight alterations and brought it upon the stage under the title of womans a riddle but allowed the unhappy author no part of the profit not discouraged however at his repulse he wrote two years afterwards love in a veil another comedy borrowed likewise from the spanish but with little better success than before for though it was received and acted yet it appeared so late in the year that the author obtained no other advantage from it than the acquaintance of sir richard steele and mr wilks by whom he was pitied caressed and relieved sir richard steele having declared in his favour with all the ardour of benevolence which constituted his character promoted his interest with the utmost zeal related his misfortunes applauded his merit took all the opportunities of recommending him and asserted that the inhumanity of his mother had given him a right to find every good man his father nor was mr savage admitted to his acquaintance only but to his confidence of which he sometimes related an instance too extraordinary to be omitted as it affords a very just idea of his patrons character he was once desired by sir richard with an air of the utmost importance to come very early to his house the next morning mr savage came as he had promised found the chariot at the door and sir richard waiting for him and ready to go out what was intended and whither they were to go savage could not conjecture and was not willing to inquire but immediately seated himself with sir richard the coachman was ordered to drive and they hurried with the utmost expedition to hyde park corner where they stopped at a petty tavern and retired to a private room sir richard then informed him that he intended to publish a pamphlet and that he had desired him to come thither that he might write for him he soon sat down to the work sir richard dictated and savage wrote till the dinner that had been ordered was put upon the table savage was surprised at the meanness of the entertainment and after some hesitation ventured to ask for wine which sir richard not without reluctance ordered to be brought they then finished their dinner and proceeded in their pamphlet which they concluded in the afternoon mr savage then imagined his task over and expected that sir richard would call for the reckoning and return home but his expectations deceived him for sir richard told him that he was without money and that the pamphlet must be sold before the dinner could be paid for and savage was therefore obliged to go and offer their new production to sale for two guineas which with some difficulty he obtained sir richard then returned home having retired that day only to avoid his creditors and composed the pamphlet only to discharge his reckoning mr savage related another fact equally uncommon which though it has no relation to his life ought to be preserved sir richard steele having one day invited to his house a great number of persons of the first quality they were surprised at the number of liveries which surrounded the table and after dinner when wine and mirth had set them free from the observation of a rigid ceremony one of them inquired of sir richard how such an expensive train of domestics could be consistent with his fortune sir richard very frankly confessed that they were fellows of whom he would very willingly be rid and being then asked why he did not discharge them declared that they were bailiffs who had introduced themselves with an execution and whom since he could not send them away he had thought it convenient to embellish with liveries that they might do him credit while they stayed his friends were diverted with the expedient and by paying the debt discharged their attendance having obliged sir richard to promise that they should never again find him graced with a retinue of the same kind under such a tutor mr savage was not likely to learn prudence or frugality and perhaps many of the misfortunes which the want of those virtues brought upon him in the following parts of his life might be justly imputed to so unimproving an example nor did the kindness of sir richard end in common favours he proposed to have established him in some settled scheme of life and to have contracted a kind of alliance with him by marrying him to a natural daughter on whom he intended to bestow a thousand pounds but though he was always lavish of future bounties he conducted his affairs in such a manner that he was very seldom able to keep his promises or execute his own intentions and as he was never able to raise the sum which he had offered the marriage was delayed in the meantime he was officiously informed that mr savage had ridiculed him by which he was so much exasperated that he withdrew the allowance which he had paid him and never afterwards admitted him to his house it is not indeed unlikely that savage might by his imprudence expose himself to the malice of a talebearer for his patron had many follies which as his discernment easily discovered his imagination might sometimes incite him to mention too ludicrously a little knowledge of the world is sufficient to discover that such weakness is very common and that there are few who do not sometimes in the wantonness of thoughtless mirth or the heat of transient resentment speak of their friends and benefactors with levity and contempt though in their cooler moments they want neither sense of their kindness nor reverence for their virtue the fault therefore of mr savage was rather negligence than ingratitude but sir richard must likewise be acquitted of severity for who is there that can patiently bear contempt from one whom he has relieved and supported whose establishment he has laboured and whose interest he has promoted he was now again abandoned to fortune without any other friend than mr wilks a man who whatever were his abilities or skill as an actor deserves at least to be remembered for his virtues which are not often to be found in the world and perhaps less often in his profession than in others to be humane generous and candid is a very high degree of merit in any case but those qualifications deserve still greater praise when they are found in that condition which makes almost every other man for whatever reason contemptuous insolent petulant selfish and brutal as mr wilks was one of those to whom calamity seldom complained without relief he naturally took an unfortunate wit into his protection and not only assisted him in any casual distresses but continued an equal and steady kindness to the time of his death by this interposition mr savage once obtained from his mother fifty pounds and a promise of one hundred and fifty more but it was the fate of this unhappy man that few promises of any advantage to him were performed his mother was infected among others with the general madness of the south sea traffic and having been disappointed in her expectations refused to pay what perhaps nothing but the prospect of sudden affluence prompted her to promise being thus obliged to depend upon the friendship of mr wilks he was consequently an assiduous frequenter of the theatres and in a short time the amusements of the stage took such possession of his mind that he never was absent from a play in several years this constant attendance naturally procured him the acquaintance of the players and among others of mrs oldfield who was so much pleased with his conversation and touched with his misfortunes that she allowed him a settled pension of fifty pounds a year which was during her life regularly paid that this act of generosity may receive its due praise and that the good actions of mrs oldfield may not be sullied by her general character it is proper to mention that mr savage often declared in the strongest terms that he never saw her alone or in any other place than behind the scenes at her death he endeavoured to show his gratitude in the most decent manner by wearing mourning as for a mother but did not celebrate her in elegies because he knew that too great a profusion of praise would only have revived those faults which his natural equity did not allow him to think less because they were committed by one who favoured him but of which though his virtue would not endeavour to palliate them his gratitude would not suffer him to prolong the memory or diffuse the censure in his wanderer he has indeed taken an opportunity of mentioning her but celebrates her not for her virtue but her beauty an excellence which none ever denied her this is the only encomium with which he has rewarded her liberality and perhaps he has even in this been too lavish of his praise he seems to have thought that never to mention his benefactress would have an appearance of ingratitude though to have dedicated any particular performance to her memory would have only betrayed an officious partiality and that without exalting her character would have depressed his own he had sometimes by the kindness of mr wilks the advantage of a benefit on which occasions he often received uncommon marks of regard and compassion and was once told by the duke of dorset that it was just to consider him as an injured nobleman and that in his opinion the nobility ought to think themselves obliged without solicitation to take every opportunity of supporting him by their countenance and patronage but he had generally the mortification to hear that the whole interest of his mother was employed to frustrate his applications and that she never left any expedient untried by which he might be cut off from the possibility of supporting life the same disposition she endeavoured to diffuse among all those over whom nature or fortune gave her any influence and indeed succeeded too well in her design but could not always propagate her effrontery with her cruelty for some of those whom she incited against him were ashamed of their own conduct and boasted of that relief which they never gave him in this censure i do not indiscriminately involve all his relations for he has mentioned with gratitude the humanity of one lady whose name i am now unable to recollect and to whom therefore i cannot pay the praises which she deserves for having acted well in opposition to influence precept and example the punishment which our laws inflict upon those parents who murder their infants is well known nor has its justice ever been contested but if they deserve death who destroy a child in its birth what pain can be severe enough for her who forbears to destroy him only to inflict sharper miseries upon him who prolongs his life only to make him miserable and who exposes him without care and without pity to the malice of oppression the caprices of chance and the temptations of poverty who rejoices to see him overwhelmed with calamities and when his own industry or the charity of others has enabled him to rise for a short time above his miseries plunges him again into his former distress the kindness of his friends not affording him any constant supply and the prospect of improving his fortune by enlarging his acquaintance necessarily leading him to places of expense he found it necessary to endeavour once more at dramatic poetry for which he was now better qualified by a more extensive knowledge and longer observation but having been unsuccessful in comedy though rather for want of opportunities than genius he resolved to try whether he should not be more fortunate in exhibiting a tragedy the story which he chose for the subject was that of sir thomas overbury a story well adapted to the stage though perhaps not far enough removed from the present age to admit properly the fictions necessary to complete the plan for the mind which naturally loves truth is always most offended with the violation of those truths of which we are most certain and we of course conceive those facts most certain which approach nearer to our own time out of this story he formed a tragedy which if the circumstances in which he wrote it be considered will afford at once an uncommon proof of strength of genius and evenness of mind of a serenity not to be ruffled and an imagination not to be suppressed during a considerable part of the time in which he was employed upon this performance he was without lodging and often without meat nor had he any other conveniences for study than the fields or the streets allowed him there he used to walk and form his speeches and afterwards step into a shop beg for a few moments the use of the pen and ink and write down what he had composed upon paper which he had picked up by accident if the performance of a writer thus distressed is not perfect its faults ought surely to be imputed to a cause very different from want of genius and must rather excite pity than provoke censure but when under these discouragements the tragedy was finished there yet remained the labour of introducing it on the stage an undertaking which to an ingenuous mind was in a very high degree vexatious and disgusting for having little interest or reputation he was obliged to submit himself wholly to the players and admit with whatever reluctance the emendations of mr cibber which he always considered as the disgrace of his performance he had indeed in mr hill another critic of a very different class from whose friendship he received great assistance on many occasions and whom he never mentioned but with the utmost tenderness and regard he had been for some time distinguished by him with very particular kindness and on this occasion it was natural to apply to him as an author of an established character he therefore sent this tragedy to him with a short copy of verses in which he desired his correction mr hill whose humanity and politeness are generally known readily complied with his request but as he is remarkable for singularity of sentiment and bold experiments in language mr savage did not think this play much improved by his innovation and had even at that time the courage to reject several passages which he could not approve and what is still more laudable mr hill had the generosity not to resent the neglect of his alterations but wrote the prologue and epilogue in which he touches on the circumstances of the author with great tenderness after all these obstructions and compliances he was only able to bring his play upon the stage in the summer when the chief actors had retired and the rest were in possession of the house for their own advantage among these mr savage was admitted to play the part of sir thomas overbury by which he gained no great reputation the theatre being a province for which nature seems not to have designed him for neither his voice look nor gesture were such as were expected on the stage and he was so much ashamed of having been reduced to appear as a player that he always blotted out his name from the list when a copy of his tragedy was to be shown to his friends in the publication of his performance he was more successful for the rays of genius that glimmered in it that glimmered through all the mists which poverty and cibber had been able to spread over it procured him the notice and esteem of many persons eminent for their rank their virtue and their wit of this play acted printed and dedicated the accumulated profits arose to a hundred pounds which he thought at that time a very large sum having been never master of so much before in the dedication for which he received ten guineas there is nothing remarkable the preface contains a very liberal encomium on the blooming excellence of mr theophilus cibber which mr savage could not in the latter part of his life see his friends about to read without snatching the play out of their hands the generosity of mr hill did not end on this occasion for afterwards when mr savages necessities returned he encouraged a subscription to a miscellany of poems in a very extraordinary manner by publishing his story in the plain dealer with some affecting lines which he asserts to have been written by mr savage upon the treatment received by him from his mother but of which he was himself the author as mr savage afterwards declared these lines and the paper in which they were inserted had a very powerful effect upon all but his mother whom by making her cruelty more public they only hardened in her aversion mr hill not only promoted the subscription to the miscellany but furnished likewise the greatest part of the poems of which it is composed and particularly the happy man which he published as a specimen the subscriptions of those whom these papers should influence to patronise merit in distress without any other solicitation were directed to be left at buttons coffeehouse and mr savage going thither a few days afterwards without expectation of any effect from his proposal found to his surprise seventy guineas which had been sent him in consequence of the compassion excited by mr hills pathetic representation to this miscellany he wrote a preface in which he gives an account of his mothers cruelty in a very uncommon strain of humour and with a gaiety of imagination which the success of his subscription probably produced the dedication is addressed to the lady mary wortley montagu whom he flatters without reserve and to confess the truth with very little art the same observation may be extended to all his dedications his compliments are constrained and violent heaped together without the grace of order or the decency of introduction he seems to have written his panegyrics for the perusal only of his patrons and to imagine that he had no other task than to pamper them with praises however gross and that flattery would make its way to the heart without the assistance of elegance or invention soon afterwards the death of the king furnished a general subject for a poetical contest in which mr savage engaged and is allowed to have carried the prize of honour from his competitors but i know not whether he gained by his performance any other advantage than the increase of his reputation though it must certainly have been with farther views that he prevailed upon himself to attempt a species of writing of which all the topics had been long before exhausted and which was made at once difficult by the multitudes that had failed in it and those that had succeeded he was now advancing in reputation and though frequently involved in very distressful perplexities appeared however to be gaining upon mankind when both his fame and his life were endangered by an event of which it is not yet determined whether it ought to be mentioned as a crime or a calamity on the th of november mr savage came from richmond where he then lodged that he might pursue his studies with less interruption with an intent to discharge another lodging which he had in westminster and accidentally meeting two gentlemen his acquaintances whose names were merchant and gregory he went in with them to a neighbouring coffeehouse and sat drinking till it was late it being in no time of mr savages life any part of his character to be the first of the company that desired to separate he would willingly have gone to bed in the same house but there was not room for the whole company and therefore they agreed to ramble about the streets and divert themselves with such amusements as should offer themselves till morning in this walk they happened unluckily to discover a light in robinsons coffeehouse near charing cross and therefore went in merchant with some rudeness demanded a room and was told that there was a good fire in the next parlour which the company were about to leave being then paying their reckoning merchant not satisfied with this answer rushed into the room and was followed by his companions he then petulantly placed himself between the company and the fire and soon after kicked down the table this produced a quarrel swords were drawn on both sides and one mr james sinclair was killed savage having likewise wounded a maid that held him forced his way with merchant out of the house but being intimidated and confused without resolution either to fly or stay they were taken in a back court by one of the company and some soldiers whom he had called to his assistance being secured and guarded that night they were in the morning carried before three justices who committed them to the gatehouse from whence upon the death of mr sinclair which happened the same day they were removed in the night to newgate where they were however treated with some distinction exempted from the ignominy of chains and confined not among the common criminals but in the press yard when the day of trial came the court was crowded in a very unusual manner and the public appeared to interest itself as in a cause of general concern the witnesses against mr savage and his friends were the woman who kept the house which was a house of illfame and her maid the men who were in the room with mr sinclair and a woman of the town who had been drinking with them and with whom one of them had been seen they swore in general that merchant gave the provocation which savage and gregory drew their swords to justify that savage drew first and that he stabbed sinclair when he was not in a posture of defence or while gregory commanded his sword that after he had given the thrust he turned pale and would have retired but the maid clung round him and one of the company endeavoured to detain him from whom he broke by cutting the maid on the head but was afterwards taken in a court there was some difference in their depositions one did not see savage give the wound another saw it given when sinclair held his point towards the ground and the woman of the town asserted that she did not see sinclairs sword at all this difference however was very far from amounting to inconsistency but it was sufficient to show that the hurry of the dispute was such that it was not easy to discover the truth with relation to particular circumstances and that therefore some deductions were to be made from the credibility of the testimonies sinclair had declared several times before his death that he received his wound from savage nor did savage at his trial deny the fact but endeavoured partly to extenuate it by urging the suddenness of the whole action and the impossibility of any ill design or premeditated malice and partly to justify it by the necessity of selfdefence and the hazard of his own life if he had lost that opportunity of giving the thrust he observed that neither reason nor law obliged a man to wait for the blow which was threatened and which if he should suffer it he might never be able to return that it was allowable to prevent an assault and to preserve life by taking away that of the adversary by whom it was endangered with regard to the violence with which he endeavoured to escape he declared that it was not his design to fly from justice or decline a trial but to avoid the expenses and severities of a prison and that he intended to appear at the bar without compulsion this defence which took up more than an hour was heard by the multitude that thronged the court with the most attentive and respectful silence those who thought he ought not to be acquitted owned that applause could not be refused him and those who before pitied his misfortunes now reverenced his abilities the witnesses which appeared against him were proved to be persons of characters which did not entitle them to much credit a common strumpet a woman by whom strumpets were entertained a man by whom they were supported and the character of savage was by several persons of distinction asserted to be that of a modest inoffensive man not inclined to broils or to insolence and who had to that time been only known for his misfortunes and his wit had his audience been his judges he had undoubtedly been acquitted but mr page who was then upon the bench treated him with his usual insolence and severity and when he had summed up the evidence endeavoured to exasperate the jury as mr savage used to relate it with this eloquent harangue gentlemen of the jury you are to consider that mr savage is a very great man a much greater man than you or i gentlemen of the jury that he wears very fine clothes much finer clothes than you or i gentlemen of the jury that he has abundance of money in his pockets much more money than you or i gentlemen of the jury but gentlemen of the jury is it not a very hard case gentlemen of the jury that mr savage should therefore kill you or me gentlemen of the jury mr savage hearing his defence thus misrepresented and the men who were to decide his fate incited against him by invidious comparisons resolutely asserted that his cause was not candidly explained and began to recapitulate what he had before said with regard to his condition and the necessity of endeavouring to escape the expenses of imprisonment but the judge having ordered him to be silent and repeated his orders without effect commanded that he should be taken from the bar by force the jury then heard the opinion of the judge that good characters were of no weight against positive evidence though they might turn the scale where it was doubtful and that though when two men attack each other the death of either is only manslaughter but where one is the aggressor as in the case before them and in pursuance of his first attack kills the other the law supposes the action however sudden to be malicious they then deliberated upon their verdict and determined that mr savage and mr gregory were guilty of murder and mr merchant who had no sword only of manslaughter thus ended this memorable trial which lasted eight hours mr savage and mr gregory were conducted back to prison where they were more closely confined and loaded with irons of fifty pounds weight four days afterwards they were sent back to the court to receive sentence on which occasion mr savage made as far as it could be retained in memory the following speech it is now my lord too late to offer anything by way of defence or vindication nor can we expect from your lordships in this court but the sentence which the law requires you as judges to pronounce against men of our calamitous condition but we are also persuaded that as mere men and out of this seat of rigorous justice you are susceptive of the tender passions and too humane not to commiserate the unhappy situation of those whom the law sometimes perhaps exacts from you to pronounce upon no doubt you distinguish between offences which arise out of premeditation and a disposition habituated to vice or immorality and transgressions which are the unhappy and unforeseen effects of casual absence of reason and sudden impulse of passion we therefore hope you will contribute all you can to an extension of that mercy which the gentlemen of the jury have been pleased to show to mr merchant who allowing facts as sworn against us by the evidence has led us into this our calamity i hope this will not be construed as if we meant to reflect upon that gentleman or remove anything from us upon him or that we repine the more at our fate because he has no participation of it no my lord for my part i declare nothing could more soften my grief than to be without any companion in so great a misfortune mr savage had now no hopes of life but from the mercy of the crown which was very earnestly solicited by his friends and which with whatever difficulty the story may obtain belief was obstructed only by his mother to prejudice the queen against him she made use of an incident which was omitted in the order of time that it might be mentioned together with the purpose which it was made to serve mr savage when he had discovered his birth had an incessant desire to speak to his mother who always avoided him in public and refused him admission into her house one evening walking as was his custom in the street that she inhabited he saw the door of her house by accident open he entered it and finding no person in the passage to hinder him went upstairs to salute her she discovered him before he entered the chamber alarmed the family with the most distressful outcries and when she had by her screams gathered them about her ordered them to drive out of the house that villain who had forced himself in upon her and endeavoured to murder her savage who had attempted with the most submissive tenderness to soften her rage hearing her utter so detestable an accusation thought it prudent to retire and i believe never attempted afterwards to speak to her but shocked as he was with her falsehood and her cruelty he imagined that she intended no other use of her lie than to set herself free from his embraces and solicitations and was very far from suspecting that she would treasure it in her memory as an instrument of future wickedness or that she would endeavour for this fictitious assault to deprive him of his life but when the queen was solicited for his pardon and informed of the severe treatment which he had suffered from his judge she answered that however unjustifiable might be the manner of his trial or whatever extenuation the action for which he was condemned might admit she could not think that man a proper object of the kings mercy who had been capable of entering his mothers house in the night with an intent to murder her by whom this atrocious calumny had been transmitted to the queen whether she that invented had the front to relate it whether she found any one weak enough to credit it or corrupt enough to concur with her in her hateful design i know not but methods had been taken to persuade the queen so strongly of the truth of it that she for a long time refused to hear any one of those who petitioned for his life thus had savage perished by the evidence of a bawd a strumpet and his mother had not justice and compassion procured him an advocate of rank too great to be rejected unheard and of virtue too eminent to be heard without being believed his merit and his calamities happened to reach the ear of the countess of hertford who engaged in his support with all the tenderness that is excited by pity and all the zeal which is kindled by generosity and demanding an audience of the queen laid before her the whole series of his mothers cruelty exposed the improbability of an accusation by which he was charged with an intent to commit a murder that could produce no advantage and soon convinced her how little his former conduct could deserve to be mentioned as a reason for extraordinary severity the interposition of this lady was so successful that he was soon after admitted to bail and on the th of march pleaded the kings pardon it is natural to inquire upon what motives his mother could persecute him in a manner so outrageous and implacable for what reason she could employ all the arts of malice and all the snares of calumny to take away the life of her own son of a son who never injured her who was never supported by her expense nor obstructed any prospect of pleasure or advantage why she would endeavour to destroy him by a lie a lie which could not gain credit but must vanish of itself at the first moment of examination and of which only this can be said to make it probable that it may be observed from her conduct that the most execrable crimes are sometimes committed without apparent temptation this mother is still alive and may perhaps even yet though her malice was so often defeated enjoy the pleasure of reflecting that the life which she often endeavoured to destroy was at last shortened by her maternal offices that though she could not transport her son to the plantations bury him in the shop of a mechanic or hasten the hand of the public executioner she has yet had the satisfaction of embittering all his hours and forcing him into exigencies that hurried on his death it is by no means necessary to aggravate the enormity of this womans conduct by placing it in opposition to that of the countess of hertford no one can fail to observe how much more amiable it is to relieve than to oppress and to rescue innocence from destruction than to destroy without an injury mr savage during his imprisonment his trial and the time in which he lay under sentence of death behaved with great firmness and equality of mind and confirmed by his fortitude the esteem of those who before admired him for his abilities the peculiar circumstances of his life were made more generally known by a short account which was then published and of which several thousands were in a few weeks dispersed over the nation and the compassion of mankind operated so powerfully in his favour that he was enabled by frequent presents not only to support himself but to assist mr gregory in prison and when he was pardoned and released he found the number of his friends not lessened the nature of the act for which he had been tried was in itself doubtful of the evidences which appeared against him the character of the man was not unexceptionable that of the woman notoriously infamous she whose testimony chiefly influenced the jury to condemn him afterwards retracted her assertions he always himself denied that he was drunk as had been generally reported mr gregory who is now collector of antigua is said to declare him far less criminal than he was imagined even by some who favoured him and page himself afterwards confessed that he had treated him with uncommon rigour when all these particulars are rated together perhaps the memory of savage may not be much sullied by his trial some time after he obtained his liberty he met in the street the woman who had sworn with so much malignity against him she informed him that she was in distress and with a degree of confidence not easily attainable desired him to relieve her he instead of insulting her misery and taking pleasure in the calamities of one who had brought his life into danger reproved her gently for her perjury and changing the only guinea that he had divided it equally between her and himself this is an action which in some ages would have made a saint and perhaps in others a hero and which without any hyperbolical encomiums must be allowed to be an instance of uncommon generosity an act of complicated virtue by which he at once relieved the poor corrected the vicious and forgave an enemy by which he at once remitted the strongest provocations and exercised the most ardent charity compassion was indeed the distinguishing quality of savage he never appeared inclined to take advantage of weakness to attack the defenceless or to press upon the falling whoever was distressed was certain at least of his good wishes and when he could give no assistance to extricate them from misfortunes he endeavoured to soothe them by sympathy and tenderness but when his heart was not softened by the sight of misery he was sometimes obstinate in his resentment and did not quickly lose the remembrance of an injury he always continued to speak with anger of the insolence and partiality of page and a short time before his death revenged it by a satire it is natural to inquire in what terms mr savage spoke of this fatal action when the danger was over and he was under no necessity of using any art to set his conduct in the fairest light he was not willing to dwell upon it and if he transiently mentioned it appeared neither to consider himself as a murderer nor as a man wholly free from the guilt of blood how much and how long he regretted it appeared in a poem which he published many years afterwards on occasion of a copy of verses in which the failings of good men are recounted and in which the author had endeavoured to illustrate his position that the best may sometimes deviate from virtue by an instance of murder committed by savage in the heat of wine savage remarked that it was no very just representation of a good man to suppose him liable to drunkenness and disposed in his riots to cut throats he was now indeed at liberty but was as before without any other support than accidental favours and uncertain patronage afforded him sources by which he was sometimes very liberally supplied and which at other times were suddenly stopped so that he spent his life between want and plenty or what was yet worse between beggary and extravagance for as whatever he received was the gift of chance which might as well favour him at one time as another he was tempted to squander what he had because he always hoped to be immediately supplied another cause of his profusion was the absurd kindness of his friends who at once rewarded and enjoyed his abilities by treating him at taverns and habituating him to pleasures which he could not afford to enjoy and which he was not able to deny himself though he purchased the luxury of a single night by the anguish of cold and hunger for a week the experience of these inconveniences determined him to endeavour after some settled income which having long found submission and entreaties fruitless he attempted to extort from his mother by rougher methods he had now as he acknowledged lost that tenderness for her which the whole series of her cruelty had not been able wholly to repress till he found by the efforts which she made for his destruction that she was not content with refusing to assist him and being neutral in his struggles with poverty but was ready to snatch every opportunity of adding to his misfortunes and that she was now to be considered as an enemy implacably malicious whom nothing but his blood could satisfy he therefore threatened to harass her with lampoons and to publish a copious narrative of her conduct unless she consented to purchase an exemption from infamy by allowing him a pension this expedient proved successful whether shame still survived though virtue was extinct or whether her relations had more delicacy than herself and imagined that some of the darts which satire might point at her would glance upon them lord tyrconnel whatever were his motives upon his promise to lay aside his design of exposing the cruelty of his mother received him into his family treated him as his equal and engaged to allow him a pension of two hundred pounds a year this was the golden part of mr savages life and for some time he had no reason to complain of fortune his appearance was splendid his expenses large and his acquaintance extensive he was courted by all who endeavoured to be thought men of genius and caressed by all who valued themselves upon a refined taste to admire mr savage was a proof of discernment and to be acquainted with him was a title to poetical reputation his presence was sufficient to make any place of public entertainment popular and his approbation and example constituted the fashion so powerful is genius when it is invested with the glitter of affluence men willingly pay to fortune that regard which they owe to merit and are pleased when they have an opportunity at once of gratifying their vanity and practising their duty this interval of prosperity furnished him with opportunities of enlarging his knowledge of human nature by contemplating life from its highest gradations to its lowest and had he afterwards applied to dramatic poetry he would perhaps not have had many superiors for as he never suffered any scene to pass before his eyes without notice he had treasured in his mind all the different combinations of passions and the innumerable mixtures of vice and virtue which distinguished one character from another and as his conception was strong his expressions were clear he easily received impressions from objects and very forcibly transmitted them to others of his exact observations on human life he has left a proof which would do honour to the greatest names in a small pamphlet called the author to be let where he introduces iscariot hackney a prostitute scribbler giving an account of his birth his education his disposition and morals habits of life and maxims of conduct in the introduction are related many secret histories of the petty writers of that time but sometimes mixed with ungenerous reflections on their birth their circumstances or those of their relations nor can it be denied that some passages are such as iscariot hackney might himself have produced he was accused likewise of living in an appearance of friendship with some whom he satirised and of making use of the confidence which he gained by a seeming kindness to discover failings and expose them it must be confessed that mr savages esteem was no very certain possession and that he would lampoon at one time those whom he had praised at another it may be alleged that the same man may change his principles and that he who was once deservedly commended may be afterwards satirised with equal justice or that the poet was dazzled with the appearance of virtue and found the man whom he had celebrated when he had an opportunity of examining him more narrowly unworthy of the panegyric which he had too hastily bestowed and that as a false satire ought to be recanted for the sake of him whose reputation may be injured false praise ought likewise to be obviated lest the distinction between vice and virtue should be lost lest a bad man should be trusted upon the credit of his encomiast or lest others should endeavour to obtain like praises by the same means but though these excuses may be often plausible and sometimes just they are very seldom satisfactory to mankind and the writer who is not constant to his subject quickly sinks into contempt his satire loses its force and his panegyric its value and he is only considered at one time as a flatterer and a calumniator at another to avoid these imputations it is only necessary to follow the rules of virtue and to preserve an unvaried regard to truth for though it is undoubtedly possible that a man however cautious may be sometimes deceived by an artful appearance of virtue or by false evidences of guilt such errors will not be frequent and it will be allowed that the name of an author would never have been made contemptible had no man ever said what he did not think or misled others but when he was himself deceived the author to be let was first published in a single pamphlet and afterwards inserted in a collection of pieces relating to the dunciad which were addressed by mr savage to the earl of middlesex in a dedication which he was prevailed upon to sign though he did not write it and in which there are some positions that the true author would perhaps not have published under his own name and on which mr savage afterwards reflected with no great satisfaction the enumeration of the bad effects of the uncontrolled freedom of the press and the assertion that the liberties taken by the writers of journals with their superiors were exorbitant and unjustifiable very ill became men who have themselves not always shown the exactest regard to the laws of subordination in their writings and who have often satirised those that at least thought themselves their superiors as they were eminent for their hereditary rank and employed in the highest offices of the kingdom but this is only an instance of that partiality which almost every man indulges with regard to himself the liberty of the press is a blessing when we are inclined to write against others and a calamity when we find ourselves overborne by the multitude of our assailants as the power of the crown is always thought too great by those who suffer by its influence and too little by those in whose favour it is exerted and a standing army is generally accounted necessary by those who command and dangerous and oppressive by those who support it mr savage was likewise very far from believing that the letters annexed to each species of bad poets in the bathos were as he was directed to assert set down at random for when he was charged by one of his friends with putting his name to such an improbability he had no other answer to make than that he did not think of it and his friend had too much tenderness to reply that next to the crime of writing contrary to what he thought was that of writing without thinking after having remarked what is false in this dedication it is proper that i observe the impartiality which i recommend by declaring what savage asserted that the account of the circumstances which attended the publication of the dunciad however strange and improbable was exactly true the publication of this piece at this time raised mr savage a great number of enemies among those that were attacked by mr pope with whom he was considered as a kind of confederate and whom he was suspected of supplying with private intelligence and secret incidents so that the ignominy of an informer was added to the terror of a satirist that he was not altogether free from literary hypocrisy and that he sometimes spoke one thing and wrote another cannot be denied because he himself confessed that when he lived with great familiarity with dennis he wrote an epigram against him mr savage however set all the malice of all the pigmy writers at defiance and thought the friendship of mr pope cheaply purchased by being exposed to their censure and their hatred nor had he any reason to repent of the preference for he found mr pope a steady and unalienable friend almost to the end of his life about this time notwithstanding his avowed neutrality with regard to party he published a panegyric on sir robert walpole for which he was rewarded by him with twenty guineas a sum not very large if either the excellence of the performance or the affluence of the patron be considered but greater than he afterwards obtained from a person of yet higher rank and more desirous in appearance of being distinguished as a patron of literature as he was very far from approving the conduct of sir robert walpole and in conversation mentioned him sometimes with acrimony and generally with contempt as he was one of those who were always zealous in their assertions of the justice of the late opposition jealous of the rights of the people and alarmed by the longcontinued triumph of the court it was natural to ask him what could induce him to employ his poetry in praise of that man who was in his opinion an enemy to liberty and an oppressor of his country he alleged that he was then dependent upon the lord tyrconnel who was an implicit follower of the ministry and that being enjoined by him not without menaces to write in praise of the leader he had not resolution sufficient to sacrifice the pleasure of affluence to that of integrity on this and on many other occasions he was ready to lament the misery of living at the tables of other men which was his fate from the beginning to the end of his life for i know not whether he ever had for three months together a settled habitation in which he could claim a right of residence to this unhappy state it is just to impute much of the inconsistency of his conduct for though a readiness to comply with the inclinations of others was no part of his natural character yet he was sometimes obliged to relax his obstinacy and submit his own judgment and even his virtue to the government of those by whom he was supported so that if his miseries were sometimes the consequences of his faults he ought not yet to be wholly excluded from compassion because his faults were very often the effects of his misfortunes in this gay period of his life while he was surrounded by affluence and pleasure he published the wanderer a moral poem of which the design is comprised in these lines i fly all public care all venal strife to try the still compared with active life to prove by these the sons of men may owe the fruits of bliss to bursting clouds of woe that evn calamity by thought refined inspirits and adorns the thinking mind and more distinctly in the following passage by woe the soul to daring action swells by woe in plaintless patience it excels from patience prudent clear experience springs and traces knowledge through the course of things thence hope is formed thence fortitude success renown whateer men covet and caress this performance was always considered by himself as his masterpiece and mr pope when he asked his opinion of it told him that he read it once over and was not displeased with it that it gave him more pleasure at the second perusal and delighted him still more at the third it has been generally objected to the wanderer that the disposition of the parts is irregular that the design is obscure and the plan perplexed that the images however beautiful succeed each other without order and that the whole performance is not so much a regular fabric as a heap of shining materials thrown together by accident which strikes rather with the solemn magnificence of a stupendous ruin than the elegant grandeur of a finished pile this criticism is universal and therefore it is reasonable to believe it at least in a degree just but mr savage was always of a contrary opinion and thought his drift could only be missed by negligence or stupidity and that the whole plan was regular and the parts distinct it was never denied to abound with strong representations of nature and just observations upon life and it may easily be observed that most of his pictures have an evident tendency to illustrate his first great position that good is the consequence of evil the sun that burns up the mountains fructifies the vales the deluge that rushes down the broken rocks with dreadful impetuosity is separated into purling brooks and the rage of the hurricane purifies the air even in this poem he has not been able to forbear one touch upon the cruelty of his mother which though remarkably delicate and tender is a proof how deep an impression it had upon his mind this must be at least acknowledged which ought to be thought equivalent to many other excellences that this poem can promote no other purposes than those of virtue and that it is written with a very strong sense of the efficacy of religion but my province is rather to give the history of mr savages performances than to display their beauties or to obviate the criticisms which they have occasioned and therefore i shall not dwell upon the particular passages which deserve applause i shall neither show the excellence of his descriptions nor expatiate on the terrific portrait of suicide nor point out the artful touches by which he has distinguished the intellectual features of the rebels who suffer death in his last canto it is however proper to observe that mr savage always declared the characters wholly fictitious and without the least allusion to any real persons or actions from a poem so diligently laboured and so successfully finished it might be reasonably expected that he should have gained considerable advantage nor can it without some degree of indignation and concern be told that he sold the copy for ten guineas of which he afterwards returned two that the two last sheets of the work might be reprinted of which he had in his absence entrusted the correction to a friend who was too indolent to perform it with accuracy a superstitious regard to the correction of his sheets was one of mr savages peculiarities he often altered revised recurred to his first reading or punctuation and again adopted the alteration he was dubious and irresolute without end as on a question of the last importance and at last was seldom satisfied the intrusion or omission of a comma was sufficient to discompose him and he would lament an error of a single letter as a heavy calamity in one of his letters relating to an impression of some verses he remarks that he had with regard to the correction of the proof a spell upon him and indeed the anxiety with which he dwelt upon the minutest and most trifling niceties deserved no other name than that of fascination that he sold so valuable a performance for so small a price was not to be imputed either to necessity by which the learned and ingenious are often obliged to submit to very hard conditions or to avarice by which the booksellers are frequently incited to oppress that genius by which they are supported but to that intemperate desire of pleasure and habitual slavery to his passions which involved him in many perplexities he happened at that time to be engaged in the pursuit of some trifling gratification and being without money for the present occasion sold his poem to the first bidder and perhaps for the first price that was proposed and would probably have been content with less if less had been offered him this poem was addressed to the lord tyrconnel not only in the first lines but in a formal dedication filled with the highest strains of panegyric and the warmest professions of gratitude but by no means remarkable for delicacy of connection or elegance of style these praises in a short time he found himself inclined to retract being discarded by the man on whom he had bestowed them and whom he then immediately discovered not to have deserved them of this quarrel which every day made more bitter lord tyrconnel and mr savage assigned very different reasons which might perhaps all in reality concur though they were not all convenient to be alleged by either party lord tyrconnel affirmed that it was the constant practice of mr savage to enter a tavern with any company that proposed it drink the most expensive wines with great profusion and when the reckoning was demanded to be without money if as it often happened his company were willing to defray his part the affair ended without any ill consequences but if they were refractory and expected that the wine should be paid for by him that drank it his method of composition was to take them with him to his own apartment assume the government of the house and order the butler in an imperious manner to set the best wine in the cellar before his company who often drank till they forgot the respect due to the house in which they were entertained indulged themselves in the utmost extravagance of merriment practised the most licentious frolics and committed all the outrages of drunkenness nor was this the only charge which lord tyrconnel brought against him having given him a collection of valuable books stamped with his own arms he had the mortification to see them in a short time exposed to sale upon the stalls it being usual with mr savage when he wanted a small sum to take his books to the pawnbroker whoever was acquainted with mr savage easily credited both these accusations for having been obliged from his first entrance into the world to subsist upon expedients affluence was not able to exalt him above them and so much was he delighted with wine and conversation and so long had he been accustomed to live by chance that he would at any time go to the tavern without scruple and trust for the reckoning to the liberality of his company and frequently of company to whom he was very little known this conduct indeed very seldom drew upon him those inconveniences that might be feared by any other person for his conversation was so entertaining and his address so pleasing that few thought the pleasure which they received from him dearly purchased by paying for his wine it was his peculiar happiness that he scarcely ever found a stranger whom he did not leave a friend but it must likewise be added that he had not often a friend long without obliging him to become a stranger mr savage on the other hand declared that lord tyrconnel quarrelled with him because he would not subtract from his own luxury and extravagance what he had promised to allow him and that his resentment was only a plea for the violation of his promise he asserted that he had done nothing that ought to exclude him from that subsistence which he thought not so much a favour as a debt since it was offered him upon conditions which he had never broken and that his only fault was that he could not be supported with nothing he acknowledged that lord tyrconnel often exhorted him to regulate his method of life and not to spend all his nights in taverns and that he appeared desirous that he would pass those hours with him which he so freely bestowed upon others this demand mr savage considered as a censure of his conduct which he could never patiently bear and which in the latter and cooler parts of his life was so offensive to him that he declared it as his resolution to spurn that friend who should pretend to dictate to him and it is not likely that in his earlier years he received admonitions with more calmness he was likewise inclined to resent such expectations as tending to infringe his liberty of which he was very jealous when it was necessary to the gratification of his passions and declared that the request was still more unreasonable as the company to which he was to have been confined was insupportably disagreeable this assertion affords another instance of that inconsistency of his writings with his conversation which was so often to be observed he forgot how lavishly he had in his dedication to the wanderer extolled the delicacy and penetration the humanity and generosity the candour and politeness of the man whom when he no longer loved him he declared to be a wretch without understanding without good nature and without justice of whose name he thought himself obliged to leave no trace in any future edition of his writings and accordingly blotted it out of that copy of the wanderer which was in his hands during his continuance with the lord tyrconnel he wrote the triumph of health and mirth on the recovery of lady tyrconnel from a languishing illness this performance is remarkable not only for the gaiety of the ideas and the melody of the numbers but for the agreeable fiction upon which it is formed mirth overwhelmed with sorrow for the sickness of her favourite takes a flight in quest of her sister health whom she finds reclined upon the brow of a lofty mountain amidst the fragrance of perpetual spring with the breezes of the morning sporting about her being solicited by her sister mirth she readily promises her assistance flies away in a cloud and impregnates the waters of bath with new virtues by which the sickness of belinda is relieved as the reputation of his abilities the particular circumstances of his birth and life the splendour of his appearance and the distinction which was for some time paid him by lord tyrconnel entitled him to familiarity with persons of higher rank than those to whose conversation he had been before admitted he did not fail to gratify that curiosity which induced him to take a nearer view of those whom their birth their employments or their fortunes necessarily placed at a distance from the greatest part of mankind and to examine whether their merit was magnified or diminished by the medium through which it was contemplated whether the splendour with which they dazzled their admirers was inherent in themselves or only reflected on them by the objects that surrounded them and whether great men were selected for high stations or high stations made great men for this purpose he took all opportunities of conversing familiarly with those who were most conspicuous at that time for their power or their influence he watched their looser moments and examined their domestic behaviour with that acuteness which nature had given him and which the uncommon variety of his life had contributed to increase and that inquisitiveness which must always be produced in a vigorous mind by an absolute freedom from all pressing or domestic engagements his discernment was quick and therefore he soon found in every person and in every affair something that deserved attention he was supported by others without any care for himself and was therefore at leisure to pursue his observations more circumstances to constitute a critic on human life could not easily concur nor indeed could any man who assumed from accidental advantages more praise than he could justly claim from his real merit admit any acquaintance more dangerous than that of savage of whom likewise it must be confessed that abilities really exalted above the common level or virtue refined from passion or proof against corruption could not easily find an abler judge or a warmer advocate what was the result of mr savages inquiry though he was not much accustomed to conceal his discoveries it may not be entirely safe to relate because the persons whose characters he criticised are powerful and power and resentment are seldom strangers nor would it perhaps be wholly just because what he asserted in conversation might though true in general be heightened by some momentary ardour of imagination and as it can be delivered only from memory may be imperfectly represented so that the picture at first aggravated and then unskilfully copied may be justly suspected to retain no great resemblance of the original it may however be observed that he did not appear to have formed very elevated ideas of those to whom the administration of affairs or the conduct of parties has been intrusted who have been considered as the advocates of the crown or the guardians of the people and who have obtained the most implicit confidence and the loudest applauses of one particular person who has been at one time so popular as to be generally esteemed and at another so formidable as to be universally detested he observed that his acquisitions had been small or that his capacity was narrow and that the whole range of his mind was from obscenity to politics and from politics to obscenity but the opportunity of indulging his speculations on great characters was now at an end he was banished from the table of lord tyrconnel and turned again adrift upon the world without prospect of finding quickly any other harbour as prudence was not one of the virtues by which he was distinguished he made no provision against a misfortune like this and though it is not to be imagined but that the separation must for some time have been preceded by coldness peevishness or neglect though it was undoubtedly the consequence of accumulated provocations on both sides yet every one that knew savage will readily believe that to him it was sudden as a stroke of thunder that though he might have transiently suspected it he had never suffered any thought so unpleasing to sink into his mind but that he had driven it away by amusements or dreams of future felicity and affluence and had never taken any measures by which he might prevent a precipitation from plenty to indigence this quarrel and separation and the difficulties to which mr savage was exposed by them were soon known both to his friends and enemies nor was it long before he perceived from the behaviour of both how much is added to the lustre of genius by the ornaments of wealth his condition did not appear to excite much compassion for he had not been always careful to use the advantages he enjoyed with that moderation which ought to have been with more than usual caution preserved by him who knew if he had reflected that he was only a dependent on the bounty of another whom he could expect to support him no longer than he endeavoured to preserve his favour by complying with his inclinations and whom he nevertheless set at defiance and was continually irritating by negligence or encroachments examples need not be sought at any great distance to prove that superiority of fortune has a natural tendency to kindle pride and that pride seldom fails to exert itself in contempt and insult and if this is often the effect of hereditary wealth and of honours enjoyed only by the merits of others it is some extenuation of any indecent triumphs to which this unhappy man may have been betrayed that his prosperity was heightened by the force of novelty and made more intoxicating by a sense of the misery in which he had so long languished and perhaps of the insults which he had formerly borne and which he might now think himself entitled to revenge it is too common for those who have unjustly suffered pain to inflict it likewise in their turn with the same injustice and to imagine that they have a right to treat others as they have themselves been treated that mr savage was too much elevated by any good fortune is generally known and some passages of his introduction to the author to be let sufficiently show that he did not wholly refrain from such satire as he afterwards thought very unjust when he was exposed to it himself for when he was afterwards ridiculed in the character of a distressed poet he very easily discovered that distress was not a proper subject for merriment or topic of invective he was then able to discern that if misery be the effect of virtue it ought to be reverenced if of ill fortune to be pitied and if of vice not to be insulted because it is perhaps itself a punishment adequate to the crime by which it was produced and the humanity of that man can deserve no panegyric who is capable of reproaching a criminal in the hands of the executioner but these reflections though they readily occurred to him in the first and last parts of his life were i am afraid for a long time forgotten at least they were like many other maxims treasured up in his mind rather for show than use and operated very little upon his conduct however elegantly he might sometimes explain or however forcibly he might inculcate them his degradation therefore from the condition which he had enjoyed with such wanton thoughtlessness was considered by many as an occasion of triumph those who had before paid their court to him without success soon returned the contempt which they had suffered and they who had received favours from him for of such favours as he could bestow he was very liberal did not always remember them so much more certain are the effects of resentment than of gratitude it is not only to many more pleasing to recollect those faults which place others below them than those virtues by which they are themselves comparatively depressed but it is likewise more easy to neglect than to recompense and though there are few who will practise a laborious virtue there will never be wanting multitudes that will indulge in easy vice savage however was very little disturbed at the marks of contempt which his ill fortune brought upon him from those whom he never esteemed and with whom he never considered himself as levelled by any calamities and though it was not without some uneasiness that he saw some whose friendship he valued change their behaviour he yet observed their coldness without much emotion considered them as the slaves of fortune and the worshippers of prosperity and was more inclined to despise them than to lament himself it does not appear that after this return of his wants he found mankind equally favourable to him as at his first appearance in the world his story though in reality not less melancholy was less affecting because it was no longer new it therefore procured him no new friends and those that had formerly relieved him thought they might now consign him to others he was now likewise considered by many rather as criminal than as unhappy for the friends of lord tyrconnel and of his mother were sufficiently industrious to publish his weaknesses which were indeed very numerous and nothing was forgotten that might make him either hateful or ridiculous it cannot but be imagined that such representations of his faults must make great numbers less sensible of his distress many who had only an opportunity to hear one part made no scruple to propagate the account which they received many assisted their circulation from malice or revenge and perhaps many pretended to credit them that they might with a better grace withdraw their regard or withhold their assistance savage however was not one of those who suffered himself to be injured without resistance nor was he less diligent in exposing the faults of lord tyrconnel over whom he obtained at least this advantage that he drove him first to the practice of outrage and violence for he was so much provoked by the wit and virulence of savage that he came with a number of attendants that did no honour to his courage to beat him at a coffeehouse but it happened that he had left the place a few minutes and his lordship had without danger the pleasure of boasting how he would have treated him mr savage went next day to repay his visit at his own house but was prevailed on by his domestics to retire without insisting on seeing him lord tyrconnel was accused by mr savage of some actions which scarcely any provocation will be thought sufficient to justify such as seizing what he had in his lodgings and other instances of wanton cruelty by which he increased the distress of savage without any advantage to himself these mutual accusations were retorted on both sides for many years with the utmost degree of virulence and rage and time seemed rather to augment than diminish their resentment that the anger of mr savage should be kept alive is not strange because he felt every day the consequences of the quarrel but it might reasonably have been hoped that lord tyrconnel might have relented and at length have forgot those provocations which however they might have once inflamed him had not in reality much hurt him the spirit of mr savage indeed never suffered him to solicit a reconciliation he returned reproach for reproach and insult for insult his superiority of wit supplied the disadvantages of his fortune and enabled him to form a party and prejudice great numbers in his favour but though this might be some gratification of his vanity it afforded very little relief to his necessities and he was frequently reduced to uncommon hardships of which however he never made any mean or importunate complaints being formed rather to bear misery with fortitude than enjoy prosperity with moderation he now thought himself again at liberty to expose the cruelty of his mother and therefore i believe about this time published the bastard a poem remarkable for the vivacious sallies of thought in the beginning where he makes a pompous enumeration of the imaginary advantages of base birth and the pathetic sentiments at the end where he recounts the real calamities which he suffered by the crime of his parents the vigour and spirit of the verses the peculiar circumstances of the author the novelty of the subject and the notoriety of the story to which the allusions are made procured this performance a very favourable reception great numbers were immediately dispersed and editions were multiplied with unusual rapidity one circumstance attended the publication which savage used to relate with great satisfaction his mother to whom the poem was with due reverence inscribed happened then to be at bath where she could not conveniently retire from censure or conceal herself from observation and no sooner did the reputation of the poem begin to spread than she heard it repeated in all places of concourse nor could she enter the assemblyrooms or cross the walks without being saluted with some lines from the bastard this was perhaps the first time that she ever discovered a sense of shame and on this occasion the power of wit was very conspicuous the wretch who had without scruple proclaimed herself an adulteress and who had first endeavoured to starve her son then to transport him and afterwards to hang him was not able to bear the representation of her own conduct but fled from reproach though she felt no pain from guilt and left bath in the utmost haste to shelter herself among the crowds of london thus savage had the satisfaction of finding that though he could not reform his mother he could punish her and that he did not always suffer alone the pleasure which he received from this increase of his poetical reputation was sufficient for some time to overbalance the miseries of want which this performance did not much alleviate for it was sold for a very trivial sum to a bookseller who though the success was so uncommon that five impressions were sold of which many were undoubtedly very numerous had not generosity sufficient to admit the unhappy writer to any part of the profit the sale of this poem was always mentioned by mr savage with the utmost elevation of heart and referred to by him as an incontestable proof of a general acknowledgment of his abilities it was indeed the only production of which he could justly boast a general reception but though he did not lose the opportunity which success gave him of setting a high rate on his abilities but paid due deference to the suffrages of mankind when they were given in his favour he did not suffer his esteem of himself to depend upon others nor found anything sacred in the voice of the people when they were inclined to censure him he then readily showed the folly of expecting that the public should judge right observed how slowly poetical merit had often forced its way into the world he contented himself with the applause of men of judgment and was somewhat disposed to exclude all those from the character of men of judgment who did not applaud him but he was at other times more favourable to mankind than to think them blind to the beauties of his works and imputed the slowness of their sale to other causes either they were published at a time when the town was empty or when the attention of the public was engrossed by some struggle in the parliament or some other object of general concern or they were by the neglect of the publisher not diligently dispersed or by his avarice not advertised with sufficient frequency address or industry or liberality was always wanting and the blame was laid rather on any person than the author by arts like these arts which every man practises in some degree and to which too much of the little tranquillity of life is to be ascribed savage was always able to live at peace with himself had he indeed only made use of these expedients to alleviate the loss or want of fortune or reputation or any other advantages which it is not in a mans power to bestow upon himself they might have been justly mentioned as instances of a philosophical mind and very properly proposed to the imitation of multitudes who for want of diverting their imaginations with the same dexterity languish under afflictions which might be easily removed it were doubtless to be wished that truth and reason were universally prevalent that everything were esteemed according to its real value and that men would secure themselves from being disappointed in their endeavours after happiness by placing it only in virtue which is always to be obtained but if adventitious and foreign pleasures must be pursued it would be perhaps of some benefit since that pursuit must frequently be fruitless if the practice of savage could be taught that folly might be an antidote to folly and one fallacy be obviated by another but the danger of this pleasing intoxication must not be concealed nor indeed can any one after having observed the life of savage need to be cautioned against it by imputing none of his miseries to himself he continued to act upon the same principles and to follow the same path was never made wiser by his sufferings nor preserved by one misfortune from falling into another he proceeded throughout his life to tread the same steps on the same circle always applauding his past conduct or at least forgetting it to amuse himself with phantoms of happiness which were dancing before him and willingly turned his eyes from the light of reason when it would have discovered the illusion and shown him what he never wished to see his real state he is even accused after having lulled his imagination with those ideal opiates of having tried the same experiment upon his conscience and having accustomed himself to impute all deviations from the right to foreign causes it is certain that he was upon every occasion too easily reconciled to himself and that he appeared very little to regret those practices which had impaired his reputation the reigning error of his life was that he mistook the love for the practice of virtue and was indeed not so much a good man as the friend of goodness this at least must be allowed him that he always preserved a strong sense of the dignity the beauty and the necessity of virtue and that he never contributed deliberately to spread corruption amongst mankind his actions which were generally precipitate were often blameable but his writings being the production of study uniformly tended to the exaltation of the mind and the propagation of morality and piety these writings may improve mankind when his failings shall be forgotten and therefore he must be considered upon the whole as a benefactor to the world nor can his personal example do any hurt since whoever hears of his faults will hear of the miseries which they brought upon him and which would deserve less pity had not his condition been such as made his faults pardonable he may be considered as a child exposed to all the temptations of indigence at an age when resolution was not yet strengthened by conviction nor virtue confirmed by habit a circumstance which in his bastard he laments in a very affecting manner no mothers care shielded my infant innocence with prayer no fathers guardian hand my youth maintained called forth my virtues or from vice restrained the bastard however it might provoke or mortify his mother could not be expected to melt her to compassion so that he was still under the same want of the necessaries of life and he therefore exerted all the interest which his wit or his birth or his misfortunes could procure to obtain upon the death of eusden the place of poet laureate and prosecuted his application with so much diligence that the king publicly declared it his intention to bestow it upon him but such was the fate of savage that even the king when he intended his advantage was disappointed in his schemes for the lord chamberlain who has the disposal of the laurel as one of the appendages of his office either did not know the kings design or did not approve it or thought the nomination of the laureate an encroachment upon his rights and therefore bestowed the laurel upon colley cibber mr savage thus disappointed took a resolution of applying to the queen that having once given him life she would enable him to support it and therefore published a short poem on her birthday to which he gave the odd title of volunteer laureate the event of this essay he has himself related in the following letter which he prefixed to the poem when he afterwards reprinted it in the gentlemans magazine whence i have copied it entire as this was one of the few attempts in which mr savage succeeded mr urban in your magazine for february you published the last volunteer laureate written on a very melancholy occasion the death of the royal patroness of arts and literature in general and of the author of that poem in particular i now send you the first that mr savage wrote under that title this gentleman notwithstanding a very considerable interest being on the death of mr eusden disappointed of the laureates place wrote the following verses which were no sooner published but the late queen sent to a bookseller for them the author had not at that time a friend either to get him introduced or his poem presented at court yet such was the unspeakable goodness of that princess that notwithstanding this act of ceremony was wanting in a few days after publication mr savage received a bankbill of fifty pounds and a gracious message from her majesty by the lord north and guilford to this effect that her majesty was highly pleased with the verses that she took particularly kind his lines there relating to the king that he had permission to write annually on the same subject and that he should yearly receive the like present till something better which was her majestys intention could be done for him after this he was permitted to present one of his annual poems to her majesty had the honour of kissing her hand and met with the most gracious reception yours etc such was the performance and such its reception a reception which though by no means unkind was yet not in the highest degree generous to chain down the genius of a writer to an annual panegyric showed in the queen too much desire of hearing her own praises and a greater regard to herself than to him on whom her bounty was conferred it was a kind of avaricious generosity by which flattery was rather purchased than genius rewarded mrs oldfield had formerly given him the same allowance with much more heroic intention she had no other view than to enable him to prosecute his studies and to set himself above the want of assistance and was contented with doing good without stipulating for encomiums mr savage however was not at liberty to make exceptions but was ravished with the favours which he had received and probably yet more with those which he was promised he considered himself now as a favourite of the queen and did not doubt but a few annual poems would establish him in some profitable employment he therefore assumed the title of volunteer laureate not without some reprehensions from cibber who informed him that the title of laureate was a mark of honour conferred by the king from whom all honour is derived and which therefore no man has a right to bestow upon himself and added that he might with equal propriety style himself a volunteer lord or volunteer baronet it cannot be denied that the remark was just but savage did not think any title which was conferred upon mr cibber so honourable as that the usurpation of it could be imputed to him as an instance of very exorbitant vanity and therefore continued to write under the same title and received every year the same reward he did not appear to consider these encomiums as tests of his abilities or as anything more than annual hints to the queen of her promise or acts of ceremony by the performance of which he was entitled to his pension and therefore did not labour them with great diligence or print more than fifty each year except that for some of the last years he regularly inserted them in the gentlemans magazine by which they were dispersed over the kingdom of some of them he had himself so low an opinion that he intended to omit them in the collection of poems for which he printed proposals and solicited subscriptions nor can it seem strange that being confined to the same subject he should be at some times indolent and at others unsuccessful that he should sometimes delay a disagreeable task till it was too late to perform it well or that he should sometimes repeat the same sentiment on the same occasion or at others be misled by an attempt after novelty to forced conceptions and farfetched images he wrote indeed with a double intention which supplied him with some variety for his business was to praise the queen for the favours which he had received and to complain to her of the delay of those which she had promised in some of his pieces therefore gratitude is predominant and in some discontent in some he represents himself as happy in her patronage and in others as disconsolate to find himself neglected her promise like other promises made to this unfortunate man was never performed though he took sufficient care that it should not be forgotten the publication of his volunteer laureate procured him no other reward than a regular remittance of fifty pounds he was not so depressed by his disappointments as to neglect any opportunity that was offered of advancing his interest when the princess anne was married he wrote a poem upon her departure only as he declared because it was expected from him and he was not willing to bar his own prospects by any appearance of neglect he never mentioned any advantage gained by this poem or any regard that was paid to it and therefore it is likely that it was considered at court as an act of duty to which he was obliged by his dependence and which it was therefore not necessary to reward by any new favour or perhaps the queen really intended his advancement and therefore thought it superfluous to lavish presents upon a man whom she intended to establish for life about this time not only his hopes were in danger of being frustrated but his pension likewise of being obstructed by an accidental calumny the writer of the daily courant a paper then published under the direction of the ministry charged him with a crime which though very great in itself would have been remarkably invidious in him and might very justly have incensed the queen against him he was accused by name of influencing elections against the court by appearing at the head of a tory mob nor did the accuser fail to aggravate his crime by representing it as the effect of the most atrocious ingratitude and a kind of rebellion against the queen who had first preserved him from an infamous death and afterwards distinguished him by her favour and supported him by her charity the charge as it was open and confident was likewise by good fortune very particular the place of the transaction was mentioned and the whole series of the rioters conduct related this exactness made mr savages vindication easy for he never had in his life seen the place which was declared to be the scene of his wickedness nor ever had been present in any town when its representatives were chosen this answer he therefore made haste to publish with all the circumstances necessary to make it credible and very reasonably demanded that the accusation should be retracted in the same paper that he might no longer suffer the imputation of sedition and ingratitude this demand was likewise pressed by him in a private letter to the author of the paper who either trusting to the protection of those whose defence he had undertaken or having entertained some personal malice against mr savage or fearing lest by retracting so confident an assertion he should impair the credit of his paper refused to give him that satisfaction mr savage therefore thought it necessary to his own vindication to prosecute him in the kings bench but as he did not find any ill effects from the accusation having sufficiently cleared his innocence he thought any further procedure would have the appearance of revenge and therefore willingly dropped it he saw soon afterwards a process commenced in the same court against himself on an information in which he was accused of writing and publishing an obscene pamphlet it was always mr savages desire to be distinguished and when any controversy became popular he never wanted some reason for engaging in it with great ardour and appearing at the head of the party which he had chosen as he was never celebrated for his prudence he had no sooner taken his side and informed himself of the chief topics of the dispute than he took all opportunities of asserting and propagating his principles without much regard to his own interest or any other visible design than that of drawing upon himself the attention of mankind the dispute between the bishop of london and the chancellor is well known to have been for some time the chief topic of political conversation and therefore mr savage in pursuance of his character endeavoured to become conspicuous among the controvertists with which every coffeehouse was filled on that occasion he was an indefatigable opposer of all the claims of ecclesiastical power though he did not know on what they were founded and was therefore no friend to the bishop of london but he had another reason for appearing as a warm advocate for dr rundle for he was the friend of mr foster and mr thomson who were the friends of mr savage thus remote was his interest in the question which however as he imagined concerned him so nearly that it was not sufficient to harangue and dispute but necessary likewise to write upon it he therefore engaged with great ardour in a new poem called by him the progress of a divine in which he conducts a profligate priest by all the gradations of wickedness from a poor curacy in the country to the highest preferments of the church and describes with that humour which was natural to him and that knowledge which was extended to all the diversities of human life his behaviour in every station and insinuates that this priest thus accomplished found at last a patron in the bishop of london when he was asked by one of his friends on what pretence he could charge the bishop with such an action he had no more to say than that he had only inverted the accusation and that he thought it reasonable to believe that he who obstructed the rise of a good man without reason would for bad reasons promote the exaltation of a villain the clergy were universally provoked by this satire and savage who as was his constant practice had set his name to his performance was censured in the weekly miscellany with severity which he did not seem inclined to forget but return of invective was not thought a sufficient punishment the court of kings bench was therefore moved against him and he was obliged to return an answer to a charge of obscenity it was urged in his defence that obscenity was criminal when it was intended to promote the practice of vice but that mr savage had only introduced obscene ideas with the view of exposing them to detestation and of amending the age by showing the deformity of wickedness this plea was admitted and sir philip yorke who then presided in that court dismissed the information with encomiums upon the purity and excellence of mr savages writings the prosecution however answered in some measure the purpose of those by whom it was set on foot for mr savage was so far intimidated by it that when the edition of his poem was sold he did not venture to reprint it so that it was in a short time forgotten or forgotten by all but those whom it offended it is said that some endeavours were used to incense the queen against him but he found advocates to obviate at least part of their effect for though he was never advanced he still continued to receive his pension this poem drew more infamy upon him than any incident of his life and as his conduct cannot be vindicated it is proper to secure his memory from reproach by informing those whom he made his enemies that he never intended to repeat the provocation and that though whenever he thought he had any reason to complain of the clergy he used to threaten them with a new edition of the progress of a divine it was his calm and settled resolution to suppress it for ever he once intended to have made a better reparation for the folly or injustice with which he might be charged by writing another poem called the progress of a freethinker whom he intended to lead through all the stages of vice and folly to convert him from virtue to wickedness and from religion to infidelity by all the modish sophistry used for that purpose and at last to dismiss him by his own hand into the other world that he did not execute this design is a real loss to mankind for he was too well acquainted with all the scenes of debauchery to have failed in his representations of them and too zealous for virtue not to have represented them in such a manner as should expose them either to ridicule or detestation but this plan was like others formed and laid aside till the vigour of his imagination was spent and the effervescence of invention had subsided but soon gave way to some other design which pleased by its novelty for awhile and then was neglected like the former he was still in his usual exigencies having no certain support but the pension allowed him by the queen which though it might have kept an exact economist from want was very far from being sufficient for mr savage who had never been accustomed to dismiss any of his appetites without the gratification which they solicited and whom nothing but want of money withheld from partaking of every pleasure that fell within his view his conduct with regard to his pension was very particular no sooner had he changed the bill than he vanished from the sight of all his acquaintance and lay for some time out of the reach of all the inquiries that friendship or curiosity could make after him at length he appeared again penniless as before but never informed even those whom he seemed to regard most where he had been nor was his retreat ever discovered this was his constant practice during the whole time that he received the pension from the queen he regularly disappeared and returned he indeed affirmed that he retired to study and that the money supported him in solitude for many months but his friends declared that the short time in which it was spent sufficiently confuted his own account of his conduct his politeness and his wit still raised him friends who were desirous of setting him at length free from that indigence by which he had been hitherto oppressed and therefore solicited sir robert walpole in his favour with so much earnestness that they obtained a promise of the next place that should become vacant not exceeding two hundred pounds a year this promise was made with an uncommon declaration that it was not the promise of a minister to a petitioner but of a friend to his friend mr savage now concluded himself set at ease for ever and as he observes in a poem written on that incident of his life trusted and was trusted but soon found that his confidence was illgrounded and this friendly promise was not inviolable he spent a long time in solicitations and at last despaired and desisted he did not indeed deny that he had given the minister some reason to believe that he should not strengthen his own interest by advancing him for he had taken care to distinguish himself in coffeehouses as an advocate for the ministry of the last years of queen anne and was always ready to justify the conduct and exalt the character of lord bolingbroke whom he mentions with great regard in an epistle upon authors which he wrote about that time but was too wise to publish and of which only some fragments have appeared inserted by him in the magazine after his retirement to despair was not however the character of savage when one patronage failed he had recourse to another the prince was now extremely popular and had very liberally rewarded the merit of some writers whom mr savage did not think superior to himself and therefore he resolved to address a poem to him for this purpose he made choice of a subject which could regard only persons of the highest rank and greatest affluence and which was therefore proper for a poem intended to procure the patronage of a prince and having retired for some time to richmond that he might prosecute his design in full tranquillity without the temptations of pleasure or the solicitations of creditors by which his meditations were in equal danger of being disconcerted he produced a poem on public spirit with regard to public works the plan of this poem is very extensive and comprises a multitude of topics each of which might furnish matter sufficient for a long performance and of which some have already employed more eminent writers but as he was perhaps not fully acquainted with the whole extent of his own design and was writing to obtain a supply of wants too pressing to admit of long or accurate inquiries he passes negligently over many public works which even in his own opinion deserved to be more elaborately treated but though he may sometimes disappoint his reader by transient touches upon these subjects which have often been considered and therefore naturally raise expectations he must be allowed amply to compensate his omissions by expatiating in the conclusion of his work upon a kind of beneficence not yet celebrated by any eminent poet though it now appears more susceptible of embellishments more adapted to exalt the ideas and affect the passions than many of those which have hitherto been thought most worthy of the ornament of verse the settlement of colonies in uninhabited countries the establishment of those in security whose misfortunes have made their own country no longer pleasing or safe the acquisition of property without injury to any the appropriation of the waste and luxuriant bounties of nature and the enjoyment of those gifts which heaven has scattered upon regions uncultivated and unoccupied cannot be considered without giving rise to a great number of pleasing ideas and bewildering the imagination in delightful prospects and therefore whatever speculations they may produce in those who have confined themselves to political studies naturally fixed the attention and excited the applause of a poet the politician when he considers men driven into other countries for shelter and obliged to retire to forests and deserts and pass their lives and fix their posterity in the remotest corners of the world to avoid those hardships which they suffer or fear in their native place may very properly inquire why the legislature does not provide a remedy for these miseries rather than encourage an escape from them he may conclude that the flight of every honest man is a loss to the community that those who are unhappy without guilt ought to be relieved and the life which is overburthened by accidental calamities set at ease by the care of the public and that those who have by misconduct forfeited their claim to favour ought rather to be made useful to the society which they have injured than be driven from it but the poet is employed in a more pleasing undertaking than that of proposing laws which however just or expedient will never be made or endeavouring to reduce to rational schemes of government societies which were formed by chance and are conducted by the private passions of those who preside in them he guides the unhappy fugitive from want and persecution to plenty quiet and security and seats him in scenes of peaceful solitude and undisturbed repose savage has not forgotten amidst the pleasing sentiments which this prospect of retirement suggested to him to censure those crimes which have been generally committed by the discoverers of new regions and to expose the enormous wickedness of making war upon barbarous nations because they cannot resist and of invading countries because they are fruitful of extending navigation only to propagate vice and of visiting distant lands only to lay them waste he has asserted the natural equality of mankind and endeavoured to suppress that pride which inclines men to imagine that right is the consequence of power his description of the various miseries which force men to seek for refuge in distant countries affords another instance of his proficiency in the important and extensive study of human life and the tenderness with which he recounts them another proof of his humanity and benevolence it is observable that the close of this poem discovers a change which experience had made in mr savages opinions in a poem written by him in his youth and published in his miscellanies he declares his contempt of the contracted views and narrow prospects of the middle state of life and declares his resolution either to tower like the cedar or be trampled like the shrub but in this poem though addressed to a prince he mentions this state of life as comprising those who ought most to attract reward those who merit most the confidence of power and the familiarity of greatness and accidentally mentioning this passage to one of his friends declared that in his opinion all the virtue of mankind was comprehended in that state in describing villas and gardens he did not omit to condemn that absurd custom which prevails among the english of permitting servants to receive money from strangers for the entertainment that they receive and therefore inserted in his poem these lines but what the flowering pride of gardens rare however royal or however fair if gates which to excess should still give way ope but like peters paradise for pay if perquisited varlets frequent stand and each new walk must a new tax demand what foreign eye but with contempt surveys what muse shall from oblivion snatch their praise but before the publication of his performance he recollected that the queen allowed her garden and cave at richmond to be shown for money and that she so openly countenanced the practice that she had bestowed the privilege of showing them as a place of profit on a man whose merit she valued herself upon rewarding though she gave him only the liberty of disgracing his country he therefore thought with more prudence than was often exerted by him that the publication of these lines might be officiously represented as an insult upon the queen to whom he owed his life and his subsistence and that the propriety of his observation would be no security against the censures which the unseasonableness of it might draw upon him he therefore suppressed the passage in the first edition but after the queens death thought the same caution no longer necessary and restored it to the proper place the poem was therefore published without any political faults and inscribed to the prince but mr savage having no friend upon whom he could prevail to present it to him had no other method of attracting his observation than the publication of frequent advertisements and therefore received no reward from his patron however generous on other occasions this disappointment he never mentioned without indignation being by some means or other confident that the prince was not ignorant of his address to him and insinuated that if any advances in popularity could have been made by distinguishing him he had not written without notice or without reward he was once inclined to have presented his poem in person and sent to the printer for a copy with that design but either his opinion changed or his resolution deserted him and he continued to resent neglect without attempting to force himself into regard nor was the public much more favourable than his patron for only seventytwo were sold though the performance was much commended by some whose judgment in that kind of writing is generally allowed but savage easily reconciled himself to mankind without imputing any defect to his work by observing that his poem was unluckily published two days after the prorogation of the parliament and by consequence at a time when all those who could be expected to regard it were in the hurry of preparing for their departure or engaged in taking leave of others upon their dismission from public affairs it must be however allowed in justification of the public that this performance is not the most excellent of mr savages works and that though it cannot be denied to contain many striking sentiments majestic lines and just observations it is in general not sufficiently polished in the language or enlivened in the imagery or digested in the plan thus his poem contributed nothing to the alleviation of his poverty which was such as very few could have supported with equal patience but to which it must likewise be confessed that few would have been exposed who received punctually fifty pounds a year a salary which though by no means equal to the demands of vanity and luxury is yet found sufficient to support families above want and was undoubtedly more than the necessities of life require but no sooner had he received his pension than he withdrew to his darling privacy from which he returned in a short time to his former distress and for some part of the year generally lived by chance eating only when he was invited to the tables of his acquaintances from which the meanness of his dress often excluded him when the politeness and variety of his conversation would have been thought a sufficient recompense for his entertainment he lodged as much by accident as he dined and passed the night sometimes in mean houses which are set open at night to any casual wanderers sometimes in cellars among the riot and filth of the meanest and most profligate of the rabble and sometimes when he had not money to support even the expenses of these receptacles walked about the streets till he was weary and lay down in the summer upon the bulk or in the winter with his associate in poverty among the ashes of a glasshouse in this manner were passed those days and those nights which nature had enabled him to have employed in elevated speculations useful studies or pleasing conversation on a bulk in a cellar or in a glasshouse among thieves and beggars was to be found the author of the wanderer the man of exalted sentiments extensive views and curious observations the man whose remarks on life might have assisted the statesman whose ideas of virtue might have enlightened the moralist whose eloquence might have influenced senates and whose delicacy might have polished courts it cannot but be imagined that such necessities might sometimes force him upon disreputable practices and it is probable that these lines in the wanderer were occasioned by his reflections on his own conduct though misery leads to happiness and truth unequal to the load this languid youth oh let none censure if untried by grief if amidst woe untempted by relief he stooped reluctant to low arts of shame which then een then he scorned and blushed to name whoever was acquainted with him was certain to be solicited for small sums which the frequency of the request made in time considerable and he was therefore quickly shunned by those who were become familiar enough to be trusted with his necessities but his rambling manner of life and constant appearance at houses of public resort always procured him a new succession of friends whose kindness had not been exhausted by repeated requests so that he was seldom absolutely without resources but had in his utmost exigencies this comfort that he always imagined himself sure of speedy relief it was observed that he always asked favours of this kind without the least submission or apparent consciousness of dependence and that he did not seem to look upon a compliance with his request as an obligation that deserved any extraordinary acknowledgments but a refusal was resented by him as an affront or complained of as an injury nor did he readily reconcile himself to those who either denied to lend or gave him afterwards any intimation that they expected to be repaid he was sometimes so far compassionated by those who knew both his merit and distresses that they received him into their families but they soon discovered him to be a very incommodious inmate for being always accustomed to an irregular manner of life he could not confine himself to any stated hours or pay any regard to the rules of a family but would prolong his conversation till midnight without considering that business might require his friends application in the morning and when he had persuaded himself to retire to bed was not without equal difficulty called up to dinner it was therefore impossible to pay him any distinction without the entire subversion of all economy a kind of establishment which wherever he went he always appeared ambitious to overthrow it must therefore be acknowledged in justification of mankind that it was not always by the negligence or coldness of his friends that savage was distressed but because it was in reality very difficult to preserve him long in a state of ease to supply him with money was a hopeless attempt for no sooner did he see himself master of a sum sufficient to set him free from care for a day than he became profuse and luxurious when once he had entered a tavern or engaged in a scheme of pleasure he never retired till want of money obliged him to some new expedient if he was entertained in a family nothing was any longer to be regarded there but amusement and jollity wherever savage entered he immediately expected that order and business should fly before him that all should thenceforward be left to hazard and that no dull principle of domestic management should be opposed to his inclination or intrude upon his gaiety his distresses however afflictive never dejected him in his lowest state he wanted not spirit to assert the natural dignity of wit and was always ready to repress that insolence which the superiority of fortune incited and to trample on that reputation which rose upon any other basis than that of merit he never admitted any gross familiarities or submitted to be treated otherwise than as an equal once when he was without lodging meat or clothes one of his friends a man indeed not remarkable for moderation in his prosperity left a message that he desired to see him about nine in the morning savage knew that his intention was to assist him but was very much disgusted that he should presume to prescribe the hour of his attendance and i believe refused to visit him and rejected his kindness the same invincible temper whether firmness or obstinacy appeared in his conduct to the lord tyrconnel from whom he very frequently demanded that the allowance which was once paid him should be restored but with whom he never appeared to entertain for a moment the thought of soliciting a reconciliation and whom he treated at once with all the haughtiness of superiority and all the bitterness of resentment he wrote to him not in a style of supplication or respect but of reproach menace and contempt and appeared determined if he ever regained his allowance to hold it only by the right of conquest as many more can discover that a man is richer than that he is wiser than themselves superiority of understanding is not so readily acknowledged as that of fortune nor is that haughtiness which the consciousness of great abilities incites borne with the same submission as the tyranny of affluence and therefore savage by asserting his claim to deference and regard and by treating those with contempt whom better fortune animated to rebel against him did not fail to raise a great number of enemies in the different classes of mankind those who thought themselves raised above him by the advantages of riches hated him because they found no protection from the petulance of his wit those who were esteemed for their writings feared him as a critic and maligned him as a rival and almost all the smaller wits were his professed enemies among these mr miller so far indulged his resentment as to introduce him in a farce and direct him to be personated on the stage in a dress like that which he then wore a mean insult which only insinuated that savage had but one coat and which was therefore despised by him rather than resented for though he wrote a lampoon against miller he never printed it and as no other person ought to prosecute that revenge from which the person who was injured desisted i shall not preserve what mr savage suppressed of which the publication would indeed have been a punishment too severe for so impotent an assault the great hardships of poverty were to savage not the want of lodging or food but the neglect and contempt which it drew upon him he complained that as his affairs grew desperate he found his reputation for capacity visibly decline that his opinion in questions of criticism was no longer regarded when his coat was out of fashion and that those who in the interval of his prosperity were always encouraging him to great undertakings by encomiums on his genius and assurances of success now received any mention of his designs with coldness thought that the subjects on which he proposed to write were very difficult and were ready to inform him that the event of a poem was uncertain that an author ought to employ much time in the consideration of his plan and not presume to sit down to write in consequence of a few cursory ideas and a superficial knowledge difficulties were started on all sides and he was no longer qualified for any performance but the volunteer laureate yet even this kind of contempt never depressed him for he always preserved a steady confidence in his own capacity and believed nothing above his reach which he should at any time earnestly endeavour to attain he formed schemes of the same kind with regard to knowledge and to fortune and flattered himself with advances to be made in science as with riches to be enjoyed in some distant period of his life for the acquisition of knowledge he was indeed much better qualified than for that of riches for he was naturally inquisitive and desirous of the conversation of those from whom any information was to be obtained but by no means solicitous to improve those opportunities that were sometimes offered of raising his fortune and he was remarkably retentive of his ideas which when once he was in possession of them rarely forsook him a quality which could never be communicated to his money while he was thus wearing out his life in expectation that the queen would some time recollect her promise he had recourse to the usual practice of writers and published proposals for printing his works by subscription to which he was encouraged by the success of many who had not a better right to the favour of the public but whatever was the reason he did not find the world equally inclined to favour him and he observed with some discontent that though he offered his works at half a guinea he was able to procure but a small number in comparison with those who subscribed twice as much to duck nor was it without indignation that he saw his proposals neglected by the queen who patronised mr ducks with uncommon ardour and incited a competition among those who attended the court who should most promote his interest and who should first offer a subscription this was a distinction to which mr savage made no scruple of asserting that his birth his misfortunes and his genius gave a fairer title than could be pleaded by him on whom it was conferred savages applications were however not universally unsuccessful for some of the nobility countenanced his design encouraged his proposals and subscribed with great liberality he related of the duke of chandos particularly that upon receiving his proposals he sent him ten guineas but the money which his subscriptions afforded him was not less volatile than that which he received from his other schemes whenever a subscription was paid him he went to a tavern and as money so collected is necessarily received in small sums he never was able to send his poems to the press but for many years continued his solicitation and squandered whatever he obtained the project of printing his works was frequently revived and as his proposals grew obsolete new ones were printed with fresher dates to form schemes for the publication was one of his favourite amusements nor was he ever more at ease than when with any friend who readily fell in with his schemes he was adjusting the print forming the advertisements and regulating the dispersion of his new edition which he really intended some time to publish and which as long as experience had shown him the impossibility of printing the volume together he at last determined to divide into weekly or monthly numbers that the profits of the first might supply the expenses of the next thus he spent his time in mean expedients and tormenting suspense living for the greatest part in fear of prosecutions from his creditors and consequently skulking in obscure parts of the town of which he was no stranger to the remotest corners but wherever he came his address secured him friends whom his necessities soon alienated so that he had perhaps a more numerous acquaintance than any man ever before attained there being scarcely any person eminent on any account to whom he was not known or whose character he was not in some degree able to delineate to the acquisition of this extensive acquaintance every circumstance of his life contributed he excelled in the arts of conversation and therefore willingly practised them he had seldom any home or even a lodging in which he could be private and therefore was driven into publichouses for the common conveniences of life and supports of nature he was always ready to comply with every invitation having no employment to withhold him and often no money to provide for himself and by dining with one company he never failed of obtaining an introduction into another thus dissipated was his life and thus casual his subsistence yet did not the distraction of his views hinder him from reflection nor the uncertainty of his condition depress his gaiety when he had wandered about without any fortunate adventure by which he was led into a tavern he sometimes retired into the fields and was able to employ his mind in study to amuse it with pleasing imaginations and seldom appeared to be melancholy but when some sudden misfortune had just fallen upon him and even then in a few moments he would disentangle himself from his perplexity adopt the subject of conversation and apply his mind wholly to the objects that others presented to it this life unhappy as it may be already imagined was yet embittered in with new calamities the death of the queen deprived him of all the prospects of preferment with which he so long entertained his imagination and as sir robert walpole had before given him reason to believe that he never intended the performance of his promise he was now abandoned again to fortune he was however at that time supported by a friend and as it was not his custom to look out for distant calamities or to feel any other pain than that which forced itself upon his senses he was not much afflicted at his loss and perhaps comforted himself that his pension would be now continued without the annual tribute of a panegyric another expectation contributed likewise to support him he had taken a resolution to write a second tragedy upon the story of sir thomas overbury in which he preserved a few lines of his former play but made a total alteration of the plan added new incidents and introduced new characters so that it was a new tragedy not a revival of the former many of his friends blamed him for not making choice of another subject but in vindication of himself he asserted that it was not easy to find a better and that he thought it his interest to extinguish the memory of the first tragedy which he could only do by writing one less defective upon the same story by which he should entirely defeat the artifice of the booksellers who after the death of any author of reputation are always industrious to swell his works by uniting his worst productions with his best in the execution of this scheme however he proceeded but slowly and probably only employed himself upon it when he could find no other amusement but he pleased himself with counting the profits and perhaps imagined that the theatrical reputation which he was about to acquire would be equivalent to all that he had lost by the death of his patroness he did not in confidence of his approaching riches neglect the measures proper to secure the continuance of his pension though some of his favourers thought him culpable for omitting to write on her death but on her birthday next year he gave a proof of the solidity of his judgment and the power of his genius he knew that the track of elegy had been so long beaten that it was impossible to travel in it without treading in the footsteps of those who had gone before him and that therefore it was necessary that he might distinguish himself from the herd of encomiasts to find out some new walk of funeral panegyric this difficult task he performed in such a manner that his poem may be justly ranked among the best pieces that the death of princes has produced by transferring the mention of her death to her birthday he has formed a happy combination of topics which any other man would have thought it very difficult to connect in one view but which he has united in such a manner that the relation between them appears natural and it may be justly said that what no other man would have thought on it now appears scarcely possible for any man to miss the beauty of this peculiar combination of images is so masterly that it is sufficient to set this poem above censure and therefore it is not necessary to mention many other delicate touches which may be found in it and which would deservedly be admired in any other performance to these proofs of his genius may be added from the same poem an instance of his prudence an excellence for which he was not so often distinguished he does not forget to remind the king in the most delicate and artful manner of continuing his pension with regard to the success of his address he was for some time in suspense but was in no great degree solicitous about it and continued his labour upon his new tragedy with great tranquillity till the friend who had for a considerable time supported him removing his family to another place took occasion to dismiss him it then became necessary to inquire more diligently what was determined in his affair having reason to suspect that no great favour was intended him because he had not received his pension at the usual time it is said that he did not take those methods of retrieving his interest which were most likely to succeed and some of those who were employed in the exchequer cautioned him against too much violence in his proceedings but mr savage who seldom regulated his conduct by the advice of others gave way to his passion and demanded of sir robert walpole at his levee the reason of the distinction that was made between him and the other pensioners of the queen with a degree of roughness which perhaps determined him to withdraw what had been only delayed whatever was the crime of which he was accused or suspected and whatever influence was employed against him he received soon after an account that took from him all hopes of regaining his pension and he had now no prospect of subsistence but from his play and he knew no way of living for the time required to finish it so peculiar were the misfortunes of this man deprived of an estate and title by a particular law exposed and abandoned by a mother defrauded by a mother of a fortune which his father had allotted him he entered the world without a friend and though his abilities forced themselves into esteem and reputation he was never able to obtain any real advantage and whatever prospects arose were always intercepted as he began to approach them the kings intentions in his favour were frustrated his dedication to the prince whose generosity on every other occasion was eminent procured him no reward sir robert walpole who valued himself upon keeping his promise to others broke it to him without regret and the bounty of the queen was after her death withdrawn from him and from him only such were his misfortunes which yet he bore not only with decency but with cheerfulness nor was his gaiety clouded even by his last disappointments though he was in a short time reduced to the lowest degree of distress and often wanted both lodging and food at this time he gave another instance of the insurmountable obstinacy of his spirit his clothes were worn out and he received notice that at a coffeehouse some clothes and linen were left for him the person who sent them did not i believe inform him to whom he was to be obliged that he might spare the perplexity of acknowledging the benefit but though the offer was so far generous it was made with some neglect of ceremonies which mr savage so much resented that he refused the present and declined to enter the house till the clothes that had been designed for him were taken away his distress was now publicly known and his friends therefore thought it proper to concert some measures for his relief and one of them pope wrote a letter to him in which he expressed his concern for the miserable withdrawing of this pension and gave him hopes that in a short time he should find himself supplied with a competence without any dependence on those little creatures which we are pleased to call the great the scheme proposed for this happy and independent subsistence was that he should retire into wales and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a year to be raised by a subscription on which he was to live privately in a cheap place without aspiring any more to affluence or having any further care of reputation this offer mr savage gladly accepted though with intentions very different from those of his friends for they proposed that he should continue an exile from london for ever and spend all the remaining part of his life at swansea but he designed only to take the opportunity which their scheme offered him of retreating for a short time that he might prepare his play for the stage and his other works for the press and then to return to london to exhibit his tragedy and live upon the profits of his own labour with regard to his works he proposed very great improvements which would have required much time or great application and when he had finished them he designed to do justice to his subscribers by publishing them according to his proposals as he was ready to entertain himself with future pleasures he had planned out a scheme of life for the country of which he had no knowledge but from pastorals and songs he imagined that he should be transported to scenes of flowery felicity like those which one poet has reflected to another and had projected a perpetual round of innocent pleasures of which he suspected no interruption from pride or ignorance or brutality with these expectations he was so enchanted that when he was once gently reproached by a friend for submitting to live upon a subscription and advised rather by a resolute exertion of his abilities to support himself he could not bear to debar himself from the happiness which was to be found in the calm of a cottage or lose the opportunity of listening without intermission to the melody of the nightingale which he believed was to be heard from every bramble and which he did not fail to mention as a very important part of the happiness of a country life while this scheme was ripening his friends directed him to take a lodging in the liberties of the fleet that he might be secure from his creditors and sent him every monday a guinea which he commonly spent before the next morning and trusted after his usual manner the remaining part of the week to the bounty of fortune he now began very sensibly to feel the miseries of dependence those by whom he was to be supported began to prescribe to him with an air of authority which he knew not how decently to resent nor patiently to bear and he soon discovered from the conduct of most of his subscribers that he was yet in the hands of little creatures of the insolence that he was obliged to suffer he gave many instances of which none appeared to raise his indignation to a greater height than the method which was taken of furnishing him with clothes instead of consulting him and allowing him to send a tailor his orders for what they thought proper to allow him they proposed to send for a tailor to take his measure and then to consult how they should equip him this treatment was not very delicate nor was it such as savages humanity would have suggested to him on a like occasion but it had scarcely deserved mention had it not by affecting him in an uncommon degree shown the peculiarity of his character upon hearing the design that was formed he came to the lodging of a friend with the most violent agonies of rage and being asked what it could be that gave him such disturbance he replied with the utmost vehemence of indignation that they had sent for a tailor to measure him how the affair ended was never inquired for fear of renewing his uneasiness it is probable that upon recollection he submitted with a good grace to what he could not avoid and that he discovered no resentment where he had no power he was however not humbled to implicit and universal compliance for when the gentleman who had first informed him of the design to support him by a subscription attempted to procure a reconciliation with the lord tyrconnel he could by no means be prevailed upon to comply with the measures that were proposed a letter was written for him to sir william lemon to prevail upon him to interpose his good offices with lord tyrconnel in which he solicited sir williams assistance for a man who really needed it as much as any man could well do and informed him that he was retiring for ever to a place where he should no more trouble his relations friends or enemies he confessed that his passion had betrayed him to some conduct with regard to lord tyrconnel for which he could not but heartily ask his pardon and as he imagined lord tyrconnels passion might be yet so high that he would not receive a letter from him begged that sir william would endeavour to soften him and expressed his hopes that he would comply with this request and that so small a relation would not harden his heart against him that any man should presume to dictate a letter to him was not very agreeable to mr savage and therefore he was before he had opened it not much inclined to approve it but when he read it he found it contained sentiments entirely opposite to his own and as he asserted to the truth and therefore instead of copying it wrote his friend a letter full of masculine resentment and warm expostulations he very justly observed that the style was too supplicatory and the representation too abject and that he ought at least to have made him complain with the dignity of a gentleman in distress he declared that he would not write the paragraph in which he was to ask lord tyrconnels pardon for he despised his pardon and therefore could not heartily and would not hypocritically ask it he remarked that his friend made a very unreasonable distinction between himself and him for says he when you mention men of high rank in your own character they are those little creatures whom we are pleased to call the great but when you address them in mine no servility is sufficiently humble he then with propriety explained the ill consequences which might be expected from such a letter which his relations would print in their own defence and which would for ever be produced as a full answer to all that he should allege against them for he always intended to publish a minute account of the treatment which he had received it is to be remembered to the honour of the gentleman by whom this letter was drawn up that he yielded to mr savages reasons and agreed that it ought to be suppressed after many alterations and delays a subscription was at length raised which did not amount to fifty pounds a year though twenty were paid by one gentleman such was the generosity of mankind that what had been done by a player without solicitation could not now be effected by application and interest and savage had a great number to court and to obey for a pension less than that which mrs oldfield paid him without exacting any servilities mr savage however was satisfied and willing to retire and was convinced that the allowance though scanty would be more than sufficient for him being now determined to commence a rigid economist and to live according to the exact rules of frugality for nothing was in his opinion more contemptible than a man who when he knew his income exceeded it and yet he confessed that instances of such folly were too common and lamented that some men were not trusted with their own money full of these salutary resolutions he left london in july having taken leave with great tenderness of his friends and parted from the author of this narrative with tears in his eyes he was furnished with fifteen guineas and informed that they would be sufficient not only for the expense of his journey but for his support in wales for some time and that there remained but little more of the first collection he promised a strict adherence to his maxims of parsimony and went away in the stagecoach nor did his friends expect to hear from him till he informed them of his arrival at swansea but when they least expected arrived a letter dated the fourteenth day after his departure in which he sent them word that he was yet upon the road and without money and that he therefore could not proceed without a remittance they then sent him the money that was in their hands with which he was enabled to reach bristol from whence he was to go to swansea by water at bristol he found an embargo laid upon the shipping so that he could not immediately obtain a passage and being therefore obliged to stay there some time he with his usual felicity ingratiated himself with many of the principal inhabitants was invited to their houses distinguished at their public feasts and treated with a regard that gratified his vanity and therefore easily engaged his affection he began very early after his retirement to complain of the conduct of his friends in london and irritated many of them so much by his letters that they withdrew however honourably their contributions and it is believed that little more was paid him than the twenty pounds a year which were allowed him by the gentleman who proposed the subscription after some stay at bristol he retired to swansea the place originally proposed for his residence where he lived about a year very much dissatisfied with the diminution of his salary but contracted as in other places acquaintance with those who were most distinguished in that country among whom he has celebrated mr powel and mrs jones by some verses which he inserted in the gentlemans magazine here he completed his tragedy of which two acts were wanting when he left london and was desirous of coming to town to bring it upon the stage this design was very warmly opposed and he was advised by his chief benefactor to put it into the hands of mr thomson and mr mallet that it might be fitted for the stage and to allow his friends to receive the profits out of which an annual pension should be paid him this proposal he rejected with the utmost contempt he was by no means convinced that the judgment of those to whom he was required to submit was superior to his own he was now determined as he expressed it to be no longer kept in leadingstrings and had no elevated idea of his bounty who proposed to pension him out of the profits of his own labours he attempted in wales to promote a subscription for his works and had once hopes of success but in a short time afterwards formed a resolution of leaving that part of the country to which he thought it not reasonable to be confined for the gratification of those who having promised him a liberal income had no sooner banished him to a remote corner than they reduced his allowance to a salary scarcely equal to the necessities of life his resentment of this treatment which in his own opinion at least he had not deserved was such that he broke off all correspondence with most of his contributors and appeared to consider them as persecutors and oppressors and in the latter part of his life declared that their conduct towards him since his departure from london had been perfidiousness improving on perfidiousness and inhumanity on inhumanity it is not to be supposed that the necessities of mr savage did not sometimes incite him to satirical exaggerations of the behaviour of those by whom he thought himself reduced to them but it must be granted that the diminution of his allowance was a great hardship and that those who withdrew their subscription from a man who upon the faith of their promise had gone into a kind of banishment and abandoned all those by whom he had been before relieved in his distresses will find it no easy task to vindicate their conduct it may be alleged and perhaps justly that he was petulant and contemptuous that he more frequently reproached his subscribers for not giving him more than thanked them for what he received but it is to be remembered that his conduct and this is the worst charge that can be drawn up against him did them no real injury and that it therefore ought rather to have been pitied than resented at least the resentment it might provoke ought to have been generous and manly epithets which his conduct will hardly deserve that starves the man whom he has persuaded to put himself into his power it might have been reasonably demanded by savage that they should before they had taken away what they promised have replaced him in his former state that they should have taken no advantages from the situation to which the appearance of their kindness had reduced him and that he should have been recalled to london before he was abandoned he might justly represent that he ought to have been considered as a lion in the toils and demand to be released before the dogs should be loosed upon him he endeavoured indeed to release himself and with an intent to return to london went to bristol where a repetition of the kindness which he had formerly found invited him to stay he was not only caressed and treated but had a collection made for him of about thirty pounds with which it had been happy if he had immediately departed for london but his negligence did not suffer him to consider that such proofs of kindness were not often to be expected and that this ardour of benevolence was in a great degree the effect of novelty and might probably be every day less and therefore he took no care to improve the happy time but was encouraged by one favour to hope for another till at length generosity was exhausted and officiousness wearied another part of his misconduct was the practice of prolonging his visits to unseasonable hours and disconcerting all the families into which he was admitted this was an error in a place of commerce which all the charms of his conversation could not compensate for what trader would purchase such airy satisfaction by the loss of solid gain which must be the consequence of midnight merriment as those hours which were gained at night were generally lost in the morning thus mr savage after the curiosity of the inhabitants was gratified found the number of his friends daily decreasing perhaps without suspecting for what reason their conduct was altered for he still continued to harass with his nocturnal intrusions those that yet countenanced him and admitted him to their houses but he did not spend all the time of his residence at bristol in visits or at taverns for he sometimes returned to his studies and began several considerable designs when he felt an inclination to write he always retired from the knowledge of his friends and lay hid in an obscure part of the suburbs till he found himself again desirous of company to which it is likely that intervals of absence made him more welcome he was always full of his design of returning to london to bring his tragedy upon the stage but having neglected to depart with the money that was raised for him he could not afterwards procure a sum sufficient to defray the expenses of his journey nor perhaps would a fresh supply have had any other effect than by putting immediate pleasures into his power to have driven the thoughts of his journey out of his mind while he was thus spending the day in contriving a scheme for the morrow distress stole upon him by imperceptible degrees his conduct had already wearied some of those who were at first enamoured of his conversation but he might perhaps still have devolved to others whom he might have entertained with equal success had not the decay of his clothes made it no longer consistent with their vanity to admit him to their tables or to associate with him in public places he now began to find every man from home at whose house he called and was therefore no longer able to procure the necessaries of life but wandered about the town slighted and neglected in quest of a dinner which he did not always obtain to complete his misery he was pursued by the officers for small debts which he had contracted and was therefore obliged to withdraw from the small number of friends from whom he had still reason to hope for favours his custom was to lie in bed the greatest part of the day and to get out in the dark with the utmost privacy and after having paid his visit return again before morning to his lodging which was in the garret of an obscure inn being thus excluded on one hand and confined on the other he suffered the utmost extremities of poverty and often fasted so long that he was seized with faintness and had lost his appetite not being able to bear the smell of meat till the action of his stomach was restored by a cordial in this distress he received a remittance of five pounds from london with which he provided himself a decent coat and determined to go to london but unhappily spent his money at a favourite tavern thus was he again confined to bristol where he was every day hunted by bailiffs in this exigence he once more found a friend who sheltered him in his house though at the usual inconveniences with which his company was attended for he could neither be persuaded to go to bed in the night nor to rise in the day it is observable that in these various scenes of misery he was always disengaged and cheerful he at some times pursued his studies and at others continued or enlarged his epistolary correspondence nor was he ever so far dejected as to endeavour to procure an increase of his allowance by any other methods than accusations and reproaches he had now no longer any hopes of assistance from his friends at bristol who as merchants and by consequence sufficiently studious of profit cannot be supposed to have looked with much compassion upon negligence and extravagance or to think any excellence equivalent to a fault of such consequence as neglect of economy it is natural to imagine that many of those who would have relieved his real wants were discouraged from the exertion of their benevolence by observation of the use which was made of their favours and conviction that relief would be only momentary and that the same necessity would quickly return at last he quitted the house of his friend and returned to his lodgings at the inn still intending to set out in a few days for london but on the th of january having been at supper with two of his friends he was at his return to his lodgings arrested for a debt of about eight pounds which he owed at a coffeehouse and conducted to the house of a sheriffs officer the account which he gives of this misfortune in a letter to one of the gentlemen with whom he had supped is too remarkable to be omitted it was not a little unfortunate for me that i spent yesterdays evening with you because the hour hindered me from entering on my new lodging however i have now got one but such an one as i believe nobody would choose i was arrested at the suit of mrs read just as i was going upstairs to bed at mr bowyers but taken in so private a manner that i believe nobody at the white lion is apprised of it though i let the officers know the strength or rather weakness of my pocket yet they treated me with the utmost civility and even when they conducted me to confinement it was in such a manner that i verily believe i could have escaped which i would rather be ruined than have done notwithstanding the whole amount of my finances was but threepence halfpenny in the first place i must insist that you will industriously conceal this from mrs s s because i would not have her good nature suffer that pain which i know she would be apt to feel on this occasion next i conjure you dear sir by all the ties of friendship by no means to have one uneasy thought on my account but to have the same pleasantry of countenance and unruffled serenity of mind which god be praised i have in this and have had in a much severer calamity furthermore i charge you if you value my friendship as truly as i do yours not to utter or even harbour the least resentment against mrs read i believe she has ruined me but i freely forgive her and though i will never more have any intimacy with her i would at a due distance rather do her an act of good than illwill lastly pardon the expression i absolutely command you not to offer me any pecuniary assistance nor to attempt getting me any from any one of your friends at another time or on any other occasion you may dear friend be well assured i would rather write to you in the submissive style of a request than that of a peremptory command however that my truly valuable friend may not think i am too proud to ask a favour let me entreat you to let me have your boy to attend me for this day not only for the sake of saving me the expense of porters but for the delivery of some letters to people whose names i would not have known to strangers the civil treatment i have thus far met from those whose prisoner i am makes me thankful to the almighty that though he has thought fit to visit me on my birthnight with affliction yet such is his great goodness my affliction is not without alleviating circumstances i murmur not but am all resignation to the divine will as to the world i hope that i shall be endued by heaven with that presence of mind that serene dignity in misfortune that constitutes the character of a true nobleman a dignity far beyond that of coronets a nobility arising from the just principles of philosophy refined and exalted by those of christianity he continued five days at the officers in hopes that he should be able to procure bail and avoid the necessity of going to prison the state in which he passed his time and the treatment which he received are very justly expressed by him in a letter which he wrote to a friend the whole day says he has been employed in various peoples filling my head with their foolish chimerical systems which has obliged me coolly as far as nature will admit to digest and accommodate myself to every different persons way of thinking hurried from one wild system to another till it has quite made a chaos of my imagination and nothing done promised disappointed ordered to send every hour from one part of the town to the other when his friends who had hitherto caressed and applauded found that to give bail and pay the debt was the same they all refused to preserve him from a prison at the expense of eight pounds and therefore after having been for some time at the officers house at an immense expense as he observes in his letter he was at length removed to newgate this expense he was enabled to support by the generosity of mr nash at bath who upon receiving from him an account of his condition immediately sent him five guineas and promised to promote his subscription at bath with all his interest by his removal to newgate he obtained at least a freedom from suspense and rest from the disturbing vicissitudes of hope and disappointment he now found that his friends were only companions who were willing to share his gaiety but not to partake of his misfortunes and therefore he no longer expected any assistance from them it must however be observed of one gentleman that he offered to release him by paying the debt but that mr savage would not consent i suppose because he thought he had before been too burthensome to him he was offered by some of his friends that a collection should be made for his enlargement but he treated the proposal and declared he should again treat it with disdain as to writing any mendicant letters he had too high a spirit and determined only to write to some ministers of state to try to regain his pension he continued to complain of those that had sent him into the country and objected to them that he had lost the profits of his play which had been finished three years and in another letter declares his resolution to publish a pamphlet that the world might know how he had been used this pamphlet was never written for he in a very short time recovered his usual tranquillity and cheerfully applied himself to more inoffensive studies he indeed steadily declared that he was promised a yearly allowance of fifty pounds and never received half the sum but he seemed to resign himself to that as well as to other misfortunes and lose the remembrance of it in his amusements and employments the cheerfulness with which he bore his confinement appears from the following letter which he wrote january the th to one of his friends in london i now write to you from my confinement in newgate where i have been ever since monday last was sennight and where i enjoy myself with much more tranquillity than i have known for upwards of a twelvemonth past having a room entirely to myself and pursuing the amusement of my poetical studies uninterrupted and agreeable to my mind i thank the almighty i am now all collected in myself and though my person is in confinement my mind can expatiate on ample and useful subjects with all the freedom imaginable i am now more conversant with the nine than ever and if instead of a newgate bird i may be allowed to be a bird of the muses i assure you sir i sing very freely in my cage sometimes indeed in the plaintive notes of the nightingale but at others in the cheerful strains of the lark in another letter he observes that he ranges from one subject to another without confining himself to any particular task and that he was employed one week upon one attempt and the next upon another surely the fortitude of this man deserves at least to be mentioned with applause and whatever faults may be imputed to him the virtue of suffering well cannot be denied him the two powers which in the opinion of epictetus constituted a wise man are those of bearing and forbearing which it cannot indeed be affirmed to have been equally possessed by savage and indeed the want of one obliged him very frequently to practise the other he was treated by mr dagge the keeper of the prison with great humanity was supported by him at his own table without any certainty of a recompense had a room to himself to which he could at any time retire from all disturbance was allowed to stand at the door of the prison and sometimes taken out into the fields so that he suffered fewer hardships in prison than he had been accustomed to undergo in the greatest part of his life the keeper did not confine his benevolence to a gentle execution of his office but made some overtures to the creditor for his release though without effect and continued during the whole time of his imprisonment to treat him with the utmost tenderness and civility virtue is undoubtedly most laudable in that state which makes it most difficult and therefore the humanity of a gaoler certainly deserves this public attestation and the man whose heart has not been hardened by such an employment may be justly proposed as a pattern of benevolence if an inscription was once engraved to the honest tollgatherer less honours ought not to be paid to the tender gaoler mr savage very frequently received visits and sometimes presents from his acquaintances but they did not amount to a subsistence for the greater part of which he was indebted to the generosity of this keeper but these favours however they might endear to him the particular persons from whom he received them were very far from impressing upon his mind any advantageous ideas of the people of bristol and therefore he thought he could not more properly employ himself in prison than in writing a poem called london and bristol delineated when he had brought this poem to its present state which without considering the chasm is not perfect he wrote to london an account of his design and informed his friend that he was determined to print it with his name but enjoined him not to communicate his intention to his bristol acquaintance the gentleman surprised at his resolution endeavoured to persuade him from publishing it at least from prefixing his name and declared that he could not reconcile the injunction of secrecy with his resolution to own it at its first appearance to this mr savage returned an answer agreeable to his character in the following terms i received yours this morning and not without a little surprise at the contents to answer a question with a question you ask me concerning london and bristol why will i add delineated why did mr woolaston add the same word to his religion of nature i suppose that it was his will and pleasure to add it in his case and it is mine to do so in my own you are pleased to tell me that you understand not why secrecy is enjoined and yet i intend to set my name to it my answer is i have my private reasons which i am not obliged to explain to any one you doubt my friend mr s would not approve of it and what is it to me whether he does or not do you imagine that mr s is to dictate to me if any man who calls himself my friend should assume such an air i would spurn at his friendship with contempt you say i seem to think so by not letting him know it and suppose i do what then perhaps i can give reasons for that disapprobation very foreign from what you would imagine you go on in saying suppose i should not put my name to it my answer is that i will not suppose any such thing being determined to the contrary neither sir would i have you suppose that i applied to you for want of another press nor would i have you imagine that i owe mr s obligations which i do not such was his imprudence and such his obstinate adherence to his own resolutions however absurd a prisoner supported by charity and whatever insults he might have received during the latter part of his stay at bristol once caressed esteemed and presented with a liberal collection he could forget on a sudden his danger and his obligations to gratify the petulance of his wit or the eagerness of his resentment and publish a satire by which he might reasonably expect that he should alienate those who then supported him and provoke those whom he could neither resist nor escape this resolution from the execution of which it is probable that only his death could have hindered him is sufficient to show how much he disregarded all considerations that opposed his present passions and how readily he hazarded all future advantages for any immediate gratifications whatever was his predominant inclination neither hope nor fear hindered him from complying with it nor had opposition any other effect than to heighten his ardour and irritate his vehemence this performance was however laid aside while he was employed in soliciting assistance from several great persons and one interruption succeeding another hindered him from supplying the chasm and perhaps from retouching the other parts which he can hardly be imagined to have finished in his own opinion for it is very unequal and some of the lines are rather inserted to rhyme to others than to support or improve the sense but the first and last parts are worked up with great spirit and elegance his time was spent in the prison for the most part in study or in receiving visits but sometimes he descended to lower amusements and diverted himself in the kitchen with the conversation of the criminals for it was not pleasing to him to be much without company and though he was very capable of a judicious choice he was often contented with the first that offered for this he was sometimes reproved by his friends who found him surrounded with felons but the reproof was on that as on other occasions thrown away he continued to gratify himself and to set very little value on the opinion of others but here as in every other scene of his life he made use of such opportunities as occurred of benefiting those who were more miserable than himself and was always ready to perform any office of humanity to his fellowprisoners he had now ceased from corresponding with any of his subscribers except one who yet continued to remit him the twenty pounds a year which he had promised him and by whom it was expected that he would have been in a very short time enlarged because he had directed the keeper to inquire after the state of his debts however he took care to enter his name according to the forms of the court that the creditor might be obliged to make him some allowance if he was continued a prisoner and when on that occasion he appeared in the hall was treated with very unusual respect but the resentment of the city was afterwards raised by some accounts that had been spread of the satire and he was informed that some of the merchants intended to pay the allowance which the law required and to detain him a prisoner at their own expense this he treated as an empty menace and perhaps might have hastened the publication only to show how much he was superior to their insults had not all his schemes been suddenly destroyed when he had been six months in prison he received from one of his friends in whose kindness he had the greatest confidence and on whose assistance he chiefly depended a letter that contained a charge of very atrocious ingratitude drawn up in such terms as sudden resentment dictated henley in one of his advertisements had mentioned popes treatment of savage this was supposed by pope to be the consequence of a complaint made by savage to henley and was therefore mentioned by him with much resentment mr savage returned a very solemn protestation of his innocence but however appeared much disturbed at the accusation some days afterwards he was seized with a pain in his back and side which as it was not violent was not suspected to be dangerous but growing daily more languid and dejected on the th of july he confined himself to his room and a fever seized his spirits the symptoms grew every day more formidable but his condition did not enable him to procure any assistance the last time that the keeper saw him was on july the st when savage seeing him at his bedside said with an uncommon earnestness i have something to say to you sir but after a pause moved his hand in a melancholy manner and finding himself unable to recollect what he was going to communicate said tis gone the keeper soon after left him and the next morning he died he was buried in the churchyard of st peter at the expense of the keeper such were the life and death of richard savage a man equally distinguished by his virtues and vices and at once remarkable for his weaknesses and abilities he was of a middle stature of a thin habit of body a long visage coarse features and melancholy aspect of a grave and manly deportment a solemn dignity of mien but which upon a nearer acquaintance softened into an engaging easiness of manners his walk was slow and his voice tremulous and mournful he was easily excited to smiles but very seldom provoked to laughter his mind was in an uncommon degree vigorous and active his judgment was accurate his apprehension quick and his memory so tenacious that he was frequently observed to know what he had learned from others in a short time better that those by whom he was informed and could frequently recollect incidents with all their combination of circumstances which few would have regarded at the present time but which the quickness of his apprehension impressed upon him he had the art of escaping from his own reflections and accommodating himself to every new scene to this quality is to be imputed the extent of his knowledge compared with the small time which he spent in visible endeavours to acquire it he mingled in cursory conversation with the same steadiness of attention as others apply to a lecture and amidst the appearance of thoughtless gaiety lost no new idea that was started nor any hint that could be improved he had therefore made in coffeehouses the same proficiency as others in their closets and it is remarkable that the writings of a man of little education and little reading have an air of learning scarcely to be found in any other performances but which perhaps as often obscures as embellishes them his judgment was eminently exact both with regard to writings and to men the knowledge of life was indeed his chief attainment and it is not without some satisfaction that i can produce the suffrage of savage in favour of human nature of which he never appeared to entertain such odious ideas as some who perhaps had neither his judgment nor experience have published either in ostentation of their sagacity vindication of their crimes or gratification of their malice his method of life particularly qualified him for conversation of which he knew how to practise all the graces he was never vehement or loud but at once modest and easy open and respectful his language was vivacious or elegant and equally happy upon grave and humorous subjects he was generally censured for not knowing when to retire but that was not the defect of his judgment but of his fortune when he left his company he used frequently to spend the remaining part of the night in the street or at least was abandoned to gloomy reflections which it is not strange that he delayed as long as he could and sometimes forgot that he gave others pain to avoid it himself it cannot be said that he made use of his abilities for the direction of his own conduct an irregular and dissipated manner of life had made him the slave of every passion that happened to be excited by the presence of its object and that slavery to his passions reciprocally produced a life irregular and dissipated he was not master of his own motions nor could promise anything for the next day with regard to his economy nothing can be added to the relation of his life he appeared to think himself born to be supported by others and dispensed from all necessity of providing for himself he therefore never prosecuted any scheme of advantage nor endeavoured even to secure the profits which his writings might have afforded him his temper was in consequence of the dominion of his passions uncertain and capricious he was easily engaged and easily disgusted but he is accused of retaining his hatred more tenaciously than his benevolence he was compassionate both by nature and principle and always ready to perform offices of humanity but when he was provoked and very small offences were sufficient to provoke him he would prosecute his revenge with the utmost acrimony till his passion had subsided his friendship was therefore of little value for though he was zealous in the support or vindication of those whom he loved yet it was always dangerous to trust him because he considered himself as discharged by the first quarrel from all ties of honour and gratitude and would betray those secrets which in the warmth of confidence had been imparted to him this practice drew upon him an universal accusation of ingratitude nor can it be denied that he was very ready to set himself free from the load of an obligation for he could not bear to conceive himself in a state of dependence his pride being equally powerful with his other passions and appearing in the form of insolence at one time and of vanity at another vanity the most innocent species of pride was most frequently predominant he could not easily leave off when he had once begun to mention himself or his works nor ever read his verses without stealing his eyes from the page to discover in the faces of his audience how they were affected with any favourite passage a kinder name than that of vanity ought to be given to the delicacy with which he was always careful to separate his own merit from every other mans and to reject that praise to which he had no claim he did not forget in mentioning his performances to mark every line that had been suggested or amended and was so accurate as to relate that he owed three words in the wanderer to the advice of his friends his veracity was questioned but with little reason his accounts though not indeed always the same were generally consistent when he loved any man he suppressed all his faults and when he had been offended by him concealed all his virtues but his characters were generally true so far as he proceeded though it cannot be denied that his partiality might have sometimes the effect of falsehood in cases indifferent he was zealous for virtue truth and justice he knew very well the necessity of goodness to the present and future happiness of mankind nor is there perhaps any writer who has less endeavoured to please by flattering the appetites or perverting the judgment as an author therefore and he now ceases to influence mankind in any other character if one piece which he had resolved to suppress be excepted he has very little to fear from the strictest moral or religious censure and though he may not be altogether secure against the objections of the critic it must however be acknowledged that his works are the productions of a genius truly poetical and what many writers who have been more lavishly applauded cannot boast that they have an original air which has no resemblance of any foregoing writer that the versification and sentiments have a cast peculiar to themselves which no man can imitate with success because what was nature in savage would in another be affectation it must be confessed that his descriptions are striking his images animated his fictions justly imagined and his allegories artfully pursued that his diction is elevated though sometimes forced and his numbers sonorous and majestic though frequently sluggish and encumbered of his style the general fault is harshness and its general excellence is dignity of his sentiments the prevailing beauty is simplicity and uniformity the prevailing defect for his life or for his writings none who candidly consider his fortune will think an apology either necessary or difficult if he was not always sufficiently instructed in his subject his knowledge was at least greater than could have been attained by others in the same state if his works were sometimes unfinished accuracy cannot reasonably be expected from a man oppressed with want which he has no hope of relieving but by a speedy publication the insolence and resentment of which he is accused were not easily to be avoided by a great mind irritated by perpetual hardships and constrained hourly to return the spurns of contempt and repress the insolence of prosperity and vanity surely may be readily pardoned in him to whom life afforded no other comforts than barren praises and the consciousness of deserving them those are no proper judges of his conduct who have slumbered away their time on the down of plenty nor will any wise man easily presume to say had i been in savages condition i should have lived or written better than savage this relation will not be wholly without its use if those who languish under any part of his sufferings shall be enabled to fortify their patience by reflecting that they feel only these afflictions from which the abilities of savage did not exempt him or those who in confidence of superior capacities or attainments disregard the common maxims of life shall be reminded that nothing will supply the want of prudence and that negligence and irregularity long continued will make knowledge useless wit ridiculous and genius contemptible swift an account of dr swift has been already collected with great diligence and acuteness by dr hawkesworth according to a scheme which i laid before him in the intimacy of our friendship i cannot therefore be expected to say much of a life concerning which i had long since communicated my thoughts to a man capable of dignifying his narrations with so much elegance of language and force of sentiment jonathan swift was according to an account said to be written by himself the son of jonathan swift an attorney and was born at dublin on st andrews day according to his own report as delivered by pope to spence he was born at leicester the son of a clergyman who was minister of a parish in herefordshire during his life the place of his birth was undetermined he was contented to be called an irishman by the irish but would occasionally call himself an englishman the question may without much regret be left in the obscurity in which he delighted to involve it whatever was his birth his education was irish he was sent at the age of six to the school at kilkenny and in his fifteenth year was admitted into the university of dublin in his academical studies he was either not diligent or not happy it must disappoint every readers expectation that when at the usual time he claimed the bachelorship of arts he was found by the examiners too conspicuously deficient for regular admission and obtained his degree at last by special favour a term used in that university to denote want of merit of this disgrace it may be easily supposed that he was much ashamed and shame had its proper effect in producing reformation he resolved from that time to study eight hours a day and continued his industry for seven years with what improvement is sufficiently known this part of his story well deserves to be remembered it may afford useful admonition and powerful encouragement to men whose abilities have been made for a time useless by their passions or pleasures and who having lost one part of life in idleness are tempted to throw away the remainder in despair in this course of daily application he continued three years longer at dublin and in this time if the observation and memory of an old companion may be trusted he drew the first sketch of his tale of a tub when he was about oneandtwenty being by the death of godwin swift his uncle who had supported him left without subsistence he went to consult his mother who then lived at leicester about the future course of his life and by her direction solicited the advice and patronage of sir william temple who had married one of mrs swifts relations and whose father sir john temple master of the rolls in ireland had lived in great familiarity of friendship with godwin swift by whom jonathan had been to that time maintained temple received with sufficient kindness the nephew of his fathers friend with whom he was when they conversed together so much pleased that he detained him two years in his house here he became known to king william who sometimes visited temple when he was disabled by the gout and being attended by swift in the garden showed him how to cut asparagus in the dutch way king williams notions were all military and he expressed his kindness to swift by offering to make him a captain of horse when temple removed to moor park he took swift with him and when he was consulted by the earl of portland about the expedience of complying with a bill then depending for making parliaments triennial against which king william was strongly prejudiced after having in vain tried to show the earl that the proposal involved nothing dangerous to royal power he sent swift for the same purpose to the king swift who probably was proud of his employment and went with all the confidence of a young man found his arguments and his art of displaying them made totally ineffectual by the predetermination of the king and used to mention this disappointment as his first antidote against vanity before he left ireland he contracted a disorder as he thought by eating too much fruit the original of diseases is commonly obscure almost everybody eats as much fruit as he can get without any great inconvenience the disease of swift was giddiness with deafness which attacked him from time to time began very early pursued him through life and at last sent him to the grave deprived of reason being much oppressed at moor park by this grievous malady he was advised to try his native air and went to ireland but finding no benefit returned to sir william at whose house he continued his studies and is known to have read among other books cyprian and irenaeus he thought exercise of great necessity and used to run half a mile up and down a hill every two hours it is easy to imagine that the mode in which his first degree was conferred left him no great fondness for the university of dublin and therefore he resolved to become a master of arts at oxford in the testimonial which he produced the words of disgrace were omitted and he took his masters degree july with such reception and regard as fully contented him while he lived with temple he used to pay his mother at leicester a yearly visit he travelled on foot unless some violence of weather drove him into a waggon and at night he would go to a penny lodging where he purchased clean sheets for sixpence this practice lord orrery imputes to his innate love of grossness and vulgarity some may ascribe it to his desire of surveying human life through all its varieties and others perhaps with equal probability to a passion which seems to have been deeply fixed in his heart the love of a shilling in time he began to think that his attendance at moor park deserved some other recompense than the pleasure however mingled with improvement of temples conversation and grew so impatient that he went away in discontent temple conscious of having given reason for complaint is said to have made him deputy master of the rolls in ireland which according to his kinsmans account was an office which he knew him not able to discharge swift therefore resolved to enter into the church in which he had at first no higher hopes than of the chaplainship to the factory at lisbon but being recommended to lord capel he obtained the prebend of kilroot in connor of about a hundred pounds a year but the infirmities of temple made a companion like swift so necessary that he invited him back with a promise to procure him english preferment in exchange for the prebend which he desired him to resign with this request swift complied having perhaps equally repented their separation and they lived on together with mutual satisfaction and in the four years that passed between his return and temples death it is probable that he wrote the tale of a tub and the battle of the books swift began early to think or to hope that he was a poet and wrote pindaric odes to temple to the king and to the athenian society a knot of obscure men who published a periodical pamphlet of answers to questions sent or supposed to be sent by letters i have been told that dryden having perused these verses said cousin swift you will never be a poet and that this denunciation was the motive of swifts perpetual malevolence to dryden in temple died and left a legacy with his manuscripts to swift for whom he had obtained from king william a promise of the first prebend that should be vacant at westminster or canterbury that this promise might not be forgotten swift dedicated to the king the posthumous works with which he was intrusted but neither the dedication nor tenderness for the man whom he once had treated with confidence and fondness revived in king william the remembrance of his promise swift awhile attended the court but soon found his solicitations hopeless he was then invited by the earl of berkeley to accompany him into ireland as his private secretary but after having done the business till their arrival at dublin he then found that one bush had persuaded the earl that a clergyman was not a proper secretary and had obtained the office for himself in a man like swift such circumvention and inconstancy must have excited violent indignation but he had yet more to suffer lord berkeley had the disposal of the deanery of derry and swift expected to obtain it but by the secretarys influence supposed to have been secured by a bribe it was bestowed on somebody else and swift was dismissed with the livings of laracor and rathbeggin in the diocese of meath which together did not equal half the value of the deanery at laracor he increased the parochial duty by reading prayers on wednesdays and fridays and performed all the offices of his profession with great decency and exactness soon after his settlement at laracor he invited to ireland the unfortunate stella a young woman whose name was johnson the daughter of the steward of sir william temple who in consideration of her fathers virtues left her a thousand pounds with her came mrs dingley whose whole fortune was twentyseven pounds a year for her life with these ladies he passed his hours of relaxation and to them he opened his bosom but they never resided in the same house nor did he see either without a witness they lived at the parsonage when swift was away and when he returned removed to a lodging or to the house of a neighbouring clergyman swift was not one of those minds which amaze the world with early pregnancy his first work except his few poetical essays was the dissensions in athens and rome published in his thirtyfourth year after its appearance paying a visit to some bishop he heard mention made of the new pamphlet that burnet had written replete with political knowledge when he seemed to doubt burnets right to the work he was told by the bishop that he was a young man and still persisting to doubt that he was a very positive young man three years afterwards was published the tale of a tub of this book charity may be persuaded to think that it might be written by a man of a peculiar character without ill intention but it is certainly of dangerous example that swift was its author though it be universally believed was never owned by himself nor very well proved by any evidence but no other claimant can be produced and he did not deny it when archbishop sharp and the duchess of somerset by showing it to the queen debarred him from a bishopric when this wild work first raised the attention of the public sacheverell meeting smalridge tried to flatter him by seeming to think him the author but smalridge answered with indignation not all that you and i have in the world nor all that ever we shall have should hire me to write the tale of a tub the digression relating to wotton and bentley must be confessed to discover want of knowledge or want of integrity he did not understand the two controversies or he willingly misrepresented them but wit can stand its ground against truth only a little while the honours due to learning have been justly distributed by the decision of posterity the battle of the books is so like the combat des livres which the same question concerning the ancients and moderns had produced in france that the improbability of such a coincidence of thoughts without communication is not in my opinion balanced by the anonymous protestation prefixed in which all knowledge of the french book is peremptorily disowned for some time after swift was probably employed in solitary study gaining the qualifications requisite for future eminence how often he visited england and with what diligence he attended his parishes i know not it was not till about four years afterwards that he became a professed author and then one year produced the sentiments of a church of england man the ridicule of astrology under the name of bickerstaff the argument against abolishing christianity and the defence of the sacramental test the sentiments of a church of england man is written with great coolness moderation ease and perspicuity the argument against abolishing christianity is a very happy and judicious irony one passage in it deserves to be selected if christianity were once abolished how could the freethinkers the strong reasoners and the men of profound learning be able to find another subject so calculated in all points whereon to display their abilities what wonderful productions of wit should we be deprived of from those whose genius by continual practice hath been wholly turned upon raillery and invectives against religion and would therefore never be able to shine or distinguish themselves upon any other subject we are daily complaining of the great decline of wit among us and would take away the greatest perhaps the only topic we have left who would ever have suspected asgill for a wit or toland for a philosopher if the inexhaustible stock of christianity had not been at hand to provide them with materials what other subject through all art or nature could have produced tindal for a profound author or furnished him with readers it is the wise choice of the subject that alone adorns and distinguishes the writer for had a hundred such pens as these been employed on the side of religion they would have immediately sunk into silence and oblivion the reasonableness of a test is not hard to be proved but perhaps it must be allowed that the proper test has not been chosen the attention paid to the papers published under the name of bickerstaff induced steele when he projected the tatler to assume an appellation which had already gained possession of the readers notice in the year following he wrote a project for the advancement of religion addressed to lady berkeley by whose kindness it is not unlikely that he was advanced to his benefices to this project which is formed with great purity of intention and displayed with sprightliness and elegance it can only be objected that like many projects it is if not generally impracticable yet evidently hopeless as it supposes more zeal concord and perseverance than a view of mankind gives reason for expecting he wrote likewise this year a vindication of bickerstaff and an explanation of an ancient prophecy part written after the facts and the rest never completed but well planned to excite amazement soon after began the busy and important part of swifts life he was employed by the primate of ireland to solicit the queen for a remission of the first fruits and twentieth parts to the irish clergy with this purpose he had recourse to mr harley to whom he was mentioned as a man neglected and oppressed by the last ministry because he had refused to cooperate with some of their schemes what he had refused has never been told what he had suffered was i suppose the exclusion from a bishopric by the remonstrances of sharp whom he describes as the harmless tool of others hate and whom he represents as afterwards suing for pardon harleys designs and situation were such as made him glad of an auxiliary so well qualified for his service he therefore soon admitted him to familiarity whether ever to confidence some have made a doubt but it would have been difficult to excite his zeal without persuading him that he was trusted and not very easy to delude him by false persuasions he was certainly admitted to those meetings in which the first hints and original plan of action are supposed to have been formed and was one of the sixteen ministers or agents of the ministry who met weekly at each others houses and were united by the name of brother being not immediately considered as an obdurate tory he conversed indiscriminately with all the wits and was yet the friend of steele who in the tatler which began in april confesses the advantage of his conversation and mentions something contributed by him to his paper but he was now emerging into political controversy for the year produced the examiner of which swift wrote thirtythree papers in argument he may be allowed to have the advantage for where a wide system of conduct and the whole of a public character is laid open to inquiry the accuser having the choice of facts must be very unskilful if he does not prevail but with regard to wit i am afraid none of swifts papers will be found equal to those by which addison opposed him he wrote in the year a letter to the october club a number of tory gentlemen sent from the country to parliament who formed themselves into a club to the number of about a hundred and met to animate the zeal and raise the expectations of each other they thought with great reason that the ministers were losing opportunities that sufficient use was not made of the ardour of the nation they called loudly for more changes and stronger efforts and demanded the punishment of part and the dismission of the rest of those whom they considered as public robbers their eagerness was not gratified by the queen or by harley the queen was probably slow because she was afraid and harley was slow because he was doubtful he was a tory only by necessity or for convenience and when he had power in his hands had no settled purpose for which he should employ it forced to gratify to a certain degree the tories who supported him but unwilling to make his reconcilement to the whigs utterly desperate he corresponded at once with the two expectants of the crown and kept as has been observed the succession undetermined not knowing what to do he did nothing and with the fate of a double dealer at last he lost his power but kept his enemies swift seems to have concurred in opinion with the october club but it was not in his power to quicken the tardiness of harley whom he stimulated as much as he could but with little effect he that knows not whither to go is in no haste to move harley who was perhaps not quick by nature became yet more slow by irresolution and was content to hear that dilatoriness lamented as natural which he applauded in himself as politic without the tories however nothing could be done and as they were not to be gratified they must be appeased and the conduct of the minister if it could not be vindicated was to be plausibly excused early in the next year he published a proposal for correcting improving and ascertaining the english tongue in a letter to the earl of oxford written without much knowledge of the general nature of language and without any accurate inquiry into the history of other tongues the certainty and stability which contrary to all experience he thinks attainable he proposes to secure by instituting an academy the decrees of which every man would have been willing and many would have been proud to disobey and which being renewed by successive elections would in a short time have differed from itself swift now attained the zenith of his political importance he published the conduct of the allies ten days before the parliament assembled the purpose was to persuade the nation to a peace and never had any writer more success the people who had been amused with bonfires and triumphal processions and looked with idolatry on the general and his friends who as they thought had made england the arbitress of nations were confounded between shame and rage when they found that mines had been exhausted and millions destroyed to secure the dutch or aggrandise the emperor without any advantage to ourselves that we had been bribing our neighbours to fight their own quarrel and that amongst our enemies we might number our allies that is now no longer doubted of which the nation was then first informed that the war was unnecessarily protracted to fill the pockets of marlborough and that it would have been continued without end if he could have continued his annual plunder but swift i suppose did not yet know what he has since written that a commission was drawn which would have appointed him general for life had it not become ineffectual by the resolution of lord cowper who refused the seal whatever is received say the schools is received in proportion to the recipient the power of a political treatise depends much upon the disposition of the people the nation was then combustible and a spark set it on fire it is boasted that between november and january eleven thousand were sold a great number at that time when we were not yet a nation of readers to its propagation certainly no agency of power or influence was wanting it furnished arguments for conversation speeches for debate and materials for parliamentary resolutions yet surely whoever surveys this wonderworking pamphlet with cool perusal will confess that its efficacy was supplied by the passions of its readers that it operates by the mere weight of facts with very little assistance from the hand that produced them this year he published his reflections on the barrier treaty which carries on the design of his conduct of the allies and shows how little regard in that negotiation had been shown to the interest of england and how much of the conquered country had been demanded by the dutch this was followed by remarks on the bishop of sarums introduction to his third volume of the history of the reformation a pamphlet which burnet published as an alarm to warn the nation of the approach of popery swift who seems to have disliked the bishop with something more than political aversion treats him like one whom he is glad of an opportunity to insult swift being now the declared favourite and supposed confidant of the tory ministry was treated by all that depended on the court with the respect which dependents know how to pay he soon began to feel part of the misery of greatness he that could say that he knew him considered himself as having fortune in his power commissions solicitations remonstrances crowded about him he was expected to do every mans business to procure employment for one and to retain it for another in assisting those who addressed him he represents himself as sufficiently diligent and desires to have others believe what he probably believed himself that by his interposition many whigs of merit and among them addison and congreve were continued in their places but every man of known influence has so many petitions which he cannot grant that he must necessarily offend more than he gratifies because the preference given to one affords all the rest reason for complaint when i give away a place said lewis xiv i make a hundred discontented and one ungrateful much has been said of the equality and independence which he preserved in his conversation with the ministers of the frankness of his remonstrances and the familiarity of his friendship in accounts of this kind a few single incidents are set against the general tenour of behaviour no man however can pay a more servile tribute to the great than by suffering his liberty in their presence to aggrandise him in his own esteem between different ranks of the community there is necessarily some distance he who is called by his superior to pass the interval may properly accept the invitation but petulance and obtrusion are rarely produced by magnanimity nor have often any nobler cause than the pride of importance and the malice of inferiority he who knows himself necessary may set while that necessity lasts a high value upon himself as in a lower condition a servant eminently skilful may be saucy but he is saucy only because he is servile swift appears to have preserved the kindness of the great when they wanted him no longer and therefore it must be allowed that the childish freedom to which he seems enough inclined was overpowered by his better qualities his disinterestedness has likewise been mentioned a strain of heroism which would have been in his condition romantic and superfluous ecclesiastical benefices when they become vacant must be given away and the friends of power may if there be no inherent disqualification reasonably expect them swift accepted the deanery of st patrick the best preferment that his friends could venture to give him that ministry was in a great degree supported by the clergy who were not yet reconciled to the author of the tale of a tub and would not without much discontent and indignation have borne to see him installed in an english cathedral he refused indeed fifty pounds from lord oxford but he accepted afterwards a draught of a thousand upon the exchequer which was intercepted by the queens death and which he resigned as he says himself multa gemens with many a groan in the midst of his power and his politics he kept a journal of his visits his walks his interviews with ministers and quarrels with his servant and transmitted it to mrs johnson and mrs dingley to whom he knew that whatever befell him was interesting and no accounts could be too minute whether these diurnal trifles were properly exposed to eyes which had never received any pleasure from the presence of the dean may be reasonably doubted they have however some odd attraction the reader finding frequent mention of names which he has been used to consider as important goes on in hope of information and as there is nothing to fatigue attention if he is disappointed he can hardly complain it is easy to perceive from every page that though ambition pressed swift into a life of bustle the wish for a life of ease was always returning he went to take possession of his deanery as soon as he had obtained it but he was not suffered to stay in ireland more than a fortnight before he was recalled to england that he might reconcile lord oxford and lord bolingbroke who began to look on one another with malevolence which every day increased and which bolingbroke appeared to retain in his last years swift contrived an interview from which they both departed discontented he procured a second which only convinced him that the feud was irreconcilable he told them his opinion that all was lost this denunciation was contradicted by oxford but bolingbroke whispered that he was right before this violent dissension had shattered the ministry swift had published in the beginning of the year the public spirit of the whigs in answer to the crisis a pamphlet for which steele was expelled from the house of commons swift was now so far alienated from steele as to think him no longer entitled to decency and therefore treats him sometimes with contempt and sometimes with abhorrence in this pamphlet the scotch were mentioned in terms so provoking to that irritable nation that resolving not to be offended with impunity the scotch lords in a body demanded an audience of the queen and solicited reparation a proclamation was issued in which three hundred pounds were offered for the discovery of the author from this storm he was as he relates secured by a sleight of what kind or by whose prudence is not known and such was the increase of his reputation that the scottish nation applied again that he would be their friend he was become so formidable to the whigs that his familiarity with the ministers was clamoured at in parliament particularly by two men afterwards of great note aislabie and walpole but by the disunion of his great friends his importance and designs were now at an end and seeing his services at last useless he retired about june into berkshire where in the house of a friend he wrote what was then suppressed but has since appeared under the title of free thoughts on the present state of affairs while he was waiting in this retirement for events which time or chance might bring to pass the death of the queen broke down at once the whole system of tory politics and nothing remained but to withdraw from the implacability of triumphant whiggism and shelter himself in unenvied obscurity the accounts of his reception in ireland given by lord orrery and dr delany are so different that the credit of the writers both undoubtedly veracious cannot be saved but by supposing what i think is true that they speak of different times when delany says that he was received with respect he means for the first fortnight when he came to take legal possession and when lord orrery tells that he was pelted by the populace he is to be understood of the time when after the queens death he became a settled resident the archbishop of dublin gave him at first some disturbance in the exercise of his jurisdiction but it was soon discovered that between prudence and integrity he was seldom in the wrong and that when he was right his spirit did not easily yield to opposition having so lately quitted the tumults of a party and the intrigues of a court they still kept his thoughts in agitation as the sea fluctuates a while when the storm has ceased he therefore filled his hours with some historical attempts relating to the change of the ministers and the conduct of the ministry he likewise is said to have written a history of the four last years of queen anne which he began in her lifetime and afterwards laboured with great attention but never published it was after his death in the hands of lord orrery and dr king a book under that title was published with swifts name by dr lucas of which i can only say that it seemed by no means to correspond with the notions that i had formed of it from a conversation which i once heard between the earl of orrery and old mr lewis swift now much against his will commenced irishman for life and was to contrive how he might be best accommodated in a country where he considered himself as in a state of exile it seems that his first recourse was to piety the thoughts of death rushed upon him at this time with such incessant importunity that they took possession of his mind when he first waked for many years together he opened his house by a public table two days a week and found his entertainments gradually frequented by more and more visitants of learning among the men and of elegance among the women mrs johnson had left the country and lived in lodgings not far from the deanery on his public days she regulated the table but appeared at it as a mere guest like other ladies on other days he often dined at a stated price with mr worral a clergyman of his cathedral whose house was recommended by the peculiar neatness and pleasantry of his wife to this frugal mode of living he was first disposed by care to pay some debts which he had contracted and he continued it for the pleasure of accumulating money his avarice however was not suffered to obstruct the claims of his dignity he was served in plate and used to say that he was the poorest gentleman in ireland that ate upon plate and the richest that lived without a coach how he spent the rest of his time and how he employed his hours of study has been inquired with hopeless curiosity for who can give an account of anothers studies swift was not likely to admit any to his privacies or to impart a minute account of his business or his leisure soon after in his fortyninth year he was privately married to mrs johnson by dr ashe bishop of clogher as dr madden told me in the garden the marriage made no change in their mode of life they lived in different houses as before nor did she ever lodge in the deanery but when swift was seized with a fit of giddiness it would be difficult says lord orrery to prove that they were ever afterwards together without a third person the dean of st patricks lived in a private manner known and regarded only by his friends till about the year he by a pamphlet recommended to the irish the use and consequently the improvement of their manufactures for a man to use the productions of his own labour is surely a natural right and to like best what he makes himself is a natural passion but to excite this passion and enforce this right appeared so criminal to those who had an interest in the english trade that the printer was imprisoned and as hawkesworth justly observes the attention of the public being by this outrageous resentment turned upon the proposal the author was by consequence made popular in died mrs van homrigh a woman made unhappy by her admiration of wit and ignominiously distinguished by the name of vanessa whose conduct has been already sufficiently discussed and whose history is too well known to be minutely repeated she was a young woman fond of literature whom decanus the dean called cadenus by transposition of the letters took pleasure in directing and instructing till from being proud of his praise she grew fond of his person swift was then about fortyseven at an age when vanity is strongly excited by the amorous attention of a young woman if it be said that swift should have checked a passion which he never meant to gratify recourse must be had to that extenuation which he so much despised men are but men perhaps however he did not at first know his own mind and as he represents himself was undetermined for his admission of her courtship and his indulgence of her hopes after his marriage to stella no other honest plea can be found than that he delayed a disagreeable discovery from time to time dreading the immediate bursts of distress and watching for a favourable moment she thought herself neglected and died of disappointment having ordered by her will the poem to be published in which cadenus had proclaimed her excellence and confessed his love the effect of the publication upon the dean and stella is thus related by delany i have good reason to believe that they both were greatly shocked and distressed though it may be differently upon this occasion the dean made a tour to the south of ireland for about two months at this time to dissipate his thoughts and give place to obloquy and stella retired upon the earnest invitation of the owner to the house of a cheerful generous goodnatured friend of the deans whom she always much loved and honoured there my informer often saw her and i have reason to believe used his utmost endeavours to relieve support and amuse her in this sad situation one little incident he told me of on that occasion i think i shall never forget as his friend was an hospitable openhearted man well beloved and largely acquainted it happened one day that some gentlemen dropped in to dinner who were strangers to stellas situation and as the poem of cadenus and vanessa was then the general topic of conversation one of them said surely that vanessa must be an extraordinary woman that could inspire the dean to write so finely upon her mrs johnson smiled and answered that she thought that point not quite so clear for it was well known that the dean could write finely upon a broomstick the great acquisition of esteem and influence was made by the drapiers letters in one wood of wolverhampton in staffordshire a man enterprising and rapacious had as is said by a present to the duchess of munster obtained a patent empowering him to coin one hundred and eighty thousand pounds of halfpence and farthings for the kingdom of ireland in which there was a very inconvenient and embarrassing scarcity of copper coin so that it was possible to run in debt upon the credit of a piece of money for the cook or keeper of an alehouse could not refuse to supply a man that had silver in his hand and the buyer would not leave his money without change the project was therefore plausible the scarcity which was already great wood took care to make greater by agents who gathered up the old halfpence and was about to turn his brass into gold by pouring the treasures of his new mint upon ireland when swift finding that the metal was debased to an enormous degree wrote letters under the name of m b drapier to show the folly of receiving and the mischief that must ensue by giving gold and silver for coin worth perhaps not a third part of its nominal value the nation was alarmed the new coin was universally refused but the governors of ireland considered resistance to the kings patent as highly criminal and one whitshed then chief justice who had tried the printer of the former pamphlet and sent out the jury nine times till by clamour and menaces they were frightened into a special verdict now presented the drapier but could not prevail on the grand jury to find the bill lord carteret and the privy council published a proclamation offering three hundred pounds for discovering the author of the fourth letter swift had concealed himself from his printers and trusted only his butler who transcribed the paper the man immediately after the appearance of the proclamation strolled from the house and stayed out all night and part of the next day there was reason enough to fear that he had betrayed his master for the reward but he came home and the dean ordered him to put off his livery and leave the house for says he i know that my life is in your power and i will not bear out of fear either your insolence or negligence the man excused his fault with great submission and begged that he might be confined in the house while it was in his power to endanger the master but the dean resolutely turned him out without taking further notice of him till the term of the information had expired and then received him again soon afterwards he ordered him and the rest of his servants into his presence without telling his intentions and bade them take notice that their fellowservant was no longer robert the butler but that his integrity had made him mr blakeney verger of st patricks an officer whose income was between thirty and forty pounds a year yet he still continued for some years to serve his old master as his butler swift was known from this time by the appellation of the dean he was honoured by the populace as the champion patron and instructor of ireland and gained such power as considered both in its extent and duration scarcely any man has ever enjoyed without greater wealth or higher station he was from this important year the oracle of the traders and the idol of the rabble and by consequence was feared and courted by all to whom the kindness of the traders or the populace was necessary the drapier was a sign the drapier was a health and which way soever the eye or the ear was turned some tokens were found of the nations gratitude to the drapier the benefit was indeed great he had rescued ireland from a very oppressive and predatory invasion and the popularity which he had gained he was diligent to keep by appearing forward and zealous on every occasion where the public interest was supposed to be involved nor did he much scruple to boast his influence for when upon some attempts to regulate the coin archbishop boulter then one of the justices accused him of exasperating the people he exculpated himself by saying if i had lifted up my finger they would have torn you to pieces but the pleasure of popularity was soon interrupted by domestic misery mrs johnson whose conversation was to him the great softener of the ills of life began in the year of the drapiers triumph to decline and two years afterwards was so wasted with sickness that her recovery was considered as hopeless swift was then in england and had been invited by lord bolingbroke to pass the winter with him in france but this call of calamity hastened him to ireland where perhaps his presence contributed to restore her to imperfect and tottering health he was now so much at ease that he returned to england where he collected three volumes of miscellanies in conjunction with pope who prefixed a querulous and apologetical preface this important year sent likewise into the world gullivers travels a production so new and strange that it filled the reader with a mingled emotion of merriment and amazement it was received with such avidity that the price of the first edition was raised before the second could be made it was read by the high and the low the learned and illiterate criticism was for a while lost in wonder no rules of judgment were applied to a book written in open defiance of truth and regularity but when distinctions came to be made the part which gave the least pleasure was that which describes the flying island and that which gave most disgust must be the history of houyhnhnms while swift was enjoying the reputation of his new work the news of the kings death arrived and he kissed the hands of the new king and queen three days after their accession by the queen when she was princess he had been treated with some distinction and was well received by her in her exaltation but whether she gave hopes which she never took care to satisfy or he formed expectations which she never meant to raise the event was that he always afterwards thought on her with malevolence and particularly charged her with breaking her promise of some medals which she engaged to send him i know not whether she had not in her turn some reason for complaint a letter was sent her not so much entreating as requiring her patronage of mrs barber an ingenious irishwoman who was then begging subscriptions for her poems to this letter was subscribed the name of swift and it has all the appearance of his diction and sentiments but it was not written in his hand and had some little improprieties when he was charged with this letter he laid hold of the inaccuracies and urged the improbability of the accusation but never denied it he shuffles between cowardice and veracity and talks big when he says nothing he seems desirous enough of recommencing courtier and endeavoured to gain the kindness of mrs howard remembering what mrs masham had performed in former times but his flatteries were like those of other wits unsuccessful the lady either wanted power or had no ambition of poetical immortality he was seized not long afterwards by a fit of giddiness and again heard of the sickness and danger of mrs johnson he then left the house of pope as it seems with very little ceremony finding that two sick friends cannot live together and did not write to him till he found himself at chester he turned to a home of sorrow poor stella was sinking into the grave and after a languishing decay of about two months died in her fortyfourth year on january how much he wished her life his papers show nor can it be doubted that he dreaded the death of her whom he loved most aggravated by the consciousness that himself had hastened it beauty and the power of pleasing the greatest external advantages that woman can desire or possess were fatal to the unfortunate stella the man whom she had the misfortune to love was as delany observes fond of singularity and desirous to make a mode of happiness for himself different from the general course of things and order of providence from the time of her arrival in ireland he seems resolved to keep her in his power and therefore hindered a match sufficiently advantageous by accumulating unreasonable demands and prescribing conditions that could not be performed while she was at her own disposal he did not consider his possession as secure resentment ambition or caprice might separate them he was therefore resolved to make assurance doubly sure and to appropriate her by a private marriage to which he had annexed the expectation of all the pleasures of perfect friendship without the uneasiness of conjugal restraint but with this state poor stella was not satisfied she never was treated as a wife and to the world she had the appearance of a mistress she lived sullenly on in hope that in time he would own and receive her but the time did not come till the change of his manners and depravation of his mind made her tell him when he offered to acknowledge her that it was too late she then gave up herself to sorrowful resentment and died under the tyranny of him by whom she was in the highest degree loved and honoured what were her claims to this eccentric tenderness by which the laws of nature were violated to restrain her curiosity will inquire but how shall it be gratified swift was a lover his testimony may be suspected delany and the irish saw with swifts eyes and therefore add little confirmation that she was virtuous beautiful and elegant in a very high degree such admiration from such a lover makes it very probable but she had not much literature for she could not spell her own language and of her wit so loudly vaunted the smart sayings which swift himself has collected afford no splendid specimen the reader of swifts letter to a lady on her marriage may be allowed to doubt whether his opinion of female excellence ought implicitly to be admitted for if his general thoughts on women were such as he exhibits a very little sense in a lady would enrapture and a very little virtue would astonish him stellas supremacy therefore was perhaps only local she was great because her associates were little in some remarks lately published on the life of swift his marriage is mentioned as fabulous or doubtful but alas poor stella as dr madden told me related her melancholy story to dr sheridan when he attended her as a clergyman to prepare her for death and delany mentions it not with doubt but only with regret swift never mentioned her without a sigh the rest of his life was spent in ireland in a country to which not even power almost despotic nor flattery almost idolatrous could reconcile him he sometimes wished to visit england but always found some reason of delay he tells pope in the decline of life that he hopes once more to see him but if not says he we must part as all human beings have parted after the death of stella his benevolence was contracted and his severity exasperated he drove his acquaintance from his table and wondered why he was deserted but he continued his attention to the public and wrote from time to time such directions admonitions or censures as the exigence of affairs in his opinion made proper and nothing fell from his pen in vain in a short poem on the presbyterians whom he always regarded with detestation he bestowed one stricture upon bettesworth a lawyer eminent for his insolence to the clergy which from very considerable reputation brought him into immediate and universal contempt bettesworth enraged at his disgrace and loss went to swift and demanded whether he was the author of that poem mr bettesworth answered he i was in my youth acquainted with great lawyers who knowing my disposition to satire advised me that if any scoundrel or blockhead whom i had lampooned should ask are you the author of this paper i should tell him that i was not the author and therefore i tell you mr bettesworth that i am not the author of these lines bettesworth was so little satisfied with this account that he publicly professed his resolution of a violent and corporal revenge but the inhabitants of st patricks district embodied themselves in the deans defence bettesworth declared in parliament that swift had deprived him of twelve hundred pounds a year swift was popular awhile by another mode of beneficence he set aside some hundreds to be lent in small sums to the poor from five shillings i think to five pounds he took no interest and only required that at repayment a small fee should be given to the accountant but he required that the day of promised payment should be exactly kept a severe and punctilious temper is ill qualified for transactions with the poor the day was often broken and the loan was not repaid this might have been easily foreseen but for this swift had made no provision of patience or pity he ordered his debtors to be sued a severe creditor has no popular character what then was likely to be said of him who employs the catchpoll under the appearance of charity the clamour against him was loud and the resentment of the populace outrageous he was therefore forced to drop his scheme and own the folly of expecting punctuality from the poor his asperity continually increasing condemned him to solitude and his resentment of solitude sharpened his asperity he was not however totally deserted some men of learning and some women of elegance often visited him and he wrote from time to time either verse or prose of his verses he willingly gave copies and is supposed to have felt no discontent when he saw them printed his favourite maxim was vive la bagatelle he thought trifles a necessary part of life and perhaps found them necessary to himself it seems impossible to him to be idle and his disorders made it difficult or dangerous to be long seriously studious or laboriously diligent the love of ease is always gaining upon age and he had one temptation to petty amusements peculiar to himself whatever he did he was sure to hear applauded and such was his predominance over all that approached that all their applauses were probably sincere he that is much flattered soon learns to flatter himself we are commonly taught our duty by fear or shame and how can they act upon the man who hears nothing but his own praises as his years increased his fits of giddiness and deafness grew more frequent and his deafness made conversation difficult they grew likewise more severe till in as he was writing a poem called the legion club he was seized with a fit so painful and so long continued that he never after thought it proper to attempt any work of thought or labour he was always careful of his money and was therefore no liberal entertainer but was less frugal of his wine than of his meat when his friends of either sex came to him in expectation of a dinner his custom was to give every one a shilling that they might please themselves with their provision at last his avarice grew too powerful for his kindness he would refuse a bottle of wine and in ireland no man visits where he cannot drink having thus excluded conversation and desisted from study he had neither business nor amusement for having by some ridiculous resolution or mad vow determined never to wear spectacles he could make like little use of books in his latter years his ideas therefore being neither renovated by discourse nor increased by reading wore gradually away and left his mind vacant to the vexations of the hour till at last his anger was heightened into madness he however permitted one book to be published which had been the production of former years polite conversation which appeared in the directions for servants was printed soon after his death these two performances show a mind incessantly attentive and when it was not employed upon great things busy with minute occurrences it is apparent that he must have had the habit of noting whatever he observed for such a number of particulars could never have been assembled by the power of recollection he grew more violent and his mental powers declined till it was found necessary that legal guardians should be appointed of his person and fortune he now lost distinction his madness was compounded of rage and fatuity the last face that he knew was that of mrs whiteway and her he ceased to know in a little time his meat was brought him cut into mouthfuls but he would never touch it while the servant stayed and at last after it had stood perhaps an hour would eat it walking for he continued his old habit and was on his feet ten hours a day next year he had an inflammation in his left eye which swelled it to the size of an egg with boils in other parts he was kept long waking with the pain and was not easily restrained by five attendants from tearing out his eye the tumour at last subsided and a short interval of reason ensuing in which he knew his physician and his family gave hopes of his recovery but in a few days he sank into a lethargic stupidity motionless heedless and speechless but it is said that after a year of total silence when his housekeeper on the th of november told him that the usual bonfires and illuminations were preparing to celebrate his birthday he answered it is all folly they had better let it alone it is remembered that he afterwards spoke now and then or gave some intimation of a meaning but at last sank into a perfect silence which continued till about the end of october when in his seventyeighth year he expired without a struggle when swift is considered as an author it is just to estimate his powers by their effects in the reign of queen anne he turned the stream of popularity against the whigs and must be confessed to have dictated for a time the political opinions of the english nation in the succeeding reign he delivered ireland from plunder and oppression and showed that wit confederated with truth had such force as authority was unable to resist he said truly of himself that ireland was his debtor it was from the time when he first began to patronise the irish that they may date their riches and prosperity he taught them first to know their own interest their weight and their strength and gave them spirit to assert that equality with their fellowsubjects to which they have ever since been making vigorous advances and to claim those rights which they have at last established nor can they be charged with ingratitude to their benefactor for they reverenced him as a guardian and obeyed him as a dictator in his works he has given very different specimens both of sentiments and expression his tale of a tub has little resemblance to his other pieces it exhibits a vehemence and rapidity of mind a copiousness of images and vivacity of diction such as he afterwards never possessed or never exerted it is of a mode so distinct and peculiar that it must be considered by itself what is true of that is not true of anything else which he has written in his other works is found an equable tenour of easy language which rather trickles than flows his delight was in simplicity that he has in his works no metaphor as has been said is not true but his few metaphors seem to be received rather by necessity than choice he studied purity and though perhaps all his strictures are not exact yet it is not often that solecisms can be found and whoever depends on his authority may generally conclude himself safe his sentences are never too much dilated or contracted and it will not be easy to find any embarrassment in the complication of his clauses any inconsequence in his connections or abruptness in his transitions his style was well suited to his thoughts which are never subtilised by nice disquisitions decorated by sparkling conceits elevated by ambitious sentences or variegated by farsought learning he pays no court to the passions he excites neither surprise nor admiration he always understands himself and his readers always understand him the peruser of swift wants little previous knowledge it will be sufficient that he is acquainted with common words and common things he is neither required to mount elevations nor to explore profundities his passage is always on a level along solid ground without asperities without obstruction this easy and safe conveyance of meaning it was swifts desire to attain and for having attained he deserves praise for purposes merely didactic when something is to be told that was not known before it is the best mode but against that inattention by which known truths are suffered to lie neglected it makes no provision it instructs but does not persuade by his political education he was associated with the whigs but he deserted them when they deserted their principles yet without running into the contrary extreme he continued throughout his life to retain the disposition which he assigns to the churchofengland man of thinking commonly with the whigs of the state and with the tories of the church he was a churchman rationally zealous he desired the prosperity and maintained the honour of the clergy of the dissenters he did not wish to infringe the toleration but he opposed their encroachments to his duty as dean he was very attentive he managed the revenues of his church with exact economy and it is said by delany that more money was under his direction laid out in repairs than had ever been in the same time since its first erection of his choir he was eminently careful and though he neither loved nor understood music took care that all the singers were well qualified admitting none without the testimony of skilful judges in his church he restored the practice of weekly communion and distributed the sacramental elements in the most solemn and devout manner with his own hand he came to church every morning preached commonly in his turn and attended the evening anthem that it might not be negligently performed he read the service rather with a strong nervous voice than in a graceful manner his voice was sharp and hightoned rather than harmonious he entered upon the clerical state with hope to excel in preaching but complained that from the time of his political controversies he could only preach pamphlets this censure of himself if judgment be made from those sermons which have been printed was unreasonably severe the suspicions of his irreligion proceeded in a great measure from his dread of hypocrisy instead of wishing to seem better he delighted in seeming worse than he was he went in london to early prayers lest he should be seen at church he read prayers to his servants every morning with such dexterous secrecy that dr delany was six months in his house before he knew it he was not only careful to hide the good which he did but willingly incurred the suspicion of evil which he did not he forgot what himself had formerly asserted that hypocrisy is less mischievous than open impiety dr delany with all his zeal for his honour has justly condemned this part of his character the person of swift had not many recommendations he had a kind of muddy complexion which though he washed himself with oriental scrupulosity did not look clear he had a countenance sour and severe which he seldom softened by any appearance of gaiety he stubbornly resisted any tendency to laughter to his domestics he was naturally rough and a man of a rigorous temper with that vigilance of minute attention which his works discover must have been a master that few could bear that he was disposed to do his servants good on important occasions is no great mitigation benefaction can be but rare and tyrannic peevishness is perpetual he did not spare the servants of others once when he dined alone with the earl of orrery he said of one that waited in the room that man has since we sat to the table committed fifteen faults what the faults were lord orrery from whom i heard the story had not been attentive enough to discover my number may perhaps not be exact in his economy he practised a peculiar and offensive parsimony without disguise or apology the practice of saving being once necessary became habitual and grew first ridiculous and at last detestable but his avarice though it might exclude pleasure was never suffered to encroach upon his virtue he was frugal by inclination but liberal by principle and if the purpose to which he destined his little accumulations be remembered with his distribution of occasional charity it will perhaps appear that he only liked one mode of expense better than another and saved merely that he might have something to give he did not grow rich by injuring his successors but left both laracor and the deanery more valuable than he found them with all this talk of his covetousness and generosity it should be remembered that he was never rich the revenue of his deanery was not much more than seven hundred a year his beneficence was not graced with tenderness or civility he relieved without pity and assisted without kindness so that those who were fed by him could hardly love him he made a rule to himself to give but one piece at a time and therefore always stored his pocket with coins of different value whatever he did he seemed willing to do in a manner peculiar to himself without sufficiently considering that singularity as it implies a contempt of the general practice is a kind of defiance which justly provokes the hostility of ridicule he therefore who indulges peculiar habits is worse than others if he be not better of his humour a story told by pope may afford a specimen dr swift has an odd blunt way that is mistaken by strangers for ill nature tis so odd that theres no describing it but by facts ill tell you one that first comes into my head one evening gay and i went to see him you know how intimately we were all acquainted on our coming in heyday gentlemen says the doctor whats the meaning of this visit how came you to leave the great lords that you are so fond of to come hither to see a poor dean because we would rather see you than any of them ay anyone that did not know so well as i do might believe you but since you are come i must get some supper for you i suppose no doctor we have supped already supped already thats impossible why tis not eight oclock yet thats very strange but if you had not supped i must have got something for you let me see what should i have had a couple of lobsters ay that would have done very well two shillings tarts a shilling but you will drink a glass of wine with me though you supped so much before your usual time only to spare my pocket no we had rather talk with you than drink with you but if you had supped with me as in all reason you ought to have done you must then have drunk with me a bottle of wine two shillings two and two is four and one is five just twoandsixpence apiece there pope theres half a crown for you and theres another for you sir for i wont save anything by you i am determined this was all said and done with his usual seriousness on such occasions and in spite of everything we could say to the contrary he actually obliged us to take the money in the intercourse of familiar life he indulged his disposition to petulance and sarcasm and thought himself injured if the licentiousness of his raillery the freedom of his censures or the petulance of his frolics was resented or repressed he predominated over his companions with very high ascendancy and probably would bear none over whom he could not predominate to give him advice was in the style of his friend delany to venture to speak to him this customary superiority soon grew too delicate for truth and swift with all his penetration allowed himself to be delighted with low flattery on all common occasions he habitually affects a style of arrogance and dictates rather than persuades this authoritative and magisterial language he expected to be received as his peculiar mode of jocularity but he apparently flattered his own arrogance by an assumed imperiousness in which he was ironical only to the resentful and to the submissive sufficiently serious he told stories with great felicity and delighted in doing what he knew himself to do well he was therefore captivated by the respectful silence of a steady listener and told the same tales too often he did not however claim the right of talking alone for it was his rule when he had spoken a minute to give room by a pause for any other speaker of time on all occasions he was an exact computer and knew the minutes required to every common operation it may be justly supposed that there was in his conversation what appears so frequently in his letters an affectation of familiarity with the great an ambition of momentary equality sought and enjoyed by the neglect of those ceremonies which custom has established as the barriers between one order of society and another this transgression of regularity was by himself and his admirers termed greatness of soul but a great mind disdains to hold anything by courtesy and therefore never usurps what a lawful claimant may take away he that encroaches on anothers dignity puts himself in his power he is either repelled with helpless indignity or endured by clemency and condescension of swifts general habits of thinking if his letters can be supposed to afford any evidence he was not a man to be either loved or envied he seems to have wasted life in discontent by the rage of neglected pride and the languishment of unsatisfied desire he is querulous and fastidious arrogant and malignant he scarcely speaks of himself but with indignant lamentations or of others but with insolent superiority when he is gay and with angry contempt when he is gloomy from the letters that passed between him and pope it might be inferred that they with arbuthnot and gay had engrossed all the understanding and virtue of mankind that their merits filled the world or that there was no hope of more they show the age involved in darkness and shade the picture with sullen emulation when the queens death drove him into ireland he might be allowed to regret for a time the interception of his views the extinction of his hopes and his ejection from gay scenes important employment and splendid friendships but when time had enabled reason to prevail over vexation the complaints which at first were natural became ridiculous because they were useless but querulousness was now grown habitual and he cried out when he probably had ceased to feel his reiterated wailings persuaded bolingbroke that he was really willing to quit his deanery for an english parish and bolingbroke procured an exchange which was rejected and swift still retained the pleasure of complaining the greatest difficulty that occurs in analysing his character is to discover by what depravity of intellect he took delight in revolving ideas from which almost every other mind shrinks with disgust the ideas of pleasure even when criminal may solicit the imagination but what has disease deformity and filth upon which the thoughts can be allured to dwell delany is willing to think that swifts mind was not much tainted with this gross corruption before his long visit to pope he does not consider how he degrades his hero by making him at fiftynine the pupil of turpitude and liable to the malignant influence of an ascendant mind but the truth is that gulliver had described his yahoos before the visit and he that had formed those images had nothing filthy to learn i have here given the character of swift as he exhibits himself to my perception but now let another be heard who knew him better dr delany after long acquaintance describes him to lord orrery in these terms my lord when you consider swifts singular peculiar and most variegated vein of wit always rightly intended although not always so rightly directed delightful in many instances and salutary even where it is most offensive when you consider his strict truth his fortitude in resisting oppression and arbitrary power his fidelity in friendship his sincere love and zeal for religion his uprightness in making right resolutions and his steadiness in adhering to them his care of his church its choir its economy and its income his attention to all those who preached in his cathedral in order to their amendment in pronunciation and style as also his remarkable attention to the interest of his successors preferably to his own present emoluments his invincible patriotism even to a country which he did not love his very various welldevised welljudged and extensive charities throughout his life and his whole fortune to say nothing of his wifes conveyed to the same christian purposes at his death charities from which he could enjoy no honour advantage or satisfaction of any kind in this world when you consider his ironical and humorous as well as his serious schemes for the promotion of true religion and virtue his success in soliciting for the first fruits and twentieths to the unspeakable benefit of the established church of ireland and his felicity to rate it no higher in giving occasion to the building of fifty new churches in london all this considered the character of his life will appear like that of his writings they will both bear to be reconsidered and reexamined with the utmost attention and always discover new beauties and excellences upon every examination they will bear to be considered as the sun in which the brightness will hide the blemishes and whenever petulant ignorance pride malignity or envy interposes to cloud or sully his fame i take upon me to pronounce that the eclipse will not last long to conclude no man ever deserved better of his country than swift did of his a steady persevering inflexible friend a wise a watchful and a faithful counsellor under many severe trials and bitter persecutions to the manifest hazard both of his liberty and fortune he lived a blessing he died a benefactor and his name will ever live an honour to ireland in the poetical works of dr swift there is not much upon which the critic can exercise his powers they are often humorous almost always light and have the qualities which recommend such compositions easiness and gaiety they are for the most part what their author intended the diction is correct the numbers are smooth and the rhymes exact there seldom occurs a hardlaboured expression or a redundant epithet all his verses exemplify his own definition of a good style they consist of proper words in proper places to divide this collection into classes and show how some pieces are gross and some are trifling would be to tell the reader what he knows already and to find faults of which the author could not be ignorant who certainly wrote not often to his judgment but his humour it was said in a preface to one of the irish editions that swift had never been known to take a single thought from any writer ancient or modern this is not literally true but perhaps no writer can easily be found that has borrowed so little or that in all his excellences and all his defects has so well maintained his claim to be considered as original
