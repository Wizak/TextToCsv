 preface there was fire on earth before the fire god came there has always been fire what yanginatep gave to humankind was madness yanginateps children will play with fire even after they burn their fingers it was only yanginateps joke then and for unmeasured time after but a greater god called down the great cold and yanginateps joke came into its own in the icy north people could not survive unless the fire god favored one of their number cautious men and women never burned themselves twice but their people died of the cold someone must tend the fire during the terrible winters twelve thousand years before the birth of christ when most of the gods had gone mythical and magic was fading from the world yanginateps gift remained book one whandall placehold part one childhood chapter they burned the city when whandall placehold was two years old and again when he was seven at seven he saw and understood more the women waited with the children in the courtyard through a day and a night and another day the day sky was black and red the night sky glowed red and orange dazzling and strange across the street a granary burned like a huge torch strangers trying to fight the fire made shadow pictures the placehold men came home with what theyd gathered shells clothing cookware furniture jewelry magical items a cauldron that would heat up by itself the excitement was infectious men and women paired off and fought over the pairings and pothefit went out again with resalet but only resalet came back afterward whandall went with the other boys to watch the loggers cutling redwoods for the rebuilding the forest cupped teps town like a hand there were stories but nobody could tell whandall what was beyond the forest where redwoods were pillars big enough to support the sky big enough to replace a dozen houses the great trees stood well apart each guarding its turf lesser vegetation gathered around the base of each redwood like a malevolent army the army had many weapons some plants bristled with daggers some had burrs to anchor seeds in hair or flesh some secreted poison some would whip a child across the face with their branches loggers carried axes and long pole with blades at the ends leather armor and wooden masks made them hard to recognize as men with the poles they could reach out and under to cut the roots of the spiked or poisoned lesser plants and push them aside until one tall redwood was left defenseless then they bowed to it then they chopped at the base until in tremendous majesty and with a sound like the end of the world it fell they never seemed to notice that they were being watched from cover by a swarm of children the forest had dangers for city children but being caught was not one of them if you were caught spying in town you would be lucky to escape without broken bones it was safer to spy on the loggers one morning bansh and ilther brushed a vine bansh began scratching and then ilther then thousands of bumps sprouted over ethers arm and almost suddenly it was bigger than his leg banshs hand and the ear hed scratched were swelling like nightmares and ilther was on the ground swelling everywhere and fighting hard to breathe shastern wailed and ran before whandall could catch him he brushed past leaves like a bouquet of blades and was several paces beyond before he slowed stopped and turned to look at whandall what should i do now his leathers were cut to ribbons across his chest and left arm the blood spilling scarlet through the slashes the forest was not impenetrable there were thorns and poison plants but also open spaces stick with those you could get through it looked like you could get through without touching anything almost and the children were doing that scattering finding their own paths out but whandall caught the screaming shastern by his bloody wrist and towed him toward the loggers because shastern was his younger brother because the loggers were close because somebody would help a screaming child the woodsmen saw themsaw them and turned away but one dropped his ax and jogged toward the child in zigzag fashion avoiding what armory plants a wildflower bed shastern went quiet under the woodsmans intense gaze the woodsman pulled the leather armor away and wrapped shasterns wounds in strips of clean cloth pulling it tight whandall was trying to tell him about the other children the woodsman looked up who are you boy im whandall of serpents walk nobody gave his family name im kreeg miller how many whandall barely hesitated two tens of us have they all gothe patted shasterns armorleathers some kreeg picked up cloth a leather bottle some other things now one of the others was shouting angrily while trying not to look at the children kreeg what do you want with those candlestubs weve got work to do kreeg ignored him and followed the path as whandall pointed it out there were hurt children widely scattered kreeg dealt with them whandall didnt understand until a long time later why other loggers wouldnt help whandall took shastern home through dirty birds to avoid bull pizzles in dirty birds a pair of adolescent lordkin would not let them pass whandall showed them three gaudy white blossoms bound up in a scrap of cloth careful not to touch them himself he gave one to each of i ho hoys and put the third away the boys sniffed the womanflowers deep fragrance way nice what else have you got nothing falcon brother dirty birds liked to be called falcons so you did that now go and wash your hands and face wash hard or youll swell up like melons we have to go the falcons affected to be amused but they went off toward the fountain whandall and shastern ran through dirty birds into serpents walk marks and signs showed when you passed from another district to serpents walk but whandall would have known serpents walk without them there werent as many trash piles and burnedout houses were rebuilt faster the placehold stood alone in its block three stories of gray stone two older boys played with knives just outside the door inside uncle totto lay asleep in the corridor where you had to step over him to get in whandall tried to creep past him huh whandall my lad whats going on here he looked at shastern saw bloody bandages and shook his head bad business whats going on shastern needs help i see that what happened whandall tried to get past but it was no use uncle totto wanted to hear the whole story and shastern had been bleeding too long whandall started screaming totto raised his fist whandall pulled his brother upstairs a sister was washing vegetables for dinner and she shouted too women came yelling totto cursed and retreated mother wasnt home that night mothers motherdargramnet if you were speaking to strangerssent wanshig to tell banshs family she put shastern in mothers room and sat with him until he fell asleep then she came into the big secondfloor placehold room and sat in her big chair often that room was full of placehold men usually playful but sometimes they shouted and fought children learned to hide in the smaller rooms cling to womens skirts or find errands in do tonight dargramnet asked the men in help with the injured children and they all left so that she was alone with whandall she held whandall in her lap they wouldnt help he sobbed only the one kreeg miller we could have saved iltherit was too late for bansh but we could have saved ilther only they wouldnt help mothers mother nodded and petted him no of course they wouldnt she said not now when i was a girl we helped each other not just kin not just lordkin she had a faint smile as if she saw things whandall would never see and liked them men stayed home mothers taught girls and men taught boys and there wasnt all this fighting not even in the burnings bonfires we made bonfires for yanginatep and he helped us houses of ill luck places of illness or murder we burned those too we knew how to serve yanginatep then when i was a girl there were wizards real wizards a wizard killed pothefit whandall said gravely hush mothers mother said whats done is done it wont do to think about burnings the fire god whandall said yanginatep sleeps mothers mother said the fire god was stronger when i was a girl in those days there were real wizards in lords town and they did real magic is that where lords live no lords dont live there lords live in lordshills over the hills past the black pit nearly all the way to the sea mothers mother said and smiled again and yes its beautiful we used to go there sometimes he thought about the prettiest places he had seen peacegiven square when the kinless had swept it clean and set up their tents the flower market which he wasnt supposed to go to most of the town was dirty with winding streets houses falling down and big houses that had been well built but were going to ruin not like placehold placehold was stone big orderly with roof gardens dargramnet made the women and children work to keep it clean even bullied the men until they fixed the roof or broken stairs placehold was orderly and that made it pretty to whandall he tried to imagine another place of order bigger than placehold it would have to be a long way he thought didnt that take a long time no wed go in a wagon in the morning wed be home that same night or sometimes the lords came to our city theyd come and sit in peacegiven square and listen to us whats a lord mothers mother you always were the curious one brave too she said and petted him again the lords showed us how to come here when my grandfathers lather was young before that our people were wanderers my grandfather old me stories about living in wagons always moving on grandfather whandall asked your mothers father but how could she know whandall demanded he thought that iothefit had been his father but he was never sure not sure the way mothers mother seemed to be mothers mother looked angry for a moment but then her expression softened she knows because i know mothers mother said your grandfather and i were together a long time years and years until he was killed and he was the father of all my children whandall wanted to ask how she knew that but hed seen her angry look and he was afraid there were many things you didnt talk about he asked did he live in a wagon maybe mothers mother said or maybe it was his grandfather ive forgotten most of those stories now i told them to your mother but she didnt listen ill listen mothers mother whandall said she brushed her fingers through his freshly washed hair shed used three days water to wash whandall and shastern and when resalet said something about it she had shouted at him until he ran out of the placehold good she said someone ought to remember what do lords do they show us things give us things tell us what the law is mothers mother said you dont see them much anymore they used to come to tops town i remember when we were both youngthey chose your grandlather to talk to the lords for the placehold i was so proud and the lords brought wizards with them and made rain and put a spell on our roof gardens so everything grew better the dreamy smile came back everything grew better everyone helped each other im so proud of you whandall you didnt run and leave your brotheryou stayed to help she stroked him letting him the way his sisters petted the cat whandall almost purred she dozed off soon after he thought about her stories and wondered how much was true he couldnt remember when anyone helped anyone who wasnt close kin why would it have been different when mothers mother was young and could it be that way again but he was seven and the cat was playing with a ball of string whandall climbed off mothers mothers lap to watch bansh and ilther died shastern lived hut he kept the scars in later years they passed for lighting scars whandall watched them rebuild the city after the burning stores and offices rose again cheap wooden structures on winding streets the kinless never seemed to work hard on rebuilding smashed water courses were rebuilt the places where people died kicked to death or burned or cut down with the long lordkin knives remained empty for a time everybody was hungry until the lords and the kinless could get food flowing in again none of the other children would return to the forest they took to spying on strangers ready to risk broken bones rather than the terrible plants but the forest fascinated whandall he returned again and again mother didnt want him to go but mother wasnt there much mothers mother only told him to be careful old resalet heard her now he laughed every time whandall left the placehold with leathers and mask whandall went alone he always followed the path of the logging and that protected him a little the forest became less dangerous as kreeg miller taught him more all the chaparral was dangerous but the scrub that gathered round the redwoods was actively malevolent kreegs father had told him that it was worse in his day the generations had tamed these plants there were bladecovered morningstars and armory plants and lordkinskiss and lordkiss with longer blades and harmlesslooking vines and flower beds and bushes all called touchme and marked by fivebladed red or redandgreen leaves poison plants came in other forms than touchme any plant might take a whim to cover itself with daggers and poison them too nettles covered their leaves with thousands of needles that would burrow into flesh loggers cut under the morningstar bushes and touchme flower beds with the bladed poles they called severs against lordwhips the only defense was a mask the foresters knew fruit trees the children hadnt found these yellow apples want to be eaten kreeg said seeds and all so in a day or two the seeds are somewhere else making more plants if you dont eat the core at least throw it as far as you can but these red death bushes you stay away fromfar awaybecause if you get close youll eat the berries magic right and theyre poison they want their seeds in your belly when you die for fertilizer one wet morning after a lightning storm loggers saw smoke reaching into the sky is that the city whandall asked no thats part of the forest over by wolverine territory itll go out kreeg assured the boy they always do you find black patches here and there big as a city block the fire wakes yanginatep the boy surmised then yanginatep takes the fire for himself so it goes out but instead of confirming kreeg only smiled indulgently whandall heard snickering the other loggers didnt believe but kreeg dont you believe in yanginatep either not really kreeg said some magic works out here in the woods but in town gods and magic you hear a lot about them but you see damn little a magician killed pothefit kreeg miller shrugged whandall was near tears pothefit had vanished during the burning just ten weeks ago pothefit was his father but you didnt say that outside the family whandall cast about for better arguments you bow to the redwood before you cut it ive seen you isnt that magic yeah well why take chances why do the morningstars and laurel whips and touchme and creepyjulia all protect the redwoods like house guards whandall said remembering that there were always men and boys on guard at placehold maybe like the plants made some kind of bargain kreeg said and laughed mothers mother had told him yanginatep led whandalls ancestors to the lords and the lords had led whandalls ancestors through the forest to the valley of smokes where they defeated the kinless and built teps town redwood seeds and firewands didnt sprout unless fire had passed through surely these woods belonged to the fire god but kreeg miller just couldnt see it they worked half the morning hacking at the base of a vast redwood ignoring the smoke that still rose northeast of them whandall carried water to them from a nearby stream the other loggers were almost used to him now they called him candlestub when the sun was overhead they broke for lunch kreeg miller had taken to sharing lunch with him whandall had managed to gather some cheese from the placehold kitchen kreeg had a smoked rabbit from yesterday whandall asked how many trees does it take to build the city back two loggers overheard and laughed they never burn the whole city kreeg told him nobody could live through that whandall twenty or thirty stores and houses a few blocks solid and dome other places scattered then they break off the placehold men said that theyd burned down the whole city and all of the children believed them a logger said well cut another tree after this one we wouldnt need all four if lord qirinty didnt want a wing on his palace boy do you remember your first burning some i was only two years old whandall cast back in his mind the men were acting funny theyd lash out if any children got too close they yelled a lot and the women yelled back the women tried to keep the men away from us then one afternoon it all got very scary and confusing there was shouting and whooping and heat and smoke and light the women all huddled with us on the second floor there were smellsnot just smoke but stuff that made you gag like an alchemists shop the men came in with things theyd gathered blankets furniture heaps of shells stacks of cups and plates odd things to eat and afterward everyone seemed to calm down whandalls voice trailed off the other woodsmen were looking at him like like an enemy kreeg wouldnt look at him at all chapter the world had moved on and whandall had hardly noticed his brothers and cousins all seemed to have disappeared mostly the girls and women stayed home but on mothers day each month the women went to the corner squares where the lordsmen gave out food and clothing and shells presents from the lords there were always men around that day and the next later they might be around or they might be gone but boys appeared only for meals and sleep and not always then where did they go he followed a cluster of cousins one afternoon as in the forest he took pride in being unseen he got four blocks before four younger men challenged him theyd beaten him half senseless before shastern turned around saw what was happening and came running shastern showed the tattoos on his hands and arms whandall had once asked about those but shastern had put off answering they blended in with the terrible scars shastern carried from the forest but many of his cousins had them too he never asked that kind of question of his cousins now whandall did not quite hear what shastern and his cousins said to them but the strangers turned him loose and his cousins carried him home he woke hurting shastern woke around noon and sought him out shastern was barred from speaking certain secrets but some things he could say serpents walk wasnt just this region of the city serpents walk was the young men who held it these streets belonged to serpents walk other streets other hands the region grew or shrank streets changed hands with the power of the hands they put up signs on walls and other places whandall had been able to read them for years serpents walk had a squiggle sign easy to draw dirty birds was a falcon drawn wild and sloppy shastern showed him a boundary a wall with the serpents walk squiggle at one end and a long thin phallus to mark bull fizzle territory at the other unmarked one did not walk in serpents walk or in bull fizzle or dirty bird either if one did not belong as a child whandall had wandered the streets without hindrance but a tenyearold was no longer a child but there are places with no signs at all whandall protested thats lord territory you can go there until one of the lordsmen tells you not to then you leave why because everyone is scared of the lordsmen why are they so strong well theyre big and theyre mean and they wear that armor they walk in pairs too whandall said remembering right and if you hurt one of them a lot more will come looking for you what if they dont know who did it shastern shrugged expressively then a bunch of them come and beat up on everybody they can find until someone confesses or we kill someone and say he confessed before we killed him you stay away from lordsmen whandall only good they do is when they bring in the presents on mothers day whandall found it strange to have his oneyearyounger brother behaving as his elder he must have spoken to wanshig too wanshig was whandalls eldest brother wanshig had the tattoos a snake in the web of his left thumb a rattlesnake that ran up his right arm from the index finger to the elbow a small snakes eye at the edge of his left eye the next night wanshig took him into the streets in a ruin that stank of old smoke he introduced his younger brother to men who carried knives and never smiled he needs protection wanshig said the men just looked at him finally one asked who speaks for him whandall knew some of these faces shastern was there too and he said i will shastern did not speak to his brothers but he spoke of whandall in glowing terms when the rest fled the forest in terror whandall had stayed to help shastern if hed learned little of the customs of serpents walk it was because he was otherwise occupied when none of the boys would return to the wood but took to the streets instead whandall placehold continued to brave the killer plants to spy on the woodsmen the room was big enough to hold fifty people or more it was dark outside now and the only light in the room came from the moon shining through holes in the roof and from torches the torches were outside snick into holes in the windowsills yanginatep wouldnt allow fires inside except during a burning you could build an outside cookfire under it leanto shelter but never inside and if you tried to enclose a fire with walls the fire went out whandall couldnt remember anyone telling him this he just knew it as he knew that cats had sharp claws and that boys should stay away from men when they were drinking beer there was a big chair on a low platform at one end of the room the chair was wooden with arms and a high back and it was carved with serpents and birds some kinless must have worked hard to make that chair hut whandall didnt think it would be very comfortable not like the big pony hairstuffed chair mothers mother liked a tall man with no smile sat in that chair three other men stood in front of him holding their long lordkin knives across their chests whandall knew him pelzed lived in a twostory stone house at the end of a block of wellkept kinless houses pelzeds house had a fencedin garden and there were always kinless working in it bring him pelzed said his brothers took whandall by the arms and pulled him to just in front of pelzeds chair then forced him down on his knees what good are you pelzed demanded shastern began to speak but pelzed held up a hand i heard you i want to hear him what did you learn from the woodsmen say something wanshig whispered there was fear in his voice whandall thought furiously poisons i know the poisons of the forest needles blades whips pelzed gestured one of the men standing in front of pelzeds chair raised his big knife and struck whandall hard across the left shoulder it stung but he had used the flat of the blade call him lord the man said his bared chest was a maze of scars one ran right up his cheek into his hair whandall found him scary as hell lord whandall said he had never seen a lord yes lord good you can walk in the forest much of it lord places where the woodsmen have been good what do you know of the wedge the meadow at the top of the deerpiss river what did pelzed want to hear woodsmen dont go there lord ive never seen it it is said to be guarded pause then can you bring us poisons yes lord in the right season can we use them against the enemies of serpents walk whandall had no idea who the enemies of serpents walk might be but he was afraid to ask if theyre fresh lord what happens if they arent fresh after a day they only make you itch the nettles stop reaching out for anyone who passes why i dont know the man raised his knife lord youre a sneak and a spy yes lord will you spy for us whandall hesitated of course he will lord shastern said take him out shastern wait with him shastern led him through a door into a room with no other doors and only a small dark window that let in a little moonlight he waited until they were closed in before letting go of whandalls arm this is dangerous isnt it whandall asked shastern nodded so whats going to happen theyll let you in maybe if they dont shastern shook his head they will lord pelzed doesnt want a blood feud with the placehold family blood feuds meant blood is he really a lord he is here shastern said and dont forget it when they brought him back in the room was dark except for a few candles near pelzeds chair shastern whispered i knew theyd let you in now whatever happens dont cry its going to hurt they made him kneel in front of pelzed again two men took turns asking him questions and hitting him we are your father and your mother pelzed said someone hit him who is your father a voice asked from behind you are someone hit him harder serpents walk whandall guessed who is your mother serpents walk who is your lord pelzed argh lord pelzed aagh serpents walk who is lord of serpents walk lord pelzed it went on a long time usually they didnt hit him if he guessed the right answer but sometimes they hit him anyway to make sure you remember they said finally that was over you cant fight pelzed said so you wont be a lull member but well take care of you give him the mark they stretched his left hand out and tattooed a small serpent on the web of his thumb he held his arm rigid against the pain then everyone said nice things about him after that it was easier whandall was safe outside the house as long as he was in territory friendly to serpents walk wanshig warned him not to tarry a knife until he knew how to fight it would be taken as a challenge he didnt know the rules but one could keep silent watch and learn here he remembered a line of black skeletons of buildings the charred remains had come down and been carried away whandall and others watched from cover from the basement of a house that hadnt been replaced yet kinless were at work raising redwood beams into skeletons of new buildings four new stores stood already sharing common walls you knew the kinless by their skin tone or their rounder ears and pointed noses but that was chancy a boy could make mistakes better to judge by clothing or by name kinless were not allowed to wear lordkins hair styles or vivid colors on formal occasions the kinless men wore a noose as token of their servitude they were named for things or for skills and they spoke their family names where a lordkin never would there were unspoken rules for gathering there were times when you could ask a kinless for food or money a man and woman together might accept that others would not kinless men working to replace blackened ruins with new buildings did not look with favor on lordkin men or boys lordkin at their gatherings must be wary of the kinless who kept shops or sold from carts the kinless had no rights but the lords had rights to what the kinless made the kinless did the work they made clothing grew food made and used tools transported it all they made rope for export they harvested rope fibers from the hemp that grew in vacant lots and anywhere near the sluggish streams that served as storm drains and sewers alike they built they saw to it that streets were repaired that water flowed that garbage reached the dumps they took the blame if things went wrong only the kinless paid taxes and taxes were whatever a lordkin wanted unless a lord said otherwise hut you had lo learn what you could take the kinless only had so much to give mothers mother said suddenly it was all so obvious so embarrassing loggers were kinless of course they wouldnt help a lordkin child the loggers thought kreeg miller was strange as the placehold thought whandall was strange each to be found in the others company whandall had been letting a kinless teach him he had carried water for them working like a kinless whandall stopped visiting the forest the serpents walk men spent their time in the streets so did the boys of the placehold but their fathers and uncles spent most of their time at home why whandall went to old resalet one could ask resalet listened and nodded then summoned all the boys and led them outside he pointed to the house the old stone threestory house with its enclosed courtyard he explained that it had been built by kinless for themselves two hundred years ago lordkin had taken it from them it was a roomy dwelling desired by many the kinless no longer built houses to last centuries why should they when a lordkin family would claim it other lordkin had claimed this place repeatedly until it fell to the placehold family it would change hands again unless the men kept guard the boys found the lecture irritating and they let whandall know that afterward mother never had time for him there was always a new baby new men to see and bring home new places to go never time for the older boys men hung out together they chewed hemp and made plans or went off at night but they never wanted boys around them and most of the boys were afraid of the men with reason whandall saw his city without understanding the other boys hardly realized there was anything to understand and didnt care to know more it was safe to ask mothers mother but her answers were strange everything has changed when i was a girl the kinless didnt hate us they were happy to do the work gathering was easy they gave us things why we served yanginatep tep woke often and protected us but didnt the kinless hate the burnings yes but it was different then mothers mother said it was arranged a house or building nobody could use or a bridge ready to fall down wed bring things to burn kinless lordkin everyone would bring something for yanginatep mathoms we called them the lords came too with their wizards now its all different and i dont understand it at all one could keep silence watch and learn barbarians were the odd ones their skins were of many shades their noses of many shapes even their eye color varied they sounded odd lien they could talk at all some belonged in the city wherever they had come from they traded taught doctored cooked or sold to kinless and lordkin alike they were in be treated as kinless who didnt understand the rules their speech could generally be understood they might travel with guards of their own race or give tribute to lordkin to protect their shops a few had the protection of lords you could tell that by the symbols displayed outside their shops and homes most barbarians avoided places where violence had fallen but lookers sought those places out the violence of the burning lured them across the sea to teps town hoys who gave up the forest had taken to spying on lookers instead whandall would do as they did watch the watchers but they were far ahead of him at that game and whandall had some catching up to do watch listen from under a walk from behind a wall lookers took refuge in the parts of the city where kinless lived or in the harbor areas where the lords ruled lordkin children could sometimes get in those places lookers spoke in rapid gibberish that some of the older boys claimed to understand at first they looked merely strange later whandall saw how many kinds of lookers there were you could judge by their skins or their features or their clothing these pale ones were torovan from the east these others were from the south from condigeo these with noses like an eagles beak came from farther yet atlantean refugees each spoke his own tongue and each mangled the lordkin speech in a different fashion and others from places whandall had never heard of serpents walk watched and met afterward in the shells of burned buildings they asked themselves and each other what does this one have that would be worth gathering but whandall sometimes wondered does that one come from a more interesting place than here or more exciting or better ruled or seeking a ruler chapter when he was eleven years old whandall asked wanshig where can i find a lord you know where pelzed lives a real lord dont talk like that wanshig said but he grinned do you remember when those people came to the park and made speeches last fall sure you gathered some money in the crowd and bought meat for dinner that was a lord i forgot his name which one there were a lot of people guards mostly and lookers and storytellers the one that stood on the wagon and talked about the new aqueduct theyre building oh the lords live on the other side of the valley in the lordshills mostly its a long way you cant go there do they have a band sort of they have guards big lordsmen and theres a wall id like to see one up close sometimes lords go to the docks but you dont want to go there alone wanshig said why not its water devils territory the lords say anyone can go there and the devils have to put up with that but they dont like it if they catch you alone with no one to come back and tell what happened they may throw you in the harbor hut water devils dont go into the lordshills do they i dont know never needed to find out i low do you know what you need to find out until you know it whandall wondered but he didnt say anything is there a safe way to the harbor wanshig nodded stay on sanvin street until you get past those hills lie pointed northwest after that there arent any bands until you get to the harbor didnt used to be now who knows the forest had fingers hilltop ridges covered with touchme and lordkmskiss that ran from the sea back into the great trees with their deadly guards there were canyons and gaps through the hills but they were tilled with more poisonous plants that grew back faster than anyone could ail them only the hills above the harbor were cleared lords lived up there when the winds blew hard so that the day was clear whandall could see their big houses the adults called them palaces whandall pointed toward the lordshills does anyone gather there during a burning wanshig squinted where on sanvin street no up there the palaces thats where the lords live you cant gather from lords why not yanginatep wanshig said yanginatep protects them people who go up there to gather just dont come back whandall theyre lords were lordkin you just dont theres no burning up there either yanginatep takes care of them at dawn he snatched half a loaf from the placehold kitchen and ate it as he ran the energy boiling in him was half eagerness half fear when it laded he walked he had a long way to go sanvin street wound over the low hills that separated teps town from the harbor at first there were burnedout shells of houses with some of the lots gone back to thorns and worse the plants gradually closed in on the old road when he reached the top of the hills all was thorns and chaparral and touchme just sparse enough to permit passage it was nearly dark when he reached a crest of a ridge there were lights ahead the distance enough that he didnt want to walk farther he used the dying twilight to find a way into the chaparral he spent the night in chaparral guarded by the malevolent plants he knew how to avoid it was better than trying to find a safe place among people he didnt know the morning sun was bright but there was a thin haze on the ground sanvin street led down the ridge then up across another it look him half an hour to get to the lop of the second ridge when he reached it he could see a highlight sun glare the harbor oil ahead and lo the left he had reached the top he knew of no band who ruled here and that was ominous enough he crouched below the chaparral until he was sure no eyes were about he stood on a barren ridge but the other side of the hill wasdifferent sanvin street led down the hills partway down it divided into two parallel streets with olive trees growing in the grassy center strip and to each side of the divided street there were houses wood as well as stone he was watching from the chaparral when a wagon came up from the harbor he had plenty of time to move but close to the road the chaparral was too sparse to hide him and farther in were the thorns he stood in the sparse brush and watched the wagon come up the hill as it passed him the kinless driver and his companion exchanged glances with whandall and drove on they seemed curious rather than angry as if whandall were no threat at all couldnt they guess that he might bring fathers or older brothers he went back to the road and started down the hill openly now past the houses he guessed this was lords town where mothers mother used to go when she was a girl each set of houses was banded around a small square and in the center of each square was a small stone cairn above a stone water basin like peacegiven square but smaller water trickled down the cairn into the basin and women lordkin and kinless alike came to dip water into stone and clay jars down toward the harbor was a larger square with a larger pool and a grove of olive trees instead of houses there were shops around the square kinless merchants sat in front of shops full of goods openly displayed free for the gathering it seemed in the olive grove people sat in the shade at tables and talked or did mysterious things with small rock markers on the tables shellsand even bits of gold and silverchanged hands were these lords they looked like no one he had ever seen they were better dressed than the kinless of serpents walk better dressed than most lordkin but few had weapons one armed man sat at a table honing a big lordkin knife no one seemed to notice him then a merchant spoke to him whandall didnt hear what was said but the merchant seemed friendly and the armed lordkin grinned whandall watched as a girl brought a tray of cups to a table she looked like a lordkin no one paid him any attention as he walked past they would glance at him and look away even if he stared at them he wasnt dressed like they were and that began to bother him back of the houses he could sometimes see clothes hanging on lines but gathering those might be riskier than remaining as he was and how could he know that he was wearing them right he went on to the bottom of the hills nearer yet to the lords domain soon there was black barren land in the distance to his right with a gleam i water and a stench of magic it had to be magic it was no natural smell breathing through his mouth seemed to help the place drew him like any mystery whandall knew the black pit by repute scant and scrawny alien scrub grew along the edges of black water a quarter of a mile on a side and nobody lived there at all hed heard tales of shadowy monsters here all he saw were pools that gleamed like water darker than any water hed ever seen a palisade fence surrounded the pit more a message than a barrier a graveled wagon road led into it through a gate that whandall was sure he could open the fence was regular flawless too fine even for kinless work kinless working under the eyes of lords might make such a thing such offensive perfection made it a target whandall wondered why lordkin hadnt torn it down and why did lords want people kept away i le saw no monsters but he sensed a malevolent power here the distant harbor drew him more powerfully yet he saw a ship topped by a forest of masts that was escape that was the way to better places if he could learn of a way past the water devils ahead and to the right was a wall taller than any man houses two and three stories tall showed above the wall palaces they were larger than hed dreamed the street went past an open gate where two armed men stood guarding a barrier pole they looked strange their clothing was good but drab and they were dressed nearly alike they wore daggers with polished handles helmets hid their ears spears with dark shafts and gleaming bronze spearheads hung on brackets near where they stood were they armed kinless but they might be lordkin a wagon came up from the harbor and went to the gate the horses seemed different taller and more slender than the ponies he saw in teps town when it reached the gate the guards spoke to the driver then lifted the barrier to let the wagon in whandall couldnt hear what they said to each other if the guards were kinless they wouldnt try to stop a lordkin would they he couldnt tell what they were they acted relaxed one drank from a stone jar and passed it to the other they watched whandall without much curiosity the gate was near a corner of the wall whandall became worried when he saw the guards were looking at him there was a path that led along the wall and around the corner out of sight of the guards and he went along that shuffling us boys do the guards slopped watching him when he turned away from the gate and soon he was out of sight around the corner the wall was too high to climb the path wasnt much used and whandall had to he careful to avoid the weeds and thorns he followed the path until it led between the wall and a big tree when he climbed into the tree he was glad he hadnt tried to get over the wall there were sharp things thorns and broken glass embedded in its top one bough of the tree not only grew over the wall but was low enough that it had scraped the top smooth that must have taken a long time and no one had bothered to fix it mothers mother had told him that kinless believed in a place they called gift of the king a place across the sea where they never had to work and no lordkin could gather from them the other side of the wall looked like that there were gardens and big houses just over the wall was a pool of water a big stone fish stood above the pool water poured from the fishs mouth into the pool and flowed out of the pool into a stream that fed a series of smaller pools green plants grew in those pools there were both vegetable and flower gardens alongside the stream they were arranged in neat little patterns square for the vegetable gardens complex curved shapes along curved paths for the flower beds the house was nearly a hundred yards from the wall two stories tall square and low with thick adobe walls as large as the placehold the gift of the king but this was no myth the lords lived better than whandall could have imagined it was late afternoon and the sun was hot there was no one around whandall had brought a dried crabapple to eat but he didnt have any way to carry water and he was thirsty the fountain and stream invited him he watched while his thirst grew no one came out of the house he wondered what they would do to him if they caught him he was only a thirsty boy he hadnt gathered anything yet the people outside the walls had glanced at him then glanced away as if they didnt want to see him would the people in here do the same he didnt know but his thirst grew greater he crawled along the tree branch until he was past the wall then dropped into the grass he crouched there waiting but nothing happened and he crept to the edge of the fountain the water was sweet and cool and he drank for a long time whats it like outside whandall jumped up startled they dont let me go outside where do you live the girl was smaller than he was shed be eight years old or so where whandall was already eleven she wore a skirt with embroidered borders and her blouse was a shiny cloth that whandall had seen only once when pelzeds wife had dressed up for a party no one in whandalls family owned anything like that or ever would i was thirsty whandall said i can see that where do you live she was only a girl out there he said he pointed east beyond the hills her eyes widened she looked at his clothing at his eyes and ears youre lordkin can i see your tattoos whandall held out his hand to show the serpent on the web of his thumb she came closer wash your hands she said not there thats where we get drinking water down there she pointed at the basin below the fountain pool dont you have fountains where you live no wells whandall bent to wash his hands rivers after it rains your face too she said and your feet youre all dusty it was true but whandall resented being told that she was only a girl smaller than he and there was nothing to be afraid of but she might call someone he would have to run there wasnt any way out of here the branch was too high to reach without a rope the water felt cool on his face and wonderful on his feet you dont need to be afraid of me she said now let me see your tattoo he held out his hand she turned it in both her hands and pulled his fingers apart to bare his serpent tattoo to the sun then she looked closely at his eyes my stepfather says that wild lordkin have tattoos on their faces she said my brothers do whandall said but they carry knives and can fight i havent learned yet i dont know what you mean by wild were not wild she shrugged i dont really know what he means either my name is shanda my stepfather is lord samorty whandall thought for a moment then said my name is whandall what does a stepfather do my fathers dead lord samorty married my mother shed spoken of her father to a stranger without hesitation without embarrassment whandall tasted words on his tongue my father is dead we have many stepfathers but he didnt speak them do you want something to eat whandall nodded come on she led him toward the house dont talk much she said if anyone asks you where you live point west and say over there sir but no one will just dont show that tattoo oh wait she looked at him again you look like someone threw clothes at you in the dark huh miss bally would say that she said leading him south around the house here clothes were hanging on long lines above a vegetable patch the lines were thin woven hemp not tarred here take this and this shanda who wears this stuff the chief gardeners boy hes my friend he wont mind put your stuff in that vat is anyone going to see me who knows who we gathered it from she considered not inside maybe miss batty but she never goes to the kitchen wouldnt eat with the staff if she was starving a band of men carrying shovels came around the house one waved to shanda they began digging around the vegetables the gardeners were kinless but they were better dressed than lordkin they had water bottles and one had a box with bread and meat a lot of meat more than whandall got for lunch except on mothers day and often not then if kinless lived this well how did lordkin live here a lordkin should have guile watch and learn shanda led him into the back of the house chapter the house was cool shanda led him through corridors to a room that smelled of cooking a fat woman with ears like a lordkins stood at a counter stirring a kettle the kettle frothed with boiling liquid whandall stared the smells went straight to his hunger the counter she stood over was a big clay box the top was an iron grill and flames licked up through it under a copper pot a fire indoors that didnt go out squinting he approached the yellowwhite glare and lifted his hands to it hot yes fire shanda gave him the funniest look the fat woman looked at them with an expression that might have been menacing but wasnt miss shanda i got no time just now your daddy is having visitors theres a wizard coming to dinner and we have to get ready a wizard but shanda didnt act surprised or excited she said serana this is whandall and hes hungry the fat woman smiled sure hes hungry hes a boy isnt he a boys nothing but an appetite and trouble she said but she was still smiling sit over there ill get you something in a minute where do you live whandall pointed vaguely west over there maam serana nodded to herself and went back to the stove but then she brought out a bowl and a spoon have some of my pudding she said bet your cook cant make pudding like that whandall tasted the pudding it was smooth and creamy no maam whandall said serana beamed miss shanda this is a nice boy she said now scoot when you get done ive got my work to do alter he finished the pudding he followed shanda down another corridor the house was built around an interior courtyard and they went upstairs to a long outside balcony over the atrium there was a small fountain in the center of the courtyard there were half a dozen doors along the balcony shanda led him to one of them this is my room she looked up at the sun it wont be long until dark can you get home before night i dont think so whandall said where will you stay i can stay out in the chaparral in the thorns she sounded impressed you know how to go into those yes he grinned slightly but i dont know how to get out of here will the guards stop me why should they she asked but if you dont come home tonight wont someone worry about you who your nurse oh well come on in the room was neat there was a closet with a door and there were more clothes hung up in it than any of whandalls sisters had there was a chest against one wall and the bed had a wool blanket on it another blanket with pictures woven into it hung above the bed there was a window that faced out on the balcony and another on the opposite wall that looked out on a smaller interior courtyard crisscrossed with clotheslines and drying clothes more rope than whandall had ever seen in one place he eyed the clothesline with satisfaction it looked strong and there was so much they might not miss one piece it would get him up to the tree branch if he could take it home it would make resalet happy they always needed rope at the placehold but he didnt know the rules here could you really sleep in the thorns she asked how without leathers you cant go far into the chaparral whandall said theres a lot worse than thorn you have to know what plants are safe most arent what are leathers where do you get them you need a leather mask and leggings at least some kinless have them and the foresters use sleeves and vests i dont know where my uncles got them they must have gathered them but you dont have any with you theres nobody in the room next to this you can sleep there tonight they ate in the kitchen at a small table in the corner serana put food in front of them then went hack to her stove other servants came in and serana gave them instructions on what to do everyone seemed to he in a hurry hut there was no shouting and no one was frantic there were more kinds of food than whandall had ever seen for one meal serana arranged trays of food eyed them critically sometimes changed the arrangements when she was satisfied the servants came and took the trays out to another room where the adults ate it was like the gardens here and the neat little fence around the black pit it was orderly serana was making patterns with her cooking whandall couldnt take his eyes off the stove once during dinner a tall woman with serious eyes and dark clothing looked into the kitchen she nodded in satisfaction when she saw shanda did you study your lessons she demanded yes maam shanda said she fixed whandall with a critical eye neighbor boy she asked from down the road shanda said quickly you behave yourself the woman said she turned to the cook did she get a good dinner i always make a good dinner for miss shanda even when ive got guests to cook for serana said huffily dont you worry about that all right good night after she left shanda giggled miss battys not happy she said she wants to eat with the family but they didnt invite her tonight thats as it may be serana said miss bertranas all right not like that other nurse you had you be nice to her miss batty was kinless whandall was certain of it he wasnt quite as certain that serana was lordkin and neither seemed to care much a servant came carrying a tray of dirty dishes some were piled high with uneaten food after dinner they went back to the balcony the adults came out to the atrium to finish their own dinner whandall and shanda lay on the balcony outside her room and listened to them the courtyard was lit by a central fire and by candles in vellum cylinders there were four men and three women in the courtyard lazy wisps of steam curled up from the cups they were holding one of the men said i thought that wizard was coming to dinner he was invited qirinty i dont know what happened to him stood you up did he samorty samorty had a deep and resonant voice and his chuckle was loud maybe id be surprised but maybe when placehold men talked in the evenings there were usually fights these men smiled and if anyone was angry it was well hidden whandall came to believe that he was watching a dance they were dancing with the rhythm of speech and gestures it was a thing he could learn a lordkin should have guile qirintys voice was feeble whandall had to listen hard we need a wizard the reservoirs getting low again if it doesnt rain pretty soon we could be in trouble samorty samorty nodded sagely what do you propose we do its more your problem than mine samorty the other man said he picked up two cups interchanged them tossed them lightly in the air the cups were chasing each other in a loop and now hed added a third cup lord qirinty has such wonderful hands shanda said it enchanted whandall that shanda already knew how to lurk he asked are those lords shanda giggled yes the big man there at the end is lord samorty hes my stepfather is that your mother with him rawandas not my mother stepmother shanda said my mothers dead too she died when rabblie was born rabblie my little brother there with her hes five she doesnt like him any more than she likes me but he gets to eat with them because hes the heir if she ever has a boy hes dead meat but i dont think she can have children she had one my sister and that took a week it was almost two years ago whandall tapped her arm to shut her up because lord samorty was talking wizard can he do it again would you want him to one of the others asked the iceberg damn near wiped out the city the women shouted with laughter the man with the clever hands said it did not chanthor it crossed your farm samorty chuckled well and mine too and left nothing but a plowed line three hundred paces wide and longer than any man has traveled that cost me i admit but it didnt cross much of the city and it sure solved the water problem chanthor snorted qirinty snatched his cup and added it to the dance samorty said a mountain of ice from the farthest end of the earth dont you sometimes wish you could do that that or any real magic but he said he could do it only once lord qirinty said he said that after we paid him did you believe him id say he wants a better price qirinty set the cups down without spilling a drop i dont know if i believed him or not one of the servants came in morth of atlantis he announced morth whandall knew that name he stood tall and straight but morth was older than any of the lords fragile and perhaps blind his face was all wrinkles his hair was long and straight and thick but pure white he tottered very carefully into the circle of firelight my lords he said formally you will have to forgive me it has been twenty years since i was last here i would think lordshills is easy enough to find samorty said even if you had never been here before yes yes of course morth said to find yes to get to perhaps not so easy for one in my profession i came by the back roads the ponies i hired could not climb your hill and as i walked up this change came on me but you must know all this perhaps we know less than you think a dozen years ago a condigeano wizard offered us a spell that would let cook fires burn indoors samorty said cheap too he didnt have to cast it himself sent an apprentice up to do it it worked but since then the only horses that can get up the hill are our big ones the lordkin ponies cant make it we dont know why morth nodded he was amused without making a point of it but surely thisspellhas not lasted a dozen years no he sends an apprentice to renew it hes done that twice since weve discussed having him cast it for other areas but we decided not to oh good morth said very wise may i be seated yes yes of course dinners finished but would you like tea and dessert samortys wife said thank you yes my lady rawanda waved to a servant as morth sat with an effort the fourth lord was older than the rest the others had come out with women but he reclined alone on his couch the servants treated him with as much respect as they treated samorty he had been quiet but now he spoke tell us sage why is it wise not to cast this spell in the other parts of the city why not in teps town side effects qirinty said the lordkin need their ponies yes that and the fires lord jerreff morth said his voice had changed slightly there was less quaver could you cast such a spell if we asked you to morth cut off a laugh no lord no wizard could do that only apprentices cast that spell and ill wager that its never the same apprentice twice either youd win that wager samorty said is this spell dangerous confined to a small area no morth said cast throughout teps town i am certain you would regret it fires lord jerreff said there would be fires inside houses anytime not just during a burning thats what our condigeano wizard told us he wouldnt tell us what the spell was just that it would keep yanginatep at a distance sage i dont suppose you will tell us either morth solemnly shook his head no lord i cannot but you do know what the spell is yes lord i know morth said and frankly i am concerned that a hedge wizard from condigeo would know aboutabout that spell i am also surprised that you would employ powerful magic you do not understand oh we know what it does qirinty said it uses up the power in magic the manna gods cant live where theres no manna i didnt know that lord chanthor said did you know samorty lord samorty shook his head all i bargained for was a way to let the cooks work inside does that mean the fountains arent magic just good plumbing samorty lord qirinty said but there is magic in running wateri suppose thats why our sage looks better now he found some manna in the fountains astute lord but very little i fear he chuckled mirthlessly i do not believe you need pay to renew the spell this year is that why the wizards cant bring rain samorty demanded no manna yes morth said the manna is dying all over the world but especially here in teps town the void you have created here isnt helping where can we find more manna chanthor asked the water comes from the mountains qirinty said look there if we can find the way there are maps chanthor said i recall my father telling me of an expedition to the mountains they brought back manna gold wild manna unpredictable samorty said some of the effects were damned odd yes samorty and anyway they got all they could find chanthor said we wouldnt do better but there was water can we get water from the mountains we cant maybe nobody can we did once yes jerreff and long ago the kinless were warriors chanthor said do you believe that samorty asked oh its true jerreff said my lords we are neglecting our guest samorty said he turned to morth the wizard was quietly sipping tea he looked less ill than when he had come to the table sage if we dont have water therell be a burning sure as anything how can we stop it qirinty asked can you bring more water morth shook his head he spoke solemnly no my lords there is not enough manna to bring rain as for the gold in the mountains you dont want it isnt it magic wild magic ive heard some very funny stories about golds effect on men and magicians but in any case i would not survive the rigors of the hip there are other mountains jerreff said the barbar mountains remain too far to go by land but we could take ship morth smiled thinly i fear i must decline that as well he said the ice can you bring more ice qirinty demanded we will pay well very well wont we samorty we would pay to have the reservoirs filled again yes samorty said you would not find us ungenerous alas as i told you then i could do that only once loan me a charioteer and i could fill your reservoirs but i do not believe you would care for salt water salt water samorty demanded what would we want with reservoirs full of salt water i cant imagine morth said but it is the only kind i control just at the moment his smile was thin and there was a tiny edge to his voice it would be difficult but not impossible to drown the city and even parts of the lordshills but the water would be sea water are you threatening to do that samorty demanded oh no lord i have worked for many years to prevent that morth said mothers mothers humor sometimes matched this old mans they laughed at things nobody else understood but do not be deceived it could happen for example if you were to use in teps town the spell that that idiot condigeano used here you might well find the sea walking across the city may i have some more tea certainly but it is a long way back sage and i perceive you are not comfortable here samorty said with your permission i will arrange transportation for our horses and an escort of guards your generosity is appreciated morth said morth hes too old whandall murmured the girl asked too old for what hes not who i thought too old to be the morth who killed my father and put my uncle to flight but wasnt that also morth of drowned atlantis mothers mother had told another tale the wizard who wouldnt bless a ship yes thats him shanda said samorty clapped his hands for a servant have the cooks prepare a travelers meal for the wizard we will need a team and wagon from the stables and two guardsmen to accompany morth of atlantis to the city at once lord the servant said he will see to your needs sage samorty said it has been our honor my thanks lords morth followed the servant out he leaned heavily on his staff as he walked they watched in silence until he was gone this powerless wizard couldnt be the morth who had killed pothefit was it a common name in atlantis well he wasnt any use chanthor said perhaps i want to think about what he didnt say jerreff said what i learned is that he cant get us any water so what do we do now samorty demanded the usual give out more increase the mothers day presents chanthor said whandalls ears twitched more mothers day presents was good news for the placehold for serpents walk for everyone but lord qirinty said the warehouses are getting empty we need rain theres a ship due with some sea dragon bones chanthor said magic to make rain if morth is as good as he says he is it wont happen jerreff said and you know it do you remember the last time you bought dragon bones ebony box lined with velvet wrapped in silk and nothing but rocks inside well yes but that merchant is crab dung now chanthor said and i keep my hemp gum in that box this time the promise comes from a more reputable ship captain hell have a good excuse for not having any dragon bones in stock jerreff said chanthor morth wasnt revealing secrets he was speaking common magicians gossip magic fades everywhere but here why would anyone send objects of power here what can we pay compared to the incas or torov even condigeo could pay more than we can all true qirinty said which brings us to the question why does morth of atlantis stay here we all saw him move a mountain of ice forget morth he has no power samorty said it is a puzzle worth contemplation even so jerreff said here he is weak he would be more powerful in a land better blessed with magic an atlantis wizard could command respect anywhere theyre rare all right lady rawanda said and there wont be any more a ripple of response ran around the table horror brushed its hand along whandalls hair tellers even in teps town spoke of the sinking of atlantis chanthor said ship captains are still telling stories about the waves wiped out whole cities do you suppose thats what morth is talking about salt water can he raise big waves that might be useful if anyone attacked us from the sea whod attack us qirinty asked weve been raided a few times chanthor said the last one was interesting wasnt it samorty lord samorty nodded nine dead though nine dead we sold six more to condigeo and we got a ship out of it chanthor said oh what happened rawanda asked ships captain ran out of luck chanthor said lost his cargo talked the crew into raiding in our harbor for their pay water devils saw them coming happened to be my watch i took waterman and his ready squad down all over in an hour as samorty said nine dead four of them water devils no lordsmen hurt and we made a pretty good profit selling the survivors even after we paid off the water devils what about the captain jerreff asked he owes us samorty said i let him recruit crew from unemployed kinless seems to be working well the kinless bring money back for their relatives to spend here and we have a merchant shipnot that ive thought of any use for it it cant bring us rain were due for rain though chanthor said if yanginatep doesnt chase it away qirintys wife said theres no predicting that qirinty said but you know i think hes less powerful when it rains fire god after all why not yanginatep the lords knew of yanginatep and they had fires indoors yanginatep never permitted fires indoors and theyd hosted morth of atlantis who had killed pothefit but he seemed too trail to defend himself at all they talked so fast and it was all hard to remember but that was part of a lordkins training whandall listened we need a small burning jerreff said if we stop the burnings altogether the lookers wont come here anymore and well all die of boredom a little burning just enough to get it out of their system youre a cynic jerreff samorty said no just practical if we dont get some rain soon therell be more kinless wanting to move out of the city and into our town chanthor said sourly cant blame them but we have no place to put them qirinty said no jobs either ive got more servants and gardeners than i need and without water there wont be enough crops to feed the people we have samorty tell me the last time you didnt see a real problem coming rawanda said qirinty shrugged and produced a dagger from thin air someone has to worry about the future and you do it well just as jerreff worries about the past im grateful to you both samorty stood now im afraid youll have to excuse me im on watch tonight he raised his voice antonio bring my armor please yes lord someone called from the house a moment later two men came out struggling under a load they dressed samorty in a bronze backandbreastplate they hung a sword longer than two lordkin knives on a strap over one shoulder and handed him a helmet is the watch ready samorty asked yes lord theyre waiting at the gate armor all polished yes lord fine to his guests he said enjoy yourselves if theres anything you need just ask rawanda ill be late tonight i have a double watch oh im sorry to hear that the lady said shes not sorry shanda whispered she doesnt even like him do you whandall asked samortys not so bad shanda said he was very nice to my mother after my father was killed in the burning there was so much to learn the lords who controlled mothers day knew supplies were running out they needed water whandall had never thought about water before there were the wells and sometimes rivers and the fountain at peacegiven square and sometimes those were nearly dry water was important but whandall didnt know anyone who could control water but this wizard had brought water once and he was welcome here now because he was a wizard or because he brought water and how did you become a lord in the first place was your father a lord shanda yes lord horthomew he was a politician and an officer of the watch like samorty how was he killed i dont know she said chapter when it was light he waited outside shandas door it seemed like a long time until she came out but the sun was still very low in the east he fidgeted and finally said i have to piss and i dont know where and she giggled i told you the room is at the far end of the hall under the stairs didnt i tell you he didnt remember certainly he hadnt understood he thanked her and ran toward the stairs lock the door when youre inside she whispercalled the room below the stairs had windows too high up to look out and a door with a latch inside a stream washed into a basin at his chest level then spilled over into a trough on the floor it was all clean and nothing smelled when he came out there was a man waiting outside the door he had the round ears of a kinless and he looked like the man who had brought samortys armor he didnt say anything to whandall as he went inside they ate in the kitchen serana fussed over them and didnt seem surprised to find whandall was still there were going to play in the big park shanda told serana will you tell miss batty for me serana made disapproving sounds ill tell miss bertrana you called her that she didnt sound like she meant it youll need a lunch ill fix up something you be back by suppertime they went to the courtyard where the clothes were drying and whandall selected a length of rope he went to the tree branch and threw the rope over it and tied knots in the rope with the rope there he felt safer because he thought that once he was over the wall no one could catch him in the chaparral not without magic the lords did magic everyone said so lord qirinty made cups dance and pulled a dagger from thin air but it was lord qirinty who had wished they could do real magic but the stove was magic it all made whandalls head hurt learning things was not the same as understanding them he started to climb the rope when he got on the branch he saw shanda was climbing up she wasnt good at climbing help me up she said he reached down and took her hand and pulled her up to the branch then he looked around one of the men with shovels had seen them climb up but he only went back to work can i get back in this way she asked youre not going out yes i am shanda the chaparral is dangerous youll get hurt and your stepfather will kill me i wont get hurt if you show me what to do no he crawled along the tree limb until he was over the wall she came right behind him no he said again but he knew it was no use go back and pull the rope to the outside of the wall just near the wall the plants seemed weak and almost lifeless but farther away they grew thicker in a mile theyd be luxurious two miles farther were the first of the redwoods those are wonderful he told her wait till you see them close but she wasnt avoiding the plants he stopped her he showed her lordskiss and nettles and thorn bushes and three kinds of touchme three leaves he said three leaves and white berries and it doesnt just sit there watch he saw a stick on the ground and examined it carefully before he picked it up then he rubbed his hands on one end and held it by the other end moving it closer and closer to a large vine at a hands distance the vine moved just enough to brush the stick whandall showed her an oily smear on the stick you wouldnt want to touch that would it kill you no it just makes you swell up in bumps the vine can kill you things it touches only hurt you she still wanted to move too fast he showed her some of the scars the plants had left on him when he was with the foresters he made her follow just in his footsteps and whenever she wanted to look at something he slopped there wasnt the ghost of a chance they would reach the redwoods today at noon they stopped and ate lunch then started hack whandall took his time pointing out plants even if shed seen them before he d forgotten often enough and kreeg had had to remind him she held a branch at the broken end glossy redandgreen leaves grew at the tip what would happen if i rub that stick on my stepmothers chair not the stick the leaves shanda really she nodded grinning well she wont die shell itch and scratch its magic shanda asked if its magic it wont work at all inside the walls thats what my stepfather says that would explain the cook fires whandall thought but not qirintys dancing cups im going to try it she said he stood under the rope as she climbed it in case she fell she waved from the top and was gone it had been a glorious day he was out of the chaparral before the light of sunset died but the night was turning misty when whandall reached the hilltops he could see fog curling in from where the harbor had been he watched it for a time humped above the land then he heard shouts had someone seen him water devils perhaps someone worse he couldnt see anyone but he ran into the fog running as hard as he could until he was exhausted fog was all around him as he caught the stench of the black pit the pit itself was not to be seen what he saw was dark shadows racing toward him he ran back the way he had come but he was too tired to run far when his breath ran out he trailed to a stop he hadnt heard a sound hed seen what had he seen dogs or wolves but huge but nothing chased him now he had to get past the pit to get home and someone had chased him up the hill a band was more dangerous than shadows the shadows came again as he crested the hill this time he watched bent to pick up a sharpedged rock in each fist and watched again he wished with all his heart that he already had his lordkin knife he had outrun them before and he could again but they were only shadows wolfshaped shadows and something much larger racing silently toward him they were less real as they came near whandall yelled and swung his rocks to smash skulls and then he was among them in them and breath less with wonder they were pockets in the fog half a dozen wolf shapes all merged now into one thrashing bubble of clear air the larger shape was a cat as big as placeholds communal bedroom armed with a pair of lungs very like lordkin knives then that too was part of the bubble thrashing as it fought the wolves and whandall could watch the shadow shapes of huge birds wheeling above the misty slaughter theyll never believe me but what a day chapter he had carried his own clothes in a bundle now he put them on over his new ones so that he could get back to placehold safely it took all day after noon he ate the roll that serana had given him the waning moon was high when he got back home hungry he checked out the tables and cookpot for leftovers that got him nothing but sticky feet he crept into the sleeping room and fell asleep at once in the morning his toes remembered the clean blond wood that floored lord samortys kitchen as they squished across placeholds sticky flagstones in the roar of placeholds shouts and laughter and curses he remembered the busy quiet around serana he tore a piece of bread off what wanshig had gathered wanshig jumped then laughed where did you gather the new clothes his sisters and cousins all looked at him pretty rotunda said are there more a lordkin should have guile even with his own kin whandall wanted to think about what he had seen before he talked about it there was no way to explain that gathering was not a way of life to the lords and those who worked with them so clothesline at a house off of sanvin street whandall said kinless house nobody looking but there wasnt anything else worth gathering too bad wanshig said ready for knife lessons sure they practiced with sticks whandall was still clumsy hed have been killed a doen times it theyd used real knives next year the uncles whod been watching the lessons were sure about it next year the lordsmen fought with spears and swords not with the big lordkin knives whandall thought about the lordshills where even the gardeners lived us well as pelzed and resalet did the lordsmen would live even better than gardeners fighters always did his uncles would never be able to teach him to light the way lordsmen did but someone might he knew he had to go back i le washed his new clothes but he could think of no place to dry them where they would not be stolen he carried them as a damp bundle when he took to the roads four days later they smelled of damp his path ran through flower market he kept to shadow when he could and the windowless sides of buildings and was still surprised to get through untouched beyond flower market nobody lived or so hed been told he saw occasional dwellings but was able to avoid them when he reached the ridge it was nearly dark he thought of staying in the chaparral then laughed he knew a better place the black pit was stench and mist and darkness and a misty blur of a full moon overhead the moon lit shadows that came bounding to greet him wolves as big as whandall himself all in a leaping pack birds big enough lo pluck him from the ground two cats bigger than whandalls imagination hubbies in the fog they merged in a frantic seething bubble and whandall laughed and tried to play with them but he touched nothing but fog rumor spoke that the black pit had swallowed people he shied from going too deep into it he didnt want any more of that alien stench either i le spread some marsh grass over a flat rock and lay down on that with two layers of clothes around him he wasnt even particularly cold half asleep he watched another shadow edging toward him several feet above the black swamp it was rounded and almost featureless and the ghosts already around him made shadows to interfere with what approached it was even bigger than the cats sleepily he watched it come and tried to guess its shape then fell asleep still wondering the gardeners boys clothes were still damp when he put them on at dawn his own serpents walk garments were underneath he wasnt cold just sodden he walked his clothes dry before he reached the broad wagon path that must be sanvin street when he got to the barren lands a wagon came up behind him the kinless driver looked at whandall and stopped need a ride yes thank you he hesitated only a moment sir climb on im going to the harbor where are you headed to see friends at lord samortys house inside eh well ill let you off at the fork hup gettap the two ponies drew the cart at a pace faster than whandall would walk the kinless driver whistled some nameless tune he was a young man not much over twenty the cart was filled with baskets with the lids tied on them what is that whandall asked the driver eyed whandall carefully who did you say your friend was shanda samortys daughter stepdaughter whandall said sir right your father work for samorty yes sir explains the shirt the driver said whandall widened his eyes and looked up at him the driver grinned if you was to look in one of those baskets youd see cloth just like what youre wearing my cousin hallati has a loom in his basement weaves that cloth he and his wives and daughters we sold a stack of it to samorty last month halite whandall had never heard the name but he would remember it how many other kinless were hiding valuables hope we can move halite out soon i dont like this drought much gets dry and those lordkin jackals get ugly almost got my cousins place last time almost the cart driver said and pulled the animals to a stop this was the road to the lordshills whandall got out and waved a goodbye there were different guards when he got to the gate they didnt pay much attention to whandall as he came up the road dont remember you one of the guards said where do you live boy lord samortys house oh gardening crew yes sir the guard nodded they didnt bother to raise the barrier but it was easy to walk around it and the guards were already talking about the weather by the time whandall was inside there were big houses and wide streets palm trees grew at regular intervals in patterns the houses were grand something more something weird thirty houses shouldnt be quite so similar though no two were identical but neither should they remind a boy of a stand of redwoods or a range of hills like a redwood like a granite hill each house looked like it had been in place forever like whandall stepped back and looked around him because he could feel how the shock changed his face anyone who saw him would know he was a stranger staring as if hed never seen a long street lined on both sides with houses none of which had ever been burned and replaced the flower bedsthey were shaped and arranged to fit around the houses not one structure showed any sign of haste of get a roof on that before the rain starts or use the beams from the tanner housethey dont quite but the tanners wont need them anymore or just do something to shelter usdont bother me cant you see im grieving it made him uneasy he didnt know what lord samortys house would look like from the i rout but it had to be near the wall he worked his way eastward until he was sure there was only the one layer of houses between him and the wall then north until he could see the big tree after that it was no problem finding his way around the back of the house to the fountain he washed his hands and face and feet without waiting to be told to didnt really think you would come back shanda said i said i would a lordkins promise there was not much warmth in her smile but then it brightened you promised to show me the redwoods he thought about that i have leathers for both of us she showed him a box hidden under the bed in her room i got them from the gardeners they dont use them anymore whandall examined the gear its good isnt it shanda demanded its good enough he admitted but wed be out all night thats all right miss batty will think im visiting shanda said ill tell her im staying with lord flascattis daughter miss batty will never check but and my stepmother wouldnt care if i never came back well take lunch and dinner and whandall looked up at the sun low in the west its way too late not today silly in the morning or next day you dont have to get back today do you he shook his head if he never came back his mother would worry about him a little but she wouldnt do anything and no one else would care much not unless they thought hed been killed by kinless did you try that stick shanda grinned that same night on rawandas chair yes it gave her a little red rash and it itched her for two days i think it still does her face tell a bit samorty must have got some on his arm because he got a rash too i guess he knew what made it because he yelled at the gardeners about it and the gardeners yelled back and they all went out to look for a poison plant but they didnt find any i didnt want to hurt samorty good whandall thought and better that she hadnt been caught and no one knew where she had been or who she had been with a little red rash whandall had given leaves of that same plant to lord pelzed and theyd used them on bull fizzle boys no one died but a dozen of them were useless for a week and pelzed and the bull fizzle lord had made a treaty not to do that again pelzed had been pleased but here it was just a little red rash plants lost power here lets get something to eat shanda was saying serana doesnt think i eat enough shell be glad to see you the kitchen was warm and dry and smelled of foods whandall could only guess at serana filled his bowl with soup and heaped bread on the table then apologized for not having anything for him will you be staying for dinner if thats all right whandall said maam this sure is good serana smiled happily they watched the gardeners but they avoided everyone else shanda showed him the carp pools with bright colored fish a pair of servants got too curious and whandall was frantically trying to find answers when shanda laughed and ran away with whandall following she led him to another part of the yard there was a small queer house too small for shanda and way too small for whandall there were rooms no bigger than a big man and tiny passages they could crawl through and open walls the curious servants had followed whandall had to wriggle like an earthworm but he followed shanda deeper into the maze into twists and shadows until no eyes could reach them he felt a moment of panic then if this place should burn theyd be trapped wriggling through flaming twists but the gardeners were all kinless werent they and he wouldnt show the little girl his fear he followed shanda deeper yet there was a small room at the center just big enough for both of them to sit up why is it so small whandall asked its a playhouse it was built for my little brother but he doesnt like it much so i get to play in it a playhouse whandall could understand the notion but he would never have thought of it an entire extra house just for fun after dinner they lay on the balcony above the courtyard und listened to the lords talk four men and three women lolled on couches that would have looked really nice in the placehold courtyard no one said anything until an elderly kinless brought out a tray of steaming cups lady rawanda passed them to the others qirintys wife sipped then smiled really rawanda you must tell u where you get such excellent tea root thank you cliella it is good isnt it rawanda said there was another silence quiet lately jerreff said i dont like it then you should be pleased samorty said we caught a sneaker last night any problems jerreff asked no there was a jollmic ship in port we got a nice burning glass for him quintana isnt it your watch tonight i traded traded with who well actually he paid peacevoice waterman extra qirinty said he produced a grapefruit from thin air and inspected it samorty shook his head sadly bad practice he said quintana laughed he was round and pudgy and looked very contented on his couch what can it hurt samorty you may like parading around all night in armor but i dont if theres need ill turn out if theres need the watchmen will be taking orders from waterman not you samorty said not to mention that waterman will get any loot they find jerreff said dryly you worry too much samorty rawanda said you think the city will fall if you dont hold it up samorty laughed thinly it fell once to us but peace it wont fall tonight more wine he poured from a pitcher on the table shanda stirred and whispered thats you theyre talking about sneaker no the lordkin whandall nodded his family street city in the hands of these dithering bickering lords was he too young to be sold onto some foreign ship for an instant the idea was indecently attractive yanginateps still asleep quintana said watchmen told me there were three fires over in the benighted areas i didnt hear about any fires have trouble just brush fires the kinless must have put them out i his time samorty muttered what i worry about is when the lordkin wont let the kinless put out the fires yanginatep protects houses quintana said but not brush suppose all the chaparral burned at once jerreff asked would that wake yanginatep half the city could burn if yanginatep wakes while the hills are burning now that would be something to worry about rowena said sure would youre too young to remember the last time samorty said i was only ten or so myself we dont know what wakes the god qirintys wife said sure we do hot weather no rain that hot dry wind from the east qirinty said sometimes samorty sounded doubtful i grant you thats usually what things are like when the burning starts but not always get us some rain and things will be all right qirinty toyed nervously with a salt shaker then caused it to whirl about sure rowena said if we cant get rain maybe we ought to do something else qirinty said carefully he put the salt shaker down what finish the aqueduct get more water into the benighted areas be real samorty said thats no easier than getting rain they have a new aqueduct in south cape quintana said one of the ship captains told me sure and they have wizards in south cape qirinty said and dragon bones for manna we dont but we could still build the aqueduct theres no money samorty said raise taxes we just raised taxes jerreff said you cant squeeze the kinless much more borrow the money we have to do something if theres another burning it will cost even more to rebuild and well still have to finish the aqueduct at the word still qirinty made a dagger vanish from his vantage above whandall saw how he did it he might have learned it from a pickpocket doesnt nico owe us sure he does and maybe he can talk his masons into working with him as a favor but it would still take two hundred laborers to finish that job theyd all have to be fed i suppose qirinty said sadly maybe we can talk the lordkin into finishing the aqueduct rowena laughed sourly alter all theyre the ones who need it yeah sure quintana said he poured himself another glass of wine but qirintys right we should do something lord quintanas wife was slim and long with sculpted hair shed arranged herself on the couch so that everyone would see her legs and painted toenails and she seldom spoke i dont see why everyone worries so much about the lordkin she said we dont need them what do we care what they do quintana ignored her no i mean really she said there was a hard edge to her voice they need the aqueduct but they wont work on it the very idea that they might makes us laugh and when yanginatep wakes and they burn the city samorty said gently he liked lady siresee kill them not easy qirinty laughed there are a lot of them and after all they won last time squeeze the kinless much harder and youll get another war jerreff said some of them are getting desperate yes samorty said but theyd really be in bad shape after a burning there are stories jerreff said whole city burned down even our town where did you hear that samorty asked at the memory guild yanginatep used to be more powerful jerreff said he could seize everyone lordkin and lords too burnings were really bad in those days didnt your father tell you that samorty yanginatep has no power in here samorty waved at the sculpted gardens and tooperfect houses and damned little in town sure and you know why qirinty said we can fence him out but we cant control him gods have gone mythical jerreff said dont be a fool samorty said you heard what morth said and suppose we could send yanginatep into mythwhat happens then no more burnings jerreff said at what cost i dont know qirinty said neither do i and thats the point samorty said right now weve got things under control sort of jerreff said enough samorty clapped his hands the kinless servants brought in new trays of mugs we have a performance tonight oh what qirintys wife asked jispomnos no no thats long quintana said not all of itscenes from part one rawanda said nobody does the whole thing even so quintana said ill be back he went off toward the small room under the stairs chapter performance was a way of telling a story several people acted out lives that werent theirs on a platform with moveable furniture a man with a booming voice spoke as storyteller whandall had never seen anything like it the performance was long and whandall didnt understand a lot of the words jispomnos had beaten his woman had tracked her down after she lied from him had killed her and the man he found with her whandall understood that well enough whandalls uncle napthefit had killed aunt ralloop when he found her with a water devil hed tried to kill the man too but the water devil had run to his kin but jispomnoss woman was kinless the killing wasnt shown guards took jispomnos away he walked away when they turned their backs the guards chased jispomnos around and around the stage in excruciating slow motion and all sang in a harmony that whandall found beautiful but they sang so slowlyin time to somnolent music that ran on forever shanda pulled his ear to wake him you were snoring whats going on now trial he watched for a time i dont understand anything at all whats the trial about she looked at him with wide eyes there was a murder she rebuked him its about whether he did it or not jispomnos is a lordkin isnt he or was the actor a lordkin playing jispomnos but shanda only looked at him strangely whandall swallowed what he was about to say shanda wasnt lordkin instead he pointed and said the kinless woman and the two men who are they theyre doing all the talking the men they speak for jispomnos clarata speaks for the court jispomnos wont speak for himself cowardice or pride why two men i dont know ill be back she whispered whandall nodded it had been a long performance he watched it was difficult to untangle the kinless woman clarata told of the killing questioned any who had been nearby showed bloody clothing of the men who spoke for jispomnos the little kinless man demanded that clarata produce jispomnoss knife whandall nodded no lordkin would throw away his knife he argued that the clothing wasnt his didnt fit jispomnos was elsewhere during the killingin the eastern arc in the woods in a dockside winery with water devils to vouch for him and on a boat bound for condigeo until the audience roared with laughter covering whandalls own giggles but the lordkin advocate spoke of jispomnoss prowess as a fighter his standing in the bands shanda came back what did i miss i think i get it well theyre not talking to the same people the little kinless hes funny but two of the judges are kinless so hes talking to them he tells them jispomnos didnt do it but jispomnos took a kinless as his woman he lives like a kinless what the lordkin judges want to know is did jispomnos make himself kinless the lordkin advocate hes telling them that jispomnos is still a lordkin he had the right to track his woman down and kill her the right her eyes bugged why he had no way to tell her that it just was so he lied i dont understand that either shanda whispered i dont think anyone does its based on something that really happened in maze walkers a condigeo teller wrote this opera the grownups like it the trial was still going on when part one ended and everyone applauded the lords and ladies drifted apart samorty and qirinty walked under the balcony samorty was saying and thats the best part greatest argument for getting rid of that arts committee i ever saw let me run the arts committee or you or chondor at least well have shows that satisfy someone qirinty stopped in his tracks thats what we need a show not for us for the lordkin not jispomnos samorty said youd start the next burning no no i mean give them a parade qirinty said get their attention and tell them about the aqueduct tell them well have it done before he rains he went back to his couch looked up at the night sky its the season why doesnt it rain not a bad idea jerreff said while all the lordkin are off at the parade samorty here can meet with the kinless association council explain what were really doing with their taxes find out if theyre ready to join the guard siresee said quintana said lordkin hear youre meeting with kinless and not them therell be trouble jerreff waved it off well meet with some lordkin too who qirinty asked who cares get the word out were meeting their leaders somebody will show up now thats disrespectful samorty said and the lordkin want respect no they dont they demand it siresees words were meant to cut well they say they want it and they certainly demand it samorty said placidly i agree jerreff it doesnt matter a lot which lordkin we talk to they dont keep their own promises and none of them can make promises for yanginatep but we have to talk to them why siresee asked time you children went to bed behind him whandall jumped but it was only serana the cook before miss bertrana catches you up so late she said morning was cloudy and just after breakfast miss bertrana came into the kitchen and took shanda by the hand your father wants you she said in your pink dress there are visitors shanda looked pained she turned to whandall im sorry thats all right whandall said id better go home yes but have some of my corn cake serana said i like to see a boy with a good appetite where did you say you lived miss bertrana asked whandall pointed vaguely to the west over near the wall maam well miss shanda will be busy all day tomorrow too yes maam too bad shanda are they showing me off the little girl asked i wouldnt put it that way but its lord wyonas family miss bertrana said the name reverently come on youll have to change shanda hesitated a moment youll come back serana was at the stove rattling pans it takes two days each way whandall whispered please ill be back he said really i just dont know when next time well get to the forest shanda lowered her voice ill leave some things for you in my room in the chest you can have all the boys clothes there the chest was nearly full and whandall couldnt tell the boys clothes from the girls most of the things were too small anyway shoes fancy not sturdy they wouldnt last a week in serpents walk there was far more stuff here than he could carry and even if he could carry it what then hed look like a gatherer if the lordsmen didnt catch him his own people would there were boys in the yard playing a complicated game hide and run track and pounce imitation lordkin pitiful whandall watched them while he thought hed need an outfit a way to blend in here when he returned but anything that would blend in here would stand out in serpents walk a lordkin had to be crafty it came to him that he could wear his own clothes underneath then two more layers of lords clothing topped by the loose jacket and still not look too odd those boys were all bulkier than he was they ate better and more often when he was dressed he felt bulky he left shandas room carefully with a twinge of regret for all the stuff he was leaving behind too much to gather he left by going over the wall guards might notice how much he was wearing no one paid any attention to him while he was in the area near the lordshills there were people and carts on the road no one offered him a ride but no one stopped him either at the top of the ridge he stopped and looked back at the lordshills and their wall then went on he knew where he could sleep safely the pit was beginning to seem a friendly place the moon was still near full the light picked up the shadows of predators coming to greet him while he made himself comfortable through the ghosts restless pockets in the fog he watched some larger shadow he couldnt see it move but every time he dozed and woke it was nearer yet then he saw something swing above ita limband he knew its shape it was twice the size of one of the giant cats with a rounded body and it was upside down it was hanging from an imaginary cylinder perhaps the branch of a tree eons dead by its four inwardcurving hands its head hung possibly watching whandall himself one of the tremendous cats maidenly discovered it turned and sprang and then the horde of beasts was tearing it into wisps the creature fought back and birds and giant wolves too became drifting shreds of fog in the morning he put on everything he had with his old clothes on top of it all he looked bulky and he couldnt run but he might get through chapter he had reached bull fizzle territory when he heard shouts sanvin street was supposed to be safe outside the jurisdiction of any band but five older boys were coming toward him whandall began to run they chased him down and tackled him hoo one of them shouted look what all hes got where another demanded whered you gather stuff like this when whandall didnt answer he hit him on the head with his fist where lordshills whandall said yeah sure now where they hit him some more and sat on his head leave me alone whandall shouted he wanted to scream for help but it wouldnt do any good theyd just call him a coward and crybaby but he could shout defiance serpents he heard the cry from down the street serpents walk a dozen older boys led by his brother wanshig were coming bull fizzle his tormentor shouted then the others were there whandall felt the weight lift from his head there were the sounds of blows you all right wanshig asked come on lets get out of here when they were back at placehold wanshig thanked the others somebodyd better tell lord pelzed wanshig said we may have trouble with bull fizzle i never left sanvin street whandall protested wanshig shrugged so what happened get anything good just some clothes and look they tore them and they gathered my jacket and shoes whandall felt hitter disappointment nothing had gone right this time this stuff is too small for them anyway nice though wanshig fingered the shirt whandall was inspecting nice you just need a way to get stuff back to placehold take one of us next time even his own family lusted for what the lords threw away it wouldnt work whandall said it was sort of an accident that i got in and made friends inside theyd never believe him if he said that shanda had given him all those things or theyd want to know why nobody notices me but the lordsmen wouldnt let a bunch of us in how many lordsmen lots whandall said two at the gate but there are others just inside yeah we heard that wanshig said and they have magic too did you see any magic maybe a little ten twenty years ago before i was born three bands got together and went to the lordshills to gather none of them ever came back wanshig said none maybe magic whandall thought and maybe it was only guards with armor and spears fighting together with the lords to tell them what to do and a ship to carry the losers away but he could never explain that to wanshig he said wan theres going to be a big show the lords will have a show in the park and give away some presents maybe do some magic when five days i think whandall said he counted on his fingers five days counting today wanshig smiled good dont tell anyone anyone well keep this for the family what will you do ill have every placeholder who can pick a pocket ready for them well have first pick of the crowd wanshig nibbled his lip considering we cant keep bull fizzle out of the park can we make them go somewhere else something to get them to the other side of town whandall watched his brother think wanshig grinned did they go through your pockets you got there first wanshigs grin got bigger so they dont know you werent carrying gold whandall iscunie has been seeing a bull fizzle boy she can tell him you gathered some gold in the harbor town and ten of us are going back for more well be coming back the morning of the parade on the south side thatll get every bull fizzle down there and well have the park to ourselves there were drums and mules and live wagons thirty lordsmen in shiny bronze armor marched with spears and shields and when they got to the park they did a complicated thing of marching in a circle then more lordsmen came and filled in between them so that the circle was protected and the wagons came in a family of kinless strung a rope between two thick trees as high as a man could reach and so taut that it hung almost straight a kinless boy younger than whandall walked from one tree to the other along the rope turned and walked back perfectly balanced while kinless and a few lordkin whistled and applauded whandall realized that these must be the ropewalker family who sold rope near the black pit the lordsmen were still at work a portable stage unfolded out of one of the wagons another wagon was covered by a tent when the stage was up a man came out costumed in feathers like an eagle the kinless gathered around the wagons more lordsmen walked through the crowds flutes played and drums and someone passed out little cookies to the children there was a little round platform that turned with wooden dragons on it for children to ride at first it was turned by kinless running around it when the lordkin pushed all the kinless children off and took their places the kinless drifted away into the crowd a couple of lordkin fathers tried to get older boys to push it but nobody would so after a while it sat there unused while people watched the show most lordkin kept to themselves in one corner of the park but placehold pickpockets moved among kinless and lordkin alike one was caught the kinless man shouted curses at him but when lordkin men moved toward him he let him go with more curses a troupe of acrobats came out onto the stage they flew for short distances with the aid of a seesaw another climbed a long pole and hung by his teeth a man and a woman both lordkin ate fire and a burly kinless man swallowed a long thin sword the ropewalkers danced on their tightrope this time the boy and a younger girl who did a backward somersault while an older man stood under her as if to catch her if she fell she was very steady and he wasnt needed whandall moved closer to where they were passing out cookies one of the girls shanda he said she looked startled oh i didnt recognize you whandall saw her look nervously up at her stepfather on the platform where he was about to make a speech whandall took a cookie are they still looking for lordkin to talk to i think so hut they havent she said lord samorty began his speech about the new aqueduct and how it would bring fresh water from the mountains the kinless cheered in places will you take me to the redwoods shanda asked not for a while well be doing this show in other parts of town ill try before the rain if i can rain makes everything grow and its harder something bright appeared on the stage then vanished an evil wizard is keeping the rain for himself samorty was saying well beat him therell be rain kinless and lordkin alike cheered but now theres a water shortage and its very hard on the horses and oxen samorty was saying delivery is difficult so next mothers day will be special therell be nine weeks rations and some other extras the lordkin cheered and that will have to last for two mothers days samorty was saying and youll all have to come to peacegiven square to get it because we wont be able to bring everything to the usual distribution places crowd noises were drowning out samorty he waved and three magicians came on the stage they made things appear and disappear one called shanda up on the stage and put her in a box and when it was opened she was gone whandall looked for her but he couldnt see her wanshig came up behind him lord pelzed isnt happy he said but there was a laugh in his voice hes got all of serpents walk out picking pockets now but we got the best good work the magicians made a vine grow i know how to make pelzed happy whandall said how he can meet the lords you dont know any lords i know who they are whandall said that was lord samorty who made the speech everybody knows that and the man over there talking to the magicians is lord qirinty hes a magician himself or at least a pickpocket and the fat one in armor with the lordsmen thats lord quintana the pretty lady serving soup is his wife so you know who they are whandall hadnt heard pelzed come up behind them what else do you know pelzed demanded wanshig you didnt share well have to talk about that wanshig looked worried lord pelzed i heard the lords wanted a lordkin leader to talk to whandall said pelzed looked crafty say more they want the most powerful leader in this part of the city whandall said but i dont know what they want from him thats me pelzed said go tell them whandall hadnt thought this out far enough uh do this for me and well forget what happened this morning pelzed said he pointed up on the stage see that guy foreigner wanshig said ive seen him before hes a teller pelzed said if i meet the lords hell tell everyone else whandall how sure are you about their wanting to talk to us whandall thought about it they hadnt wanted to talk to the lordkin but they thought theyd have to only whandall didnt dare tell pelzed that i heard them plan it out over dinner whandall said whandalls a great sneak wanshig said i remember pelzed said well go tell them im here no you come with me lord pelzed whandall said shig you come too he led them back behind the tent as hed hoped shanda was there whandall bowed as hed seen kinless do lady this is pelzed the leader of serpents walk the little girl looked surprised then smiled for a moment whandall was afraid shed wink or grin but she just said pleased to meet you ill go tell my father youre here she came back with samorty who invited pelzed past the guards no one invited whandall and wanshig so they went back to watch the show when pelzed came out he had a new burning glass and was very proud he showed it to everyone then he found whandall you called me pelzed not lord pelzed he said whandall had thought that through i thought the lords might not like hearing you called lord they can make you disappear lord pelzed he said you really have been in lords houses whandall nodded he already regretted letting them know what did they want wanshig asked pelzed waved his hands it was important labor peace how to organize for the new distribution on mothers day theyre going to let more female hemp plants grow in some of the fields important stuff i cant talk about therell be a meeting tonight be there wanshig whandall be there the meetinghouse had stone walls but no roof there had been a roof but it hadnt been strong enough one night the men of serpents walk had climbed onto the roof no one remembered why the beams broke the kinless family who had once lived in the house couldnt be found so serpents walk couldnt meet there when it rained it didnt rain much anyway whandall and wanshig had to tell everyone how lord pelzed was summoned to meet with the lords while no one from bull fizzle or any other band had been called only pelzed they spoke of the new mothers day everyone would be in one place theyd need all the women to collect and carry and all the men to protect the women and their gifts itll be safe in the square pelzeds advisors said lordsmen will see to that but outside we need two bands pelzed said one to protect our stuff another to see what we can gather from bull pizzle bull pizzle will be doing the same thing whandall thought pelzed appointed leaders wanshig would be one of them whandall thought hed be in wanshigs band but he wasnt he couldnt fight yet so he was afraid hed be assigned to help the women carry that would be shameful but the meeting was over before anyone told him what to do when everyone else was leaving pelzed made whandall and wanshig stay behind pelzed sat at the head of the table with guards standing behind him sit down he invited well have some tea everyone knew about pelzeds tea it was made with hemp leaves and enough of it left you babbling pelzed sipped at the hot brew wanshig gulped his whandall sipped just keeping up with pelzed it made his head spin just a little so you have been to lords town yes lord whandall admitted and you brought back fine clothes what else is there that we can gather everything whandall said but youll die of it they have magic lord pelzed they have stoves inside their houses the fires dont go out yanginatep he didnt want to say it not here where yanginatep ruled i saw the lordsmen in their armor whandall said and big swords and spears every night a lord puts on armor like that and so do the lordsmen and they go on watch where do they go pelzed demanded everywhere they call it the watch because they watch for gatherers not just in the lordshills theres a village outside the walls and they watch there too and they have magicians how much could he tell pelzed whandall was trapped between loyalties he owed pelzed he belonged to the placehold but the future he longed for might be with the lords we saw the magic miracos said he was the advisor who stood at pelzeds right sometimes he spoke aloud and sometimes he whispered in pelzeds ear vines growing fireballs and i saw the black pit whandall said everyone wanted to know about the pit whandall told them as much as he dared no one believed him theres a wall around lordshills miracos said but theres no wall around those big kinless houses lords town there is in back whandall tried to explain about the little squares tables and plants in the middle houses around them walls behind the houses and the watch is there this watch pelzed asked swords armor kinless i think so its hard to tell with those helmets kinless with armor weapons miracos said bad they never come here pelzed said lords do what lords do he made it sound profound but tell us more about those kinless homes whats there what can we gather whandall described some of what he had seen shops with pots and beads and cloth clothing hung on lines people sitting in the squares drinking from cups and talking no lordkin there miracos said maybe we could go live there lords wont let us pelzed said lords always telling us what to do one of the guards said like to show them my knife right up them lords make the kinless work pelzed said if you could do that if i could wed have a roof whandall go back take someone with you wanshig take wanshig bring me back something go learn the way i heard three bands went to the lordshills together to gather wanshig said three together and none of them ever came back dirty bird was powerful before that happened you scared to go with whandall pelzed demanded yes lord anybody would be scared whandalls the only one i ever met who went into lords town and came out only one i ever heard of doing it not talking about inside the walls pelzed said lords are lords leave lords alone but those kinless houses out there thats different go look whandall when everyones carrying stuff the way will be clear you can bring things back go see what you can find id like me a shirt like yours whandall was glad of being small his shirt wouldnt fit pelzed but if a little lords girl could keep what was hers maybe a lordsman could too chapter serpents walk was coming to know a certain visiting looker after the carnival everyone knew his face the boys knew his names he was tras preetror of condigeo tras fascinated them he spent the whole day in idleness like a lordkin the kinless liked him even when he was with lordkin because tras paid for what he took not always though sometimes he told stories instead he would walk away from a fight or run but sometimes he talked his way out wanshig got close enough to see zatch the knife accost tras he reported that they were presently talking like brothers long separated that tras preetror shared a flask with zatch zatch took nothing else everything about tras preetror was exotic peculiar whandall knew he had to see more the boys of serpents walk kept getting caught because they went in bands bands could hide in the forest because the forest was roomy in the city people occupied what space there was getting caught got you laughed at whandall preferred to lurk alone others learned that tras preetror was staying with a kinless family in the eastern arc the kinless had bought protection from the bonechewers who owned that area so the house was nicer than most it also meant that whandall risked more than being laughed at if he got caught three days after the carnival the mornings light found elevenyearold whandall on the roof just above trass curtained window hed slept there flattened on the slope of the roof he heard tras wake piss and dress himself all while singing in the rolling condigeano tongue trass footsteps went straight to the curtained window his arm reached through with something in his hand come down boy he said tormenting the syllables of normal speech ive got something for you talk to me whandall flattened against the roof while he thought it over he hadnt gathered anything from the room the teller couldnt be angry about that he was singing again whandall joined in the chorus and swung on in you sing pretty tras said who are you he held out his gift whandall tasted orange wedges in honey for the first time name whandall of serpents walk happy meet you tras he said in condigeano hed practiced the words while he and others eavesdropped on the lookers happy meet you whandall tras said in bad talktostrangers speech i talk to other you call lordkin lordkin yes of serpents walk tell me how you live he understood the words how you live but whandall couldnt make sense of them how i guard my self my brothers teachwill teach me how to use a knife i walk without one until i know what you do yesterday hid in the hid watched this house cant see roof no lordkin around climb house next door look at roof go for blanket come back sleep on roof wait for you tras speak condigeo tras said in his own speech are a lot of your days like that some maybe tell me how the kinless live i dont know mmm disappointed whandall said i know how woodsmen live woodsmen are kinless tell me whandall began to speak of what hed learned the dangerous plants their names how to recognize and avoid them the rite that woodsmen performed before they felled a redwood and cut it up what they ate how they talked why none but kreeg miller would help injured lordkin children how they came to accept whandall tras listened intently nodding smiling when whandall ran down he said there now youve told me a lot about yourself you rescued your brother lordkin dont work hut you carried water when you saw there was need lordkin dont learn about the forest even the ones who go in as children lordkin like to watch without being seen you gather but the kinless try to stop you because what you gather is what they make or sell or use you dont worship trees but you worship yanginatep you see tras show me what you say tell me how you live tras preetror talked he had come to watch the burning to travel afterward and tell what hed seen if you want to see the world a teller is what you want to be wherever you go they want to know what its like where you came from of course you should know the speech my family could afford a woman of the incas to teach me and my brothers and sisters and cousins we learned geometry and numbers and incantations but i learned inca speech too tras mangled the words and rhythms of normal speech until whandalls head hurt sometimes he didnt have the words finding them turned into lessons in condigeano speech rich if i was rich i could get my own ship and take it where i wanted tras someone could take it away and go where he wants pirates sure you have to be better armed than they are or carry a better wizard or somehow persuade a pirate that you do once upon a time two torovan privateers had us bracketed far from shore privateers are pirates but a government gives them a license to steali mean gather who has a better right tras laughed and said but wave walker carried a wizard that trip we watched acrimegushe was our wizardsent a beam of orange light from his hand down into the water near one of the other ships it was just bright enough to see in twilight he held it there on and on while we maneuvered and the two ships countermaneuvered and came closer and closer then the water boiled at that one spot when acrimegus gave us the signal we all pulled the sails down and then crowded along the rail the privateers must have thought we were crazy a head broke the surface it was almost the same size as the nearest ship all of us shrieked and went running below all but acrimegus i stuck my head back out to see the rest the head was rising and rising on what looked like leagues of neck it turned toward us acrimegus waved and danced and shouted no no you massive great fool until it turned toward the privateer and started to dip what was it well an illusion of course but the privateers turned about and ran what made it work wasnt just acrimeguss light effects but the details the way he acted the way we were acting were you frightened i pissed in my kilt but what a story id travel again with acrimegus any day now you tell me something ive seen a lord so have where was your lord at home in lordshills he had a fountain and a room inside where they can cook a room to piss in with running water and a room where kinless wrote things on paper and put them in jars but i couldnt go in there whandall decided not to speak samortys name he would hold that in reserve can you read no i dont know anyone who can read except the lords could read and shanda you do now what did your lord do whandall was still trying to understand what hed seen on two visits he had other lords to dinner and a magician people who werent lords brought the food and took it away and all the lords did was talk and ask each other questions at the end they acted like theyd fixed something broken only only it was the next burning they think if they can make people talk to each other they can miss the next burning and at the end he put on armor and went out with some other armed men did they do you think they put off the next burning no grown man or woman could answer that question whandall didnt think even lord samorty knew that whandall said no then when will it happen nobody knows whandall said there was another lord who made cups move in a circle like this yes thats called juggling how do you do it years of practice it isnt magic whandall it isnt no there was a whandall couldnt remember the word people pretending to be other people telling each other a story like they dont know theyre being watched jispomnos they called it ive seen jispomnos its too long for after dinner it runs on forever you saw just pieces i bet was there a part where the wifes parents want blood money they talked through the morning and deep into afternoon whandall practiced his scanty condigeano from time to time but usually they were each speaking their own language tras spoke of his own affairs without hesitation still it was hard for even a teller to tell how he lived to see it from inside to see what a stranger must miss they had to walk circles around their lives to sneak up on the truth do you know who your father was whandall said yes do you yes of course tras said what you did with your face it looked like you wanted to fight tras shrugged uncomfortably maybe for just a moment sorry whandall its an insult to ask if anyone but my father is my father tras changed to local speech this not condigeo you feel i still respect you yes but we dont say father resalet tras lofted one eyebrow whandall explained resalet is father to my brothers wanshig and shastern and two of my sisters he tells us i know who my father is so do you but maybe im talking to one who isnt so lucky i dont throw it in his teeth you dont either you say pothefit you and i and he know who i mean even if were wrong pothefit your father have other name not to tell live with you pothefit was killed by a wizard trass face twisted the mans face was so alien it was hard to tell just what he was showing he said when was that my second burning i was seven five years ago almost five whandall thought i missed it my ship left late now nobody seems to know when the next burning will start tras said nobody knows whandall agreed tras preetror sighed but someone has to know someone has to set a fire an odd viewpoint whandall thought yanginatep sets fire they used to know here in teps town in late spring every spring youd burn the city now its been three years what do you remember of the burning whandall tried to tell him tras listened for a bit then asked in condigeano a wizard killed this pothefit it was said odd id know if there was a powerful wizard in teps town hes here ive seen him someday ill see him again i dont know enough about magic yet i dont even have my knife tras said ive seen those knives half a pace long plain handles maybe a little crude crude a condigeano merchant would spend more effort inca smiths get very fancy here someone would just take it away from him whandall frowned remembering something why did you laugh tras looked guilty you caught that im sorry yes but why magic wears out it wears out faster in cities because there are more people everybody knows a little magic you ever try to work a spell near a courthouse its bad enough in condigeo but here theres something about teps town that eats the magic right out of spells and potions and prayers here its hard to imagine what a wizard could do that would hurt a careful man he must have taken your ftaken pothefit by surprise how a man so old that he might die before whandall had his knife a gatherer must be wary ready to run or fight what could morth of atlantis have done to surprise pothefit but whandall only asked have you been where magic is strong theyre dangerous places deserts the ocean mountain peaks anywhere magicians have a hard time getting to thats where magic can still leap out and bite you but i like to go look tras said im a teller i have to go to where i can find stories to tell what will happen when all the magic is gone tras looked grave i dont know i dont think anyone knows but some magicians say they have visions of a time when there is no magic and everyone lives like animals others say that after a long time therell be a new age that doesnt need magic whandalls minds eye showed him teps town spreading to cover the world just for a moment before he blinked the image away what whandall remembered best of that afternoon was how little he understood of what hed seen of his world but hed learned just by talking and the teller didnt seem disappointed chapter of course whandall asked tras preetror about lords strangely tras wanted him to find out more tras we saw you with them on the wagon you spoke to them whandall said we see them when they want to be seen tras said a show for tellers but youve seen lords when they didnt know whandall everyone is curious about your lords who are they where do they come from how do they get their power dont other people have lords lords kings and a hundred other ways to keep chaos imprisoned tras said but teps town is different you burn down your city the kinless rebuild and everyone thinks it wont happen without the lords maybe everyones right i want to know whandall dont you want to go back whandall was learning how to survive in the streets of serpents walk in the benighted sections he had enemies but also friends and guides he was actually getting good at it in the lordshills were dangers he didnt understand no he didnt really want to go back not now not until he understood better what he might do there he had no place in lordshills or in lords town nearby where kinless and lordkin lived together and hung clothes out to dry but he might learn in time the kinless in the pony cart had spoken of moving his relatives to lords town and there were gardeners and lordsmen living inside the walls of lordshills they had to come from somewhere he had to learn those things hut where doing to lordshills without knowing more could he dangerous there was his promise to shanda but hed told her it might take time he tried avoiding the teller it made life less interesting and tras sought him out anyway whandall began to wonder what would the teller do to persuade him whandall hadnt looked at the clothes shanda had given him in a third of a year when he saw their condition he put a kilt and shirt on under his serpents walk gear and took them to show the teller they were torn they stank its all like this he told tras dry rot and how did they get ripped bull fizzles caught me and afterward i couldnt hang them up to dry without somebody gathering them tras offered to get him some soap whandall explained that soap was unheardof treasure his family would gather it from him if he could get it that far unless tras grumbled at the price but he paid whandall went home by hidden ways concealing a whole bag of soap guile and a brisk breeze hid him through dirty bird to serpents walk and from there a cake of soap bought him an escort back to the placehold he could think of only one way to hide so much soap he started giving it away his mother praised him extravagantly brothers took a few cakes to give to their women he spoke to wess a girl two years older than whandall the daughter of his aunts new lover for the luck that was in his words or because she liked him or for the soap she knew he had she lay with him and took his virginity now placehold reeked of soap and whandall could safely use the rest he cleaned the clothes shanda had given him pants and two shirts had rotted too badly they came apart he found he could still assemble a full outfit he went back to wess and begged her to sew up the rips they didnt have to hold long or to stand up to more than a second glance when wess agreed he gave her another cake of soap it would not do to trade with a lordkin man or woman but a gift would persuade wess not to forget her promise or keep it badly he could see himself in the lordshills trying to get into pants that had been sewn shut at the cuffs his clothes must have been good enough because the guards paid no attention to him at all this time he knew the way to samortys house dinner in seranas kitchen was as good as he remembered there was always more than enough food in a lords house whandall thought that must be the best thing about living here you could never be hungry shanda had new clothes for him when did you get these whandall asked just after the carnival she said when you didnt come back i thought about giving them to the gardeners but you said it might be a long time whandall was impressed not that she had saved them for him though that was nice but that she could keep things a long time no one gathered from her room hed seen clothes hung to dry unguarded the lords had gone to someone elses house so there was nothing to do whandall slept in the empty room next to shandas in the morning they went over the wall with a lunch serana had packed whandall inspected shanda in her leathers before he let her go further he was no less careful with his own the hills near the lords wall were ablaze with flowers it was glorious but whandall had never seen the chaparral like this all the patterns and paths he remembered were gone the chaparral seemed well behaved this near the lords wall whandall tried to urge caution but shanda was entranced by the beauty the farther they went the more vicious it all became yet the hills still flared in every conceivable color every bouquet of swords had a great scarlet flower at the tip touchme displayed tiny white berries and pale green flowers with red streaks hemp plants grew taller than whandall they looked inviting but whandall wouldnt touch them ive never seen the woods like this he confessed dont pick anything okay please there were few paths and animals had made those at least shanda seemed to be taking the plants seriously the whips and morningstars were visibly dangerous and shed seen what touchme did to her stepmother le watched her weave her way through a patch of creepyjulia very cautious very graceful very pretty among the blackedged lavender flowers but she kept stopping to look he wove a path through touchme and bouquets of swords to an apple tree she followed carefully in his footsteps they ate a dozen tiny apples and in a field of high yellow grass threw the cores at each other it was well past noon and they were ravenous again before they reached the redwoods they were a thousand paces outside lords town these trees seemed different they were not taller or larger but none of them had ever been cut perhaps the lords protected their view of the for est from the woodsmen at shandas urging he kepi moving until the city couldnt be seen at all all was shadows and wilderness and the huge and ancient pillars this wont hurl you he said watch your feel he walked a crooked path to a twisted trunk that was half bark half glossy red wood freaky yeah firewand thiss all right too a pine tree loomed huge next to children but tiny beneath the redwoods whandall plucked a pine cone and gave it to her you can eat parts of this and he showed her pelzed had been impressed with his knowledge of the forest would shandas father seranas packed lunch was clearly superior but shanda picked another pine cone to keep they were late starting home whandall didnt worry at first he only gradually saw that as shadows grew long the world lost detail the sun was still up there somewhere but not for them you couldnt quite tell where anything was paths morningstars touchme a sudden drop he found them a patch of clear ground while he still could there was a bit of lunch left over no water the leathers had been too hot during the day but they were glad of them now he and shanda still had to curl up together for warmth he felt stirrings remembering the clumsy coupling with wess wess was older hed thought she would know more than he did he might have been her firstshe wouldnt sayand he still didnt really know how the plants were very closethe thought of getting touchme between his legs made him shudderand shanda wasnt at all interested instead they lay looking at stars a meteor flashed overhead lord qirinty keeps hoping one of those will fall where he can find it shanda said but they never do deep into the black night when he felt her uncoiling from him he made her piss right next to him where he knew it was safe he held his own water until the first moments of daylight they could take off the masks when they got closer to the wall but it wasnt safe to remove the leathers when they came in over the wall miss bertrana was waiting by the rope she took shandas hand whandall tried to run away but two gardeners grabbed him they didnt hurt him but he couldnt get away they followed miss bertrana and shanda into the house lord samorty was sitting at a table talking to two guardsmen miss bertrana brought shanda to the table samorty eyed shandas leather leggings where did you sleep he asked in a clearing do you itch no sir he turned to whandall so you know the chaparral he got up to inspect whandalls earlobes interesting who did you learn from woodsmen they taught you disbelieving no lord we lurked samorty nodded ive seen you before sit down miss bertrana ill thank you to take miss shanda to your rooms and discover her condition sir you know very well what i mean oh yes sir miss bertrana said shanda started to protest father just go samorty said he sounded weary and resigned to problems and his voice was enough to cut shandas next protest off before it began she followed miss bertrana out where have i seen you boy samorty demanded he didnt seem angry just annoyed by the distractions and very weary whandall didnt know what to say so he stared at the table and said nothing there was something carved into the table lines some curved a big square shape with smaller square shapes in it you like maps samorty asked i dont know whandall said no i guess you wouldnt samorty said look think of this as a picture of the way the city would look if you were high above it this is the lords town wall he indicated the square this is this house and right here is where you two went over the wall whandalls terror warred with curiosity he bent over the carving to study it is it magic lord not now whandall stared again thenthats the sea he asked right now how far from the wall before the chaparral gets really nasty two hundred paces whandall said two hundred and it will hurt you five hundred and it kills how far did you take my daughter whandalls voice caught in his throat we know it was a long way because we saw you coming back samorty said and you were a lot more than five hundred paces out far enough that nobody would go out after you where did you take her show me on this map we had to go around a lot of bail places whandall said so im not sure are these the trees yes he put his finger into the forest about that far samorty looked at him with new respect is there hemp out there yes lord but its dangerous how kreeg miller had told him a tale we heard the woodsmen say that once they found four men dead with smiles on their faces theyd let one of the hemp plants catch them they went to sleep and it strangled them miss bertrana came in without shanda shes fine she said youre certain oh yes sir intactno question about it and theres no rash either good thank you you may go yes sir miss bertrana escaped happily let me see your hands samorty said he recoiled from the dirt and clapped his hands washbasin he said to the kinless who came in answer now wash up he told whandall his voice was almost friendly now whandall washed his hands carefully whatever miss bertrana had said seemed to have calmed samorty and given him some new energy as if one of his problems didnt matter anymore when whandall was done washing samorty inspected his tattoo serpents walk he said almost to himself i remember you you brought pelzed to see me yes sir for which i thank you whats your name whandall was too afraid to lie whandall placehold well whandall placehold theres no harm done here you want those leathers keep them and here he went to a box on a table in the corner and came back with a dozen shells take these thank you sir now dont come back samorty said whandall had never had a dream ripped out of him it hurt more than he thought anything could samorty clapped his hands and told the kinless servant bring me peacevoice waterman he should be just outside peacevoice waterman was big and almost certainly lordkin peacevoice this is whandall placehold take whandall placehold to the gate show him to the watch and tell them hes not welcome here any longer sir tell him too samorty said when they reached the gate waterman took out his sword easy or hard way boy he demanded i dont know what you mean dont you its simple bend over or ill bend you over whandall bent waterman raised the sword the flat of the sword made a loud whack as it hit whandalls buttocks but he was still wearing the leathers and it didnt really hurt at all not compared to the loss he felt waterman hit him five times more all right get waterman said go gather somewhere else this was all given to me good thing too waterman said boy you dont know how lucky you are now get out of here dont come back chapter tras preetror was both disappointed and intrigued for what that soap cost me he said i could have got a dozen stories from that wizard from you its all hints at something bigger whandall had not spoken of the map he had to keep something back he asked wizard tras morth of atlantis you must know him yes whandall didnt say that it was morth of atlantis he had seen at lord samortys dinner you have to go back you know tras said whandall felt his buttocks he wasnt hurt this time the leathers hadnt been interesting enough to attract attention from the bull fizzles so hed gotten home safely with the shells lord samorty had given him would woodsmans leathers help him win a fight or only hamper his swordplay but he remembered the sound of that sword hitting him it was sharp and if it hadnt been turned to hit him flat hed have lost a leg whandall was sure that even the flat would hurt dreadfully without the leathers no think of the stories tras said they know me they wont let me in the tree they know about the tree tras whandall said there has to be a way tras said nobody talks about the lords hills not the lords nut the people who live there there have to be stories morth has been to lordshills and he knows things hes never told the lords he brought water to teps town whandall said maybe he could interest tras in morth and then hed leave whandall alone whandall had forgotten pelzed ten days later he was summoned to the serpents walk meetinghouse pelzed was all smiles he poured from a teapot and slid hot hemp tea over to whandall his eyes commanded whandall drank they drank hemp tea at serpents walk meetings but it was never as strong as this whandall was sweating and hungry before he drank half of it his headhe heard things pleasant sounds the teller says you wont go back to lords town pelzed said lord you talk to tras preetror thats not your business did he tell you i got caught whandall demanded no you look all right any broken bones no lord b pelzed waved it away what did you see redwoods whandall said the inside of a lords house a big room where he calls people and gives orders and a map if he told pelzed about maps hed have to draw them for him a big lordsman with a sword beat me and told me never to come back so i wont lord they would beat him but worse they would send him away again whandall had tried to forget lordshills and the gift of the king tras says he will pay for a new roof on the meetinghouse pelzed said tras is generous if you take him to lords town have some more tea i cant go there sure you can tell them i sent you pelzed said tell them you have a message from lord pelzed of serpents walk they know me he said proudly a lordkin should have guile they wont believe me whandall said youre important but im just a boy they already threw out inspiration why dont you go instead lord pelzed grinned no but theyll believe tras preetror he said hell tell them have some more tea theyd told him never to come back maybe this way would work whandall thought his head buzzed pleasantly this time he would watch do nothing learn the rules and customs the gardeners clothing wasnt fine enough for an emissary of lord pelzed pelzed sent gatherers to inspect the kinless shops when they found something tras preetror thought might do serpents walk built a bonfire at the street corner nearest the shop others began making torches then pelzed offered a trade new clothes and there wouldnt be a burning the kinless were happy to accept tras hired a wagon to take them to the lords town gate the kinless driver was astonished but willing so long as he didnt have to go further into teps town than ominous hill whandall took the opportunity to examine the ponies that pulled the wagon the beasts tolerated whandalls gaze but shied from his touch bony points protruded from the centers of their foreheads they passed the black pit you want to be a teller you have to look for stories tras said there must be stories about the black pit whandall gaped as if hed never noticed the place before fire the kinless wagoneer said used to be fire pits my grandfather said his voice took on the disbelieving tone kinless used fires and ghost monsters until yanginatep took the fires away now the lordsve put up a fence the guards watched with interest as they came up the hill a quarter of the way up the ponies slowed the driver let them go on a few more paces then stopped far as i go why tras preetror asked bad on the ponies cant you see look at their foreheads horns as long as a finger joint had shrunk to mere thorns the beasts actually seemed to have shrunk tras said but the hills not that steep just the way it is here the driver said i saw horses go in the gate whandall said but they hadnt borne these bony nubs lords horses bigger than my ponies the driver shrugged lords horses can go up that hill mine cant you were paid to take us to the gate tras said the driver shrugged again well have to walk then tras said not so dignified here whandall stand straight look proud they walked the rest of the way up let me do the talking tras said he walked up to the guard were emissaries from serpents walk thats whandall nephew to lord pelzed of serpents walk wed like to speak to lord samorty would you now the guard asked daggett i think youd better go get the officer tras began another speech dont do you no good to talk to me the guard said i sent for the officer save it for him but you do talk pretty whandall recognized the officer as lord qirinty peacevoice waterman was with him you lad waterman said didnt we tell you to stay away from here he turned to qirinty and spoke rapidly too low for whandall to hear qirintys eyes narrowed we are emissaries from lord pelzed of serpents walk to talk about the new aqueduct tras said and what would lord pelzed of serpents walk have to do with the new aqueduct qirinty asked his voice was pleasant enough but there was more curiosity than friendliness in it he can get you some workers qirinty laughed sure he can peacevoice i dont think we need any more of this watermans badge of office was a large stick he smiled pleasantly as he walked over to tras preetror and eyed his head expertly your superiors wont like waterman whacked tras just over the right ear and tras dropped like a stone waterman nodded in satisfaction mister daggett this ones for you he said sort of a bonus like he turned to qirinty now about this lad well he doesnt learn very well does he qirinty asked hes done us no harm and i believe you said samortys daughter likes him yes sir i expect miss shanda wont like it a bit when we feed him to the crabs that may be a bit drastic qirinty said but do see that he understands this time yes sir this time whandall wasnt offered a choice of hard or easy waterman swung the stick when whandall put his hands up to protect his head the stick swung in an arc to his legs hitting him just behind the knee whandall yelled in pain as he fell to the ground he doubled over to protect himself the other guard kicked him in the back just above the waist nothing that had ever happened to him hurt that bad now now wergy waterman said to the guard hes going lo need them kidneys to pee with they didnt give me a choice most of that came out as a scream as the stick descended this time on whandalls upper left arm then swung instantly to hit his buttocks from behind they didnt i had to come another blow to his left arm after that whandall didnt notice who hit him or where he just knew it went on for a long time chapter when he woke it was dark he felt a jolt and closed his eyes tightly afraid he was being beaten again but finally he opened them to see that he was in the back of the cart they were just passing the black pit the kinless driver turned when he stirred you going to live he asked without much interest yes thank you had to come this way anyway the driver said here have some water he passed back a flask whandalls left arm wasnt working at all he was surprised to find that his right would lift the flask to his lips every muscle of his body seemed to be throbbing in unison it was nearly dawn when they reached peacegiven square the driver lifted him down from the wagon and left him lying by the fountain his brothers found him just before noon it was late afternoon before whandall remembered that tras preetror wasnt with him he spent some hours wondering what might have happened to him maimed flayed impaled were there cannibals among the ships of the harbor to whom tras preetror might have been sold such thoughts gave him some comfort his left arm was broken other agonies masked the pain and nobody ever set it he cradled it held it straight as best he could and finally mothers mother used a strip of cloth to bind it rigidly against his chest it healed a little crooked while whandall lay healing in his room his mind roamed free of probability and logic mail dreams mad schemes chased each other through his head rescue shanda from her unparents kill pelzed take his place increase his power until he was the equal of a lord become a teller roam the world which in his mind was a great foggy swirling wall of rainbow colors his mother had him moved to a room closer to hers shared with her latest infant and three others mothers mother brought him soup it was all he was able to eat two days passed before he could get to a window to piss a week before he could walk around placehold a cousin and her man had gathered his room while he healed in the nursery he couldnt lift or gather they set him to cleaning the kitchen and the public areas alongside much younger girls and boys wess was with vinspel a dark man of serpents walk who had been visiting whandalls sister ilyessa but found wess more attractive she avoided being caught talking to whandall alone when he ran her down he saw a look in her eyes that made him wonder what he looked like crippled marred he took to avoiding wess she didnt need more soap it was bad to be a weakling in placehold but the street would have killed him when he could climb to the roof they set him to working on the rooftop garden it was less shameful than cleaning and he couldnt be seen by anyone outside placehold the placehold had a large flat roof strong enough to support a foot of dirt and buckets of water rabbits couldnt get up there and most insects didnt picking bugs off carrots was work for girls and young boys whandall resented having to do it but there wasnt anything else for a onearmed boy who couldnt use a knife like the plants of the forest the crops fought back if they were attacked by rabbits or insects or pulled up when young they developed poisons you could pluck a young carrot or an ear of corn and cook it quickly and it wouldnt be deadly but leave it a day and it would bring tumors and painful death traders sometimes bought teps town root vegetables and whandall had once asked tras preetror what they did with them sell them to wizards tras had told him most places theyll kill even a wizard but teps town doesnt have so much magic the plants still fight back but not so hard wizards eat teps town carrots to gain strength tras anything that doesnt kill you makes you stronger tras had said in the voice he used when quoting somebody dead now whandall remembered and hoped it was true mostly garden workers protected crops from rabbits and insects until they were big and old and tough plants gone to seed didnt care whether they were eaten these they pulled up for food old carrots onions and potatoes would keep a long time it was work for kinless but no kinless could be allowed up on the placehold roof whandall found it a pleasant way to pass time the work wasnt hard except for carrying buckets of water up the stairs and that was done in an hour each day the rest was only tedious he had to crawl along the vegetable rows looking for insects to kill the view from the roof was wonderful whandall remembered the carving on lord samortys table a map from the roof whandall could see all of serpents walk and some of the other band territories and could see where people went on mothers day and afterward he tried to draw the patterns a room opened up for him just when living with crying and crawling infants was about to drive him crazy shastern led him to a tiny room just below the roof hed have to do something about the unwashed smell which suddenly struck him as familiar lenorbas room he said was where is she nobody knows we needed an extra woman at the last mothers day we took lenorba of course we stopped at the border of peacegiven square and the women went on lenorba never came back they got her whandall nodded it was thirteen years ago and most people must have forgotten what lenorba had done yet he could feel no surprise his arm stopped hurting and eventually he took off the swaddling strip mothers mother had used to bind it up the arm was crooked but he could use it hauling water up the stairs helped strengthen it picking insects off carrots gave him skill in small movements after whandalls arm healed he took his knife lessons seriously although the instruction was haphazard whandall thought about each lesson and practiced on the roof he wondered why you did things a certain way then he discovered that if he practiced foot movements with no knife his arms just held out defensively he could concentrate on getting the steps exactly right then he thought about the cloak over his left arm moving that as a shield and learned precisely where his arm should be to protect against a thrust or a slash then he learned knife movements standing still and concentrating on his hand and arm each time he thought about getting one thing right his uncles and cousins had nearly given up in disgust thinking whandall slow and simple must have got hit in the head one of his uncles said not bothering to lower his voice so whandall wouldnt hear whandall went on practicing one move at a time concentrating on getting each one just right when whandall thought he had learned all the moves they would teach him he put them all together his uncles were astonished at the result suddenly he could best his cousins younger and older in mock duels with wooden knives he was growing stronger and now he was quick and deceptively fast and he used his limbs effectively one day he bested resalet the next resalet and his grandson working together that was the day they pronounced him ready to go to the streets again and gave him a knife of his own they said it had belonged to pothefit whandall knew better but the lie pleased him even so he was wary on the streets rumor said that pelzed was most unhappy with him his first foray was a walk with his brothers a seeking for conversation and he found he was treated with respect he was whandall of serpents walk and so long as he stayed in the walk or allied territory he was safe he thought of asking for a face tattoo but he put that off he still had sores on his head and a scar at his left eye it was an angry red ring with a white center painful to touch his left arm was shorter than his right in time the pain faded but he grew slowly part two adolescent chapter girls suddenly they snagged at whandalls eyes the sight of a pretty girl held all of his attention if he was talking to lordkin or gathering from a kinless a clout across the head might be his first return to sanity what had changed whandalls loins worried at him like a bad tooth girls werent eager to go with a scarred thirteenyearold with no tattoo hed avoided wess while he was healing he didnt want her to see him that way now wess was avoiding him and vinspel wouldnt let a man near her anyway the other boys found ribald amusement in the ringshaped scar at his eye maybe it was even worse than hed guessed other boys talked about girls theyd had and whandall joined in telling stories as tras preetror had taught him you didnt doubt another boys story if he needed to prove himself a man he might do it with a knife whandall could do that the first time a bull pizzle challenged him whandall had startled him and everyone else the fight was over before it started the pizzle disarmed with a cut across the back of his hand whandall could have killed him easily but that would start a blood feud instead he took his knife the next day two more bull pizzles challenged him they were both young with knives but no face tattoos in minutes whandall had two more knives then lord pelzed and the bull pizzles met and whandall was told to stay out of pizzle territory and everyone left him alone his skill impressed his uncles but not the girls what did impress them no man knew girls were never found alone they were with older tougher hoys or even men a few had brothers who guarded them fiercely whandall spoke of trying his new skill with a knife the next night he was summoned to speak with resalet so youre able to fight all of bull fizzle and possibly owl beak as well resalet said alone without help it seems we taught you well whandall at thirteen thought he was immortal but part of him knew better there was a black pit in his stomach when he said only kinless are abandoned by their kin resalet said now think on this you will fight for a woman you will win and her man or his brothers or her brothers or all of those will fight you you are skilled but youre small blood will flow someone will die when you are killed the placehold will demand blood money from those who killed you he eyed whandall carefully for fools we dont need much blood money whandall shuffled his feet unable to reply youre too young to fight for a woman resalet told him i feel like i could whandall said resalet grinned showing wide gaps in his teeth know what you mean but the placehold cant start a war over getting you a woman shall we buy you a woman for a night whandall understood that the word buy was an insult still he considered the offer there were women who lived with their children but no men some were always popular others might have a suitor for a few days after mothers day then they were around for a jewel or a shell or a skirt or a shared meal and a place to sleep or for nothing what would any of them do for soap but trass soap had near killed whandall and tras was dead or gone and what kind of woman would look at a strange scarred boy this soon after mothers day not just yet he said but thanks resalet nodded sagely youll be a good lordkin someday but youre not one yet grow more before you take a tattoo you wont take my knife no but carry it softly while you grow ask but who could he talk to boys his age were afraid of him and older boys laughed because he knew so little his mother had no time for him he used a shell samorty had given him to buy a melonfruit soft enough to eat without teethand brought it to mothers mother dargramnet hacked it with her sleeve knife and ate it noisily girls whandall prompted and waited the thin lips parted in a smile yes yes i see them now not like they were when i was a girl go with anyone now theyll learn too late theyll learn too late warned them warned them all its very hot today isnt it she didnt always hear or remember what whandall said whandall wasnt sure she knew who he was still the stretch of years within her mind must be worth exploring what had the girl dargramnet wanted in a man he asked what were the men like mothers mother spoke of the men shed known strif bloude gliratenold lovers came and went in dargramnets mind as they must have in life interchangeable inside broken stories until whandall couldnt tell one from another her second son pothefit strong enough to lift a wagon stubborn as a lord wanshig and whandall her first grandsons thomers sons by pothefit and resalet cousins who shared everything most of them dead now killed in knife fights burnings just gone whandall nodded many of the boys hed grown up with were dead theyd survived the forest but not the city teps town killed boys did other cities did boys die so young in lords town or in the lordshills or condigeo one could watch and try to learn unattached women without kin to protect them were hard to find and they wanted big men to be with except on mothers day the lords didnt give then gifts to women who had men women went to peacegiven square alone and one need only listen to learn who had a man waiting most girls wanted to marry most men didnt but they wanted their sisters married one or two of whandalls sisters friends might be ready to marry but that was too big a bite for whandall at thirteen not that hed reasoned any of this out exactly but every lordkin knew that there was a time when a man need not ask whandall remembered a high optimism a firelight feast for eyes grown bored with daylight frenzy and excitement couples pairing off when he was seven years old shig when will the burning come wanshig laughed youre a looker now they were at dinner in the placehold courtyard the sky was red with sunset speech ran softly round the circle of adults and the smaller circle of children wanshig was eighteen now hed watched whandall practicing with his knife and twice had joined him on the roof not ashamed to learn from his younger brother whandall liked him best of all his kin now wanshig set his spoon down and said nobody knows long ago it was once a year now every four or five even when mother was a little girl they couldnt tell anymore maybe gods sleep like your uncle cartry after a lordsman whacked his head maybe yanginatep isnt deadhe just dover wakes up did yanginatep take you wanshig laughed again no i was only twelve i think someone then they say yanginatep possessed alferth and tarnisos you dont know them whandall theyre crazy enough without help all i know is we see fires south of us smoke blowing our way resalet whoops and dives into carralands fine clothes and we all follow carraland runs away shouting out looker gibberish what happened to pothefit that snapped wanshig out of his wistful nostalgia whandall do you remember when they came in with the cook pot yes shig pothefit and resalet were shadows against the dancing blaze from the granary carrying the cauldron through placeholds main door while wanshig and another brother pretended to help we gathered it out of a wizards shop on market round we piled stuff in the cook pot too but we went back for more and to burn the place an atlantis wizard a stranger he didnt know any better than to come back to his shop during the burning he found us pothefit was trying to set the shelves alight the wizard waved his hand and said something and pothefit just fell over rest of us got away lord samortys courtyard i saw him morth of atlantis me too that shop on market round he built it again after the burning no shig morth of atlantis was too old for that he was almost dead right and cook fires burn inside whandall that is morth of atlantis the shop on market round where does he go at night wanshig cuffed him hard enough to make the point dont even think it never remember a killing after the burning whandall rubbed his ear shig youve killed barbarians lookers kinless uglies anyone whos insulted you you can kill but thats only during the burning whandall and its not a big part of it its only its bad to hold your anger locked in your belly for too long you have to let it go something in the conversation had attracted resalets attention whandall how do you reckon we keep the placehold when everybody wants it we watch we can fight we can fight resalet said but we couldnt fight everyone serpents walk whandall said resalet nodded gravely but serpents walk cant fight bull pizzle and owl beak and maze walkers all together and what happens if lord pelzed wants to live here whandall had never thought of that resalet grinned showing as many black spaces as teeth were smarter than they are we have rules he said and the first one is dont start tights you cant win dont even start fights that will cost you strength but once you do get in a fight win it no matter what happens no matter what it costs always win always win big make an example of your enemies every time lords do that too theyd done it to whandall what if you cant win resalets grin widened you never think about that once its started i le went back to his soup whandall was about to say something but wanshig put his bowl aside and stood up show you something what come on wanshig pulled a burning stick from the cook fire and ran whirling it round his head he was through the courtyards narrow entrance with whandall just behind him the flame gleamed pale in the dusk wanshig skidded around another corner crossed the street diagonally and whandall running behind him saw wanshig hurl the torch through the window of goldsmiths wire jewelry shop the owner was just about to pull the shutter down for the night he screeched as the torch went past his ear and the flame snuffed out wanshig kept running past the store whooping whandall followed in the shadow of an alley they stopped to breathe then to laugh see if the burning isnt on us indoor fires just go out then maybe you get laughed at and maybe you get beat up depending so dont be the one to start the burning let someone else do it wanshig grinned you were about to get a beating he said i just wanted to know you wanted to know what happens if so many come after us that we cant win wanshig said whandall you know what would happen wed run away but resalet cant say that not even inside the placehold if the story got out that you could take the placehold without killing every one of us that any of us even thinks that waywere gone chapter one day a fire began in the brush behind a kinless house just outside serpents walk territory all the kinless in that area turned out they brought a big wagon pulled by the small kinless ponies it had a tank on it and kinless men dipped water from it and threw it on the fire until it was out whandall watched from behind a flowering hedge on the way home he gathered an apple to give resalet why do they bother the fire would go out wouldnt it whandall asked resalet was in a mellow mood kinless dont believe in yanginatep he said so yanginatep doesnt always protect them against us yes unless theres a burning sometimes against accidents not always and the kinless dont wait to find out those wagons they keep them in the stable area resalet said what if the fire is too far away resalet shrugged ive seen them turn out with buckets when theres water in the river of spirits the river of spirits flowed out of the forest and down through lordkin territory before it reached the kinless area it stank whandall thought hed rather see placehold burn than have a fire put out with what was in that river there was much to learn about yanginatep and one could ask mothers mother told him some when she was a girl she had heard a tale that the kinless had once been warriors with a god of their own before yanginatep and the lords brought the lordkin to teps town she couldnt remember who had told her the story and she thought the days were hotter than they used to be days were long for whandall he was smaller than other boys his age and the months spent healing and afterward doing childrens work had lost him what friends he might have had his best friend was his older brother wanshig and shig didnt always want a smaller boy hanging around with him there was little to do his uncles were content to have him hang around placehold in case of need but that was no life his younger brother shastern had grown while whandall was recovering now anyone seeing them together took shastern for the elder shastern was deeply involved in serpents walk activities he was leader of a band that gathered from the kinless in owl beak come with us whandall shastern urged lord pelzed wants us to look at a street in bull fizzle territory why i cant run fast no but you can lurk if you dont do it ill have to whandall thought about that you didnt used to be very good at lurking im learning but youre better what are we looking for whandall asked dark mans cup street its right at the border i know where it is whandall said theres nothing there shaz theres nothing to gather what would lord pelzed want with that place shastern shook his head he didnt tell me he said to find whos living there now when was the last time you were there whandall thought back six weeks i was following a kinless but maybe he knew i was behind him whandall shrugged i lost him in the trash on that street its that bad come tell lord pelzed i think hes mad at me shastern shook his head not that i know of whandall you have to see him sometime this way you can do him a favor all right whandall felt his heart beat faster suppose pelzedlord pelzedwanted him to pay for the cart and clothes or the roof tras preetror had promised but shastern was righthe had to know sometime pelzed found time for the boys that afternoon shastern says you followed a kinless to dark mans cup he said have some tea the tea was weak and didnt do anything to whandalls head he sipped and found it good he was kinless whandall said but he didnt live there who does i only saw some women iordkin yes i think so whandall said lord pelzed dark mans cup looks like there hasnt been a kinless there for years its all trash and weeds in the street and it stinks children two babies whandall said dirty like their mothers no men i didnt see any go find out pelzed said lord go find out therell be men find out who they are lord why theres nothing there but there could be pelzed said and ill send tumbanton with you have some more tea dark mans cup lay on the other side of a small gully that had running water during the rainy season but was usually dry the creek bed was filled with trash and sewage and there was no bridge three boys and an older man picked their way through the trash with whandall in the lead tumbanton was usually seen at pelzeds right hand he was the whip hand the trainer when a boy joined serpents walk hed saved pelzeds life twentysix years ago when they were both no more than gatherers hed defended their retreat when a raid on maze walkers went disastrously wrong six had died tumbanton and pelzed had escaped tumbanton usually went without a shirt to show the maze of scars from that event he loved to tell the story but hed picked up a trace of a limp too and a noisy wobbly walk his son geravim with no scars to speak of seemed as clumsy as his father whats pelzed want with this place anyway geravim asked as he shook filth off his sandals tumbanton must know that but he didnt speak maybe he thinks he can get the kinless to build a bridge shastern said wish theyd done it already geravim muttered and why would they when the lords and lordkin would only gather what they built but they did kinless did work sometimes and only men like pelzed knew why pelzeds family had never been important how had he become lord pelzed whandall caught a whiff of cooking meat it was faint nearly masked by the smells of sewage and decay but it was there something shastern asked probably not whandall said wait here ill be right back there was no wind but when hed smelled the cook fire there had been pull of air from the south whandall went that way downstream if there hail been any water in the gully there were thickets of greasewood and sharp plants like lordswords except these were smaller and didnt move to strike at him another patch looked like a variety of lordkiss three leaves and white berries but the leaves were sickly red ahead was a patch of holly thorns and berries there was a tunnel in the thorns and rabbit droppings on the path he sniffed fresh the way led steeply down the center of the gully was deep a dry streambed but on the sides there were shelves of flat land fifty feet wide and nearly that far above the streambed above them were thickets all the way to the top of the gully and beyond but the shelves themselves had i clear patches among the weeds and chaparral the smell of cooking meat got stronger as he went south when he reached the end of the narrow twisting passage through the holly bushes he stayed prone and used his knife to part the weeds ahead of him so he could look without being seen he saw a cook fire a slab of meat roasted on a spit above it behind the fire was a cave into the gully bank the entrance was hidden from above and most other directions by holly bushes and scrub oak three kinless men sat by the fire they were sharpening axes a kinless girl came out of the cave and put sticks on the fire a patch of hemp grew just beyond the camp area these plants seemed different from the hemp that grew in the fields between teps town and the lordshills taller and more lushly green as the girl passed whandall saw the plants stir in a breeze he couldnt feel wild plants would have done that too whandall couldnt make out what the kinless men were saying he wriggled backward until he could turn around then went back to shastern and the others find something shastern asked whandall shook his head he might have spoken but geravim and tumbanton werent relatives the rogue kinless wouldnt have much worth gathering but hed keep this a secret for the family the gully had always been a nomansland used as a garbage dump by serpents walk and bull fizzle alike and serving as an easily recognized boundary dark mans cup was the first street on the other side about a hundred feet from the gully beyond it was a tangle of streets and thistle fields mixed together before the town proper started again there were nine houses on dark mans cup five had roofs one of the roofless houses was stone and would be a good house if someone could make the kinless build a roof two of the roofless structures had been used as garbage dumps and outhouses and only three of the houses with roofs seemed to be inhabited those stood apart three houses together along a field partially cleared of weeds every wall of every house inhabited or not had a bull pizzle mark they watched a boy about shasterns age repainting the bull fizzle mark on his front wall whandall left shastern and the others at the edge of the gully and crept through the trash piles in the yards behind the houses each household had a small cleared patch in back where they built the cook fires and another small area where children played weeds grew everywhere even in the cleared patches everything stank one house had a dog but it didnt seem interested in anything outside its own yard there were snares in the animal paths behind the houses whandall automatically avoided them as he crept toward the inhabited area he moved quickly but silently and no one noticed him whandall grinned to himself watching the kinless woodsmen had been good practice whandall saw only four men two were ancient and sat in toothless conversation near a cook fire in one of the yards one was about twenty the other was the boy who had repainted the bull fizzle sign whandall watched to see if anyone else would come then he heard a rustling behind him he turned see shastern coming shaz walked carelessly along a game path watch out traps whandall said he tried to keep his voice low but one of the old men must have kept his hearing spies the old man shouted spies bull fizzle spies and the warning had done no good shastern was entangled in a snare when it tripped him another snare caught his arm there were shouts from somewhere to the east whandall ran back to shastern when he reached him there were more shouts louder bull fizzles coming shastern said cut me loose it was hard to cut the leather thongs without hurting shastern finally whandall had his brothers arm free together they freed his legs shastern stood and grinned feebly now what whandall asked now we run like hell big brother shastern said he ran for a few yards then went down as another snare caught him by the time whandall had helped cut him free the shouts of the bull fizzle warriors were much closer they couldnt see anyone but it sounded like the warriors were just behind them shastern ran in bounding leaps hoping to avoid the snares whandall ran behind him watching for traps as shastern got farther and farther ahead geravim and tumbanton were gone shastern was far ahead and whandall heard shouts behind him he was nearly winded they would catch him soon better to stop while he could still fight he looked for a place to stop a corner would be best but there werent any there werent even walls here the best refuge he could see was a holly bush it would be useless against a spear but it would protect his back from knives he ran to the holly bush scooped a handful of dirt jacket over his left arm turned the big lordkin knife felt good in his hand and he tried to grin as hed seen big lordkin men do when they were menacing kinless there were only three of the bull fizzles all were bigger than whandall the oldest probably twenty he had seen none of them before whoever lived on dark mans cup was content to let others defend it for them one had a knife that didnt worry whandall but another had a big club studded with obsidian blades the third boy had a rock tied onto a long rawhide thong he swung it around his head in a lazy circle the rock still moving fast enough that if it hit whandall it would brain him as the first bull fizzle came toward him whandall threw dirt into his face then lunged forward slashing before retreating to his bush blood flowed from the bull pizzles chest and the knifeman howled in pain the older boy had the club he gestured to his companions to spread out hes fast but he cant get us all the bull fizzle leader grinned a tattoo marked his left eye what you doing here boy looking to get killed what band marks itself with a target target oh he meant the scar around whandalls eye whandall looked for a way out there didnt seem to be one we were following a kinless for shells whandall said but we lost him then my friend was caught in a snare we did you no harm youre in pizzle territory the older boy said then glanced expertly at whandalls hand we dont want snakes here he gestured again to spread the other two out farther the boy with a knife had stopped snuffling when he found that his cut wasnt serious now he tried to rub the dirt from his eyes he moved over to whandalls left side away from whandalls knife his knife was held clumsily a beginner whandall thought hed be no problem at all the club worried him it was long enough to reach him before he could strike whandall had never faced a club before you scared to use a knife whandall taunted no just careful the older boy said you want to give up what happens if i do the club man shrugged up to our chief he said dont know what wulltid will want to do with you cant be worse than what well do it you dont give up the problem was it could he on the other hand pelzed might ransom him since hed been sent by pelzed there wasnt an active war with bull fizzle but pelzed wouldnt be happy you going to give up the club wielder asked running out of time i have lots of time whandall said hed caught his breath now the situation was bad the boy with the bola had moved well off to whandalls right and was swinging it faster now the club man raised his weapon last chance yanginatep whandall shouted yanginatep the bull pizzle leader was startled for a moment he looked around as if expecting the fire god to appear then he laughed yanginatep loves bull pizzle as much as snake shit he roared which is not at all the knifeman said maddog i dont care if he gives upi get to cut him yeah i think so yanginatep yanginatep isnt going to wake for you whandall didnt think so either but it had been worth trying serpents walk the shout came from the gully snake feet whandall answered coming it was shasterns voice there was wild thrashing in the gully were coming maddog listened it sounded like half a dozen serpents walk warriors and he didnt like the odds stay out of pizzle territory he shouted he gestured to the others and they withdrew toward the east as soon as they were away whandall ran toward the gully and over the lip shastern was there alone he had a tree branch and was bashing at the chaparral were coming good to see you shaz whandall said shastern grinned good to see you big brother now lets run before they find out its just me geravim and tumbanton ran chapter pelzed listened carefully to whandalls account no one important living there he said none of the people who chased you live there youre sure yes lord whandall hesitated lord may i ask pelzeds eyes narrowed thinking of taking my place no lord i couldnt do it whandall said pelzed considered that i think youre smart enough to believe that he said whandall what im looking for is territory we can claim but its not worth claiming whandall exclaimed pelzed smiled glad you think so if you think its worthless wulltid of bull fizzle will be sure of it pelzed and wulltid met in peacegiven square under the watchful eye of the patrolling lordsmen they had agreed to bring only four men each wulltid brought four great hulking bodyguards pelzed had two of his regular guards but he also brought whandall and shastern you raided my territory wulltid began abruptly calm pelzed said have some tea he poured from a stone jug wrapped in straw to keep it hot the cups had been kept warm the same way pelzed lifted his cup sipped and nodded so greetings chief wulltid wulltid stared sourly at pelzed lifted his cup and drank thats pretty good he admitted greetings lord pelzed but you still raided my territory pelzed swept his hand to indicate whandall and shastern i sent these two boys to see what youve made of dark mans cup pelzed said which is nothing at all two hoys to a street you dont care about now hows that a raid still my territory wulltid said lets talk about that what will you take for it hemp how much hemp maybe some tar hemp tar wulltid glared at whandall boy what did you find there gold trash its a trash heap chief wulltid whandall said he turned to pelzed and repeated a trash heap lord so why does your boss want that place wulltid demanded whandalls perplexity was genuine its simple enough pelzed said ive got some relatives who need homes and some kinless wholl build for them need a place dark mans cup wont be too bad once all the trash is thrown in the gully thats what i thought wulltid said but the kinless i put in there wouldnt stay yours wont either thats my problem pelzed said now just what do you want for the cup its not like its worth much what if i said i dont believe you wulltid said pleasantly theres more to this theyre not close kin pelzed smiled lord samorty asked me the lords want that area cleaned up why who knows why lords want things but they asked me what did they offer pelzed sighed five bales of hemp five they only gave me three you took it but you didnt get it clean pelzed said wulltid scratched his head i tried i could have kept that place clear for two years three even but that gemwright wanted five years i had to promise five gemwrighthes one crazy kinless you didnt even give him two years pelzed said cheerfully bull fizzles were gathering in the cup a year after the kinless moved in wulltid sipped tea without comment so the work stopped you couldnt keep your people from gathering the kinless moved out and now youre stuck protecting a place that nobody worth anything will live in chief im doing you a favor taking that slum off your hands but ill give you half a bale youre getting five bales wulltid said i want two for dark mans cup one pelzed said you have three already two all right two pelzed said but we get a lords witness to this deal wulltid shrugged youll pay him then i wont the lords witness was accompanied by two lordsmen guards and a kinless clerk no more than whandalls age the clerk dressed like servants whandall had seen in lordshills the witness wore a tightfitting cap that completely covered his ears and dark robes of office the clerk spoke in a highpitched voice you wish the attention of a lords witness that will be ten shells in advance pelzed laid them in a row one smooth motion ten shells marked by a lords clerk the clerk swept them into a leather pouch he turned to the witness they have paid honorable the witness sat down to listen an agreement between lord pelzed of serpents walk and chief wulltid of bull pizzle the clerk said speak wulltid of bull fizzle we give the street known as dark mans cup to serpents walk wulltid said serpents walk will complete whats left of the work bull pizzle was paid to do we will remove all bull pizzle people within two days and never return serpents walk has to repaint all the signs we wont do that the clerk wrote on what looked like a sheet of thin white leather when pelzed tried to speak the clerk held up a hand until he had finished writing now speak pelzed of serpents walk we will complete the work offered by lord samortys clerk the lords will pay us five bales of hemp and two buckets of tar we will pay two bales of hemp to bull pizzle in return all trash will be removed from the street and yards five houses of kinless will be established and no one will gather in dark mans cup for five years the clerk wrote again do both of you accept this he demanded then mark this vellum thank you that will be twenty more shells afterward pelzed was talkative and amused it was easy he crowed wulltid never suspected a thing whandall didnt ask but he looked pelzed laughed we had no way to expand in that area because of the gully he said ive always wanted something on the other side the gully may be worth something clean it up and a kinless could grow hemp there i think whandall remembered the hidden kinless camp so i wanted it pelzed said i could have bought it maybe but this way is better look whandallnow the lords know bull pizzle took their three bales and two more of mine and did nothing for it five hales for nothing im gelling the three hull pizzle got and ill get it cleaned up whandall waited a respectful moment how lord my kinless believe me when i tell them theyll have five years with no gathering pelzed said do you believe me whandall whandall didnt answer instantly pelzed asked you know fawlith the beggar who babbles all the time thats him we caught him and his brother gathering on a street where i promised the kinless wed leave them alone i didnt know he had a brother pelzed just grinned want to live in a house of your own he asked ill need two lordkin families in the cup to watch over the kinless there ready to start a family whandall thought about it for a moment thank you no lord i have a home he shrugged i dont have a woman fine house will get you a woman pelzed said even with that eye but youre young ask me when youre ready i owe you for this three of them shastern said much later and you held them off until i scared them away tell me how to do that whandall tried to explain he told shastern how hed practiced each move thinking about that and nothing else and how it had taken months shastern didnt believe him there had to be a secret that whandall wasnt telling him shastern left in disgust leaving whandall more alone than ever chapter as the scars of burning faded the lookers dwindled they never went away entirely though tras preetror was gone other tellers remained a teller gave shastern a handful of fruit to torch carvers lumberyard at a dead run and with a bloodcurdling whoop shastern hurled paired torches past a heap of beam ends and into the work shed the fires went out of course shastern shared the fruit around afterward they never told the lookers what happened to fires outside the shed whandall liked lookers like most kinless they made little trouble when their things disappeared a looker who made a fuss would be returned to the docks in bruised condition and who would complain many not just tellers carried little flasks of wine as gifts in return for stories or guidance some carried preserved fruit for children and of course they told stories in spring again three years after the beating pelzed summoned whandall to his roofless hall tumbanton wasnt about it came to whandall that he hadnt seen tumbanton or geravim the last few times pelzed summoned him tumbanton and his son might be avoiding whandall after leaving whandall and wanshig to the mercy of the bull fizzles these days whandall had the status of a man even though he had not selected his tattoo tentatively he opened conversation with some of pelzeds men and found them speaking openly treating him as an equal hut when ho asked alter iumbanton nobody wanted to hear that question whandall hid his amusement and naively asked allot geravim too talk died whandall meandered casually toward pelzeds rooms hed best not name those names again until he knew more the serpents walk lord offered hemp tea and waited until whandall had sipped before he spoke tras preetror is back whandall stared i thought theyd fed him to the crabs seems not he owes me a new roof anyway id like to hear his story wouldnt you whandall had learned caution he only nodded go on i want to meet him but i hadnt decided who to send anyone else he might not pay attention if i send you hell try to explain what went wrong bring him here right lord i am your messenger and no more he comes or he doesnt where would i find him nobody knows pelzed smiled the tea was making him mellow not in the lordshills i think tumbanton thought pelzed owed him pelzed might be tired of hearing it tumbanton had heard pelzeds prohibitions but might think himself an exception tumbanton and his son had explored dark mans cup it gave them a proprietary interest whandall couldnt ask around pelzed he couldnt ask in dark mans cup stray lordkin dared not be seen there but pelzed had set two lordkin families corles and trazalac to guard the cup when stant corles came to the long mile market to shop whandall was there with a cold baked potato stant only knew that four lordkin had tried to gather from the kinless in the corles familys charge theyd moved into the house under cover of night and held the family as terrorized prisoners when it was over the kinless were freed and three lordkin had been given to the lords no telling what would happen to them but the fourth the older man with all the scars we strung him up and played with him he lasted two days not my idea long as he could talk at all he kept trying to tell us he was friends with lord pelzed old man trazalac he thought that was way too funny he never said why and you know im not inclined to ask twice tras preetror was in the village near the harbor that was already too close to the lordshills for whandall peacegiven square was neutral territory and was the closest place to the hills and hemp fields separating the benighted areamost of tops townfrom lords town the harbor and lordshills the lords had changed the way things were done before the carnival carts and guards came to local parks once each month this year they gave out more but the women had to go farther to get it all the women had to travel to peacegiven square each eight weeks thence the lordsmen guards and kinless wagoneers brought baskets of grain and jars of oil sometimes there were fruits and twice a year there might be cheese the kinless clerks were protected by big lordsmen with helmets and spears there were things the women had to say i am a widow i have no home my children are hungry no man protects me any men must hang back at the edges of the square the clerks would give only to single mothers and to women too old to have children many a woman must borrow a child the lordsmen and their kinless clerks passed out the goods and the women carried them out of the square then the fights started men gathered from unprotected women all the placehold men would make a circle around mother and mothers mother and the aunts and sisters and cousins placehold had a cart pulled by the younger boys some goods went into the cart but not all because another band might gather the cart placehold was large enough with enough women that it was better to protect what they had than to try to gather more theyd learned that the first mothers day after the carnival others were learning too they had finished packing everything in carts or hanging it on poles for the women to carry when whandall saw tras preetror he told resalet pelzed wants me to talk to him resalet eyed the crowd then nodded we can spare you this time its well to keep peace with pelzed come home when you can tras looked older thinner more wiry the sight of tras made whandalls bones ache with memories they told me theyd fed you to the crabs he said they told me theyd done that with you tras said peacegiven square was clearing fast with households and families and bands moving rapidly away trying to get home safely before someone gathered everything from them tras selected an outdoor table at the street corner and ordered honey tea for both of them he inspected whandall as they sat clearly they didnt youve grown got your knife too i thought i was crippled for life whandall said tras you said you could persuade them but you cant persuade people who dont listen what did they do to you sold me as a deckhand tras said i was two years working off the price they got for me he looked down at his callused hands sea life is hard but im in better shape than ive ever been got some good stories too lord pelzed wants to hear them he says you owe him a roof tras preetror laughed like a maniac whandall found that irritating he asked been back to the lordshills the laugh caught in his throat you were right of course but they dont care what i do now i saw that peacevoice waterman at the docks when my ship came in he was surprised i was a passenger and not crew but all he did was warn me to stay away from lordshills i didnt need that warning this time tras looked up at the olive tree sheltering them but you know maybe theres a way not with me tras whandall said next burning tras asked get your friends relatives everyone you know and take yanginatep to the lords thatll teach them teach somebody maybe whandall said but it wont be me for a moment whandall thought of life without the lords it would be vastly different better he couldnt know the tea was pleasant different from the hemp tea that pelzed served tras must have seen that whandall liked it because he ordered more he sipped carefully touch of hemp and sage he pronounced the bees must go to the hemp fields whandall looked puzzled tras asked dont you know where honey comes from whandall shook his head i guess loggers dont have honey tras mused bees make honey then beekeepers collect it worlds opened when tras spoke beekeepers would be kinless wouldnt they where did they keep the honey they had gathered did the bees protect them whandall asked and tras preetror knew other places a beekeeper negotiates with the queen he agrees to guard the hive or maybe he grows them a garden they like gold here the queens magic wont protect the hive from animals and gatherers i guess you can just take the honey but so can anyone else id guess some kinless has to guard the hives drive off bears hide the location from lordkin only i heard something what was it whandall was thirsty for knowledge he had not guessed how much he missed tras preetror he watched tras wrestle with his memory ddaggers the teps town gatherer bees have started growing poisoned daggers like little teeny blackandyellow lordkin tras said gleefully right your turn whandall had missed that too he told how he had been returned to the placehold and tended in the placehold nursery how he had moved into the tiny room upstairs lenorbas room they finally got her thirteen years late who i heard the tale when i was a little boy youve seen jispomnos played tras you know that what a man does with his woman is nobodys business but theirs even murder right a woman who kills her man doesnt see much hassle either maybe hes slapped her around and everyone knows it everyone sees the bruises but it wasnt like that with lenorba and johon johon of flower market moved in with her because she was a little crazy specially for sex then when he got tired of that she didnt she was with a lot of men one of em beat johon up johon went home and heat up lenorba then they talked and both said they were sorry and they went to bed she wore him out he went to sleep beside her and she killed him in his sleep then she ran home to the placehold she really seemed to think that all she needed was a bruise to show its not like that flower market let it be known that if they found lenorba outside the walls theyd kill her so she never left again wanshig told me the rest there werent enough women in the placehold to get us what we needed on mothers day unless they took lenorba they gave her a baby to hold gave her my little brother trig the men escorted the women to peacegiven square but they had to stop at the border and all the women went on afterward they found trig sitting on the dais right on stage sucking on a plum they never found lenorba the square was nearly deserted now wanshig came across the square to stand beside whandall he eyed tras preetror suspiciously we got the cart home safe wanshig said so i came back to look out for you last time you went with him you were a year healing more he added looking at the bright red circle of inflammation by whandalls left eye tras looked pained they let him come home he said i was two years buying my way off that ship wanshig sat without being invited you were on a ship yes where did you go condigeo tras laughed the long bloody way when we got back to condigeo i bought my way free but first we went north where wanshig asked lordship bay first they call it that because your lords have kin there or say they do then woodworker bay then around the cape to sugar rock north of that is great hawk buy one day i may go hack there host fish restaurant anywhere run by a burly merman called the lion then we went south but our wizard wasnt good enough a storm drove us past condigeo to black warrior bay whandall was surprised to see that wanshig was listening in fascination ive never even seen the harbor up close wanshig said so you went to sea and whandall got his arm broken i think you owe my brother pelzed says i owe him a roof pelzed knows youll never pay wanshig said this is different you owe whandall tras shrugged it may be but how do i pay it took nearly everything i had to buy myself away from the captain why did you come here whandall asked stories its a risk if i stay away too long ill forget the condigeano speech you know how languages change therell be slang i dont know what kind of teller would i be then so i stayed in condigeo long enough to learn but i had to come back its time for a burning and i cant miss the next one how long has it been six years do you feel the burning near wanshig said the next teller who asks that question dies whandall asked why is it so important they were mixing condigeano and common speech whandall was still the only lordkin who could do that wanshig wasnt able to follow much of what they were saying tras said the fewer tellers watch the burning the better a story it makes when the others go home thats when it pays me to be here but i wish your yanginatep would stir himself alferth and tarnisos started the last burning whandall told him shall i show them to you man those guys are weird wanshig said he shifted to an accent used mostly inside placehold and spoke too rapidly for tras to understand and you dont know where they are i can find them whandall said sure he looked at tras who was trying to understand what they were saying youre really not mad at him are you whandall shook his head not anymore well theyre over in flower market square how do you know that its where they hang out now theres a truce between flower market and serpents walk wanshig changed to common speech you want to talk to the lordkin who started the last burning give my brother five shells you can afford that some other time well talk about more alferth was a surly burly man near thirty there was a distorted look to his nose and ears whandall wasnt old enough to work out what had him so angry all the time but he could imagine what alferths meaty hand would feel like swung with that much weight behind it he had no urge to talk to alferth himself but he stayed close after pointing alferth out to tras preetror tras sat down at alferths table at the end of a meal set a flask between them and asked what was it like to be possessed by yanginatep alferth expanded under the lookers interest i felt an anger too big to hold back tarnisos screamed like a wyvern and charged into old weavers place and i charged after him we kicked him and his wifei never saw his kidswe took everything we could and then tarnisos set the place afire by then there were too many of us to count i had an armful of skirts for half a year i had a skirt for every woman who why weaver i think the old kinless refused tarnisos credit once tras asked why would yanginatep start with weaver alferths laughter was a bellow a roar whandall left with a gaping sense of loss a pain in the pit of his belly chapter when whandall was an infant morth of atlantis had brought water to the lords he must have been paid well now he kept a shop in what the lords called the benighted section far from the docks and the lordshills it was not right to be stalking the man who had killed pothefit during a gathering never remember a killing after the burning but morth was a knot of enigmas why would a wizard of power live in the benighted areas why would a lordkin of fourteen years age visit a magic shop whandall had better have an answer ready for that he blocked the path of a dumpy woman in straight street the kinless looked at him differently now he was near grownno longer cute not yet menacing while his knife was hiddenbut still she fished in her purse and gave him money probably not enough it didnt have to be he watched until the shop was empty of customers before he went in morth of atlantis was younger than he remembered from that night in lordshills against all reason whandall had somehow expected that it didnt even startle him that sparse hair white as salt was now sandy red but he was still an old man of dubious humanity tall and straight with dry brown skin and a flat belly and an open innocent face with a million wrinkles a little silly a little scary whandall asked can you cure pimples the magician peered close one quick straight thrust could have cut his throat but what spells protected him youve got worse than pimples lie touched the inflammation by whandalls eye his hands were surprising fingers widest at the tips thats ringworm itll never go away by itself thirty shells whandall cursed mildly and showed the five the woman had given him maybe later as you wish a kinless would have bargained lordkin didnt and maybe magicians didnt whandall asked youre from atlantis the mans face closed down im seshmarl of serpents walk whandall knew better than to give his true name to a magician savant our younger streetbrothers wonder about you if you dont want to be asked over and over how you escaped atlantis tell it only once im a good teller ill tell them are you morth smiled at him how could an old man have so many teeth tell me a story whandall hadnt expected this but without a stammer he said yanginatep was the god who brought the knowledge of fire to the world but zoosh beat him in a knife fight so men began to serve zoosh instead of tending fires for yanginatep lifetimes later only the lordkin still serve yanginatep when we came south from the ice yanginatep traveled with us have you heard the tale not from your view we werent finding enough wood until the lords showed us the way to the forest there we hunted during the day and built big fires at night in the forest yanginatep grew strong we cut and burned our way through and that was how we found teps town the kinless called it something else of course valley of smokes the magician said whandall was taken aback kinless called it that have you seen how red the sunsets are here or how hard it is to breathe after the burning something about the shape of the land or the pattern of winds keeps fog and smoke from blowing away it isnt your fire god something older a kinless god maybe during the burning and after mothers mothers breath rasped as if she were dying whandall nodded but the harbor is good hand for the look of curled fingers morth saw whandalls unspoken huh and added you have to see it from the air oh right from the air the magician had him totally off balance story he was in the middle of a story the kinless couldnt fight us because yanginatep was strong again so the kinless came to serve us they still wear the noose as we still hold their lives just its mothers mother had told the title to her grandchildren with no mention of alliance with the lords i never would have taken that for a noose morth said a strip of colored cloth around the neck hangs down the chest thats it ive walked along the woods many times where is this wide path your folk burned their way through north from here but its been lifetimes six lifetimes anyway maybe the trees grew back the magician nodded thats lordkin and kinless what of the lords we met them before we found the forest they showed us how to gather wood taught us about yanginatep and zoosh why would they know about yanginatep and zoosh i dont know the lords have not always been with us but they were with us when we took this land they spoke to the kinless they keep the kinless working but you are lordkin are you kin to the lords whandall shook his head ive asked that no one says different but no one says so either the magician smiled thinly i see so now you take what you want from the kinless and the lords gather from you no the lords gather from the kinless seldom from us they have their own lands and the harbor and the magician nodded all right you know the story of atlantis the land that sank a long way from here right on both a very large land mass a very long way from here and it sank because the swordsmen came whandall just looked at him i was wizard to the fishing folk human and mer i was blessing a new ship at the docks attic warships came into sight east of us hundreds the captain decided i could finish my spells while we sailed for safety i could have stayed and fought alongside the priests but it was too late did you know atlantis was going to sink yes and no something was coming sometime everyone knew that a thousand years ago priests of atlantis were already making spells to keep the land quiet the quakes were long postponed we didnt know they would come that day the attic soldiers must have reached the priests during the lifting of stone ceremony after sunset we saw waves like black mountains marching toward us our ship floated above the water but the waves below and the wind they took with them tossed our ship like a childs toy and you brought water to teps town wh yes yes that was me its a girl story ill tell you another time nobody but tras preetror did that traded information for information whandall smiled a mountain of ice had come from the end of the earth at morth s bidding scouring across lands belonging to the lords whandall would know if morth told the story right and morth had no way to know that whandall knew a long city block away tras preetror stepped out of a shadow to intercept him he wanted to talk about morth of atlantis did lordkin deal much with magicians with barbarians with magic other than their own peculiar fire magic what was whandall doing in morths shop anyway what was tras doing waiting for him here whandall didnt ask that he said morth is funny he trades what he knows for what you know like kinless trade shells for goods tras whats it like to sail on a trader tras offered strips of jerked meat i expect all magicians do that information is what they sell in a way what did you trade with him whandall ate yes tras but whats it like to sail on a trader i prefer not to be reminded of my experience whandall waved and turned away all right tras preetror looked at him hard its no fun as a deckhand its different as a passenger as a teller tellers do a lot of traveling we get over being seasick quick or we quit or travel on land instead whats seasick how to survive seasickness and how to survive a storm and what you ate at seait was different for passengers and crewand what youd better eat on land to get healthy again weather magic and how it could kill you tras was skilled at telling you never know how strong the magic is when youre on the ocean the mannayou understand manna whandall shook his head hed heard that word where on shandas balcony boy youre going to owe me manna is the power behind magic manna can be used up the man who learned that ranks with the woman who learned what makes babies at sea there are currents and manna moves with those a spell to summon wind might do nothing at all or raise a tempest to tear your ship apart there are water elementals and merfolk does morth know about this have you ever seen an old atlantis ship whandall shook his head and tras said the bottom has windows and hatches it floats above the water above the water above land too the most powerful did no longer i think and the ships they built in this last hundred years before atlantis sank theyre ship shaped if some ocean current swirls away the manna down conies the ship splash and then you dont want windows breaking below the water sure morth knows about manna likely he thinks its his most secret secret so whandall are you thinking of taking up sailing tras we never see the docks the water devils dont want anyone else there thats all thats stopping you whandall had seen ships but only from the top of wheezing hill hed be guessing well i cant see why a ships captain would let a lordkin on wouldnt it be dangerous what if a sail disappeared or that tube they look through or that big board at the back tras was laughing rudder damn right it would whandall you couldnt buy or beg your way aboard a boat and kinless cant either because most barbarians cant tell kinless from lordkin youll never learn enough to steal a ship and the dockside lordkin wont help you do that because theyd lose the trade such as it is do you think i could become a teller again whandall was subjected to intense scrutiny whandall i think you could youve got the knack already trading information with me like a kinless sweets merchant but anyplace these boats go they know about lordkin and you have the look youd never be welcomeanywhere whandall nodded trying to swallow his disappointment he said morth was blessing a new ship at the atlantis docks when chapter on a later day whandall returned to morth of atlantis he lurked a bit before he went in tras preetror seemed to be following him around and he didnt like that how could anyone lurk hide spy gather with a teller hovering at his elbow but tras wasnt about and whandall seshmarl went in and bought an acne cure for fourteen shells it was an evilsmelling cream altered by gestures it hurt when he rubbed it in but three days later the ringshaped inflammation was fading from his eye and his pimples were smaller too in a week his skin was clear except for the ringworm and that was smaller morth gave value for money he came again and asked about love potions morth wouldnt sell those he considered it wrong to tamper with anothers mind whandall nodded and pretended to find that sensible and wondered who the man thought he was befooling i could have used a love potion a time or two the wizard said can you guess how lonely its been for the last atlantis wizard in a town of no magic youre talking to a lordkin thats lonely yes come any time seshmarl even if you cant afford to buy wait now i can do tattoos morth said suddenly youre serpents walk would you like a serpent tattoo he waved at an elaborate golden feathered serpent somewhat faded displayed on one wall beautiful hed never find money for that i have a tattoo whandall said and gave morth a glimpse of the tiny serpent in the web of his thumb i havent asked for another yet month looked down at whandalls hand his brows furrowed hut he only looked up alter a moment and leaned close into whandalls face a tattoo would be painful over ringworm and look odd too but i see my cure is working yes whandall pointed at the feathered serpent and asked anyway how much for that where the ringworm was morth laughed id ask enough to put a new room on my house normally here where would i find a client seshmarlno wait morth took whandalls right hand the knife hand in both his hands bad manners he spread the fingers wide morth wasnt just staring at whandalls hand now he was pulling it toward the oil lamp above them astonished whandall let him do that light fell on his hand morth had an open face not used to hiding things but now whandall couldnt tell what he was thinking he said youre going to leave teps town why would i want to do that cant tell maybe you dont want to will you take a word from me morth was still studying reading whandalls hand never go near rivers or the ocean if you depart by land its likely your own idea but you might visit the docks and travel the rest of the world as an oarsman with a bump on his head or be carried in the bellies of a school of fish whandall had to clear his throat to speak we cant go to the docks anyway water devils dont like people from outside morth do you know your future no what can i give you to put that tattoo on my face yes seshmarl i have some errands for you and one day when you are fully healed and your um bandlord has given permission come to me the tattoo will be my gift there were days he came with no excuse but the whim to talk he would watch morth and his customers discuss their needs then morth would hand them something from under the counter or step to a shelf and mumble and wave or only stand watching for several seconds before snatching up some box or tiny flask as if avoiding invisible teeth and give it to the customer with elaborate instructions one could ask medicines for pain yes morth had those for wheezing shortness of breath morth sold a lot of that especially after the burning he bought herbs from loggers philosophers stone unicorns horn boy youve got to be joking magical cold torch spell of glamour invisibility levitation those didnt work here cither had a cook pot once that would cook without fire never knew what to do with it didnt use it because would wear it out i couldnt sell it because it wouldnt work very long finally it was stolen not that it will have done the thieves any good magic is weak in the valley of smokes well it would still be a pot seshmarl said true is it that way everywhere less so some places morths eyes went dreamy why here morth shrugged yanginatep magic is the life of a god its like you cant keep honey where there are ants atlantis had no god can you do prophecy seshmarl to know the future is to change it so that time wriggles like a manyheaded snake what you see is false because youve seen it even if there were magic enough how could i read the lines in my own hand we student wizards couldnt even read each others lines our fates were bound up together tangled morth shrugged as if great weight sat on his shoulders i read part of your fate because you might leave see time spreads ahead of us like this he reached above his head this fan your most likely future leads to places where magic still holds power traces of manna flow back through time to weave meaning into the lines on your hand im going to leave morth took his hand again and spread it in the lamp glow do you see its the pattern the lines make with the ambient magic anywhere in the world but here yes you still have the chance to leave and you should still stay clear of water except for bathing bathing whandall saw only his hand he asked morth why would a magician live where theres no magic morth smiled seshmarl thats not something id tell anyone morth had said that whandall would leave teps town in his present state that seemed desirable had he healed enough did he know enough he tried to beg money from resalet just suppose now suppose morth sells me a potion of easy breathing for mothers mother i might see where he takes it from if its where the pimple salve came from then thats the medicines and if hes lying about unicorns horn which is supposed to be priceless stay out of that magicians shop resalets finger stabbed whandalls chest you dont know what he can do read minds make you die in a month hes the man who killed your father i know that but does he stay away from morth of atlantis if he couldnt buy from morth was there anything morth might want from seshmarl he asked morth said i want to know more about the forest you buy your herbs from loggers ask them that is a very strange situation morth said lords tell the loggers where they can cut down trees i mean exactly where and which they dont log themselves whandall suggested maybe theyre hiding something in the forest yes and maybe they just like telling people how to live their lives morth took dried leaves from a jar here smell this do you know it does it grow there wait yes sage grows where the trees open out it doesnt kill and it smells great when you walk through it hey they use this for cooking at samortys house yes its good for that and other things what about this one whandall took the sheet of pale barkrubbed it sniffed it held it to daylight in the doorway i dont think so morth smiled willow bark i didnt think it grew around here what about this long leaves yes foxglove whandall said it can be valuable do you know of poppies he showed a faded flower i know where there are whole fields of them whandall said the loggers say they are dangerous he didnt add that he had been to the poppy fields and nothing happened they whiled away an afternoon morth was dubious he didnt want whandallseshmarlpicking plants that were not quite what he wanted that was dangerous bring me the whole plant or a whole branch when you can so ill know what i have morth sent him to where there were no loggers whandall didnt want to meet loggers anyway he was no child and hed be on their turf kinless or not they had axes and severs he sought morths plants in the old growth and found them rarely on his second foray he approached the lordshills from the forest side there was the blank wall back of lord samortys house the tree had been cut back and there were marks on the top of the wall where it had been repaired whandall watched the hill for a time no guards and if they chased him into the wood he would outrun them or lead them into lordkiss he hall ran half crawled within range of the wall then hurled what he was carrying he was in shadow when he heard the splash he didnt wait for more but a pine cone had splashed into the laundry pond and shanda would know of it she would know he was alive chapter morths plants were rare but they both understood that morth sought knowledge too he was using whandalls explorations to map the forest morth wasnt stingy with his rewards whandall collected medicines to ease pain and reduce a swelling and bring sleep foxglove leaves made a powder that would send a man into jittery mania just before a fight poppies yielded a brown gum that gave good dreams all of these lost their power if not used and often whandall had more than morth and placehold combined would need he began trading them for favors on the street morth always told how to use the powdered leaves sniff carefully never more than once a week and dont ever heat them first whandall was careful to do the same then one day he was summoned to pelzed pelzed was angry did you give duddigract some of your foxglove he demanded duddigract was one of pelzeds advisors a big man with a bad attitude always muttering about what hed like to do to the lords he was usually behind pelzed today he wasnt anywhere to be seen no lord we dont get along hes dead pelzed said some maze runners raiders came into the walk i sent duddigract to deal with them he turned to one of the men behind him renwilds tell it again yes lord duddigract saw the ma e runners five of hem there were only six of us but duddigract looked mean the ma e runners looked scared and i was sure theyd run if we gave them a chance we could chase them out theyd run theyd he gone with no blood shed and theyd drop anything they gathered started to say that to duddigract and i saw he had a leaf full of white stuff he took a big sniff of that then he stuffed a wad of brown gum in his mouth and chewed then he took another big sniff from the leaf we tried to say something but he just grinned said it would be a shame to waste it now he was ready to fight pelzed looked to whandall you know what hes talking about pelzed said yes lord i always tell people how dangerous the white foxglove powder is the brown gum is safe enough that just puts you to sleep but the white is dangerous what does the white do pelzed demanded lord i dont know i just know thats what morth of atlantis tells his customers he never sells them more than a pinch or two of white and he makes them sniff it there in the shop he wont sell them any more until its been a week or more brown hell sell any time but not white say more renwilds pelzed ordered id say that magician knows what hes talking about renwilds said duddigract sniffed that stuff and got a big grin and all of a sudden he was a wild man he took out his knife and before any of us could say anything he was all over the maze runners they were ready to talk you know brag a little before they ran and we were all set to brag back and theres duddigract with his knife out he cut down two with no warning they didnt even get to draw by then the others had their knives out and one of them cut duddigract and lord it was like he didnt even feel it duddigract yelled but it wasnt like he was hurt it was like the burning had come we were sure yanginatep had him but duddigract didnt want to burn anything he just wanted to kill he killed another maze runner and the others dropped everything and ran they were really scared but so were we lord when the maze runners ran duddigract looked at us like he didnt know us pelzed nodded grimly go on renwilds shrugged it was that powder lord it summons invisible monsters uh huh why didnt you chase the maze runners too fast lord and wed have had to get around duddigract so we were trying to figure what to do when duddigract screamed again and fell down babbling about how monsters were after him and he curled up like he was going to sleep only he never woke up where did he get it pelzed demanded he wouldnt tell us lord said hed gathered it but he wouldnt say where pelzed turned to whandall well whandall told what he knew lord about a week ago some black lotus warriors caught me near the east border there were too many to fight so i let them gather a bag of powders i was taking to morth maybe there was enough in there to do that to duddigract or maybe they mixed the powders but i dont know how they got from black lotus to duddigract you didnt tell me they gathered anything whandall just that theyd chased you i was embarrassed lord pelzed nodded thoughtfully i sent duddigract to look into it he said he must have caught up with the lotus warriors and he never told me never told me pelzed grew visibly angry but not with whandall its his own fault then pelzed said but whandall be careful with those powders i will lord but there were always more powders and friends were always ready to accept them there was so much he could buy with foxglove but some liked the stuff too much one day three followed him home resalet came out with two uncles and chased them away that evening whandall was summoned to resalets big northeast room on the second floor resalet eyed him critically dargramnet says youre smart resalet said or used to say it whandall nodded it had been a year since mothers mother had recognized whandall when she saw him now she sat by the window and talked of old days and old times to anyone who would listen the stories were interesting but she told the same ones over and over so if youre smart why are you acting like a fool whandall thought for a moment then took a handful of shells from his pouch and laid them on resalets table yes bigger fools than you will pay resalet said and if they think you keep that stuff here theyll come to take it well have to fight well lose people therell be blood money the lords may get involved we cant fight lordsmen lords dont care about hemp whandall said they keep hemp gum in ebony boxes dont show off for me boy resalet said i know youve been to lordshills and look what it got you you came in heat up and useless u lot more trouble than you were worth hadnt been that dargramnet likes you wed have thrown you out to the coyotes i dont know what the lords do at home but down here hemp trouble gets you lordsmen enough lordsmen and they tear your house down this is placehold weve had placehold longer than ive been alive and were not going to lose it because of you whandall tried to change the subject the bull fizzles sell hemp pelzed serves hemp tea pelzed is damn careful with his tea resalet said and since when did serpents walk learn from bull pizzle he shook his fists violently and i dont care if serpents walk sells hemp were placehold whandall if you want to trade powders do it somewhere else get your own house placehold doesnt want the trouble do you understand me pelzed offered me a house in dark mans cup whandall said should i take it if you like whandall was startled to realize that resalet meant it up to then it was just a boy talking to adults but resalet meant it he really could be thrown out of placehold he thought about living alone it might be fun but the other boys his age who moved out of their households to live alone were mostly dead coscartin wasnt dead coscartin had half a dozen other young men living with him and that many women and some kind of arrangement with pelzed the stuff he dealt in was supposed to come from the water devils id rather stay here then give up the powder resalet said give it up right out loud give away all your stock make sure everyone knows you wont have more but why because i tell you yes i understood that whandall said i meanwhat do i tell them resalet chuckled with the first sign of amusement since whandall had come into his room tell them you had a vision from yanginatep no one will believe that then tell them anything you want but you bring more of that stuff here youre going out they told stories about whandalls party for years he brought out everything white powders and yellow foxglove leaves and brown gum he parceled it out with care wanshig found some hemp tras preetror wrote two songs and told stories but us the night went on his speech became an endless stream of babbling shealos managed to finesse three times his share of the brown poppy gum whandall let him do it he was a noisy whiner when thwarted shealos went to sleep in a corner where the forigaft brothers must have found him no one was seriously hurt there would never be another party like it but it left ripples two young lordkin ended up in the river unhurt but stinking three girls became pregnant shealos didnt wake until sunset the next day in the middle of an intersection stripped naked and painted with the wrong band signs and a short written message a blank wall in the kinless house whandall had taken over for the party bore more words written inside a pattern made from ten local band signs kind of pretty really but any band would take it as a killing insult more messages were found scrawled in bright red paint on the long wall around dead town on the day after whandalls party dead town was where folk were buried if no family claimed them nobody painted band signs in dead town all factions were welcome there pelzed was asked to summon the forigaft brothers these four brothers had somehow learned to read it made them arrogant the brothers painted messages on any clean surface you couldnt tell what they said not even by asking one of them because they would lie the night of whandalls party they must have gone crazy on the powders whandall remembered their antics howling and gymnastics and wait now hed seen them doing that to his wall and hed laughed like a loon he didnt remember seeing them leave the brothers were scattered about serpents walk and peacegiven square they were easy to spot they mumbled to themselves they shouted foul and cryptic threats and accusations into the faces of passersby two brothers tried to write something on renwildss burly belly using yellow paint and their fingers renwilds let them finish then knocked them both senseless they were all crazy as loons pelzed fed them for two weeks then somehow traded them to the wolverines who lived below granite knob for a wagonload of oranges whandall copied some of their marks off a wall and brought them to morth i was not lordkin zincfinder tattooed my corpse morth read search the sand at sea cliffs for the treasure i died for she hid my knife he looked up your dead town must have its share of murder victims when your mad readers were spraying the graveyard the ghosts wrote messages on their minds justice carries its own manna sometimes whandall regretted his decision he could have been living in a household of sycophants and women like coscartin coscartin and all his household were killed by rivals unknown half a year after whandalls party chapter when wanshig reached fifteen he began working with alferth alferth was a tax taker which gave him avenues into kinless commerce one afternoon wanshig pulled whandall away from his friends back to the courtyard of the placehold house taste this wanshig said just a sip it was a small clay flask the fluid inside had a fire in it whandall almost choked what wine oh i know about wine that made wanshig laugh well youre clever in spots little brother and you know how to keep your mouth shut can you think of a way to make the kinless bring this stuff in to sell they shared the bottle unequally outside teps town there are taverns wanshig said how do you know this tellers wanshig said and do you remember marila she was a water devil and she listened at home stories of other lands and of the docks and what are these taverns whandall asked wanshig smiled dreamily gathering places for men or even men and women together to drink wine be together with friends celebrate there are wine shops everywhere but here why not teps town but wine was doing a slow burn inside whandall yanginateps fire he pronounced magic yeah wine felt good whee whandall thought and he felt words bubbling to his partly numb lips resalet ran away he thought he left my father to die things he didnt want to say to any placeholder ever lordkin dont work for anyone shig said i dont work for alferth i work with him hed said it out loud whandall slapped his hand across his mouth he tried to say no little brother you have to work with otherwise youre all alone wanshig said sometimes its hard to tell which is which it runs the other way too some lordkin work some kinless take things said what kinless loses his work what can he do got to have food blanket shoes he gathers them wed kill him surehe doesnt have the rightbut why would anyone catch him somethings missing nobody asks who gathered it never mind that little brother why dont the kinless keep wine shops wine shops if it feels this good whandall gestured widely wanshig ducked someone wants wine just smash in the door if its too strong go for help if the winetender tries we beat on him kill him maybe kinless would be crazy to keep this stuff around taverns then make them sell drinks one at a time whandall with wine buzzing in his ears and his blood could feel what was wrong with that kinless and barbarians might drink wine and keep their selfcontrol in the burning city men would drink then unguarded words would bubble through their lips and they would fight no tavern would survive shig said the most we ever get here someone pops up on a street corner with maybe eight of these little flasks when theyre gone hes gone hes not there long enough to be robbed wheres he get it the flasker lords and kinless get some wine through the docks from torov and condigeo if the rest of us find out we take it of course so they give some to the water devils and theres another place they wobbled as they stood and wanshig led him north whandalls head cleared quickly the wine was gone there hadnt been much just enough for two the houses north of teps town ended at the forest wanshig led off northwestward whandall was sober now and full of questions but wanshig only smiled here the forest withdrew from the city leaving a delta of meadow the wedge with a slow stream the deerpiss meandering down its center whandall had known of the wedge all his life and only began to wonder as wanshig led him up the stream why hadnt the meadow filled with houses where the wedge converged to a point a twostory stone house straddled the stream like a blockage in a funnel on either side the road would be wide enough for wagons but gates blocked both sides two men emerged from a secondstory door one started down the ladder whandall had seen lordsmens armor and lumbermens leathers both men wore what lumbermen would wear like what the boy whandall himself had worn both men were masked in what might have been lumbermens leathers but were not wanshig ran at the rightward gate whandall followed at speed wanshig climbed the gate like a monkey with whandall right behind him lordkin didnt ask permission they went where they would the two armored men scrambled to the ground and lifted weapons they carried not quite severs hafts ended in straight blades sharpened on both sides whandall didnt hear what words wanshig spoke but the men stepped aside glancing incuriously at whandall as he dropped to the ground they were climbing back up as wanshig led off along the stream the forest had closed in at the banks now out of earshot whandall asked what was that place guardhouse wanshig said after our fathers took teps town we made the kinless build that across our path the path is gone but the toronexti are still here they let anyone through but they take part of what theyre carrying its custom these days they guard something else too the path i could tell morth he bit it off eons late was it the wine this long after i have to see him shig dont worry i wont do anything stupid wanshig seemed unsurprised how did he kill pothefit i havent asked yet dont ask but find out where the stream bent to the right wanshig walked straight into the forest the tall straight spikes must be young redwoods mature redwoods had been felled here huge stumps remained wanshig led them a careful crooked path around morningstar plants nettles spear grass redandgreen clumps of touchme whandall was ready to snatch him to safety but his older brother had learned theyd traveled a couple of hundred paces before the trees opened out here were croplands a wide expanse of vines planted in straight rows kinless men and women were at work there were lordkin about too wanshig and whandall watched from their bellies wanshig said the lords get some of their wine here but of course they need somebody to protect it thats where alferth comes in he got the toronexti to do it he leaves them half what kind of half he cheats a little they cheat a little wanshig began creeping backward i wanted you to know if youve got any ideas do we really want more wine in teps town we do if its ours but wine makes us kill whandall thought and mostly we kill each other lords drink wine without problems kinless can handle it we teach kinless to control themselves barbarians learn or die with us though he said what we were drinking did it come from here right said wanshig what the lookers give us is it better smoother its not the best i bet wanshig glared and whandall said lookers know we dont know the difference so they buy cheap some barbarian somewhere knows how to make better than weve got we should find him and talk him into working for us wanshig shrugged his eyebrows talk barbarians brought in wealth the lords would spit fire if a barbarian was kidnapped alferth wouldnt dare but better wine would be better for the city than more wine whandall thought chapter resalet had told him to avoid the magician and give up all his plants and powders whandall hadnt seen morth in just under a year the boy seshmarl had grown older had he come to look too dangerous two kinless customers looked at him nervously the magician flickered a smile at him then finished serving them when they had left the magician said seshmarl tell me a story information for information if you follow the deerpiss north out of the city you get to a meadow then a guardhouse with masked and armored men theyll take some of what youre carrying what theyre guarding is the old path where my people cut their way through the forest to the valley of smokes but dont go there right just look you have been busy morth said whandall smiled is the path still open i dont think so what if i want to leave teps town the docks i cant go near the sea i tried going south once but its all marshes i dont know anything about that nobody goes that way seshmarl the forest not through the forest been two hundred years the woods grow back theres poison plants and lordkiss and morningstars and hemp and foxglove he didnt intend to speak of the vineyard curse and a guardhouse too you face them youd better have a story but dont you have some spell for finding paths the magician didnt answer he told a story instead the fire god lost many battles sydon drowned his worshippers in atlantis zoosh used the lightning against him in attica and is said to hold him in torment wotan and the ice giants battled him in the north and again they torment him still in many places the firebringer bears a great wound in his side here too i think your people must have fled zooshs people you lordkin may well be the last worshippers of yanginatep yanginatep gave us everything heat cooking burning cities we dont burn the whole city morth only tellers say that at any burning we lose resale says three or four hands of buildings its still crazy whandall said even a wizard might want to avoid yanginateps anger morth smiled indulgently yanginatep is near myth his life uses the magical strength that would give my spells force but theres little of that to start with in these days magic works poorly everywhere yanginatep does not stir i would sense him can you predict the burnings tras preetror would pay well for that information sometimes morth said mysteriously he couldnt but he knew when yanginatep would wake he had to why did you want to know about the forest i want to get out morth said i cant go near the sea hed said whandall took a wild guess will the ice chase you morth swallowed a laugh it looked like a hiccup what do you know of that you brought a mountain of ice once i wondered how but if ice would chase you the lords would pay well so its not ice waves saltwater you know a lot morth said no longer amused the wizard took whandalls hand again stared and nodded you have destinies most have only one but you have choices one choice may lead to glory be ready now tell me about the path through the forest whandall persisted why do you want to leave is it the elemental he still didnt know what the word meant last month i hired a wagon to take me to the harbor id heard nothing of a water sprite in many years as crossed the last hill a single wave rose and came toward me the sprite is still out there in the harbor does yanginatep protect you then in a manner of speaking yes seshmarl the fire god wont permit a water sprite here id heard about the burning city all my life but i never wanted to live here few do seshmarl i came to hide the lookers come oh yes tellers have made this city famous fools used to visit every spring to see the burning i suppose the lookers bring money that helps pay the cost of rebuilding to me it all seems quite crazy but it does make your city safer whandall swallowed his anger a lordkin should have guile never remember a killing after the burning yanginatep protects us most of the time fires dont burn indoors not here are there other cities where fires cant start by accident oh magic can protect a building morth said and i know a spell to douse a fire that works even in teps town the lords cook indoors whandall said and they lit torches in the big room after dark not just candles torches morth said nothing it had been dry in teps town for two years you brought water once a water elemental chased me embodied in an iceberg from the southernmost end of the earth it hunted me to kill me seshmarl when things move they want to keep on moving morth said the bigger and heavier it is the harder it is to stop the iceberg was the biggest and heaviest thing that ever came here what stopped it yanginatep whandall realized suddenly you used yanginatep to turn that curse to an advantage destinies morth muttered to himself yes seshmarl thats a lot of what magic is understanding how things work and turning them to your advantage i let it chase me until there was no manna to move the iceberg farther but you cant do it again the elemental wont do it again morth said it would have to go far away to find ice it wont go that far from me the magician looked out the window but he wasnt seeing the street outside this tale is not one to be told seshmarl it might reach the lords and that was valuable information whandall thought though he didnt know how to use it my teacher says i can have a tattoo now he said diffidently my brother wanted to do it but i said knew an artist for a breath he wasnt sure morth had heard then the magician said wonderful and wheeled around the same the winged serpent of atlantis let me show you he took a box from a shelf and reached inside he unwrapped a fine cloth and let it hang from his fingers it was a scarf in gold and scarlet and blue here do you like it oh yes the scarf was new it was far finer than the faded painting hed once seen on morths wall which had disappeared sometime in the past year whandall couldnt take his eyes off the serpent in flight it sported a crest of feathers and little feathered wings on either side of its neck like no serpent hed ever heard of the colors blazed but it was big it would cover his face and shoulder and half his arm whandall remembered getting his thumb tattooed if it wont how much does it hurt hurt no here sit he settled whandall crosslegged on a rug morth spread the scarf over the box and moved whandalls arm until the scarf was under his upper arm and shoulder the lines and colors of the scarf lifted and crawled along his skin whandalls eyes tried to cross he felt a stirring as if a snake were settling on his arm squeezing sliding up his shoulder his neck his face there was no pain no swelling no blood he hid out for a night and a morning i stayed the night i didnt want to face anyone it just hurt too much he told resalet resalets eyes were popping he stripped off his tunic in one angry maneuver and moved against whandall arm to arm to compare his own faded blue snake fifteen years old to whandalls fourcolor godthing he cursed its wonderful how can i get one ill ask ask who is it morth again whandall admitted it resalet said tell me all about it whandall thought it prudent to describe nearunbearable pain as if a snakes fangs had sunk into him i dont care if it hurts it just floated off the scarf and crawled up your shoulder did he say anything gesture picked it up put it down shall i ask if i can bring a mmm an uncle it might cost a lot no dont bother does he know who you are seshmarl of serpents walk he had to know that much you he careful with morth of atlantis whandall no more powders no more hemp whandall went back on another day and waited until the shop was empty before he entered hed gathered a wine flask and he set it on the counter they sipped it together then whandall asked is this magical morth laughed no its not very good either but theres not enough here to hurt us can you tell me any more about how a man might leave teps town whandall shook his head but i know of a safe place most of the city is afraid of the black pit morth was astonished how did you come to know that ive slept near the black pit nobody bothers you there and the monsters cant touch you morth nodded if there was manna about theyd be dangerous enough the cats of isis the hounds of hell the birds of wotan some tremendous war beasts they all died by thousands of thousands in a war of gods only a tiny fraction wound up in the tar gods themselves went myth in that last battle he said morth tell me again about the iceberg morth looked thoughtful you know the story yes but i dont understand it all magic doesnt work here but you make it work and should i tell you morth said half to himself let me see your hand again he studied whandalls palm then the magician sipped wine and settled himself to tell the story the wells of atlantis dried up ages ago we were too many for the rivers to support and nobody likes rain for a thousand years the people of atlantis drew their water from the end of the world atlantis magic has ruled water for as long as we can remember we sendsentwater sprites south to fetch icebergs and bring them to be melted for our water when morth considered then went on when i left atlantis instead of staying to fight an iceberg was in sight of the harbor the priests commanded the water sprite to hunt me down and kill me i crossed an ocean and a continent and i reached the coast with a mountain of ice chasing me at great hawk bay the mers at lions attic told me about teps town i was almost here before my ship sank down in the desert i knew the elemental could get this far i could hope it couldnt get any farther not in the fire gods domain to the lords i swore i could bring an iceberg to that dry lake they call the reservoir now in the lordhills yanginatep had power there in those days i told the lords to pay me on delivery and i hoped that yanginatep had the power to stop the ice whandall nodded then sipped the last hallswallow of wine that amused morth dont you wonder how i knew theyd pay never occurred to you lordkin two or three lords were very irritated that cursed sprite took a mountain of ice across land they owned whandall nodded samortys turf chanthors now morth looked surprised you knew that much how did you make them pay i led them to wonder what their houses would look like if another iceberg crossed blawind hills what about the water thing melted no the damned elemental is waiting offshore i cant ever go near water but i spent the lords money long ago and i cant pull that stunt again are you afraid of the burning oh no ill sense when yanginatep rises i can see that much there will be one maybe two small burnings then a big one morth said then ill get out i never want to see that again whandall wondered if morth wasnt whistling through dead town not seshmarls problem he said the toronextithe tax guardswill take almost everything you own perhaps they wont see it all morth said were you here last time when my father died yes the alien face turned haggard i could have been killed there was nothing nothing to tell me that yanginatep was awake not even after i saw smoke and fire pluming up i went home to keep my house from burning that night i went back to the shop stupid thievesgatherershad already stripped it bare i was looking around and planning how to rebuild when more gatherers came in and saw me his mouth was very dry whandall asked what happened i used a calming spell what belligerent and guilty morth said its simple magic so simple it even works here it takes the anger out of a man and puts out fires too ive used it before it isnt as if i wanted to hurt them i threw a calming spell at the big one when he came at me with that knife he went down like u handful of sticks the others screamed and ran away dead dead and cold i pulled him outside and left him a barbarian pulling a dead man by the ankles and nobody paid any attention seshmarl does yanginatep really possess people i think so shouldnt a wizard know that thug was all anger all fire yanginatep must have had him and when i sucked the anger out of him i think his life came with it morth looked up the burning what did you see i was only seven did you feel yanginatep ive sometimes wondered what thats like no maybe next time four kinless came in then whandall sensed their unease and left and maybe yanginatep heard morths insults sluggishly in his coma part three the burnings chapter for three years rain had been sparse even the trees with their deep roots showed the dryness the reservoirs went dry some said that the fountains in the lordshills were still running others said they werent and no one really knew a few kinless purchased rain weather wizards were rarely successful hut some sold the names of their clients kinless who had money to throw away there were beatings and robberies leaving less to be spent on weather wizards the deerpiss became a trickle then dried up wells went dry the lords sent out a decree that water must be used only for drinking and washing the kinless agreed and demanded even stricter rationing lordkin didnt listen to such stuff they used water to cool themselves and their homes until even drinking water was a trickle and there would be none to douse fires it was a dry season without water and that might have been what wakened the fire god twelve days after morth belittled him whandall alone wasnt big enough to get water when bigger men were thirsty that morning wanshig and whandall escorted the women and younger children across the central city to a working well resalet stayed in with a hangover the other placehold men were not to be found elriss was new she stayed at the periphery helping to keep the older women in place and moving wanshig hovered close to her hed brought elriss home twenty days past and she had his heart and mind mothers mother hadnt been outside the walls in many years whandall heard her muttering at everything she saw the dirt bud manners among the lordkin sullen faces among the kinless at least thirty kinless were using the well at the sight of the approaching lordkin family they drifted away in little clumps the bucket brought up a scant mouthful the kinless had taken it all and that alone might have started the burning but whandall waiting for his turn to scoop up a handful of water for mothers mother smelled smoke on the windless air too early for a cook fire stay together wanshig snapped get the women and children home the burning had begun they had to go out of their way several times fire was just catching in the messageservice offices kinless were trying to get the horses out others were fighting the fire with wet blankets the kinless fire wagon had just come when half a dozen lordkin waded into the kinless with curses and long knives firefighters fell bleeding others ran one lordkin sat on a kinless mans head and beat on his chest with a rock another came over and kicked the kinless man and laughed mothers mother was leaning on mother gasping monsters we never killed we only burned we never killed mother and whandall led her rapidly away from the scene whandall looked at wanshig and didnt ask is it true or is she crazy maybe men didnt tell women everything even then wanshig said quietly it was peaceful on angle street where the land humped a bit to hide the smoke southward faces turned curiously toward a crowd of women with only two men for escort and wanshig whispered relax stroll just another dull morning okay and whandall tried to feel that take it easy nod at mothers mothers ranting and hope nobody hears elriss looks like she needs any strong mans help but mothers taking care of that easing her back where she doesnt show tras preetror the teller hailed him whandall what are you doing dont you know whats happening wave at tras preetror smile walk toward him hello tras breezy a little bewildered what are you talking about tras made no effort to hide his delight oh guarding the women good idea but why arenthe waved about him voice risingthey doing something isnt the bur whandall slammed a quick punch at preetrors heart shut off his breath tras was expecting it he dodged and turned sloughed the blow backed out of reach isnt the burning supposed to happen all at once do you feel yanginatep do you feel the rage a tellers task isnt to keep the peace all these years whandall had known tras preetror without ever quite grasping that truth too late now angle street had heard his message lordkin were disappearing into shops kinless were fleeing converging into a pack tras joined them bubbling with news wanshig had whandalls arm move out whandall through there you lead ill trail elriss follow whandall another street pelzed passed with nine serpents walk men whandall wanshig pelzed shouted were going to lords town come with us whandall waved to indicate the women astonishingly pelzed nodded calmly as if he understood the need we cant wait he said and gestured his serpents walk warriors toward sanvin street youll miss the best then they were gone and the smell of smoke was thicker yet three crossstreets later the burning had arrived before them a handful of lookers confronted a pudgy lordkin in his forties did he need help no the barbarians were merely bewildered and the dirty bird was shouting into their faces while his arms described expansive circles its free take itits all ours joyfully he tried to lead them into a shoemakers shop where a score of gatherers were already seated on the dirt floor passing shoes back and forth trying to find something to fit the party atmosphere called to whandall but wanshig steered the placehold women around that scene too and finally home and upstairs to the more defensible second floor placehold had stone walls the floors would burn but they were thick wood and it would take determined effort to get them blazing no one in the past had ever taken the time the women were as safe as they would ever be and whandall asked now yes o eager one whandall was halfway down the stairs all the fine loot would be gone wanshig shouted down at him wait where are the rest of us whandall stopped himself with an effort there was a surging in his blood and a heat in his loins both were familiar but they had never been this strong the whandall who once sat on mothers mothers lap and listened to stories of a better time watched the rest of himself losing control and whispered its disapproval where are they wanshig demanded resalet shastern the other men the boys gathering whandall i thought resalet would wait wanshig clambered down after him hes gone all the men are gone shig theyre just out gathering and partying with everyone else resalet has been talking about morth of atlantis wanshig said he looked up the stairs to see elriss staring down at him come back elriss said i think they went to morths shop wanshig said with an effort he turned away from elriss and followed whandall outside i think they went as soon as the fires started what would he want there whandall demanded powders hemp wanshig said resalet hates that stuff wanshig laughed resalets afraid of morth whandall said what about never remember a killing after the burning they were back in the street where the granary had been the new restaurant was burning a hardluck site eastward a shouting match over who had first claim to an ornate desk was about to turn violent while someone disappeared with the matching chair wanshig looked back to the placehold wholl watch the women he demanded someone has to stay he looked at whandall and saw almost uncontrolled eagerness and i know i know it wont be you little brother a kinless hurried past pulling a cart help me the kinless shouted a dozen youths serpents walk flower market bull fizzle all mixed together ran after him shouting and laughing the cart overturned almost at wanshigs feet and the kinless merchant ran on unencumbered rings with red stones spilled out of the wreckage and wanshig scooped up several he handed one to whandall ours a bull fizzle shouted but he was laughing he saw whandalls elaborate tattoo looked up to the walls to see the serpents walk signs and eyed whandall nervously no one moved for a moment then the bull fizzle laughed again and dove into the mob at the cart they tore the cart apart and left in a bunch carrying dresses and trousers and a coil of rope there was smoke to the west wanshig turned that way hurrying whandall youve been spying on morth is there anything our fathers should know about him anything that might hurt them that was why hed gone to morth wasnt it months ago whandall thought he remembered other reasons morth was nearly a friend but those memories conflicted with the fire in his veins whandall said he told me about the spell that killed pothefit he wont use that again but you dont exactly ask a magician please tell me what you use to stop lordkin from taking things then what exactly do you ask him i watch i listen shig some things he just picks up and sells other things he waves his hands or mutters under his breath some of those its never the same twice so maybe hes bluffing i cant tell you what to lake he stopped remembering shig i dont think morth will be there at all he lives at the shop hell be afraid he didnt mean to hurt pothefit they were jogging now moving wide around gatherers staggering under loads of valuables or trash whandall stopped suddenly men his own age were gathering a kinless woman it looked like fun more he knew her dreamlotus innkeep of the western edge four years his elder and very lovely hed never quite worked up the nerve to approach her to learn if she would have the love of a young lordkin and now he need not ask wanshig tried to pull him away whandall resisted come on shig no elriss would kill me he looked into whandalls face and gave up ill go on ahead maybe i can get them to hold up his grip closed like a vise on whandalls arm you follow me yes you dont stop again yes shig yes chapter he was ready to follow shig pulling his clothing on checking his own belongings trading jokes with the others happywhen he saw that the man now on top of dreamlotus was strangling her before the sight had quite registered whandalls knife was out and moving in a downward arc neatly precisely he sliced the mans left ear off the man bellowed his rutting urge had his lower body in thrall but his head and shoulders tried to turn tried to reach his belt and knife the man who held dreamlotuss wrists had only begun to react horrified at the strangling or horrified at whandalls meddling no way to tell someone else bellowed and snatched at him whandall rolled across the stranglers back notched his other ear then ran slashing backhand at his nose and unexpectedly nicking the tip and upper lip the strangler let go of dreamlotuss throat and stood up dreamlotus sucked air in a whistling shriek while whandall ran hed once heard a man say that strangling a woman would make her react that it was a greater kick hed thought that was disgusting he thought so now there were too many following him to stop and make a stand skill was no use here run the strangler himself was in the lead legs pumping hard barefoot to the hips big guy and scarred under a tattooed orchid but the knife so quick maybe he could have talked persuaded the man to what nobody plays at sweet reason during a burning through here rigmasters ropewalk was a long building with no windows but plenty of hemp in storage it had started to burn maybe the strangler would step on a live coal whandall caught a lungful of smoke realized his mistake and swerved away rightward around the pall of pale smoke then hard left someone ran out of the building a kinless carrying a bundle he saw whandall screamed and ran hard still carrying what looked like carved wooden blocks theyd have burned but what were they if whandall werent running for his life hed have found out when yanginatep possessed a man was this what he felt it didnt feel divine for that moment hed felt so wonderful hed been so grateful to dreamlotus then someone was hurting her and the chance to rescue her was all he could have desired it felt very natural to cut the strangler and not at all divine feet pounding hard whandall completed his arc around the cloud of hemp smoke the strangler was a trace of shadow and yes he was cutting across through the rope factory itself there were other shadows in there the stranglers friends maybe theyd all chase whandall and let dreamlotus go maybe the strangler would outrun the rest use all his strength catching up to die under whandalls knife would dreamlotus be pleased grateful for such a gift maybe not they were squeamish the kinless and after all whandall too had raped her behind whandall the strangler ran out of the burning structure choking and half blinded and reeling with the effects of hemp smoke he slowed hearing the laughter that followed him he looked down realized his nakedness and began to laugh despite the blood that flowed from nose and ears those behind him staggered about in a giggling fit they collapsed in laughter as more of the hemp smoke blew past them whandall slowed too to laugh and gesture then ran on which way was morth of atlantis as the danger faded whandall remembered his thirst water was what he would be gathering if he dared stop what would resalet expect to find in morths shop of all places wanshig must be wrong but whandall kept running because he knew in his gut that wanshig was right as he ran his mind caught up the scarf resalet thought he could gather a tattoo from morth of atlantis tras preetror was interviewing a handful of gatherers in sildas handmeals the gatherers were preening proud that their lives would be made legend in lands theyd never see that son of a dog had helped to spread the burning beyond its reasonable bounds if whandall could catch tras alone you dont stop again whandall didnt stop his head was clearing he should be nearing morths shop morths defenses might have preserved himhut might also he used up by now random looters wouldnt know what was sale to take he hoped his brothers and uncles had waited he should have come sooner some landmarks were missing the belfry the houses of teaching the tallest structures must have made the best torches that glare of light and heat to his left woods lumberyard lordkin had piled beams into a tent shape to burn better just beyond it morths shop matters were not as he expected buildings around the site were burned charred but the shop of morth of atlantis was a flat circle of gray ash whandall felt a fist closing in his chest nothing had survived those were bones skulls five skulls maybe morth was among them maybe whandalls family was avenged maybe morth had bent the gods exuberant rage to his own will to punish looters whandall wouldnt know until he reached home he couldnt make himself hurry he couldnt go straight home the stranglers flower market streetbrothers hadnt had time to forget whandalls face he saw a whooping lordkin drop a howling dog into a well to die that struck him as stupid but there were four lordkin and they were big he left them alone he found clumps of kinless holding off jeering lordkin with makeshift weapons and he left them alone too in the back of his mind he could see himself and his kin and in truth the whole thing was beginning to look stupid others might have thought so whandall saw more of caution than of yanginateps manic joy the burning was ending though coals still burned the family cook pot had been stolen from the courtyard the men hadnt come home they never came home even wanshig had disappeared whandall at fifteen was the oldest man in the placehold chapter the men were goneand mothers mother never showed surprise shed lived in a world of her own for years she came back to reality long enough to organize the household the women took her orders perhaps because they were terrified she took time to hold whandall as she might have held a small child youre the oldest now she said keep the placehold ive always been proud of you you saved your brothers before now you have to do it again keep the placehold it was as if she had waited half her life for this now tasks done she slipped away back to some pleasant place that no one else could see elriss was pregnant she wept for wanshig and stayed in the womens rooms mother was more practical in the first light of the morning after the burning she found whandall i have to leave why he asked they had never been very close with a new baby every year she had little time for him even though too many died hed spent more time with mothers mother will you be back ill come back if i can mother said elriss will take care of the youngest you and shastern can take care of yourselves whandall theres no food and no water we need you to get food from the lords whandall said elriss and wess and motherthrees enough the lords wont give any more than three can gather mother said she lilted her carpet bag ill be back it can come back but where will you be she didnt answer whandall watched her go down the stairs there she joined two other placehold women women who had both left babies in the placeholds care he watched them make their wary way out into the street out into the burning and wondered if hed ever see mother again three hours after first light shastern and five younger boys came in pulling a cart each had an armful of stuff clothing enough rope to trade for a big cook pot if they could find someone whod trade there was a small cook pot in the cart there was food amid the junk but some of it was spoiled and the rest would have to be eaten in a hurry they traded whooping memories of the burning one by one they turned serious when they saw there were no men the younger boys gathered around whandall in the big room on the second floor girls came out to join them they all stared at whandall placehold shastern demanded where are the men gone whandall said he didnt tell them what he suspected that all including wanshig had been blasted by morth of atlantis was there anything he could have done if hed stayed with wanshig would all the men have lived but theyll be back shastern said theyre just he saw whandalls face what do we do shastern asked when the word gets out therell be men come to gather the placehold what do we eat rubyflower asked her tenyearold eyes were as big as dinner plates how much food do we have whandall asked rubyflower shook her head i dont know a week before mothers day we usually have more in the pantry than we have now and its two weeks to mothers day whandall mused have you heard anything about mothers day will the lords come will they bring the gifts no one knew whandall sent ilthern to find out dont talk whandall said just listen see what theyre saying in peacegiven square listen to the lordsmen and their clerks maybe theyll say something it wont matter rubyflower said if they had mothers day tomorrow wed never get the cart back from peacegiven square someone would gather everything the little girl was right whandall thought only four men in the placehold carried knives only two wore tattoos placehold itself might be defended by barricading the stairs it wouldnt burn the burning was already lading bring up rocks whandall told rubyflower get the other girls boys too ecohar you go with them bring up rocks here here and on the roof try not to look frantic and what do we eat whandall shastern asked quietly when the smaller children were gone for rocks rubyflowers rightwell never get a cart home whandall will think of something wess spoke from behind him possession and pride in her voice vinspel had been killed in a knife fight ten days back theyd had to lei i wess no man would tell her or tell any woman that vinspel had been lighting for another woman the other placehold women liked wess too but they would talk and now whandall could only think that no man could keep her from him she was the oldest girl in the room mothers mother was leader of the placehold but she was somewhere else inside her mind mother had been the real leader usually when she didnt have flasks and powders but now she was gone if wanshig came back elriss would be leader now now whandalls woman would have the job honors and duties alike it came to whandall that he didnt really know what that meant he knew that mothers mother then mother had kept the keys to the pantry neither seemed to cook or sew or clean others did that but without someone to make it happen they didnt two children began to wail wess grabbed the oldest a sixyearold and shook him quiet let whandall think she said go with rubyflower and get some rocks all of you shoosh get rocks we can throw from the roof not you rainier get some water for the roof garden not drinking water dirty water will do fine come on all of youlets get to work whandall nodded rocks good he said shastern you help wess find some way to barricade the stairway too ill be back as soon as i can where are you going shastern asked pelzed hed have to tell pelzed how helpless the placehold was that would be dangerous but pelzed would find out anyway better to tell him straight off pelzedlord pelzedowed whandall a favor would he remember would he care but it was the only place whandall could go pelzed had led a band toward lords town whandall couldnt follow there hed wait at pelzeds roofless house but pelzed was back three of pelzeds women were going through a stack of gatherings pelzed shouted when he saw whandall whandall come have some lea whandall approached warily he waved to indicate the loot from lords town lord pelzed grinned not exactly he said sit down yes lord pelzed heard youd had some trouble pelzed said wanshigs gone some of the other men yes lord lord you once said you owed me a favor we need help lord pelzed poured tea and pushed the cup over to whandall tell me all the men are gone lord whandall said theres only me and the younger boys the women will try to find men but pelzed nodded there was no expression in his eyes at all as he sat lost in thought finally he said are you asking for my protection yes lord why not ask the lordsmen lord there are lines a hundred people long in front of every clerk in peacegiven square whandall said and what good would it do men come to gather the placehold we send for the lordsmen and maybe they come and maybe not but they wont come in time to do us any good we have our own lord here why go to the lords of lordshills you learn fast pelzed said all right well protect your cart on mothers day and ill get the word out that anyone gathering at the placehold will have to answer to me and ill speak to the lords clerks in the square youll be all right thank you lord youll have to control the placehold dont make any new enemies i cant fight new enemies pelzed said you remember that yes lord how many boys do you have at placehold eleven lord not including shastern theyll all join serpents walk pelzed said join knowing they owe us yes lord good pelzed sipped more tea a crafty smile came to his lips dont you want to know what happened he asked oh yes lord whandall said i saw you going toward the lordshills so did the bull fizzles pelzed said they were following us we couldnt shake them and there were too many to fight so there we were going out gathering with a bunch of pizzles following right behind i had a good planwear forester leathers wear leathers and make sure we didnt leave any dead behind theyd never know it was us but when we got closer we saw lordsmen twenty maybe more they had armor swords spears big shields and we werent about to gel past them kraemar and roupend were feeling yanginateps power they wanted to run in and gather couldnt control them much longer is that where you got all that whandall asked lords town no what i did was let the bull fizzles get past me then go back to the fizzle streets pelzed said with our leathers on struck a bargain with the kinless there kraemar and roupend got to burn some old houses and stores the rest of us gathered all this and the bull fizzles never came back i may even have a new street for serpents walk lordwas chief wulltid killed then lord no you know what hes like he didnt go with his men he stayed to take his pleasures in his own houses pelzed laughed i hope he enjoyed himself he wont like my new arrangements the grin was wider but the lords will bull fizzle isnt very popular with the lords right now whandall sipped tea and listened he tried to imagine himself as lord whandall of serpents walk it was a good picture and the more he thought about it the more he liked it it was a big job and he didnt know how to do it but he could watch pelzed and learn wess had moved all his things into the big northeast room resalets clothes were gone his other things bronze mirror drinking cup were laid out for whandalls approval wess was wearing a short wool skirt and a thin blouse that opened down to her navel where did you get that he knew he shouldnt ask from vinspel his hands were on her shoulders nice he said and repeated himself nice wess youre beautiful she must have used the mirror he thought and he reached out for the magical thing and looked into it there was no trace now of that ringshaped scar the serpent tattoo was magnificent alien what did i look like he asked i stayed clear of you while i was healing hed let her see him once the look in her eyes that scar i never thought it would heal i found magic he said wess ive got to talk to the rest of the house but first what have you got done the children were being taken care of there was food this evenings dinner would be huge they were cooking everything that wouldnt keep theyd eat as much as they could tomorrow who knew stashes of rocks were on the roof and children on guard invaders would expect rocks there should be something else too something to startle a gathering band boiling water too complicated too much work and where would they get water think of something fire would burn on a roof the placehold was nearly empty was there some way the place could look busier all that showed from the street was a blank wall and a wide gate what men he had he could move them through that gate more often and i couldnt think of anything else she said you ive got pelzeds protection the only idea i had dark mans cup will do us some good i think pelzed killed some friends for not keeping his promises there chapter whandall was busier than he had ever been in his life hed forgotten that everyone went hungry following the burning there wasnt enough food outside too many gatherers and not enough to gather hunger then feasts when anyone could gather food they fought over the dishes and everything tasted so good he remembered that now he knew why they were starving whandalls elder half sister sharlatta came home with chapoka chapoka was an adult male and there was no more to be said for him he never gathered except from a friend he complained about everything and he never shut up whandall knew him well enough to throw him out chapoka wouldnt be thrown and whandall was harassed and hungry he decided his household of children could use entertainment the fight in the courtyard left chapoka with scars he would have to explain for the rest of his life the gaudiest were on his back afterward the placeholds survivors treated whandall like a lord during this time lack of respect was one complaint he never had he hadnt realizedhe had to leaf back through his memories to understand that everyone always complained to a lord all the time even wess loving wess was wonderful and she held the placehold together as much as anyone but living with a woman took new skills at accommodation and ate time he didnt have it wasnt like living with a roomful of brothers and he hadnt liked that very much he saw his former life as a long dream of idleness he came to understand why lathers disappeared maybe he wouldnt have stayed with it hut he knew he knew where the men had gone whatever befell the placehold now was his doing whandalls mother brought freethspat home four weeks after the burning everyone was astonished he was a heavily scarred man around thirty years old from so far across town that nobody knew anything of his clan sea cliffs he said and he showed a finely tattooed sea gull in flight when whandall came home that afternoon freethspat and mother had the northeast room whandalls things were in the north room that shastern had taken because no one wanted to move elriss from the southeast room she had shared with wanshig wess moved in with elriss she was avoiding him again once they met on the stair and wess spoke rapidly before he could open his mouth you could have asked me to stay what if i asked now stay where whandall i would have followed you you never said anything its like i came with the northeast room or with your being the oldest man i wasnt sure whandall said shed left him once before she had come to him when his status changed and it might change again for those reasons and one other hed dithered that other reason wess if i had you and the placehold to take care of that would be my life guard you and the rest of them until i am dead i know how to do that be pelzeds right hand when pelzed wants to slack off a little years from now id be lord pelzed lord whandall he tasted the name except when lords or lordsmen can hear me i she waited for him to go on but he didnt know how to say it he hadnt even tried until now i dont want to be pelzed pelzed bows and scrapes and flatters and sets his people against each other and lies and kills and tells other people to kill friends and with all that lives not a half as well as the real lords in lords town what i want it isnt here wess brushed past him and was gone coals still burned the killing of firelighters had got up the kinlesss noses now they wanted to carry knives for months after the burning the talk was of little else there was no fundamental disagreement among the lordkin how could a conquered people be permitted weapons of course the firefighters shouldnt have been killed not killed but fire was yanginateps wait now yanginatep suppressed fire too so it wasnt blasphemy yes it was but they could have been driven off taught an unforgettable lesson scarred or maimed then driven off but theyd soaked those blankets to smother the firesthat was drinking water in the streetcorner gatherings whandall tried to stay out of the arguments they could get you killed a teller from begridseth was beaten for asking the wrong questions and again whandall didnt participate at home the women were in quiet mourning but mothers mother left no doubt about how she felt the lordkin had become no better than animals the kinless couldnt see reason they had been attacked while rescuing horsesyes and fighting a fire too attacked and murdered the kinless wanted the killers heads hah no hope of that of course even without the protection of their streetbrothers youd have thought half the city had watched the firefighters die they were willing to describe what they thought had happened in minute detail but nobody could remember a face but the kinless wanted to carry knives or clubs to fight back next time many lordkin would have offered them the chance for amusement a bad precedent though a reversal of ancient law but nothing was being built lords and kinless were holding talks lordkin spoke at every intersection and every mouth was dry the deerpiss carried water an uncertain distance and then stopped because smashed aqueducts were still smashed garbage wasnt moving the lordkin began to see that it would not move itself rats and other scavengers were growing numerous ash pits that had been stores and restaurants now began to serve the lordkin as garbage dumps mothers day came and went nothing was distributed in peacegiven square because there was nothing to distribute scant food was coming into the city too much was disappearing on the way great fire would the lordkin have to take up driving wagons themselves that whandall decided was an interesting notion now freethspat and whandall and shastern were the only men in the placehold freethspat fit in well enough he didnt often beat the younger children and never seemed to beat the women at all he was respectful to pelzed and spoke well of serpents walk mother never yelled at him which was unusual a week after his arrival freethspat was gone all night whandall wondered if hed disappeared mother had no doubts and in the morning he brought home a pushcart full of food some of it fresh there was enough food to last a week and no one mentioned the blood on the cart freethspat was a provider freethspat might have had a little lords blood in him too over the next three weeks rooms nobody would walk in barefoot became jarringly clean and the placehold girls smiled proudly when freethspat praised them six placehold boys who had been old enough to gather in the burning but too young for anything so serious as robbing a wizard now brought home gold rings and wallets from looker pockets and produce from kinless markets and whandall now its your turn freethspat said they were in the courtyard gathered for dinner heads turned as freethspat spoke theyd heard this conversation before whandall asked mean what mean its time you earned your keep whandall freethspat said sure i can get more to eat but what happens to your mother if they get me and your sisters your turn i dont know where to get food i can show you but your mother says you know a lot freethspat said youve been to lordshills take me there whandall shook his head the lordsmen will kill us both me for sure lord samorty told them last time i was there here look at my armit grew back crooked whandall pulled off his shirt here then somewhere else you know the forest but theres nothing to be had there is there no then somewhere you went with your brother what was his name wanshig elriss said glaring she was nursing wanshigs son wanshig freethspat said they tell me you hung around with him a lot whandall he must have showed you something they say wanshig was smart he was elriss said so show me whandall could have liked freethspat but the man was just an inch taller and just an inch wider than whandall just a little too obtrusive in his strength he called him whandall as a brother would he lived in whandalls room there had been no need for whandalls gathering skills in the time since the burning there was no need now but whandall was getting restless and wess was unobtrusively following the exchange and it wouldnt take much of a coup to shut freethspat up i did have a notion whandall said i just couldnt see a way to make it work freethspat what do you know about wine well back from the road and screened by growths of touchme vine whandall and freethspat watched the vineyard the noon sun was making the workers torpid their patient drudgery hadnt changed since he and wanshig had watched them nearly a year ago the grapevines were glossy green the buildings behind them showed no sign of scorching the burning of two months back simply hadnt happened here the lordkin guards did seem more alert a youth passed whandall walking upright and noisily far from the comforts offered by that big house woodsmans leathers made him clumsy and still he avoided the morningstar bushes and beds of touchme steering wide of the hiding place wanshig had found for them whandall had been surprised to see how much freethspat knew about leathers and the chaparral freethspat knew about a lot of things and here came a pony a local pony with a fleck of white bone on its forehead pulling a wagon with a single driver that one freethspat said no its empty wait whandall whispered he watched the wagon go by just watched this time he was not bored in serpents walk there hed been bored the same limp justificationswhat do the kinless want of us when yanginatep takes us we do these things its not us its the rageuntil they believed it themselves it was hard to believe in that empty wagon wasnt the bed a little high easy to picture a false floor with flasks of wine under the boards the kinless driver tugged at his yellow silk noose a little besotted was he rolling a little with the wagons motion a big one he was with shoulders like boulders maybe you needed that to control a pony it hardly mattered a kinless wouldnt fight the guard was a lordkin whandalls age fifteen or sixteen older men had sent him out and stayed to drink in comfort no doubt in armor hed be helpless whandall could take him then the wagon much closer nowhave to sprint to catch itand the driver arms like a wrestler the big hat shadowed his face but the nose was flat hard to believe in him too he was still tugging at the yellow silk tied loosely around his thick neck he wasnt used to it damn the hat shadowed his nose and ears but that driver is lordkin freethspat said his voice was filled with disgust working like a kinless youre right what could you pay a lordkin to make him work like a kinless what could he gain that another lordkin couldnt take away from him whandall thought about it while the wagon receded wine maybe if he drank it right away secrets things nobody else knows this isnt going to be so easy is it we may have to kill the driver have to kill the guard anyway your turn whandall chapter the next wagon didnt appear until near sunset the same guard had been out there for all that time pushing through branches wearing a path sweating into his leathers and bored into a stupor the wagon distracted him now freethspat said without turning it was whandalls scheme all it needed for completion was some way to avoid killing freethspat was a skillful gatherer he knew things he had brains freethspat turned to look at whandall hes too far now when he comes back take him i brought you here whandall protested his voice never rose above the sound of the breeze in leaves isnt that enough freethspat studied whandall with interest youre not scared he whispered no i understand but whandall this is what we are this is what a lordkin is here and now right now with me watching whandall took in a deep breath the guard was coming toward him again his forearm and wrist brushed a morningstar he grunted in pain and shied back and then whandall slammed into his back and cut his throat it was his first kill and it went much better than hed expected whandall had several seconds to get into place before the wagon arrived he didnt look back at the corpse he thumped into the wagon bed while the wagoneer was scanning the trees for the guard the wagoneer half stood turning slicing blind with his long knife in a move he must have practiced for years whandall blocked the blade with his own and threw with his other hand pebbles spattered the ponys head and ears the pony screamed and surged forward the wagoneer stumbled tried to stab out anyway and was cursing as whandalls blade slid in under his armpit the road curved wide around down to the streambed the turns werent sharp and the pony knew the way whandall had time to put on the hat and coatand figure out how to move the complicated knot to get the noose off the corpse and onto his own neckbefore the gatehouse came in view bile was rising in his throat he let the pony slow it wouldnt do to be seen vomiting over the side he heard freethspat climbing in behind him there was a rustle as he hid under the tarp well done came the whisper couldnt have done it better myself whandall im proud of you whandall didnt care to speak freethspat examined the dead man then cursed softly what hes a toronexti freethspat said so was the other one why didnt you tell me tell you what whandall demanded suddenly he remembered wanshigs words alferth had hired toronexti to guard the vineyards freethspat sighed you have a lot to learn boy you dont gather from the toronexti ever whandall pointed to the dead man theyre not so tough no theyre not but there are a lot of them you kill one others come looking for you and you wont know who they are so what do we do we get out of here with this stuff freethspat frowned we get rid of it as quick as we can maybe they gathered the wagon no toronexti marks on that what do they look like never you mind it was tempting to think in terms of secrets of hiding the wine under the false bed was in little flasks those could be hidden it was what you did with wine but how would you hide a wagon they discussed it after theyd cleared the gatehouse they reached home in a stony silence whandall began moving garbage friends offered suggestions get shovels line the wagon with hay some of the serpents walk men helped him do that others helped move garbage away from where they lived until they got bored freethspat stayed with it if any part of the scheme had collapsed freethspat would have gotten whandall out alive and then never let him forget it but he became good with the shovel and he stayed with it four more were good enough at it and stayed long enough that whandall and freethspat shared wine with them they stayed as a core to gather other men four days of that and everyone was tired of it serpents walk was full of men from alferths quarter who knew very well where and how whandall got that wagon whandall left the wagon abandoned it disappeared with a few flasks left under the boards as a gift there was wine for mother and mothers mother for his sister sharlatta and the man shed brought home after whandall evicted chapoka for elriss who had known no man since wanshig disappeared and wess whose man had taken to vanishing at night wine served as a dontkillme gift for hartanbath the man hed cut that was freethspats suggestion whandall and freethspat shared two bottles with hartanbath and some of his flower market friends and were gone before hartanbath had drunk very much dusk in teps town whandall stood at the western edge of the placehold roof garden to watch the sun fall into the sea the landscape below softened hiding the garbage and the filthy streets a few kinless hurried home eager to reach shelter before darkness gave the world over to gatherers and worse there were lordkin with no place to go some found shelter with kinless that could be tricky kinless had no rights but some were protected pelzed and other lordkin leaders put some streets off limits the lords didnt permit a breach of the peace but they never said what that was armed lordsmen might come to help a kinless house under siege sometimes lordsmen squads swept through teps town and rounded up any lordkin unlucky enough to get their attention they took their prisoners to camps where they were put to work on the roads and aqueducts for a year that didnt seem to happen in serpents walk pelzed luck yanginatep probably not yanginatep and you didnt steal from the toronexti but only freethspat could recognize them so now what and how did he do that the day faded and now the city was lit with a thousand backyard cook fires whandall took out three flasks of wine he drank the first in three gulps he was halfway through the second when he heard the scream me listened long enough to he sure it didnt conic from the placehold he sipped more wine not his business the scream ended with a strangled gurgle someone had died of a cut throat whandall wondered who it might be someone he knew a kinless who resisted more likely a lordkin knife fight freethspat was proud of him hed killed the guard his first kill some would add to their tattoos or wear an earring it was what lordkin did this was what it meant to be lordkin his belly spasmed and spat the last swallow of wine straight up into his nose and sinuses he doubled over coughing and snorting and trying to get the acid out of his windpipe and more wine came up stupid he knew what wine did he got himself under control and took another swallow there were torches over by the new ropewalk the scream had come from that direction could someone be gathering there whod be such a fool the ropewalk was in pelzeds forbidden zone two lordkin families lived among the kinless rope makers whandall had been inside that area only once during the burning rebuilding of the ropewalk started the day after the burning and pelzed himself came down to supervise and make it clear that the kinless working there were never to be molested rope was important both to use and to sell once whandall had been curious about how it was made but no lordkin knew that hemp held many secrets where hemp was grown how the fibers were stripped from it always at dawn after a night of heavy dew but no one knew why tar was brought from the black pit hemp fibers and tar were taken to a long narrow building and later they came out as rope some tarred some not to be used and sold ships used rope rope left serpents walk gold and shells came back and every step of that was protected by pelzed here and the lordsmen elsewhere a dozen torches now whandall began the third flask of wine it was his last the screams had stopped the torchbearers went out of sight whandall thought he saw shadows moving near the ropewalk the next morning a lordkin from the hook was found with his throat cut someone had gathered his clothes and shoes leaving him naked on a trash heap chapter thus whandallwho already knew how to fight and how to run learned how to gather a ponydrawn vehicle and really move out one day he might be glad and he had a hell of a story to tell if the chief flasker ever wanted to make something of it that was unlikely alferth worked with certain lords whandall had robbed them alferth would defend his status but he would never defend property to alferth whandall and freethspat had only demonstrated their skill a great many lordkin were part kinless as many kinless merchants were part lordkin only kinless would defend property and alferths nose was a little too pointed and he didnt have enough earlobe and in fact any fool could see that alferth had kinless blood but somewhere a lord had been robbed whandall wondered about him and about the toronexti that lord had hired to guard and move his wine what would they do the toronexti guarded a path to nowhere and nobody knew who they were alferth knew who had killed two of them whandall was coming to realize that no one ever felt safe in teps town he stopped worrying about alferth though alferth wouldnt talk to the toronexti now theyd want to know why he hadnt spoken earlier theyd lost a wagon they were guarding theyd never want anyone to know that if alferth spoke he would only embarrass himself and the toronexti nobody did that they were still talking somewhere in the higher circles no lordkin had seen save whandall up there where the lords set the taxes and the kinless made their futile protests on the street corners there was talk of compromise whandall heard the rumors and wondered what to believe teps town was to have a troop of guards whandall laughed when he heard that but the rumors piled up details and the laughter faded someone in the councils was serious several hands of kinless men would be given weapons never to be concealed most would be allowed hardwood sticks and torches torches a mad suggestion fire belonged to yanginatep darkness belonged to any gatherer in need rigid rules were laid down the guards might use their sticks in carefully described circumstances but never otherwise only officers might carry blades and those no longer than a hand guards would wear conspicuous clothing they must never approach a lordkin by subterfuge from time to time their behavior would be reviewed by the lordkin and the lords whandall wondered what the kinless thought they had won hedged about with such rules theyd be more helpless than ever the lords themselves and the loudest voices among the lordkin might have agreed to this nonsense but if lordkin saw fit to take a stick away from some kinless guard they would but water and food were moving again garbage was leaving the inner city though a few of those ash pits turned garbage pits were being made to grow food structures began to rise to cover the scars of the burning everyone was happy about that but whandall remembered the lordshills and wondered rumor flowed down from lords town there lordkin and kinless lived together and worked for mutual benefit garbage still moved the fountains were turned off most of them but the date and olive trees werent dry flower gardens still grew how was it done who were these lords to have a city and a life when teps town was dying it was death to go and look there had been a living god who gave fire to men nobody could doubt that but alferth who started the burning when whandall was seven hadnt been possessed by yanginatep hed laughed when tras suggested such a thing the fires hed set didnt seem to be motivated by anything bigger than the whim to watch a fire whandall was losing faith yanginatep must be mythical by now morth of atlantis was gone the placehold women didnt want whandall lo lake a woman he was the last man horn in the placehold yanginatep forbid he should leave the house would have no trusted protectorbut one more woman would be a hardship wess came to share his bed sometimes so he should not have been lonely wess had reconsidered freethspat wasnt interested in a second wife and whandall was as good a catch as wess was likely to find she made it clear to whandall that she would move in anytime he asked whandall refused it rankled that she had moved out of his room when she thought freethspat might be available and other men came to visit wess was never unfriendly to any man who might have power freethspat was here and his sister ilyessa brought home a man and it didnt feel like his family anymore one day whandall would bring home a mate the women would presently accept her he would sire children he was a fighteror the rest of the city thought he was he would rise in power among pelzeds counselors and a few would whisper that pelzed thought of him as his heir in later years he would sometimes collect taxed goods to supply a feast he would speak with the lords to shape civic policy the placehold and the city expected these things of him they didnt know that fire had claimed the placehold men because whandall stayed behind to get laid he was leery of making decisions for others he held his opinions to himself and shied away from being too persuasive and he watched the city rebuild part four the return chapter two years after the burning elriss had blossomed into a very handsome woman desired by nearly every man who saw her she worked in the roof gardens and tended arnimer the son born months after the burning she taught all the placehold children she worked with the other women and she was respectful to freethspat but except to go to peacegiven square on mothers day she never left the placehold and she never spoke to men visitors or single placeholders except for whandall she treated whandall like wanshigs little brother even wine hadnt tempted her presently even whandall thought of her as a sister whandall was dressing presently he would go to the meetinghouse to drink tea with pelzed carry out any errand pelzed might have watch how power was used elriss came shouting to his door wanshig is back she cried i see him hes coming up the street and moments later wanshig was there he looked older thinner and a great deal stronger whandall had only moments to greet him before elriss swept him into the room she had held from before he left she showed him her son then the infant arnimer was sent out to play with the other children and no one saw elriss or wanshig for a long time whandall went to the roof wanshig knew whandall could have come to help the placehold men but he stopped for dreamlotus wanshig was back and wanshig knew they sat drinking weak hemp tea alter dinner everyone listened as wanshig told his story he was looking at whandall as he said i ran just as fast as i could and i was still too late i saw an old man running away looking back i wondered if it was morth whandall realized hed been holding his breath the shop was full of lordkin wanshig said i could see them through the door and a big window at least ten and they were all placeholders whandall enough placehold men to drive anyone else away things were burning inside resalet was possessed of yanginatep i saw him wave at a shelf and a whole line of pots puffed into flame he picked up something big in both arms what was that i never knew understand i was moving at a dead run legs like soggy wood all i saw of anyone was a shadow backed by fire i knew resalet by the way he moved and his arms were wrapped around a heavy round thing about as big as as arnimer the babe looked up on hearing his name wanshig stroked his back and said holding his voice to an icy calm i tried to scream get out get out i went whoosh no breath i sucked in air to scream whatever was burning in that shop caught in my throat i went into a coughing fit cousin fiasoom staggered through the door clawing at his throat and fell to his knees resalet was coughing too i could see him hunch over just inside the doorway he gestured the edge of his round thing into a tiny white flame very bright he plucked off the lid everything went white the box exploded no i saw just that much resalet exploded resalet was one great glare like looking into the sun at noon it was like daggers in my eyes i screamed and threw my arms over my eyes and curled up around myself i felt yanginatep breathe on my back one long blast and then he went away i was blind when i could move i waited a bit maybe someone from the placehold would see me see nobody did so i started feeling my way around i stayed back from the heat that must have been morths shop i could hear the riot around me my sight came back with edges and white spots i could see people around me gathering and burning i wanted out you understand out no more burning no more serpents walk no more teps town sure shig nobodys called me that in a long time what then the women were guarding the placehold i didnt even think of that i went to the black pit i couldnt see i couldnt fight i needed a place to hide and you told me ghosts couldnt hurl me remember i thought theyd scare away anyone else so i went there spent the night in the morning i could see more my good white tunic was charred all across the back where yanginatep had breathed on me my hair came off in handfuls it was crisp there were a lot of fires far away east and south whandall i never wanted to see fire again whandall laughed wanshig didnt he said i went to the docks i played sneakandspy past a few water devils there were ships i went to the biggest the entrance to a ship they call that a gangplank two men were on guard there not water devils i told the big one the older one i want to sail on a ship both men laughed but i could feel them separating a little you know to put one behind me the big one said well thats not a problem boy and i turned fast and caught the other ones arm hed tried to hit me with a little wood club they call afishkiller you know whandall we practice this kind of thing i broke his arm and let him dangle over the water holding him out with my one armyou know showing off i told manocane the big guy the officer i want his job that was sabrioloy his job was guarding the lordkin when the lordsmen wheel up a cart full of gatherers sabrioloy knocks them on the head shows them whos boss he tried that with me after that i was boss boss over the lordkin sailors anyway sabrioloy showed me the rest of what i needed to know he trained me and i didnt throw him over whandall he couldnt swim a ships man i thought even water devils could swim most sailors cant swim their doubt must have showed wanshig said we were just pulling out of the bay the officers wanted more sails up so sabrioloy and i drove the men aloft to raise them jack rigenlord was an old hand and he was up there above us all then a mountain of water stood up out of the sea and hit us broadside it must have been magic whandall i never saw anything like it before or since waves come in lines rows but this just stood up and curled over and wham the ship heeled over and the mainmast bowed like a whip jack flew into the sea he waved once at us and was gone that made me a believer i made etiarp teach me to swim first time we docked near a beach etiarp was a water devil who tried to gather from a merchant ship we taught a few of the lordkin if a lordkin could swim i promoted him we taught sabrioloy too chapter it was a night of storytelling and it ran nearly to dawn freethspat told how he and whandall had gathered a wine wagon he still had a flask to pass around only yanginatep might know where hed hidden it all this time whandall let him describe the escape then he told how hed turned himself and freethspat and the wagon into a garbage hauling business he much enjoyed wanshigs open amazement and freethspats determined grin wanshig let the flask pass him while he told a story of being chased by a snakearmed monster bigger than the ship when freethspat called him a liar wanshig only shook his head the old wanshig would have had some clever riposte the new one saw how they stared puzzled waiting he said we sailed into waluu port eighteen days after jack rigenlord drowned a woman came down to the dock asking for captain jack now jack he didnt have more than one woman in any one port and some of them thought he was captain i guess fencia she had a marriage contract when jack didnt appear she found us at the nearest saloon manocane knew her he made her sit down and bought her a mulled ale and made her drink and then he said jack married the mermaid freethspat was delighted ive heard of mermaids when i was a boy oh the merfolk are real enough wanshig said theyre wonderful they like to pace a ship ride the bow wave where the magics weak they take the shape of a big fish but they breathe air not water theres a nostril right on top where the magics strong you see a man or woman with fishy hindquarters we dont offend the mers they can drive fish toward a fleet or away and show you where the rocks are when its thick with fog we like the merfolk but its just a sailors way of speaking he married the mermaid jack rigenlord drowned we dont like to say drowned but fencia of waluu port didnt know that she was furious he was going to marry me i waited through six years and four voyages for him to get enough money and now hes married a mermaid how does he expect to get children wed been drinking she was so angry you know and i guess i thought it was funny you know married laughter rippled wanshig didnt smile manocane opened his mouth but i cut in first i said to fencia no wait they arent married yet he says he wants your permission i saw every head turn i heard a lot of laughing choked back my permission she screams and she makes me tell her all the details what was he doing when she popped out of the water what did the mermaid look like did she cover her breasts did she sing him down into the water or did he just see her and jump did jack even remember fencia i made it up as i went along by now we were surrounded sailors have a deadpan way of telling a story so they kept straight faces if fencia heard any cackling she must have thought they were laughing at her because her man left her i thought we were about to get some real entertainment sometimes an angry woman can remind a sailor why he left the land whandall waited when wanshig didnt speak again he asked then what she gave it wanshig said what she didnt do any more screaming that night she just turned around and stalked out head high the next morning fencia came to the dock and announced to a big crowd that her engagement to jack rigenlord was at an end and he was free to do as he liked if she cried it wasnt where anyone could see her manocane and i got all the other sailors to hold their tongues i heard what they said afterward but me i thought she was brave ive lied since he told them all but i dont like it people get hurt and im home now and i wont lie again on subsequent nights shastern listened quietly to wanshigs tales of the sea he concealed his thoughts but when wanshig spoke shastern always came to listen whandall noticed and wondered if shasterns thoughts resembled his own if whandall was fated to leave teps town despite morth of atlantis might it be by sea chapter wanshig found whandall on the roof garden whandall had developed the habit of seeing to the health of the plants wanshig said i want you to know that two of us couldnt have done any more than i did you could have got there in time to be blinded thats all whandall had found a few bugs already so he finished inspecting the row of tomatoes he stood up to find wanshig watching the sun fall into the sea what are you watching for shig whandall asked green flash just as the sun vanishes sometimes when its very clear you can see a flash of green wanshig said have you seen it twice but never from shore wanshig said just when we were at sea its very good luck the weather is always great the next day wanshig stared westward at the darkening hills sunsets are better when the sun falls into the sea you liked sailing whandall said i loved it so why did you come back for elriss wanshig looked around to be sure they were alone and still he lowered his voice thats what i told her he said but whandall they put me ashore why wanshig didnt answer that day hed been home for nearly a week then and whandall hadnt seen him taste wine wanshig wobbled home long after dinnertime whandall found him washing in the courtyard tub in the dark shh he said i dont want elriss to see me what happened you havent had a drink three weeks and a day a teller found me whandall somehow he heard a lordkin went sailing and came back he had some flasks whandall nodded in the dark what did you tell him stories why you came home nonono not that whandall waited they liked me whandall i did them some good taught most of the crew to swim protected the merchants nobody gathered from our passengers they really liked me b shipmasters trade wanshig said they dont want to be known as pirates pirates arent welcome condigeo keeps warships they can afford them because they hire them out to other towns to hunt pirates so you never know when you sail into a harbor whether they might have pirate hunters ready to come inspect you ships get a reputation he paused to stare at the first stars so they dont want gatherers on board whandall thought about that and you didnt know this i knew it they told me the first day i was aboard no gathering in port ever of course i didnt believe them until the first time they caught me took everything i had and gave it back and gave my pay to the people id gathered from taught me a proper lesson they did whandall didnt say anything but then i got drunk theres a town below the barbar mountains three days sail west of here stuffy place but lots of magic silks arts crafts and i was coming home id be here in three days first time wed put in here since i shipped out whandall nobody wants to come here not often anyway so there was this shop with a dress that would look terrific on elriss you thought shed still be here wanshig looked around again elriss wasnt about her or someone but i couldnt afford it that was all right id get it another time but then i went down to the docks and some of my buddies had bought a whole keg of beer we sat drinking all night and come morning wanshig shrugged well it seemed like a good idea to go get that dress of course they caught me the captain didnt say anything about it not then but when we got here he put me ashore and told the other captains one morning shastern was gone when he didnt come back the next day whandall told pelzed patrols were sent out and a formal question was sent to wulltid of bull fizzle shastern was a loyal soldier of serpents walk wulltids answer was polite but brief no one had seen shastern of serpents walk if anyone did he would be well treated and delivered to his home three days after shastern disappeared whandall sat with pelzed in the serpents walk meetinghouse pelzed had made a complicated trade of services and protection now a kinless crew showed up to put on a new roof whandall thought he recognized two of the older workmen as woodsmen hed seen with kreeg miller but he didnt speak to them theyd never know him a runner came to the long table where pelzed sat most days shastern is back lord he said where peacegiven square theres a wagon with a lordsman in armor and a water devil pelzed frowned the lords are bringing water devils to serpents walk lord hes a boy small tattoo no knife he asks to speak to you and theres a lords clerk there too they ask you to come lord pelzed looked around the meeting room miracos youll stay here whandall come with me pelzed selected two more guards whandall thought miracos glared at him as they went out everyone wanted to stand near pelzed when he spoke to the lords clerks and miracos thought of himself as pelzeds chief advisor lately whandall had been favored shastern lay on a litter in front of the witness table a helmeted lordsman stood next to him the wagon was nearby driven by a kinless teamster and drawn by kinless ponies not the big horses lords used for their own business the lords witness with his tightfitting cap and robes sat at the table he didnt rise when pelzed arrived with his retinue but the kinless clerk stood and bowed to pelzed then intoned formally witness we see pelzed of serpents walk the witness stood his voice was thin and dry very formal pelzed of serpents walk i am instructed to convey the greetings of lord samorty of the lordshills lord samorty wishes you well he sat again the clerk turned to the water devil an unarmed boy of no more than sixteen with hand tattoo only speak lattar of the water devils witness we return shastern of serpents walk to his people lattar said he was cast onto the docks by ships guards at womb of petes gangplank let the record show that his injuries are not of our making we found him we tended to his wounds and he is now delivered to his people the clerk turned to shastern do you dispute this shastern of serpents walk shastern mumbled something the clerk frowned and whandall went over to his brother he could see that shasterns mouth was swollen and there were bruises showing through his tattoos shastern saw whandall and tried to smile greetings big brother was what he tried to say but only whandall understood it lost a tooth did water devils do this no shastern tried to move his head shifsh crew he managed to say devils sen me home not their fault whandall turned to pelzed he doesnt dispute it lord pelzed nodded serpents walk is satisfied return my thanks to samorty of lordshills the clerk smiled wryly witness all parties are satisfied he said the witness spoke without rising read the proclamation the clerk took a parchment from under his robe proclamation to all those who hear this take heed for it is the law many shipmasters are unfamiliar with the customs of the lordkin of teps town this has resulted in unfortunate incidents causing disrespect and injury to lordkin therefore for the protection of the lordkin henceforth all lordkin who wish to approach any ship in the harbor of teps town must first obtain permission from the lordsmen officer of the harbor watch we regret the necessity of this ruling but it must be strictly enforced by order of samorty chief witness of teps town and lordshills territories the clerk turned to the witness the proclamation has been read we will read it again each hour this day and the next the witness nodded the clerk turned back to pelzed pelzed of serpents walk you have heard the proclamation of the lords take heed your kinsman shastern of serpents walk has been returned to you the wagon has been hired for the day and is at your disposal witness our fees were paid in advance and there is no more business to be done shastern healed fast one tooth was gone and his sisters fed him soup for a week while the swelling in his jaw subsided but no bones were broken at dinner shastern told everyone hed tried to gather from a harbor tavern met a crewman and went aboard and was beaten when the other crewmen saw him but he spoke with whandall on the roof alone i thought if shig could go to sea so could i shastern said but they wouldnt let me on the ship at all the whole crew heat me i kept saying i knew they didnt want gatherers that id never gather i didnt come to gather i just wanted to go to sea and they kept kicking me if the lordsman hadnt come they would have killed me i think shastern fingered his tattoo whandall pelzed of serpents walk is a name with power they dont call him lord but the lordsman knew his tattoo there was some kind of meeting with the devils chief and the lordsmen and then they sent for a lord samorty yes they called him that whandall nodded he goes on watch himself what did they meet about about me shastern said i just wanted to get home i was dripping blood and i needed a drink when the lord saw me he got angry clean him up he said his voice was real low and mean are you blind dont you see that tattoo so they got me a basin of saltwater and another of fresh and a cup of wine good wine then they went in another room but the big lordsman wouldnt let me go he got me another cup of wine but he went with me when i had to piss deciding what to do with you whandall said im guessing but its like them they cleaned you up so if they let you go youd tell about that then they decided whether to let you go or feed you to the crabs whandall put his hand on his brothers shoulder maybe shastern said they were nice enough when they came out made the ship captain apologize he gave me a bag of shells and two silvers shastern held out a coin stamped with a hummingbird then the lord said real slow and careful that he regretted it but lordkin had to stay away from the ships and theyd draw up a proclamation that was when he said nice things about pelzed and serpents walk like he didnt want pelzed mad but we cant ever go to sea whandall nodded and looked out over the valley of smokes chapter he was twenty before the burning came again and this time everyone was ready hartanbath was more bison than man in the serpent street region of teps townflower market bull fizzle serpents walk and several lesser bandshe was the man a fighter must defeat his missing earandahalf contributed to whandalls own reputation whandall could never have hurt him if hartanbath hadnt been powerfully distracted hartanbath seemed to have learned that lesson he was never seen fornicating in public again with or without a womans consent whandall did not want a rematch few did hartanbath didnt lose at seventeen whandall had taken to driving alferths wine wagons two years later he was present when alferth held a streetcorner drinking party a halfnaked darkskinned heavily armed looker ambled up and took a flask of wine with each hand hartanbath objected the looker mocked hartanbaths ears the looker was younger hartanbath was an inch taller and a stone heavier both could hit like logging axes but hartanbath ran out of strength first sat down and covered his head until the looker was satisfied then the looker finished the wine and consented to tell stories he was arshur the magnificent some tremendous mountain range east of the valley of smokes had birthed his people to the child arshur all was vertical and all vertical laces were slippery with snow and ice arshur could climb any wall enter any building bypass any trap a householder might set for a thief there were cities where a thief might be imprisoned others where he might be hanged and cities where no thief could escape the kings magicians arshur had gathered fortunes in these places and others he had fought monsters and magicians with his good sworda huge clumsy mass of spelled bronze thrice the size of a decent knife a seer had predicted that he would one day be a king when arshur explained what a king was the laughter angered him so tell us majesty shastern asked what brings your magnificence to teps town arshurs face clouded only a moment then he downed the last of the flask and struck a pose i spent my last gold coin on a party he said this was up the coast to the north and west great hawk bay they call it they do have hawks but mostly they have merfolk merfolk one of the younger onlookers was willing to admit ignorance werepeople arshur said you hear of werewolves these are sea creatures no shape changers people who become animals old tales alferth said not told much anymore are you saying theyre real arshur nodded vigorously real yes you would not doubt my word no one did of course arshur said bear men are the worst not as much sense as a wolf and when they want to he made motions with his hips rut someone shouted rut yes when they want to rut they rut anything anybody theyre big and hard to kill so when they want to rut most people get rutted sea people are easier to deal with they like people especially the girls great rutting and the merfolk at great hawk bay set the best table in the universe theres a restaurant in the harbor an island with a bridge to it rordray thats his namerordray owns the place sometimes cooks himself but usually leaves that to others he built the place to look like the top of a castle because thats the way his last one looked somewhere else where the sun rises out of the sea the sun rises out of the sea wanshig had seen that you spent all your money your magnificence shastern prompted it wasnt obvious to anyone but whandall that shastern was set to run if arshur came after him arshur laughed instead its sad being in a place of magic with no money rordray didnt need me neither did anyone else if you steal gather gather they have magic to catch you besides i like the people at great hawk i could stealsure i can steal from anyonebut theyd know who did it then rordray said hed pay me for hemp and sage leaves and the best comes from a place he calls the valley of smokes thats here whandall asked dont they have hemp and sage other places the barbarian looked at whandall other places they grow too strong something to do with magic wizards can change the taste but rordray says they never get it as good as grows here naturally hemp tea alferth said ive been told that beforethat you get good hemp tea here you sure do arshur said wish i had a cup storytelling is thirsty work later someone shouted howd you get here took ship arshur said fought off pirates big canoes of them at the cape they turned and ran after they saw what i did to the first canoe more pirates out of point doomfought them off too so when we got here i figured i had some drinks coming only thing was i hadnt been paid yet and the tavernkeeper wouldnt give me any credit tavernkeeper someone asked boy dont you know anything arshur demanded but you know i see how you wouldnt no taverns here just down at the docks its a place where they sell hemp tea ale wine sometimes tables and benches good roaring fire at night only not here here the fires always outside anyway i was drinking good ale in peace when the owner demanded his money he called the watch when i couldnt pay by the time i explained to them theyd beaten me upside of the head the ship captain gave my pay to the tavernkeeper for damages and sailed on before i woke up so here i am ill ship out one day but i thought id see the country how do you like teps town alferth asked not so good no magic not that i know much magic but a little magic makes life slide by a little smoother and the women down there by the harbor theres a nice townlords town they call it they sure didnt want me there anyplace id go theyd send for the watch chased me right out of town they did so i get here and the women all run away when i try to talk to them one of them pulled a knife on me on me i wasnt going to hurt her they tell me you can rut anytime you want to here whether the women want to or not but i sure didnt find it that way burning shastern said thats during a burning you just missed it arse of zoosh i never have any luck when do you do it again next year maybe ill stay a year maybe in a year alferth said and maybe longer itll be longer hartanbath said tenderly he touched his remaining shred of cur notched by whandall and now torn hy arshur maybe a lot longer seems like more years between burnings than when i was a kid alferth climbed unsteadily onto the wagon and stood on the seat he swayed just a bit as he shouted to the crowd what say is arshur a lordkin yeah who says im not arshur demanded there were shouts not me lordkin he is hell i dont care hey this could be fun arshur was treated as a lordkin from that day hartanbath disappeared for a seasonhealingthen came back to pound the first fool who referred to his loss he and arshur were seen drinking together it was an endless pointless dance but you had to keep track of who was on top arshur fitted into lordkin society for a few months he stole what he willed and carried his loot about until he realized what older children knew almost by instinct that a kinless might as well tend and carry property until a lordkin needed it and one day arshur got in a fight with the town guard his companions chose not to involve themselves they just kept hitting him and hitting him with those sticks idreepuct told them later with secondhand pride he never gave up they had to knock him out they never made him give up idreepuct was speaking in an intersection of alleys to people already angry voices thick with rage demanded what was he doing to make them do that and are the lords crazy to give them those sticks doing it seemed almost irrelevant but the tellers kept asking and idreepuct presently confessed ilserna tough athletic woman who had never admired a man until arshur camehad heard somehow of alferths secret wine wagons of course she told arshur and idreepuct they snatched a wagon it was piled with fruit and it didnt look much like alferths wagons but they took it anyway they drove down straight street whipping the ponies into a frenzy ilsern pelted passersby with fruit while dree tried to pull the floorboards up and the kinless driver clung to the side and made mewling sounds by now the town guard didnt just have sticks and vivid blue tunics they had built themselves small fast wagons to put them where there was trouble wagons werent part of the lords agreement but they werent exactly weapons either a guard wagon chased them then another kinless scattered out of the way dree got the floorboards up nothing but road down here he told arshur and arshur swore and drove the ponies even harder they nicked a fat lordkin lady carrying a heavy bag she screamed curses as they sped away they were tire on wheels until one pony tell dead pulling the other down too and that was the end idreepuct and ilsern stayed where they had fallen in the road kneeling in surrender and that stopped the guard of course rules were rules you knelt they had to freeze it could be very funny to watch their frustration but arshur was still jittering with berserker joy he broke one guards ribs and anothers shoulder and a blow to his head left another unconscious for two days when whandall came on the scene they were carrying arshur away strapped to a plank laughing and insulting the guards with a broken leg and bruises beyond counting and one of em hit him in the head idreepuct complained they cant do that can they tarnisos said big deal arshurs got a head like a rock as whandall strode briskly out of earshot and then ran there was mothers man freethspat on a corner talking to shangsler the bigshouldered man who had moved in with wess twenty days past whandall stopped to describe the situation he ran on gathering whatever placehold men he recognized all of them were near strangers some would defend the house some would celebrate the burning instead the lordkin believed they could feel it when yanginatep stirred whandall felt that now he intended to be guarding the house when the burning began days later nothing at all was burning and the placehold men were letting him know it whandall felt foolish he might have noticed that idreepuct had spilled the secret of the wine wagons to a score of loose tongues some had seen alferths wagons moving regularly along the deerpiss the vineyard was said to be totally destroyed now the most excitable among the citys lordkin were out of action nursing their first real hangovers a gray drizzle had driven them indoors the town guard had virtually disappeared tactfully or prudently carts and sticks and all the burning remained a smoldering potential it was only a matter of time part five the last burning chapter it had been raining hard for two days the placehold would have camped in the courtyard for safety but you couldnt have a burning in the rain could you so the women and children were inside and the men were guarding the door in rotation but twentyyearold whandall was elsewhere dripping wet in a windless rain surrounded by seven sullen lordkin in their thirties a very bitter alferth described what followed arshurs beating a gathering horde of lordkin flowed upstream along the deerpiss and through the meadow the wedge they damaged the gatehouse but couldnt be bothered to take the bricks apart no mention was made of toronexti guards they must have joined the crowd laborers saw human figures straggling out of the forest ten twenty they alerted alferth all the vintners lordkin and kinless prepared to protect their holding only tarnisos on the roof noticed the dust plume as hundreds of invaders surged up from the gatehouse they stomped the vines into mush a few stopped to taste grapes for the first time the rest stormed the wine house it was deserted alferth and his people were fleeing through the forest weaving a path among the deadly guardians of the redwoods guided by what they had learned from whandall placehold the invaders found the vats in the basement and drank everything that would flow alferth waited two days before he took his people back in the woods they found corpses slashed and mottled and swollen many who took that shortcut never reached the vineyards two hands more of bodies lay among the vats killed by bludgeons and lordkin knives by wine and each other the living had returned to town whandall wasnt sorry to have missed that still he gave thought to his own status alferth had been important to pelzed and serpents walk pelzed might see whandall as more than alferths man but pelzed might equally consider that whandall had held the placehold with pelzeds help that all debts were paid alferth was in his midthirties most of the boys hed grown up with must be dead by now what would it take to put him back together whandall raised his voice above the rattle of raindrops alferth they didnt take what you know youve still got that alferth only looked grim he was thinking like a victim freethspat found that disgusting and was starting to show it tarnisos was ready to kill someone anyone you know how to make vines grow whandall said alferth you know how to make juice turn into wine and the wine into well respect i dont know any of that almost nobody does kinless they know it all alferth said find some land somewhere else time you kinless fool it takes time and work to make wine a year before theres anything to drink and thats after you have vines longer to grow vines ill be forgotten by then without wine im nothing alferth was thinking like a kinless thats how we grew up whandall pointed out we have nothing except what we gather he looked for support and saw smiles flicker not enough and it wasnt quite true either the child alferth had had nothing but he hadnt been old it came to whandall that he had done what he could leave now a twopony wagon came trotting up straight street alferth and his men watched from the curb it came near through several silent minutes the little boneheaded ponies were pulling hard the wagon was heavy though the bed held only a few coils of rope whandall cursed in his mind he smelled blood they were next to a butcher shop but whandall could recognize an omen go home get everyone into the courtyard its still raining but the burning is on us i feel it but hed shouted of the burning six days ago and nothing tarnisos trotted a few paces west to an ash pit a shop for farm gear five years ago the rebuilding hadnt touched it he came back with an arms length of fence post charred at one end alferth stepped casually into the road freethspat followed then the rest whandall hadnt moved without willing it he became the fixed end of an arc across straight street the driver might have been dozing or hiding his face from the rain he looked up far too late pulled on the reins tried to turn the ponies far too late as seven lordkin swarmed over his wagon and wrestled his ponies to the ground he fought he shouldnt have done that alferth took a solid blow to the head and then the rest were on the driver beating him aye enough whandall said louder enough nobody chose to hear whandall couldnt watch couldnt interfere dared not show his anguish he turned to the cart instead the bed was high maybe too high it carried coils of tarred rope but not a lot of that had someone else taken to driving wine wine would distract them he felt for a loose board found a corner and lifted eyes three small faces one mouth opened to scream a childs hand covered the smaller childs mouth whandall put a finger to his lips then set back the board having seen very little but at least three children tarnisos set himself as if in a whackball game and swung his fence post at the drivers head they were killing him hed been curled around himself on the ground but at tarnisoss blow he sprawled loose and sloppy and whandall felt a rage burning outward from his belly not since hed cut hartanbath had he felt like this but he was helpless as tarnisos wound up for another blow whandall raised his hand and set tarnisoss weapon afire tarnisos dropped the flaming beam with a yell and a backward leap yanginatep was real yanginatep was in whandall as a jubilant rage he pointed into the butcher shop and it caught with a flash and a roar the men still kicking the wagoneer looked around at the sudden light and knew the burning had begun the butcher shop burned merrily in the rain flames cradling the apartment above tarnisos picked up his torch and tried to set the shop next door alight it was wet and whandall held his power back the rest were kicking smoldering wooden walls into slats to make more torches the kinless driver looked dead moving him might kill him if he wasnt but he wasnt safe here whandall crossed the mans arms and enclosed the mans elbows and torso with his own arms resalet taught his boys to do that to hold in damaged innards he eased the man into the wagon nesting him in a coil of rope he got onto the seat found the whip and used it the wagon lurched away tarnisos yelled and came pelting after him the last burning hue happened in a drought this lime everyone had stored food a handful of kinless children would not discommode the placehold whandall thought they could tend the house while the burning lasted and then go home if they still had a home but four strangers were now pelting along behind tarnisos and tarnisos had caught the wagon and was pulling himself aboard what did the man think he was doing tarnisos pulled himself over the bench back and next to whandall you felt it he crowed yanginatep alferth thought i was crazy but you feel it right right with the weight in children the ponies were pulling whandall wasnt going to outrun anything he waved behind him six followed now and one had swept up an armful of faggots whore they tarnisos looked back nobody they saw you start the burning maybe maybe maybe they recognized a falsebottomed wagon they thought they were chasing wine better distract them it was like being drunk not words he never wanted to speak but fire leaked from the joyful rage at his core the bundle of sticks flamed at both ends and the man carrying them whooped he began passing them out in some haste this next turn would take him home but whandall drove straight on behind the running men fires were catching he could not lead this merry mob to his own front door let freethspat warn them of what was coming whyd you take the tarnisos rapped the probable corpses skull him anything on him best not to let tarnisos know what he was hiding tarnisos inspected the man nothing anyone would want hes dead why did you want the wagon ive got something in mind whandall said a much easier turn came up he could follow it west and north toward the black pit then north along the coldwater until it branched into the deerpissa route whandall knew well two of the runners dropped back and then all of the rest in a clump barring one theyd stopped to gather at a store it looked like but the last runner was pumping hard monumentally ugly he was a barbarian whandall picked him for a teller just arrived he kept driving markets and large stores attracted unwanted attention they were looted too often fellers disenchanted forest was big for teps town now ahead of the burning and first of the local looters whandall pulled up in front and got out coming whandall what is it you want dunno ive never been in here before a squinting clerk approached them behind him kinless customers were moving briskly out of the store the nearsighted clerk lost his smile turned and ran whandall ignored them all he selected two big axes two long poles tipped with blades blankets rope was already in the wagon thick leather sheets loosely bound by laces one size fits all adult or child wooden masks with slits for sight he piled some into tarnisoss arms and some into his own and led the way out into the rain the teller had caught up he blocked whandalls path and tried to speak but he could do nothing but heave for breath whandalls look sent him stumbling back tarnisos stopped in the doorway nobody would want this stuff whandall i said i had something in mind he dropped his load into the wagon and returned tarnisos pushed his own load into whandalls arms theres a stash of shells somewhere in there and i want it he jogged back in pushing past the gasping teller whandall dumped the stuff into the wagon hed watched woodsmen at work long years ago what had he forgotten he had rope severs and axes sleeping gear armor lightning played through the black clouds in this light the driver looked very dead whandall lifted the man out of the wagon bed and set him under the awning poor kinless hed gotten in the way at the wrong time other kinless would heal him or bury him whandall boarded the wagon a clattering approached a wagon rounded the corner on two wheels voices hailed whandall to halt whandall reached for his rage the guard wagon flapped one great sheet of flame town guards screamed and baled out hit the dirt and rolled the teller tried to talk to a fallen guard the guards stick whacked his shin the teller danced whandall laughed a sound like a maddened bird startling himself two guards were on their feet running toward whandall waving sticks the ponies were running better now but they still wouldnt outrun men on foot whandalls wave turned their regulation sticks into torches he waved behind him setting one end of fellers disenchanted forest on fire the stairs had been at the other end tarnisos would have his chance to get out whandall didnt want him hurl he would only to be rid of him it was quiet beyond the houses lightning flickered in blackbellied clouds whandall listened for children rustling beneath the wagon bed but he heard nothing it worried him they could be suffocating whandall cursed being wet bothered him unreasonably he made for the black pit chapter the pit was changed only the stink was the same the gate was open but much of the fence was in ruins half rebuilt but not as neatly as whandall remembered as he pulled the ponies to a stop he found no mist around him and no misty monsters he was alone but for the black and silver pools that made up the pit and a scrawny coyote pacing the shore not far away eyeing him distrustfully here was no protection at all whandall kept an eye for rioters and rivals and city guards but the coyote would have fled such invaders he found the wagon beds loose corner and pulled it up he thought of the long knife he hadnt drawn and the way hed seen rats react to being trapped the children didnt move by the wave of body odor theyd been in there for some time their big eyes watched him in wariness and fear they snorted at the alien stench of the pit seven of them were packed in with hardly a wine flasks worth of empty space to share the youngest might be four and five two were hardly children at all the older boy might have been a lordkin of nineteen the girl sixteen though lordkin would have been at whandalls throat by now the girl was trying not to meet his eyes she was as beautiful as any woman hed ever seen she was slender tall for a girl her legs long and smooth surely there were lordkin among her ancestors the lines did blur between lordkin and kinless sometimes the results were wonderful his whole body and mind were ready to drown in the dark deeps of her eyes me held buck he could guess how he must look lo a kinless she was already terrified im whandall he said the man who was driving you was killed the girls shoulders slumped i knew it she whispered whandall couldnt take his eyes off her she started to cry tears welling despite her efforts at control the man must have been her father but of course whandall couldnt ask he desperately sought for something to say that wouldnt offend her wouldnt scare her away nothing came to him so he turned to the boy who are you carver ropewalker the boy said your sister whandall asked carver ropewalker nodded and sat up what are you going to do he was trying to sound brave but the fear came through in his voice and he kept glancing at whandalls big lordkin knife im not sure i got you out of the burning whandall said saved you you could at least thank me but now what you could wait here here this is the black pit whandall was listening to the boy but he was watching the girl as both climbed out of the wagon the younger children stayed in the compartment their eyes enormous the girl was crying but trying not to show it afraid but not terrified and who wouldnt be afraid of the black pit stay here with me i cant go back yet im possessed of yanginatep carver ropewalker looked at him in disbelief and a scorn he was trying to swallow the girl seemed more frightened than ever well be all right here she said she wouldnt meet whandalls eyes or even look at him whandall realized she was more afraid of him than the pit a kinless girl unmarried her father dead the city burning despite the rain now she faced a lordkin babbling that he was possessed of the fire god i didnt hurt the driver he said in case she feared that too i tried to save him but he was dying before i could get him in the wagon he didnt think they believed him yanginateps anger rose in a surge who did they think they were these were kinless kinless at his mercy and the burning had begun you can leave us here carver said he wasnt quite demanding and not quite pleading dont worry about us well get back therell be nothing to go back to the girl wailed i smelled hemp smoke after we got in the wagon compartment she peered through the gloom and rain toward the city she couldnt see you should hurry back she said youll be missing the fun yanginateps fire rose higher in whandall placehold she hated him they all hated him she was his if he wanted her and he did as he had never before wanted a woman they were all staring at whandall now carver tried to get between whandall and the girl brave and futile a silly gesture carver ropewalker was no threat none at all yanginatep or someone laughed within him and whandall moved forward his control stretched to its limits something growled behind him whandall turned gladly to face a new threat there was no threat there were only these pools of black water and the snarling coyote not water it was wave less black stuff that didnt reflect and scattered silver pools of water on top and a deers head no a terrified deer struggling neck deep its antlers jittering that was what held the coyotes attention the coyote was trying to decide whether to go after the deer it snarled at whandall mine yeah whandall focused on the far side of the black pool where the coyote was glaring at him like a rival and let a little of his rage leak out he thought the coyotes fur might puff into flame he wasnt expecting what happened an acre of black goo flamed and rose into a mushroom of fire the deer screamed and thrashed the coyote ran shadows in the flame formed a pair of daggertoothed cats who menaced the drowning deer carver ropewalker gaped at the fireball im possessed of yanginatep whandall repeated what will the burning be like if im not there it mighti dont whandalls hands were trying to speak for him he kept secrets better than he told them the girl wouldnt meet his eyes whandall felt the girls fear he suddenly understood what arshur the magnificent had tried to tell them the women of teps town wouldnt play at sex they were afraid to be noticed he forced out i dont like burning down my city every few years it makes a mess people die mothers mother says they never used to but they do now again he was speaking to carver but he was watching the girl did she look just a little less afraid but she still hated him father is dead then carver ropewalker asked the driver carver im not sure i left him where he could get help or burial he could see carver swallowing that dealing not just with his fathers death but his own new responsibility and the ambiguous dangerous presence of a firecasting lordkin presently he nodded father got in trouble he said the lordkin you know what theyve been like since the guards beat up that barbarian we have a ropewalk in the pond district yeah the pond had once belonged to the kinless now the populace was mostly lordkin the only kinless were those who couldnt afford to get out they must have felt like mammoths in a roc nest and father lost his temper how do i name you whandall asked willow ropewalker was the older girl carvers sister she finally elected to look at him but not to smile their brother carter was twelve or so his hand was hidden certainly holding a weapon the younger ones were children of carvers fathers sister hammer ms hyacinth and opal miller carver and willow and whandall got the younger children out of the wagon two were crying without sound willow looked around her and into the pit the firecats had become shadowcats in smoke they were stalking a dead tree like house cats the size of houses whandall said they wont hurt us theyre only ghosts but theyll scare everyone else off this is a good place to wait this is the black pit yes carver i know carver said all right whandall its nothing id have thought of i guess those fences will keep the kids out of the tar oh that was it the black pit smelled ferociously of rope it was tar not magic though there must be magic here tar the boy hammer said carver we stay away these ghostsdont you know how they died whandall didnt he listened carver said the tar sucked them down prey and killer together thousands of skeletons all down there in the tar their ghosts in battle until the end of time the rain fell more heavily the tar fires went out but black smoke hung over them and the rain was sooty willow tried to cover the children carver said urgently hey whandall these blankets we can spread them for an awning tilt em so they can drip go ahead for an instant carver was at a loss then he and the children began to look along shore for dead trees poles props for blanketawnings his voice drifted back then what lordkin how long will the burning last whandall didnt want to talk to them it was enough to control the rage but the boy deserved an answer theres no telling yanginatep could take someone else youll have to wait if the sky clears up look for smoke if theres no smoke over teps town go home the boy hammer miller was still in the wagon the ponies have gotten bigger he said whandall had wondered if it was his imagination the beasts had pulled more strongly as they ran toward the black fit now they shuffled with nervous energy theyd eaten every plain in reach they were bigger yes and the projections in their foreheads were horns long enough to hurt a man hammer asked what is all this stuff you brought whandall spoke his hearts desire or we could cut our way through the forest carver said youre joking but willow ropewalker ran to the wagon bed and began running her hands through the loot carver he isnt axes saws leathers up the coldwater would take us right to the forest edge we canwe can leave thats what father wanted the burning was coming he she glared at whandall oh fine and now well be taking the burning with us i dont suppose you know how to swing an ax whandall smiled at her her beauty would make him drunk if he let it i dont know willow kreeg miller never let me hold an ax but i watched i can drive ponies and i couldnt do that once but his plansdaydreams reallyhadnt run past this moment he said lady he tasted the word pelzeds woman liked to be called that lady theres a world out there what do you think could we get through father thought so said willow your army came through the forest with the lords leading you those old lordkin must have chopped their way through whandall youd better learn to use an ax youre both crazy carver said whandall recognized the way willow looked at her older brother a contempt born of too much knowledge we cant stay carver whatever we have is all gone theres a world out there ive been on the docks carver said willow just looked huh whandall said my brother was a sailor whats your point ive met sailors and lookers and tellers from all up and down the coast and farther yet all they know is this is the town they burn down willowwhandallthey dont know kinless from lordkin from lords they cant tell the difference we go out there we go as thieves forgive me you say gatherers dont you it came to whandall that he had never believed it in the first place he wasnt disappointed then to know that carver was right that wanshig had told him the same wanshig who held a post for three years and was then put back on the docks in teps town because he couldnt stop gathering because he was lordkin but the blood was draining from his face and he could only look at the ground and nod morth asked what if a magician vouched for you whandall looked up he felt that he should he startled somehow morth of atlantis looked no older than the last time whandall had seen him his clothes were inconspicuous but finer than what he had worn in teps town his hair was going gray white to gray waves of orangered running through it like cloudshadows as whandall watched morth whandall said my word should be enough i think morth said and it would be wise if we did not get closer together a magician a water magician whandall felt yanginateps rage fear came back to willows eyes and whandall fought with yanginatep morth must have felt the struggle he moved away so why would some random barbarian trust you whandall shouted for that matter something odd here where did you come from bubbles in drifting smoke a mere suggestion of huge daggertoothed cats were playing around morths feet a lurking spell it worked morth looked around him very pleased at the signs of astonishment theres still manna around this place good well be safe here until we decide whandall left his knife where it was pushed through the leather sleeve in his belt but he hadnt forgotten it he said morth you dont just happen to be here no of course not i came here because i thought you would i almost followed you but i guessed you must be in the middle of the burning so smile shrug he saw no answering understanding so he said the tattoo i prepared it after i saw the lines in your hand i can follow its pattern anywhere in the world im hoping to follow you out willow exclaimed out then you think so too its possible whandall she said his name almost defiantly whandall is he really a wizard morth of atlantis meet the ropewalkers and the millers yes willow her name didnt come easily hes a wizard once a famous one i mean look at his hair did you ever see such a color on an ordinary man morth where have you been sincesince you lost your shop i moved to the edge of the lordshills as a teacher it seemed to me that yanginatep had cost me everything burning after burning i had better go to where a god could find no magic i never built another shop i saw the ash pit some burned skulls morth must have sensed that there was more to this than curiosity yes and in the ashes did you see an iron pot with a lid no wait my brother saw that is it important it was my plan to get out it was my last treasure morths fists were clenched at his sides i thought cold iron was all i needed to protect it the burning city it never crossed my mind that cold iron can he heated the ropewalkers and millers were fascinated truly so was whandall well morth had regained control of himself i never sensed the burning i was fooling myself about that that afternoon i was eating lunch at my counter when i looked out the door at eight lordkin running straight at my shop i saw the big one cast fire from his hand and that was all i needed i went out the back my last treasure was two atlantean gold coins rich in manna get those out of teps town and im a wizard again they would have lost all magic if i hadnt stored them in a cold iron pot with a spelled lid it was too heavy for one man to carry i cut the handles off and made myself believe that nobody could stealsorry seshmarlgather it carver said seshmarl its whandall whandall admitted morth said whandall then the lordkin charged into my shop i looked back they werent chasing me i slowed and watched the big man he picked up my pot in his two arms i just have trouble believing how strong you lordkin are whandall nodded morth said id seen him start fires he was possessed of yanginatep carver and willow looked at each other i still didnt think he could get the pot open until he caused the iron to burn hot iron doesnt stop manna flow i saw him lift the lid and look inside two gold coins must have been the last thing he ever saw he hardly needed to say and then all the magical power left behind by sunken atlantis roared into a man possessed of the fire god you just dont seem to have very good luck whandall said with the placehold men and that was how he knew he was leaving he had spoken his familys name among strangers chapter the rain stopped at evening and by night the skyline had become a patchy red glow the burning continued without whandall the night seemed endless whandall made his bed on rock wrapped in a blanket snatched from fellers far enough from the kinless children to make them stop twitching he half woke from a dream of agony and rage his hands were fire that reached out to spread fire like a pestilence by touch the placehold was burning he was the placehold he was burning and his shape was gone alien a crab with a long trailing looping tail and a terrible freezing bleeding wound somewhere near his heart for a long moment he knew that fires were the nerves of yanginatep he sensed all of the fires in the valley of smokes and two ships offshore one cooking breakfast one aflame he felt his life bleeding out through lordshills where a warlocks wheel had eaten away all the magic then it all went away like any dream and left him chilled and wet he gestured and the halfdead fire flared into an inferno at least it was easy to tend a fire he was very aware of willow ropewalker not far away desire rose and he held it back as he would hold a door his weight on one side enemies on the other desire and excitement they could leave forever would they leave together morth the wizard was on the other side of the fire and he stayed there whandall had to shout anyone might overhear so he it what will happen youve seen my future is it withhe gestured to willowthem morth considered what to say i havent read their future he said i dont know them well enough to do that you may leave the valley of smokes i dont know about the millers and ropewalkers further in the future the line loops and blurs you may return he studied whandall from the other side of the fire i can say this you will have a more pleasant life with friends with people who know who you are consider seshmarlwhandallyoure choosing a new and unknown path easier to walk it with others you know what im thinking then morth shook his head sadly i know what lordkin think actually most lordkin dont think at all they just act youre different its hard whandall said morth smiled thinly i cant help anything i could do to calm you would probably kill you as youno as it your spellkilled my father whandall said morth said nothing whandall wondered if hed known all along wizard liar hed killed whandalls family yanginateps rage boiled inside him and morth was gone whandall heard a distant bush rustling flame shot high as greasewood ignited and whandall knew that hed done that he thought he saw a shadow beyond the flame morth there was no answer whandall it was carver behind him stay away im possessed of yanginatep whandall said wheres morth i dont know running the night went on endlessly and always there was the glow of fire over teps town chapter daylight whandall dreaming fire snapped awake as if he were guarding the placehold with only children for defenders they were in the wagon sleeping most of them one kinless boy was down by the fence whandall went down to shore walking wide of that black stuff that stuck to everything the boy was hammer miller whandall hailed him from a safe distance hammer turned without surprise one hand hidden the other held a milk pot i want to get some tar he said i cant let you go your sister would kill me no not willow carver might we can sell it how do you know everyone needs rope how much do you need hammer showed him a milk pot this much i dont think i can lift it when its full ill have to get carver whandall watched how they went about it first they talked the problem to death carver and willow tied a rope to hammers waist then while hammer danced with impatience they tied another rope to the neck of the jar and let the rope trail hammer went over the fence he walked with some care and twelve paces out found his feet mired the coyote came out of nowhere streaking for the mired boy whandall touched the beast with flame a ring of flame flashed outward hammer shouted and ducked the flame just singed him before it puffed out carver was cursing him whandall said didnt think sorry the coyote was gone hammer was still mired they pulled on the rope he shouted they left off long enough for him to scoop a mass of sticky black stuff into the jar waist deep now and still sinking they pulled again it was hard work whandall joined them on the rope hammer tried to drag the jar after him lost it then caught the rope that tethered the jar and dragged it a little farther when he could stand he braced himself and began pulling carver went over the fence treading in the shallow footprints hammer had left before he sank together they pulled the jar out half full enough carver said it wasnt that much different from a raid on some shop in maze walkers lurk spy out the territory test the defenses then go for it gathering what you can anything unexpected has to be fixed on the fly settle for what you can gather in one pass dont go back for more and this awful stuff which had already ruined every scrap of clothing he could see could be made into wealth by moving it somewhere else how did they know that was the hard part now the wagon stank of tar not of bodies long confined the ponies pulled more strongly as they moved northwest whandall waited until he was moving up the deerpiss before he made the ropewalkers and millers get under the floorboards tar pot on top a guard would think hard before he lifted that the brick guardhouse was in sight its gates closed opening them wouldnt be complicated a guard popped out saw him shouted staxir two more stepped out to study his approach they all wore armor but on this hot day none of them were fully protected though they all wore masks they swung the gate open and retreated back under an awning what were toronexti doing here though they looked edgy weapons drawn it looked like he could just drive on through nan he stopped alongside the awning and before any of them could speak asked staxir what are you doing here the vineyards nothing but muck they laughed they were older lordkin and wiser were not here for alferth well miss the wine though stax this is the path the toronexti have to be here if the kinless want to leave another surprise whandall asked the path goes right through the forest really no but kinless still try it staxir said the burning could start any hour and dont they know it so we look in their wagons and take what looks good and in a day they come back and we take whatre you carrying whandall said stuff for cutting trees what is that stink tar the woodsmen they cover their hands with it to stop plant poisons therere kinless out past here getting lumber arent there no staxir said whandall scratched his head well there will be the burning is on so i took this stuff i can keep it in the wine house day or two men who might have taken some of his good tools a moment ago thought again eyes turned toward teps town staxir said we gotta be here kinlessll be trying to get out again with everything they own you dont need us all stax safer here dryer sounds of disgust whandall waved and drove on he could guess the unspoken a wagoneer who came this way with heavy gear to sell would be back with shells for a tax mans pockets but whandall didnt plan to come back weeds were starting to cover the trampled vineyard whandall pulled the wagon behind the brick wine house the roof wasnt brick it had been timber and thatch and it had burned whandall cursed he was tired of being wet he got the children out of the wagon two youngsters were beginning to cry without sound whandall helped willow out carver rejected his hand he was still looking at whandall like a dangerous animal it was getting on his nerves a stub of blackened timber poked from the wine house roof whandall let a little of his rage leak into it against the blackbellied clouds it made orangewhite light and a bit of heat willow looked around her and said were at the forest what is this place carver asked wine house whandall said the roofs gone but the walls are still up shelter but it was not yet noon and he didnt want to stop he looked at the malevolent forest across his path could they really get through that carver walked toward the woods and into them careful whandall called he followed with willow just behind him the redwoods towered over them these were young trees though tall enough to cut the force of winddriven rain deeper in they would be much bigger a hundred varieties of thorns and poison plants clustered protectively around their bases whandall spoke to willow hoping that carver and the children would listen you didnt lecture a grown man directly if you could avoid it stay clear of this thorny stuff its too dark to see how close you are at night you wouldnt move at all these pine trees they wont hurt you almost everything else will even the redwoods make you want to look up when you should be watching your feet where did you learn about the forest the twelveyearold asked i used to watch the loggers carter i carried water for them carver do you think we can cut our way through here you brought those cutting things severs severs we can use those carver said but the plants can always reach farther than you think you think youve got clearance butim worried about the children these leathersll fit the older ones and us we could cut a path for children whandall thought or a wider path for a wagon but how far did the forest go it took an army half a year to get through two hundred years ago whandall said we only need enough for one wagon willow said briskly we go around what we can cut when we have to sell the lumber gear when we get to the other side and the tar if theres anyone to buy did you bring a whetstone whatever that is i didnt bring it whandall hadnt thought in terms of buying and selling kinless would know how to trade how to work how to find work on the other side of the forest lordkin would not have license to take what they wanted he hadnt missed that point but he was starting to feel its force but he felt the warmth stirring in his belly not unlike lust not unlike the heat that rose from wine alferth was wrong to call it anger this was yanginateps path his arm reached forward and the heat ran through his fingertips feeling out the old path far beyond what his eyes could see yanginateps trailing tail the dream held for an instant and was gone again brushwood caught vines and thorn plants burned in the rain an eddy swirled the smoke around them and made them choke then the wind steadied blowing it north ahead of them chapter the land ran generally uphill the flamepath didnt cramp them but it wasnt quite a road there were stumps whandall had to burn out the horses were grown visibly stronger they pulled with little effort but they shied at carvers touch on the reins whandall tried it both ponies stopped and turned to look at him along spiral spears as long as a forearm willow took the reins from his unresisting hands and the ponies turned and began to pull that first night they stripped a dozen crabapple trees for their dinner children didnt need to be instructed to hurl the cores away they did it by instinct carver suggested that whandall sleep between the wagon and the vineyards lordkin might follow the scorched path he said carver was trying to protect willow whandall went along with that but in the morning he told carver we dont need a guard at night only a madman would walk through the forest in the dark he pointed back down the trail a blackened ruin ash and mud with a few flecks of green growing into it it wasnt straight and it certainly wasnt inviting thats odd carver said he pointed ahead the trail remained black no traces of green at all the redwoods stood like pillars holding up the blackbellied clouds their shadows made a twilight even at noon where whandalls fire had gone they saw nothing of predators and nothing of prey they had to strike out sideways to their path to find anything to cut willow picked an apronful of small red berries for them delicious whandall watched her mind wrestle with itself before she warned him whandall dont eat these berries if theyre growing near a redwood i know we need to keep the kids away from any berry patch the poison patches look too much like red berries carver made slings a weapon new to whandall it would send a stone flying at uncanny speed carver was good with a sling carter was even better whandall developed some skill they were able to feed themselves and the children and to fend off coyotes kinless with weapons kinless skilled with weapons he half remembered the lords talking of an old war fought against the kinless how had kinless fought had they used slings why had they lost he dreamed that night of lords with helmets and armor and spears leading a horde of lordkin with knives they fought a smaller slimmer people who used slings and small javelins the stones rattled against the lords shields a few mad lordkin held their hands out and sheets of fire flowed into the kinless ranks and every one of the firewielding lordkin looked like whandall in rain they had slept under the wagon theyd left the rain behind and now they could sleep in the wagon off the ground fire was easy halfburned charcoal was everywhere they dug a midden and laid a ridge of dirt from the midden to the wagon in the dark a child could follow it by feel whandall watched them studying how the kinless worked how the kinless thought how they talked always they talked their third morning brought them to the crest of the mountains downhill the land was blackened and almost bare plants were growing back whandall hadnt done this it was half a year old but the going looked easy and the path was clear whandalls new burn switch backed through the halfgrown plants like a black snake whandall this is easy traveling and we dont need your fire lets go back for another wagon who carver he asked knowing carver would never leave whandall with willow lordkin men guarded their women no less than carver did you and me willow you can keep the wagon moving cant you the ponies wont mind anyone else anyway if you get into trouble just stop green creepers were sprouting everywhere along the path poking through the ash of whandalls burning between dawn and sunset carver and whandall retraced their path through the burned woods a wagon had been left near the loading dock one of the mares had wandered into view she was smaller than the stallion ponies and her horn was just a nub they watched the wine house through sunset until midnight before they believed that it was deserted then carver approached the mare and was able to put a bridle on her they found hundreds of little flasks heaped against a wall empty whandall pointed out well made though they wont leak maybe we can sell them on the other side they heaped the wagon with flasks and cut some grass for the mare too they slept in the ruined wine house in the morning whandall rode facing backward wary that something might follow while carver drove carver grumbled we didnt see anyone following us lordkin know how to lurk some halfsuspected danger tapped at the floor of whandalls mind he watched their back path it wasnt black anymore it was green this ash must make wonderful fertilizer he said carver turned around you can almost see it growing ahead of them was only blackened dirt yanginatep whandall said wants us gone carver snapped when did your fire god become a fertility goddess not yanginatep then but something wants us gone the forest whandall remembered days in morths shop morth reading his palm mumbling about whandalls destiny could a god read destiny too i think thats it im carrying fire through a forest were being expelled carver said whandall shook his head smiling youre escaping im being expelled and even as he watched the trail behind seemed to grow more creepers travel went fast the mare grew stronger as they traveled and larger but she wasnt giving them any trouble behind them the trails outline blurred with green coyotes had discovered the travelers abandoned middens that was scary that evening whandall and carver crawled under the wagon to sleep back to back and armed a voice in the dark this magician who killed your lather did you try to kill him no carver good whandall believed he had nothing to hide from carver nothing so monstrous as the open truth of what he was still sharing secrets outside the family seemed unnatural into the quiet dark carver said did you know that plague is a kind of living thing wizards can see it wizards can kill it and heal the client otherwise it grows without a wizard other people get sick too more and more we need wizards but wizards dont like the valley of smokes course not no magic the dark was silent a while longer then carver asked why not kill morth why your father morth did what kinless do sorry taxpayers what we do too if pothefit caught a looker taking the cook pot from the placehold courtyard hedve killed him it was too dark to see carvers expression whandall said the burning killed pothefit in the burning you can have anything you can take they couldnt take morths shop silence from carver the woods stirred something died violently thats what i was trying to remember whandall said suddenly morth could follow us i keep forgetting morth carver we wouldnt see him that lurk spell near sunset of the next day they reached the crest of the mountains and found two dead coyotes near a dead campfire carver ran whandall watched him disappear into the rocks he almost followed coyotes might menace willow and the children but whandall was trying to learn kinless ways and what about the wagon unhitching the mare wasnt easy she tried to pull the rope out of his hands he hung on long enough to tie it to a tree stump the length of it would let her reach forage she had her horn if coyotes came back thenbut wait what had killed these beasts he stooped over one of the corpses not a mark on them wide bloodred eyes mouths wide tongues protruding he touched the slickeddown fur expecting to find it wet but it wasnt he caught carver far down slope at the next dead campfire there they slowed to a walk blowing hard willow and the wagon must have taken a full day to cover this distance carvers hands held his sling and a handful of rocks cracked to get sharp edges he said i wish had a knife whandall said with that you dont have to let them so close i wish i had a sever day was dying they smelled meat cooking and they slowed they saw the fire first and a young looker standing tall and straight backlit with orangered hair falling to his shoulders willow had the horses tied and a fire going then a whiff of corruption showed an arc of dead coyotes at their feet willow saw two men coming at a grim halfrun whandalls knife point carvers whirling sling she leaped up from her cooking and stepped quickly to the mans side he saved us she shouted the coyotes would have torn us apart carvers sling drooped he said morth morth smiled faintly morth youre young yes i found this morth held out a handful of yellow lumps whandall had never before seen the magician gleeful gold he said in the river he stepped forward past whandalls knifepoint and pushed the gold into whandalls unresisting hand whandall said this is dangerous isnt it wild magic no no this gold is refined ive taken the magic morth said cant you see shall we race shall i stand on my head for you im young carver backed up a bit and so did willow here was no lurking spell morth wanted to be noticed he babbled gold is magic it reinforces other magic look he leaped straight up and kept rising until he could grasp a branch twice whandalls height above him he shouted down not just young i used to fly he dropped lightly give gold to a wizard most of the power leaches from the gold after that its refined gold harmless people use it as if it has value but the original meaning was i gave gold to a wizard to touch a wizard owes me whandall keep the gold morth of atlantis owes you whandall put the nuggets in the pouch beneath his waistband he asked why morth laughed youre guiding me out whandalls fingers brushed his cheek the tattoo he couldnt see and every wizard in the world can track me every atlantean wizard morth said and laughed like a lunatic chapter willow had roasted a halfgrown deer and some roots morth had found the adults held backeven morth even whandall ravenous but following their leaduntil the children were fed then they dug in carver suddenly cried out lordkin did you do anything about the other wagon whandall told him what hed done but the mare doesnt like me so youll have to go get her yourself unless you think we should both go whandall enjoyed what carvers face did then leave willow with whandall or leave the wizard with willow and no whandall to guard him or take willow leaving the children alone with the wizard and the lordkin and nobody who could handle bonehead stallions ill go it can wait till morning i should hope so the night was black as the inside of a lions belly whandall had to imagine carver willow morth the gently snoring carter and himself arrayed in a fivepointed star in the dirt near the wagon feet pointing inward severs ready to hand the children in the wagon hyacinth dropping over the side sleepy and clumsy thud crawling away to use the pit its the biggest burn patch weve seen it took us all day to cross it and half of yesterday willows voice in the dark wondering and content joking whandall said this lire wasnt mine lightning willow said lightning hits the highest tree it burns afterward the redwood grows in two prongs sometimes coals fall and a patch of forest catches why doesnt the whole forest burn woodsmen just go home when they see a fire she said patches burn then they go out morth said yanginatep spends most of his time in a deathsleep but a big fire wakes him feeds him fire is yanginateps life a companionable silence then carver said sleepily what if you dont believe in yanginatep whandall raised his voice above morths laugh carver firewand seeds dont sprout unless theres been a fire neither does redwood this land is fires home teps town valley of smokes smokes would have been burned out before i was ever born if some power werent snuffing the fires yanginatep is the reason fire wont burn indoors theres a truce between yanginatep and the redwoods so they dont burn i tried to tell kreeg miller a taxpayer woodsman willow said there are a lot of people named miller whandall had nursed a hope that he was helping kreeg millers relatives there was an old debt hed never acknowledged willow said outside the forest theres no yanginatep you could cook indoors get your food still hot yes yes said morth and whandall well i never heard of such a thing but well see willow turned and was asleep whandall rolled his blanket tighter around him wishing he could get up and stroll around knowing that a thorn plant or laurel branch would surely slash him if he did they had left the rain behind the sound of the night was wind and sometimes a tiny cry of mortal agony chapter for a time the wagon moved easily downhill with willow at the reins then they had to use the severs sliding the poles under nettles and morningstars and lordkinskiss to cut the roots with the blades to shape a path wide enough for children and a wagon they could have used carvers help but carver had gone back for the mare and second wagon willow spoke this yellow blanket this we use to clean the severs to get the poison sap off use the rough side only you dont ever touch it right hammer iris hyacinth opal the children nodded this one blanket because theres nothing else that color the blanket hangs here on the wagon tongue never moves so anyone can find it they saw problems before they happened looked for them they lectured each other as easily as they lectured a lordkin male carter and hammer were assigned to hold the other children together they moved fairly rapidly half a morning later whandall remembered part of the deer left in the wagon from last night he dropped the sever stood up whandall dont try to save work touchme venom can stay on a blade and brush off on the wagon and then on a child someone could sit on it its clean when it leaves your hands every time willow said understand a blank face hid his rage whandall picked up the sever and wiped the blade clean willow had treated him like a child a bad child in front of morth and the children carter and morth both had the grace to be paying attention to something else if carver had been here whandall might have had to hurt him in a later calmer moment it came to him that she hadnt spoken by chance willow had been watching waiting for him to do what he did a stand of lordkiss blocked whandalls scorchpath its leaves barely singed morth called whandall dont burn it youd strangle us all the smoke is poisonous whandall had reached for yanginateps rage and found only a dying ember the fire god was leaving him they had to dig a path around the lordkiss he thought of it as showing off his strength to make it feel less like work in early afternoon they broke through the undergrowth above running water through sparse branches whandall saw a far distant mass floating in the sky a cone with its base in cloud gray rock and greentinged black capped with blazing white morth gaped what is that the legends said it would be there carter mused before the lordkin came there was a path through the forest mount joy willow whispered but the story said you could only see it if you were worthy one of the heroes holaman carter said yes he spent a lifetime searching for this vision willow said are we blessed with good weather morth said but i think my path leads there he held his arm out palm down and looked along it first with his fingers together then spread magic carter asked no navigation if your stories are right we wont see this again so im looking for landmarks in line with it looks hard to reach carter said whandall was thinking impossible but for a wizard morth said the worlds most inaccessible places are the places where wizards have never used up the manna i have to go there gold would keep me alive but the magic in gold is chaotic i was too long in teps town morth ran his hand distractedly through his hair i need the magic in nature to fully heal too much gold would drive me crazy he looked at the fistful of red and white strands he was holding and whooped laughter too little is bad too willow led the stallions the wagon lurched and sometimes the children had to heave up on the downside to keep it from rolling over still matters had improved nothing ahead of them seemed to need cutting the vegetation grew right up against the shore and it was touchme all the way but the river ran shallow at the edges and the wagon wheels would only run a few hands deep willow said well find easier traveling if we follow the river whandall waited for morths reaction hed been treating morth like a friend who sniffs white powder a dubious ally this might be the chance to be rid of him but morth only said you cant stay with the river long no of course not wagons dont go on water do they whandall surprised to be asked his opinion whandall said willow people dont go on water either the way she looked at him he flushed she asked whandall cant you swim no my brother can i meant morth said gently that the sprite cant get to me right away but he must know im here lets see how far we can get the river continued shallow the wagon bumped over rocks they had to run slow where the still growing ponies wanted to run carter and willow couldnt leave them without their becoming restive theyd grown large and dangerous as big as lords horses with horns that would outreach whandalls lordkin knife i could spell them morth said gentle them no morth was as twitchy as the ponies whandall didnt trust his magic well at least i can dispel the stink of tar he gestured but nothing happened the smell was still there morth frowned then danced ahead vanished out of sight a fat lot of help he was but it could be said that he was scouting terrain springing traps that would otherwise wait for children and a wagon the ponies and wagon plodded on veering around deeper pools rolling over rocks wobbling tilting held from rolling over only by a lordkins strong shoulder whenever whandall hoped to leave this snails trek and follow the magician carver wouldnt have much trouble catching up whandall decided hed find a path carved ahead of him they were halfway down the mountain when morth came bounding back bellowing dont any of you lordspawns get hungry he gestured and sang and suddenly whandalls clothes were clean even the tar stains were gone now to eat the children chorused their agreement morth roared laughter i could eat the gods know what i could eat he faced the woods and raised his hands as if they held invisible threads lets just see seshmarl a fire whandall gathered an armful of dry brush and set a few fallen limbs on it his touch raised no more than a wisp of smoke it was not that he enjoyed being ordered about like a kinless but whandall preferred to hide how weakly the power of yanginatep ran in him and morths hands still waved their messages into the forest while white chased red in waves down morths luxuriant mane and beard whandall coaxed the smoldering kindling until flame rose toward his fingertips when morth turned from the woods there was fire animals came trooping out of the wood a gopher a turkey a fawn a redtailed hawk a halfstarved cat as big as hammer and a family of six raccoons all filed up to morth and sorted themselves by size the cat was smaller than the ghosts of the black pit and it didnt have those huge dagger teeth whandall made a sound of disgust an animal might be meat but it should be hunted altering its mind was but the animals were strangling all but the raccoons were reaching for air and not finding it thrashing gaping dying the bird tried to reach morth and would have if he hadnt dodged and then it was dead too drowned and a burbling chuckle leaked out of morth whandall reached for his knife it wasnt needed he and the kinless watched as two adult and four halfgrown raccoons stripped the feathers from the bird and butchered the drowned animals with their clawed hands skewered the meat and set it broiling the children watched in fascination the raccoons all spasmed at once looked and instantly disappeared into the chaparral hawk had a miserable taste but everyone tried it willow convinced the children that theyd brag about this for the rest of their lives turkey and deer were very good and gopher could be eaten they had safe fruit morth had found with his ability to see poison it struck whandall that he had not eaten this well since lord samortys kitchen in early afternoon morth suddenly said here and waded into the stream whandall was startled morth arent you afraid of water weve hours before the sprite can get here morth bent above the purling water with his arms elbow deep fingers spread just above the river bed whandall saw golden sand flow toward him merging into a lump ah he said he picked up a mass the size of his head as if it were no heavier than a ball of feathers for a time he stood holding the gold against his chest with his eyes half closed and the look of a man breathing brown powder smoke from a clay pot then he handed it to whandall again for my debt put this in the wagon whandall took it he wasnt prepared for its weight it would have smashed his toes and fingers if hed been a bit less agile morth was helpless on the ground laughing almost silently hk hk hk with every eye on him whandall set himself lifted hugged the gold to his chest and carried it toward the wagon morth rolled over and stood up mud covered his sopping wet robe hed lost weight his ribs showed through the cloth his hair was red and thick and curly his long smooth bony face wore a feral look like a young lordkin about to test his knife skills for the first time thats better he said little more of that he walked back into the river and began wading downstream willow repacked the wagon whandall helping while the children put out the fire and wrapped the remaining deer meat in grass whandall said he never helps willow looked startled you dont either im helping now well yes thank you you dont do it often well its because the ponies dont like you what i meant was you dont seem to notice whandall said morth has lived in teps town longer than ive been alive but hes a looker do you see him as a yes maybe willow laughed uneasily hes a funnylooking lordkin crazy and dangerous and sometimes he can do something we cant they set off with the wagon they saw morth rock hopping downstream until the river turned late afternoon whandall heaved upward while the ponies pulled the wagon lurched rolled and was back into riverbed that was shallow and flat i quit willow said whandall looked up she was riding he was walking but she was exhausted the restive ponies had worn her out we have to get the wagon on shore he said do we really the water thing that hunts morth its coming up the river we dont want to be in the way and there isnt any shore yet so they wrestled the wagon through another eighty paces of rough water then there was a strip of sand and a sloping bank they could push the wagon up and willow could sleep forty feet above the water whandall had worked hard too had worked he was new to that it was good to lie down on warm earth the children lay about him all asleep willow was curled up with a tree root for a pillow comfortably distant from the lordkin with ponies tethered on either side one rope strung between two trees whandall watched her for a time his mind adrift the ponies looked up at him he felt the heat of their stare they stood they pulled in opposite directions a steady pressure the rope parted silently they walked directly toward him whandall scrambled to his feet already choosing a tree to climb but a stallion trotted to block it he picked another and that was blocked the rocks yes the rock slope behind him he ran toward it ahead of a pair of ponies charging at full tilt their horns lowered it all had a dreadful familiarity he knew exactly what to do because the ponies behaved exactly like a pair of bull fizzle bullies and if he couldnt get around them hed be dead he was climbing the rocks before they reached him and then the rocks impeded their hooves but the slope was steep stones rolleda pony screamedhe kicked a few loose on purpose and now he was high above them hed have taunted them like frustrated bull fizzle lordkin but ponies didnt act like this ensorcelled he reached into his pants into the concealed pouch and found morths handful of gold dust he tossed a cloud of gold over them the ponies went mad scrambling at the slope risking their hooves and their bones and their lives then they paused looked at each other turned and trotted then galloped back toward the wagon wild magic would strengthen a spell but disrupt it too morth had said but who could have spelled these ponies if not morth of atlantis whandall scrambled down the slope chasing the bonehead ponies willow was standing in the wagon bed holding a sever morth stood out of range laughing ignoring the ponies who were now menacing him the air around him seemed to sizzle whandall called willow she was near tears and glad to see him he wantedi dont know what he wanted i didnt let him get that far morth was offended no woman would have reason to be insulted id never have offered if i hadnt seen something of lost atlantis in you i have gold he held a yellow chunk the size of a childs head in each hand he stood as if bracketed by suns willow ropewalker i have power i can protect you from whatever dangers await us can you hold a man when you lose your youth you dont have to get old and i dont either the heat rose up in whandall hut only the merest flicker he reached for yanginatep but yanginatep was gone he drew his knife he saw morths hands rise willow raised the sever as if she would throw it stop she commanded morth turned toward her his back toward whandall what must do to convince you i mean no harm willow forget what i spoke leave her mind alone morth laughed his hands wove invisible threads a great calm settled on whandall he knew that this was the spell that had killed his father smiling gently he strolled toward morth morth watched with interest whandall was well within range now but first he gave warning morth do you think that i cant kill a man without getting angry first seshmarl you surprise me leave us weve helped each other but you dont need us anymore oh you need me morth said his eyes flicked away and back and he laughed again whandall held his pose morth would be dead before he had spat out the first syllable of a spell you need me elsewhere seshmarl so here is more gold refined morth dropped the gold and danced away he was ten paces uphill from whandalls reflexive lunge dancing between bouquets of swords and slashing laurels faster than the plants could move in the gathering dusk he paused on the rocky crest and shouted downstream you a wave was rolling up the river tidal bore a later age would call such a thing it followed the rivers meandering path growing taller as it came it would drown this camp morth watched it and laughed you aquarius morth was tiny with distance but they heard him clearly you great stupid wall of water do you know that youve made me rich now see if you can follow me and morth ran the fastest lordkin chased by the most savage band had never run so fast as morth the wave left the rivers course and tried to follow him straight up a hillside and along the crest dwindling slumping morths manic laughter followed him down a hill and up another straight toward the distant whitetopped cone of mount joy until he was no more than a bright dot on the minds eye they waited until evening before going to the river for drinking water the river roiled with white froth and weird currents even where there were no rocks chapter at dusk whandall tried to start a cook fire but the power had left him there was plenty of cooked meat from morths feast but there would be no more cooking until they could learn to make fire the absence of yanginatep was loss and gain like a toothache gone and the tooth with it carver rejoined them by the light of a setting halfmoon whandall was ready to kill him even after he knew that the sound of a mare and wagon thrashing through brush wasnt a dozen coyotes fool kinless maybe the mares magic led him through that maze of death willow spoke before whandall could brother have you been traveling through chaparral by dark willow i was worried her voice was low and her speech was refined and whandall listened in awe and dread he never wanted to hear her speak to him that way carver lay between them in the night when willow might be asleep he rolled toward whandall and said i was afraid for her i was afraid whandall whispered i hear you silence you missed all the excitement ill tell you tomorrow there were stretches of narrow beach elsewhere they could rockhop or wade but the moment came when they reached a deep pool with vertical walls on either side carver said im going to teach you to swim at first it seemed the cold would kill him its bite eased quickly the bottom was soft mud a delight to the toes the water came to his chin he couldnt really drown still for a time it felt like carver and willow had decided to drown him sweep your arms to push the water back and breathe in while the water isnt in your face breathe out anytime he began to feel the how and why of it but already the trees hid the sun and he was exhausted and shaking with cold and ahead was the river with no way up the bank they would have to go on how far whandall didnt know there was no fire they ate cold meat and berries by the light of a growing moon the night closed down while the elders described their river trip and the swimming lesson amid much laughter presently whandall asked of nobody in particular what do you think is out there we never get lookers from the other side of the forest carver said maybe theres nothing maybe nothing but farms or herdsmen or more forest or nothing at all whandall said no lordkin anyway willow said doesnt mean there cant be carver searched for a better word then gave up thieves or old stories about lordkin we dont know that they dont know about lordkin tomorrow you stay with the children whandall they couldnt keep up anyway carver i can swim you taught me you learned fast too willow assured him her hand was on his arm she hadnt done that before now you know how to swim in a pool whandall if you ever fall in the water you might even get out alive but well be wading in a running river you shouldnt come anyway carver said you shouldnt be seen well take carter and the severs better leave you one sever for the coyotes whandall well come back when we know where the river goes whandall wished he could see their faces he was just as glad that they couldnt see his for two days whandall kept himself and the children busy widening the path to the river giving them more safe space to roam whandall and hammer found unwary prey at the edges of the scorch hammer knew how to fish me tried to teach whandall and whandall caught two they ate them raw feeding the ponies was difficult they couldnt be let loose to graze because no one but willow could catch them whandall gathered anything that looked like grass or straw and the children carried the fodder up to where the ponies were tethered they had to carry water as well if whandall came near the ponies they menaced him with their horns and strained at the ropes holding them to trees more than once whandall was grateful that the ropewalkers knew their craft but all three of the ropewalker family were gone leaving him with the four miller children and one of the wagons the wagon with the bottles and the gold whandall knew nothing of kinless families loyalties infighting grudges it worried him carver and willow and carter ropewalker might cease to need him very soon it might have happened already a lordkin with a knife would be all he was and all he had for whatever that might mean to strangers on this side of the forest in teps town a lordkin with a knife need be nothing more he could go back what could stop him but strangers guarded the placehold men brought home by placehold women during the past few years they could protect the house if they had the nerve they might have lost it already they had little in common with whandall placehold elriss and wanshig were friends but they were together with their children most of the time wess had another man and another after that and never came back to whandall other women were friends for a day or a week never more alferths wine wagons had nothing to carry what was there to hold whandall in teps town here on the other side of the forest lordkin might be unknown he did not know how he would survive where he could not simply gather what he needed but kinless knew how to make things happen it wasnt all luck and a lordkin knife they could teach whandall as theyd taught him to swim hed brought them out of the burning city they owed him and there was willow if only a lordkin could have a kinless woman but only by force and he could not force willow he could treat herhe had treated herwith the respect he would give a lordkin woman she seemed to have lost her fear of him and he was glad of that but why would willow look at a lordkin male it was not too late to go back take the miller children give them over to the first kinless he met these thoughts played through his mind while he hunted food for the children and tried to keep them out of trouble at the next noon the ropewalkers were back a road willow told them and a long way up the road are some houses how far whandall asked we can be to the road tomorrow afternoon if we start now whandall thought about that what are the people like we didnt see any people willow said we didnt want to be seen carver said so we didnt get very close what are the houses like whandall asked squarish made of wood solid looking well made roofs like this he held his hands to indicate a peaked roof unlike the flat roofs that were more usual in teps town very solid interesting whandall said like lords houses made by people not afraid of burning yes willow clapped her hands i never thought of that but yes whandall got up ill load the wagon youll have to hitch the ponies part six the bison tribe chapter the ponies were as big as lords horses now and each had a spiral horn larger than a lordkin knife growing from his forehead outside conditions had bleached them they were as white as chalk with long silky manes they looked nothing like the kinless ponies theyd been the mare was nearly as big as the stallions but her horn was smaller and she hadnt lost the gray coloring she was tame the stallions were not tame they went frantic when whandall or carver approached them they wouldnt attack the children but only willow could bridle them and hitch them to the wagon if she tried to ride on the wagon they stopped and waited until she walked ahead again one more night on the river whandall sat and stared at the water what would they find ahead what would willow do she lay asleep next to her brother her straight black hair was a tangle and she slept from exhaustion and whandall thought her the most beautiful woman he had ever seen he wondered at that magic they started early the next day and at noon they came to a bend in the river carter pointed excitedly the road is just up there he pointed up the steep slope there were trees in the way whandall scouted out a route to the road by going around they could avoid most of the trees but finally there was no choice theyd have to cut two trees to get through neither tree seemed to be guarded by other plants there were few plants in the forest and those were just hushes and leafy plants without thorns they didnt move when approached this tree was broadleafed the trunk thinner than a mans body whandall bowed to it as hed seen kreeg miller do then chopped a deep notch on one side in the direction he wanted it to fall then he and carver chopped on the other side until it fell not quite where he wanted but out of the way the other larger tree dropped exactly where whandall aimed it and they were free to go to the road willow brought up the horses and wagon you bowed to the tree she said whandall shrugged woodsmen do that willow giggled to redwoods she said not to all the trees just redwoods there arent any redwoods here willows smile faded slightly i know you care she said grandmother loved them i think we protected each other humans and redwoods before the lordkin came here theyre gone maybe well find more whandall said he looked at the trees hed felled we wont run out of wood anyway maybe someone will have a fire i hope so willow said bathing in cold water ugh kinless women took baths every day whandall had learned even when there wasnt soap or hot water nothing but a stream it seemed a strange custom hed jumped in himself and whooped and thrashed like the others to show that he too could stand cold the road was no more than a deeply rutted track but while the river itself wandered in sweeping curves like a snake the road was straight here and there the river had changed course to undermine the road there the road curved away from the river then straightened out again they had jerked meat and bread theyd baked when they had fire evening found them on the road just after dusk carver looked at the night sky were going north he said how do you know that whandall asked stars willow said father taught carver how to read stars its hard carver said i looked last night and i couldnt tell there are more stars here lots more too many to recognize this early in the evening it looks right but when its dark there are thousands and thousands of stars what are stars carter asked dargramnet whandall hesitated my mothers mother she said the stars are cook fires of our ancestors cook fires and bonfires to yanginatep you hesitated willow said you do that when you speak of your family why wethe lordkindont talk about families to strangers whandall said or even close friends why not whandall shook his head we just dont i think part of it is certainty you know who your mother is but not always your father and your mother might go off anytime even when you think you knowbut you know dont you how whandall girls dont sleep with men until theyre married willow said sleeping wasnt what made babies but this seemed to be a language thing did she really mean whandall asked what happens if they do no one will marry them willow said pink was flooding into her neck and cheeks even if its not their fault there was a girl the daughter of a friend of mothers dreamlotus was a few years older than me old enough to be attractive during the last burning some lordkin men caught her they almost killed her maybe it would have been better if they did whandalls voice came out funny why she had a baby willow said it wasnt her faulteveryone knew thatbut she had a baby and no man would have her her father died and then her brother drank himself to death what happened to her whandall asked he didnt dare ask about the baby we dont know after mother died we lost track of dreamlotus she always wanted a job in the lordshills maybe she went there they came to the edge of the town at noon the next day first there were the dogs they ran barking toward willow one got too close and the rightside pony lowered his horn and lunged the dog ran away howling the barking and howling brought two townsmen they were big men dark of complexion each with long straight black hair braided in a queue hanging down his back one held a leather sling in one hand and a rock in the other the other man had an ax they shouted something unintelligible first at whandall then at the howling dog the dog came over to them and the man with the ax bent to examine it he spoke without getting up and the other man nodded whandalls thumbnail brushed the big lordkin knife at his belt just to know where it was the men looked from whandall on the wagon to willow walking ahead of the horses frowned and one said something to the other then they pointed to the horses and one laughed hello whandall said where are we no response he repeated himself in condigeano the man with the leather sling said something saw whandall didnt uncleisland and pointed up the road they culled their dugs and watched until willow had led the wagon out of sight whandall counted twenty houses before he stopped trying to count them there were at least that many more strung along three parallel dusty streets the largest house was about the size of a good lordkin house in teps town but they had flower gardens in front and a few had fenced yards they didnt look as elegant as lords houses but they were not crude and they were clearly built to last a generation and more some wood some baked clay none stone at the far end of town was a wagon camp a dozen or more big covered wagons drawn into a circle just before the wagon circle there was a wooden rail corral holding a hundred or more great shaggy beasts they seemed to have no necks their eyes stared out of a big collar of fur and they had short curved horns and lashing tails they stood in a circle the biggest ones on the outside smaller ones inside and they munched on baled hay while staring malevolently at whandall and his wagon when willow tried to speak to a gaudily dressed lady on the dusty town main street she didnt seem unfriendly but she only laughed and pointed to the wagon circle my feet hurt willow said two boys came out of the wagon train circle and shouted something whandall gestured helplessly they laughed and went back inside and in a moment a large man of around forty came out his face was weathered and he had a bit of a squint he was lighter of complexion than the men theyd seen earlier he was dressed in leather long trousers longsleeved pullover tunic soft leather boots a big red moon was painted on the left breast of his tunic red and blue animals chased each other in a circle around the moon a dark red sun blazed on his back and below it warriors with spears chased a herd of the same ugly beasts theyd seen in the corral his hair was black with some gray at the temples plaited into a queue that hung halfway down his back there were feathers in his hair and he wore a bright silver ring with a big bluegreen stone another silver and bluegreen design hung on a thong around his neck his belt held a very serviceablelooking knife with a fancily carved bone handle the blade was not as long as whandalls lordkin knife hi yo keenm his ho whandall shook his head whandall he said from teps town the man considered that know condigeano i speak good condigeano whandall said excitedly good i dont speak your tongue not much contact with the valley of smokes he said howd you get here we cut a path through the forest whandall said im impressed he looked from whandall to willow looked at the ponies looked at the children on the wagon dont think i ever met anyone who got out that way theres a few harpies in condigeo but they got there by ship willow looked back at whandall harpies she said i guess he means us whandall said willow shuddered tell him she caught herself finelooking onehorns the man said looking to sell them no i dont think so whandall said well all right that your sister whandall choked back the automatic rage at the impertinent question no um you hungry my names black kettle by the way he patted his ample paunch but everybody calls me kettle belly he swept his hand to indicate the wagon train this is the bison clan i am whandall clan that was too complicated and thats willow her brothers carver and carter the children are cousins whandall said ah your girl i already told you more than you have to know but the question seemed innocent enough maybe people here talked about such things tras preetror had willow wouldnt understand him whandall said i hope so kettle belly smiled good finelooking girl here follow me well get you something to eat thanks we could use fire too kettle belly laughed heartily a valley of smokes harpy cant make fire whandall wanted to resent that but kettle belly seemed so friendly and well intentioned that he couldnt instead he laughed never learned how never needed to guess i understand that all right kettle belly said you come on with me then he turned to one of the children number three im four kettle belly roared laughter again and gave instructions he turned back to whandall i told him to let mother know weve got company and hell look up haj fishhawks wife she came from the valley of smokes shell be able to talk to your friends when youre ready to trade those onehorns let me know ill give you a good price and show you how to drive bison why would i want to sell them kettle belly smiled indulgently well something might come up ruby fishhawk was at least fifty a kinless woman with soft eyes and long fluffy hair gone white as soon as she met willow she began asking questions about family who was willows mother who was her fathers mother in minutes she found that willows fathers mother had married rubys aunts brother and willows mothers brother was rubys cousin but youre tired kettle belly says you dont have fire how long three days willow said you poor thing come with me i have a bathtub i love my husband i love the trader folk but they dont bathe properly sweat lodges are all very well but theres nothing like a proper bath come on ill show you what about the horses willow asked whandall cant handle them ruby grinned as if willow had made a good joke well take care of that she spoke rapidly to kettle belly he nodded and pointed to a second and larger corral beyond the circle of wagons there were two of the onehorned stallions each stood in his own part of the corral one had the company of two gray shorthorn mares the other was alone they eyed whandalls team and snuffled whandalls mare whinnied girls younger than willow carried fodder to the corral one of the girls was watching the strangers with evident curiosity kettle belly gestured and she came over to them she was shapely a little younger than willow and just beginning to show as a woman whandall found her pretty in an exotic way her hair was long and straight tied with a bow of orange ribbon and she smiled at whandall kettle belly spoke rapidly finally saying whandall the girl smiled and nodded to whandall her name translates to orange blossom kettle belly said youll learn to say it but not now i think she likes you orange blossom smiled shyly shell take care of your onehorns your wagon will be safe enough here next to mine orange blossom began to unhitch the horses whandall watched wondering what to do the horses and wagon were all they owned he saw that kettle belly was watching him with wry amusement itll be all right lad kettle belly said think about it were bison clan wagon traders everyone knows who we are if we were thieves would any town trust us its not like we could run not with bison pulling the wagons orange blossom slipped a bridle on the mare she didnt bother with the stallions she led the mare toward the corral and the stallions followed docilely young colts kettle belly said give them another year theyll fight right now they wont be any problem ruby was still talking well thats all settled then come willow she led willow off into the circle of wagons she hasnt heard her own language since the last time we went to condigeo kettle belly said she has kinfolk there kinfolk as she reckons them anyway well come on lad theres better things than bathtubs tell the youngsters to go with number four there hell find them something to eat number four whandall asked ho we dont give boys names like they do in the cities kettle belly said when theyre old enough they find their names until then we just call them by their fathers name unless theres so many they have to have numbers anyway four will see the kids are fed you come with me whandall explained to the ropewalkers and millers who had been listening without comprehension carver thought he should stay with the children carter had a different idea he wanted to go with whandall whandall was about to say it was all right with him when he saw that carver didnt approve youd better help your kin whandall said all right whandall carter said kettle belly led whandall to one of the big wagons the wagons were roofed over with hoops covered with some kind of cloth the roof was high enough that whandall thought he would be able to stand under it but they didnt go inside kettle belly led him around the wagon and into the circle an awning had been attached to the top of the wagon and led out to poles so that it made a highroofed shed to shade them from the sun large boxes made low walls around the covered area the area under the roof was carpeted and there was a bench just outside it kettle belly sat on the bench and began pulling off his boots he indicated that whandall should do the same we mostly take off our shoes before we go in he said saves the women some work whandall considered that it was a new way of looking at things the carpet felt strange to his bare feet he had seen carpets in lordshills but hed never walked on one these were brighter in color and seemed sturdy he thought the lords would pay well for one how are these made he asked what the carpets woven kettle belly said from wool this one was done by hill shepherds they weave them in winter he turned back a corner of the carpet the underside was covered with thousands of small knots it must take a long time it docs kettle belly said this one probably took eight or ten years to make you can get cheaper ones in towns weave wont be as close flax and hemp threads in the wool there may be some for sale here when the market opens tomorrow have a seat they sat on woolstuffed pillows the pillows were woven of a coarse material like the carpets but they had different designs kettle belly sat with his legs out his back against one of the wagon boxes if you had to live out of a wagon carpets were a good idea whandall thought do they sell good carpets here kettle belly smiled well i wouldnt want the firewoods town people to hear me say he said he watched whandall react to that and grinned marsyl carpets look all right but marsyl town doesnt get cold enough in winter sheep here dont have the best wool we buy marsyl carpets when were headed south and we dont have a full load they sell all right down condigeo way youre not going south whandall guessed tras preetror had said that condigeo was six days sail south of teps town right kettle belly clapped his hands a woman about his age came out from behind the wagon boxes she was darker than kettle belly and considerably thinner her skirts were leather with designs tattooed on them in bright colors some of the tattoos were emphasized by colored thread sewn into patterns her dark hair was pulled back and tied with a ribbon but not plaited like the men wore theirs kettle belly stood when the woman came into the enclosed area and after a moment whandall did too whandall my wife mirime im afraid she doesnt speak much condigeano kettle belly spoke rapidly in a tongue that meant nothing to whandall but he thought he heard the word harpy mirime didnt look happy with her new guest but finally she nodded and went out between the boxes to what must have been another room in a moment she returned carrying a tray with two cups and a bottle she set it down on the carpet bowed slightly and left kettle belly waved whandall to the cushions he filled both cups and handed one of them to whandall the cup reminded whandall of the thinwalled cups the lords used and like the lords cups it had figures painted on it there was a ship on one side and a woman with a fishtail on the other it was filled with a wine that smelled wonderful whandall was about to gulp it down when he saw that kettle belly sipped at his then watched whandall whandall sipped too it was smooth and sweet nothing like the wines hed had in teps town he sipped again in moments the cup was empty kettle belly refilled the cup from the stone jug we saw big smoke last week he said burning whandall nodded yes kettle belly clucked never did understand that why would you want to burn your city down not everyone wants to whandall said sure ruby fishhawk told me theres two kinds of harpies ones like her who put the fires out and the other kind kinless and lordkin whandall said yep thats what she called them lordkin follow yanginatep whandall said when the fire god takes a man the burning starts the wine cup was empty again kettle belly filled it without being asked whandall drank more lordkin do other things whandall said morosely thieves arent they we gather in teps town thats not stealing not for lordkin it is here kettle belly said willow is kinless whandall said he hesitated the wine burned in his stomach so are the others but im lordkin well of course you are kettle belly said the laughter was back in his voice and his smile was broad you knew kettle belly roared with laughter whandall whandall everybody knows whandall frowned how for answer kettle belly called out mirime bring the mirror the woman came back in carrying a bronze mirror that kettle belly polished with a clean soft cloth then handed to whandall you dont have a mirror do you whandall looked he saw a bright feathered serpent with a mans face under it other places other customs kettle belly said teps town isnt the only place that has tattoos but theyre said to be gaudier among the lordkin harpies and whandall no place have i seen anything like that its why no one was afraid of you you know i dont understand whandall found the wine buzzing in his head and heard his speech thicken the tattoo its probly atlantis atlantis but youre not from atlantis no no made friends with an atlantis wizard whandall said wondering why he was talking so much to this stranger well he did you proud but whandall anyplace you go anything you do itll he known all up and down the road in weeks kettle belly said youre the easiest man to describe on the hemp road is it ugly whandall asked takes getting used to ill say that kettle belly said but once you do its sort of pretty whandall drained his cup and held it out again kettle belly leaned over to fill it then stopped sure no dumb whandalls fist closed hiding the cup but this my brother was looking for this meaning good wine wanshig was sure never tasted anything like this but he was sure like i was sure theres a way out an i finally found it kettle belly nodded understanding question is can you hold it it wasnt a familiar term to whandall it wine sure i hope so kettle belly said lad i hope so youre not the first you know whandall frowned the question other lordkin harpies come out why do you think we call you harpies most dont last the lucky ones get put back most get killed when its too much trouble to put them back what happens to the rest there arent many you met ruby fishhawk there are two harpy guards with lonesome crows wagon train and i hear tell of a harpy leather smith up in paradise valley not sure i know of any others maybe a few more women whandall thought about that theres no way to put me back i knew you were smart you can control yourself too sober you can anyway how would he know that what magic did they have here tell you what lets have some water kettle belly said more wine with dinner first let me show you around chapter the wagons werent like whandalls they were well designed and bigger there were cargo wagons and wagons to hold bales of hay and fodder but every family had one that was like a house on wheels those were covered by a roof of closely woven cloth held up by metal hoops and they had a complicated harness arrangement to attach them to the weirdly shaped bison keeps our greathand busy kettle belly said the blacksmith and lots of leatherwork but theres no magic needed lots of people on the road magic runs thin along the hemp road best not to depend on magic too much whandall nodded theres not much magic in teps town thats what they tell me kettle belly said you call it the hemp road kettle belly shrugged theres other commerce probably as much wool as anything else but hemps a stable product always a demand for good hemp fiber rope smoking flowers hemp tea hemp flower gum you can always get a good price for good hemp doesnt it try to kill you whandall asked what hemp maybe it forgot how whandall muttered kettle belly looked at him strangely but didnt say anything the wagons they lived out of were bare inside kettle belly explained we dont so much live in the wagons as just outside of them the wagon boxes nearly till the wagons when were on the road and make the walls when were in camp see some of the boxes open from the side some from the top stack the boxes spread the canopy roof spread the carpets lash everything down and youve got your travel nest we can be done an hour after we make camp if everyone works together it was all new to whandall no lordkin no kinless just people who worked like kinless but kept what they made who owns all this whandall asked well thats complicated kettle belly said lot of this stuff is owned by the wagon train most families own a cargo wagon a few own two i own three and every family owns a house wagon and team of bison thats the brides dowry he grimaced five girls ive had married off two three to go three more outfits to buy but my girls get the best you should see what im having made for orange blossom theres a smithy fifty leagues up the road makes great wagons like this one well collect hers next time were through there sometime this summer shell have to beat the boys away with a stick after they see that rig like kinless whandall thought kinless men took care of their daughters lordkin men seldom knew who their children were a boy could look like his mothers man and then it was pretty clear but you never knew with girls dowry a new word and kettle belly talked so fast whandall wasnt sure of everything he had said there was too much to learn and yet whandall grinned broadly he had learned one thinghe had a chance here a real chance the market area was a field beyond the town there were tents and wagons with platforms and an air of messiness as townsfolk and wagoneers hastened to set up the fairgrounds itll look pretty good in the morning kettle belly said he led the way to a large tent at one corner of the field orange blossom supervised as four children worked to lay out carpets set up tables and generally make preparations so whandall got anything to sell kettle belly asked you can see the wagons empty mostly i see its got a false bottom kettle belly chuckled no telling what youve got in there of course thats the idea anyway i wont charge you much to set you up a table in my tent is this a good place to sell whandall asked kettle belly shook his head depends on what youre selling oh well not really not a lot to buy here either other than food and hay leastways not going north in spring well buy some berries crops ripen here quicker than they do up north sometimes you can turn a good profit moving berries north while people are sick of winter food but they wont have much and you have to be careful berries spoil fast if you hit u stretch where the magics weak then why do you stop here heh lad we dont have any choice the bison go only so far then they stop for a couple of days have to let them rest up and fill their bellies thats most of this towns excuse for existence wagon stop on the hemp road he eyed whandall critically and now we have to come to some agreement what does that mean whandall turned wary and crouched slightly knife fighter lonesome crow tells me you harpies are good at knife fighting kettle belly said good enough whandall said what kind of agreement boy you keep asking for information it cost me to learn what you want to know should i tell you for free whandall considered that wizards trade information he said tellers trade stories i studied with a teller yes but you dont know anything i need to know kettle belly said leastwise i doubt you do stories are good you can eat off good stories any night you have a good story dinners free but what do you know that i need to know by now he must have seen whandalls grin great hawk bay whandall said theyll pay well for herbs and spices depends on the spices kettle belly said we dont get that far west theres a market in golden valley that pays better than great hawk for that matter great hawks on the sea they get ship trade whandall do you have valley of smokes spices in that wagon bottom whandall considered his options none of them seemed very good might as well tell the truth some hold on to them golden valleys the place to sell those if you can get there why would that be a problem whandall asked orange blossom giggled behind them it wont if you stay with us she said she was using a broom to sweep off the carpet it can get tricky kettle belly said bandits maybe you can fight them off but generally theres more than one then theres the tax collectors every town wants a cut theyll take all they can get from a lone traveler you go alone you wont get two hundred miles whandall didnt say anything youre tough kettle belly said and damned mean looking to boot but one man alone isnt enough to fight off tax collectors whandall thought of the toronexti are you making an offer im thinking about it do father orange blossom said yep whandall you travel with us to golden valley ii heres fighting to do youll fight on our side you pay your own travel expenses thats food and fodder we pay the taxes you keep up with us it costs you a third father orange blossom said hush child a third of what of the value of everything you have when we get to golden valley what does everyone else pay whandall asked a fifth but youll be a lot more trouble than they are starting from condigeo whandall guessed they pay that starting from condigeo he wasnt used to bargaining but a lordkin must have guile well you have a point kettle belly said and besides my daughter likes you a quarter whandall and thats my best offer a quarter of what youre worth when we get to golden valley he paused you wont get a better offer supper was a big affair a huge pot of stew bubbled over an open fire in the middle of the wagon camp carpets and cushions were spread out around it men and older women sat while children and younger women served out bowls of stew and small pots of a thin wine generously watered kettle belly waited until whandall had finished a bowl of stew then came over to introduce him around the wagon circle first he was taken to a wagon with a cover painted like the sky an odd funnelshaped cloud reached from the top of the canopy to the bottom of the wagon bed it was so real that whandall thought he could see it move if he looked away from it if he stared at it it stayed still the wagon was tended by two women as old as ruby fishhawk and a girl about willows age the girl stared at whandall until kettle belly spoke rapidly and one of the women went inside she came out with a man hickamore kettle belly said he spoke rapidly then turned to whandall this is hickamore shaman of this wagon train ive told him that i have invited you to join the wagon train hickamore was ageless his dark skin like the leather he was dressed in his eyes set deep in his head he might have been thirty or ninety he stared at whandall then looked past him into the distant hills whandall started to say something but kettle belly gestured impatiently for silence they stood and waited while hickamore stared at nothing finally the shaman spoke in condigeano whandall placehold he said whandall jumped this is your name hickamore made it a question yes sage but i have not told it to anyone here hickamore nodded i was not sure you will have other names all known to the world you will not again have or need a secret name you see the future sometimes when it is strong enough will i meet morth of atlantis again hickamore stared into the distance so the story is true an atlantis wizard lives i met one long ago before atlantis sank but i know little of atlantis i would know more whandall said nothing a shrewd light came into the old shamans eyes black kettle am i an honest man none more so kettle belly said none here anyway whandall placehold i make you a trade black kettle will charge you half the traveler fee he demands and you will tell me all you know of morth of atlantis now hickamore black kettle do you dispute my right no sage kettle belly shrugged he hadnt accepted my offer he does now hickamore said one part in ten kettle belly howled one in eight is half what i offered hickamore stared at him robbery kettle belly said robbery youll ruin us all oh all right one part in ten but you must satisfy the sage whandall it was all happening too fast and whandall still felt the effects of the wine were they stealing from him was all this staged pelzed had done that and the lords with their circuses and shows they were certainly treating him like a child arguing over his goods his and willows and the children one part in ten would be half what anyone else paid and they didnt know about the gold a lordkin must have guile thank you whandall said we accept greathand the blacksmith was nearly as big as whandall much bigger than anyone else in the wagon train with arms as big as black kettles thighs he eyed whandall suspiciously and spoke mostly in grunts but he didnt object to whandalls joining the wagon train after black kettle introduced whandall around the circle of wagons ruby fishhawk took willow and the others on the same tour the evening ended with wine and singing and whandall fell asleep staring at the blaze of stars overhead the market tents were set up in a field next to the wagon camp not all the bison clan families had tents some shared two families with tables in one lent everyone displayed something for sale that was a rule kettle belly insisted on liven overpriced goods made the fair look larger across the field from the wagon train tents the townsfolk set up their own market their tents were less colorful than the bison clans and there were not many goods for sale mostly the town dealt in food stocks and fodder kettle belly went with whandall to inspect the towns goods one tent sold rugs warned by kettle belly whandall inspected these closely there were fewer knots on the underside of the carpet and the patterns were not as bright or as well done as they walked away kettle belly muttered overpriced far too high for this time of year i wonder if they know something what might that be cold winter wind off the high glaciers have to ask hickamore we need rugs whandall said i dont mind sleeping on the ground but willow isnt used to it the children arent tell her to hold on a couple of weeks kettle belly said he pointed north beyond the pass at the end of this valley we start up into the mountains not the real mountains but theyre high enough that the wools better well be in german in two weeks look for rugs there they wont be as good as mine but theyll do use them on the road buy better in golden valley and sell the gorman rugs in last pines next year youll get at least what you paid for them orange blossom had harnessed and bridled two pony stallions streamers flowed from their horns in the scantiest of clothing orange blossom stood on their backs one foot on each and rode through the town to bring the townsfolk to the market field a stream of young men followed her back to the market willow caught him gaping she does that well whandall said willow only nodded then she went to find her brother and together they went to the fishhawk tent they came back with two of the fishhawk boys and two posts twice as long as whandall was tall carter dived into the hidden compartment of their wagon and came out with ropes they stood the posts eight paces apart and used ropes and stakes to hold them upright then they strung a rope from one post to the next and tightened it with a stick twisted into the rope willow vanished into their tent she came out wearing skintight trousers and tunic catch me she shouted to whandall then she climbed agilely to the top of one of the poles and stood on it catch me she shouted again carter moved beside whandall she wants you to stand beneath her in case she falls if she falls you catch her oh memories came back youre the ropewalkers carter stared i mean i saw you before before i knew what your name was whandall said he remembered the man who had stood beneath the ropewalking girl during pelzeds show that must have been her lather whandall moved out under the rope his eyes fixed on willow she was both beautiful and vulnerable willow smiled down at him ill probably fall i havent done this in a long time she said but youre strong id suit up carter said only theres nothing to wear next time willow said ill work alone today she walked out onto the rope whandall stayed under her it wasnt easy she did backward somersaults stood on her hands on the rope jumped and caught herself she seemed less graceful than the little girl whandall remembered but she got the attention of the spectators a mixed crowd of villagers and wagon train boys gathered to watch they all stared at willow she smiled back at them and did a forward somersault i carver was standing by one of the posts wow whandall looked at him forwards a lot harder than backward you cant see carver said shes still the best willow attempted something complicated she was falling before he quite realized that it wasnt an act she had the rope and lost it but it slowed her for a moment and then whandall was under her whandall braced himself she fell limply into his arms he caught her and they both went down knocking the wind out of his chest they lay on the ground willow atop him despite the pain it felt good to whandall she was well muscled soft at the shouldershis hands moved involuntarily willow smiled and deftly got up thanks my hero she said it half mockinglybut only halfand she smiled then she bowed to the crowd and went into their tent kettle belly came over to their wagon after dinner i feel better about the deal you made he told whandall you didnt tell me willow could perform carter can too whandall said remembering he needs practice though theyll have the chance a good show is worth a lot whandall theyll draw crowds out in stone needles country golden valley too whandall were moving out tomorrow how will you move your wagons the ponies theyll be slow willow can still lead them well i suppose so i dont know why she couldnt kettle belly grinned knowingly good but it wont do they wont move faster than the girls can walk most of the way is uphill the girls will gel tired and slow us down even if orange blossom takes turns with willow willow will be too tired to practice and what about your mare carver can still handle her shell pull a cart if he drives it whandall shrugged not me that mare wants me dead kettle belly grinned again okay good carver drives the wagon with the mare the other wagons a different matter ill bring over some bison in the morning and number three will show you how to hitch them up what about our ponies theyll follow the girls willow and orange blossom can ride at the tailgate of your wagon and all the onehorns will follow them darned things are more trouble than theyre worth but theyre popular in golden valley chapter after dinner he left the ropewalkers and millers working on the wagon carver sent a dirty look after him a look he was meant to catch he stopped he said carter maybe youd better come with me carter trotted to whandalls side but this is work carver said as if whandall might not recognize it on sight we need all the hands we can get i made a bargain with hickamore the wizard whandall informed them all if i dont keep it well be paying kettle belly a fourth of what we own so im going to tell him stories about morth but why carter he doesnt speak condigeano carter might have seen things about morth that i didnt the younger children would miss anything subtle and you werent there carver while willow and i were dealing with morth you were a days walk away dealing with a cart and mare that you had left behind but i could take willow instead oh whandall i think they need me here willow said with apparent regret take carter carver began pounding a post into the ground carter and whandall went to hickamores wagon the shaman and his family sat under the stars they must have had first choice of campsites the circle of rocks around his fire was almost too convenient as a conversation pit my children these are whandall and carter surely the most unusual of visitors to our home how had hickamore known carters name magic folk greet my daughters rutting deer and twisted cloud and their friends fawn and mountain cat twisted cloud was just turned fourteen quite pretty in the local fashion high cheekbones and arched brows and straight dark hair she had carters full attention running deer was seventeen with that same look exotic to whandall fawn didnt say but she looked to be the same age fawn was pretty enough but running deer was twisted cloud made mature tall and lovely with dark straight hair sculpted into a single braid mountain cat was eighteen or nineteen and finely dressed he was with fawn or with twisted cloudit was difficult to tell whichbut he didnt want the barbarians near either of them whandall sat aside even among lookers he knew how to avoid knife play the girls chattered willow twisted cloud said why is she named willow its their way fawn said like ruby something precious twisted cloud nodded understanding its hard to find maybe they dont have any in the valley of smokes the old man offered whandall wine whandall asked for river water instead twisted cloud scowled knowing shed be sent to the cistern to fetch it and she was hickamore asked when did you first see morth of atlantis he was in lord samortys courtyard below shandas balcony talking to the lords he looked decrepit then and amused i was only a little boy but even i could see that he thought they were all fools they saw it too i think but they thought he was wearing it a wizards attitude like the lords attitudes they all wore like masks but it wasnt he did think they were fools then why they used something that burned up all the magic right through their whole town magic didnt work there morth was dying for lack of magic a warlocks wheel whandall shrugged hickamore was excited what did it look like i never saw it whats it supposed to look like but in the distraction of twisted clouds return the question got lost whandall drank then thanked her and hickamore asked what was a lordkin boy doing on a lords balcony whandall told of crawling over the wall meeting shanda the exchange of clothes running deer fawn and twisted cloud were listening rapt mountain cat had forgotten all his suspicions under the lure of a good story hiding on the balcony watching an opera the black pit at night the magic forest hickamore wanted to know more about hemp it wants to kill you whandall said everyone knows that you cant walk through a hemp field without tailing asleep and it will strangle you by morning not here mountain cat said ropewalkers hickamore said how do they make rope if the hemp tries to kill them whandall looked to carter carter the shaman asks carter said in broken condigeano old men know never teach me at hickamores urging whandall described taking shanda through the chaparral being caught by samortys people the mock beating hickamore wanted to know more about maps whandall drew teps town in the dust by firelight hickamore gave him colored sand to improve it then hickamore added whandalls improvements to a map he must have drawn earlier grinning he watched whandalls face as the map came to life a greensand forest bowed and rippled to a yellow windstorm cobalt river tracks glittered bison no bigger than ants ran before the orange sparkle of a prairie fire within the fire a birds beak showed for an instant there and gone and something else a bird as large as a bison ran ahead of the fire and vanished carter was yawning and that gave whandall his excuse to depart bringing carter had been a good idea hitching up bison was a pain but driving them turned out to be easier the beasts were not very smart they wanted to follow their leaders they were hitched four to a wagon as long as a team of bison could see the team in front of them they followed docilely kettle belly drove the lead wagon the road took them steadily north they crossed two small streams then the road led steadily upward the first sign of the terror bird was a high piercing shriek then a scream from a woman in the lead wagon then more of the alien shrieking then a coyote burst from the chaparral followed by something bright green and orange and big whandall had never seen its like it ran on two legs like a chicken but the eyes were a head higher than whandalls and it hadnt even straightened up the head was too big for its body mounted on a thick and powerful neck the beak was most of the head and it wasnt shaped like a chickens it was curved and hooked built for murder the legs were thick and stumpy thighs nearly as big around as whandalls and covered with feathers a plume of tail feathers fanned out behind it whandall gaped it was clearly a bird but those werent wings the forearms ended in what looked like lordkin knives with no pretense at flight the coyote ran in terror an astonished camp dog sprang alter it just too late and the beast shrieked again and charged the dog the dog dodged by a hairbreadth the beak snapped shut on nothing striking timber from a wagons side the howling dog dove under the wagon the apparition darted after it bison panicked the lead wagon jolted as the bison broke into a cumbersome canter others followed in seconds the orderly wagon train was a mass of stampeding bison pulling wagons and the bird was in the middle of it willow and orange blossom were seated on the tailgate of their wagon clinging to ropes as the wagon lurched away the bird hesitated then charged them whandall snatched a blanket from a wagon seat and ran forward waving his lordkin knife shouting a wordless challenge ponies tried to block the thing but it evaded their horns and aimed a kick powerful enough to stagger the larger stallion then it ran toward willow it was faster than whandall whandall flapped the blanket at its eye the bright blanket got the terror birds attention it turned to charge whandall its eyes fixed on the blanket whandall kept the blanket in front of him until it was nearly on him then stretched out his blanketcovered left arm and raised it while turning to his left the bird stretched out its neck and dove into the blanket whandall brought down the big lordkin knife at the base of its neck the neck was too thick the bird ran a circle around whandall blinded and trying to tear through the blanket while whandall sawed at the neck with his knife turning the edge forward got it under the feathers round and round but that had to be bone and he was getting through it and then the head was bent back but the bird was still running it ran whandall into the side of a wagon he spun off and lay dazed the bird was hellishly fast but its head flopped loose now and here came carter and carver with a rope stretched between them the birds random path veered toward them they pulled the rope taut and tripped it as it thrashed they ran round it wrapping the legs so it couldnt get up the spearclaw forearms thrashed for ten minutes by the time the beast was still kettle belly and the other drivers had halted the wagon train now they all gathered around whandall and the ropewalkers and the dead bird what in the hell is that whandall demanded terror bird kettle belly said theyre rare lets keep it that way whandall said but he was grinning victory felt good and willow was looking at him in a way she never had before so were the other girls of the wagon train all of them that felt good too the terror bird made soup to feed the whole train in a row of the big bronze pots that most of the wagons carried the train gathered around hickamores ring of rocks to share it the meat was tough and red less like bird than bison as they ate hickamore asked whandall about his tattoo whandall had learned some of the local speech by now but it went better with ruby fishhawk to translate from his own language i know now that morth of atlantis made it for me and enchanted it so that he could follow me out of the burning city i believe it killed all the men in my family gradually the folk around them went silent hickamores daughters listened and the ropewalkers and millers too and willow theyd never asked him about the feathered snake tattoo what had they known of lordkin they might not know this tattoo was unusual whandall felt good if willow hadnt been there he might not have stuck to river water the party broke up far too early the road led up to another pass orangetown was in a vale there and unlike marsyl orangetown had walls the town gates were set into stone gate towers and the walls were stone for a hundred paces to each side of the gates elsewhere they became a wooden palisade logs sharpened at the top and set into low stone walls chest high to whandall whandall thought orangetown was smaller than lordstown it was certainly tiny compared to teps town there were permanent corrals outside the walls with pens for the bison and another fenced area for the ponies a steady wind blew from the northeast and the pens were downwind of both the town and the campground the campground itself had wells and fountains and stonelined walks there were feed stores and warehouses adjacent to the animal pens a large field with wooden seats filled the area between the campgrounds and the animal pens kettle belly and a dozen of his younger relativessons daughters nieces nephews and cousinscame to help whandall and the ropewalkers unhitch their animals and set up camp youll be here kettle belly said indicating an area among the low trees thats your well the toilet trench is in the grove there use it and clean up any animal droppings theyre sticky about that here whandall smiled to himself not everyone had a well and a fireplace at his campsite the area kettle belly picked for whandall was nearly as large as hickamores and certainly nicer than what the fishhawks got the town looks organized whandall said well pay for it but yes theyre organized one thing catch up on sleep its safe here when we set out north again well stand night watches until we get to the big valley he eyed whandalls big lordkin knife wouldnt surprise me if you got a chance to use that again more of those birds im hearing rumors of two bandit tribes in the hills carter fingered the sling he wore openly around his neck and displayed a bag of streamrounded stones well be ready whandall smiled thinly hed never seen a kinless with a sling until carter took to wearing one carter had a knife too he was clumsy with it but the kinless were good with slings more than ever whandall thought he knew why lordkin turned up missing from time to time back in teps town bandits have seen slings before kettle belly said bet they never saw anyone like whandall before kettle belly eyed the orange feathers whandall wore in his plaited hair and the gaudy feathered serpent crawling up his arm and across his cheek and eye now there you may be right i heard morth say what if a magician vouched for you i had no idea he was there and i wasnt even surprised morth called it a lurk spell whandall said he took a strawberry the shaman had set out a platter of big red strawberries whandall hadnt seen anyone picking them shaman where did you get these treeswinger town before we met you hickamore said he saw whandalls astonishment my magic preserves many kinds of food one of the ways in which i earn my keep whandall ate another strawberry then drank he lifted the water bottle to show twisted cloud brought my own you wont have to leave this time the girl giggled she did too much of that whandall didnt know how to deal with a giggler he continued two huge daggertoothed cats made of fog and smoke were playing around morths feet his hair was going white to pink and back again like cloud shadows he had magic to make him young but it wanted power i had to hold back i wanted to kill him no reason at all yanginatep was in me and yanginatep is a fire god and morth is a water wizard morth backed away the kinless children were still giving me plenty of room hickamore held out the wine flask he had only made that gesture once the first night of storytelling after that hed kept the bottle whandall took the bottle and drank it wasnt watered better not do that again mountain cat reached whandall passed the bottle whandall asked carter for his own memories of morth and then willows and carvers carter laughed he said that willow had thought morth might protect them from the lordkin who threw fire hammer had found whandall awesome because he frightened carver but morth tended to lecture like his father whandall didnt take the bottle again but he could feel its effect burning in his blood he spoke on the fire track through the forest morth suddenly among them tell them about gold in the riverbed not yet twisted cloud went to bed mountain cat made his excuses and departed carter was asleep whandall picked the boy up in his arms and made his farewells the campfire lit his way barely he became aware that both older girls were walking with him one spoke in a teasing voice mountain cats made of smoke is any of that true whandall kept walking because carter was heavy he said i wouldnt lie also i wouldnt lie to a shaman until i knew his power why do you bring the boy with you you almost never ask him anything is he your he is under my protection what was that word stays with you so that a woman cant get you in trouble so that another womans dowry is safe does willow ropewalker fear for her dowry she doesnt have one running deer what is that word dowry but the girls were gone so abruptly that whandall wondered just how much wine hed taken one full swallow it had burned his throat going down maybe some wines were stronger than others chapter the water in their camp well was cool and sweet whandall drank his fill then splashed himself clean in the washing pool next to the well the afternoon was hot it had been a long day starting before the sun came up he found shade in a thicket near the wagon and stretched out for a nap the sun was still high when he was awakened by someone moving he looked out through the thicket moving just his head old habits die hard willow was tightening a rope four feet above the ground for practice she liked it high enough that a fall would hurt but not so high that shed break bones she tugged on the rope nodded in satisfaction and went into the wagon whandall waited for her to come out he liked to watch her although willow didnt want anyone to watch her practice she came out wearing bright feathers when theyd skinned the terror bird whandall had given the feathers to willow he hadnt known she had made a costume from them it looked good on her gold and green and orange feathers sewed into the cotton and linen cloth most townspeople wove and sold it fit her tightly showing the curve of her hips and breasts and stopped short at the knees to show her perfect calves whandall stifled his approval she might be angry with him for watching her when willow got angry she got more and more quiet and if he asked her what was wrong she would mutter nothing it drove him crazy she vaulted onto the rope and did a quick back somersault then a handstand the feathered skirt tumbling down to show more feathers and a few inches of thighs wagon train women and townswomen never allowed anyone lo see them when they werent fully clothed unless they were performing like orange blossom riding the ponies then they wanted everyone to see them girls were confusing willow came off the handstand and dove forward whatever she attempted she missed and nearly fell just catching the rope she used it to swing upward and back onto it then did a forward somersault bravo carver came around the side of the wagon you startled me willow said coming up no ive lost the knack carver said brother you just need practice no ive really lost it besides no one wants to see me do ropewalking they want to see pretty girls that was nice do you really think im pretty yes whandall thinks so too maybe she jumped lightly to the ground well if you arent going to be part of the act ill have to work out a new routine youll do fine carver said mother always said you were really good i miss her willow said dad too well sure butyeah dad too carter and hammer came out of the wagon hi hey you look great carter said did you make that well i sewed it willow said ruby fishhawk helped carter fingered the feathered skirt that sure was something to see whandall saw that bird looking at you and pow he was right there that big knife out that blanketdid you see what that bird did to the blanket it would have torn whandall the same way only he was too fast for it and strong you ever seen anyone stronger will you stop with that carver said why should i whandall lay still wondering what to do now lurking was natural but this wasnt he willow carter demanded wasnt he wonderful willow nodded but didnt say anything ah you think whandall cant do anything wrong carver said but what does he really know how to do he cant tame ponies even my mare runs away from him he cant make rope what can he do he can fight lordkin can fight carver said and hes a lordkin hes not carter said hes not lordkin and were not kinless not out here then what are we hammer asked i guess were just people carter said rich people whandalls rich carver said were not morth gave that gold to whandall not us we dont even own the wagon not if whandall says we dont hammer had been listening with attention but its ours hammer said well yours but one of the ponies was my dads so that makes it mine yours if whandall says it is carver said its mine anyway hammer said if that lordkin harpy wont give it to me ill carter laughed you wont do anything ill get help hammer said carver will help and the wagon master and the blacksmith theyll make him give me my pony carter laughed again you think everyone in this wagon train could take something away from whandall if he didnt want to give it he could kill everyone here well maybe not carver said but youre righthed be pretty hard to take out they wont try it the wagon train cant afford to lose that many people dead or hurt unless we get him in his sleep you wont do that carter said why are you all mad at whandall he saved willow from that bird he saved us all wed never have got out of that forest wed still be in teps town if it wasnt for whandall and he never did any of us any harm willow youre the oldest make him stop talking like that we still dont know what happened to father carver said whandall didnt hurt him carter said he says he didnt willow said you believe him carver demanded yes yes i do anyway he was possessed of yanginatep willow said slowly yanginatep could do anything it wouldnt be whandalls fault you believe in yanginatep now carver asked dont you morth does you saw what morth could do with magic and morth was afraid of yanginatep yanginatep cant take whandall again carter said were safe here we dont know that willow said we dont know what gods there are or what theyll take a whim to do but i think were safe from whandall hes still lordkin carver said why do you keep saying that carter asked because thats what everyone says everyone in the wagon train does kettle belly say it willow asked no hickamore she was holding back a laugh i never asked him who have you been listening to willow asked yeah whos everybody hammer chimed in carver was turning belligerent rutting deer and fawn the blacksmiths older daughter they say hes a lordkin boor willow laughed merrily and whandalls heart danced inside him she said you dont know much about girls do you little brother carver gaped at his sister that hurt i already heard that story willow said ruby fishhawk told me rutting deer her mother had a vision hammer snickered can you picture it hush rutting deer and fawn are together all the time and they both had their eyes on whandall after he killed the terror bird so did you carter laughed i saw you so they tried to flirt with him willow forged on carver fawns not as good looking as rutting deer is she but shes not promised rutting deer is promised to a boy in another wagon train they both think its fun to flirt that poor boy mountain catanyway whandall just couldnt believe that name i can understand that carver said i can hardly make myself say that in front of a girl even if its her name he thought hed heard wrong whandall called her running deer but he got them mixed up and called fawn running deer now they both want his liver willow said hes still a lordkin carver said stubbornly and mountain cat is still their toy doll but you could take his place if you say what they want whandall would have paid a high price to be somewhere else no outsider should hear any of this us the wagon carver said his face was very red and he was forcing the words out the team who owns any of this whandall already gave away one part in ten that was a good deal carter said everyone else pays more yes but he made the deal for all of us carver said he didnt ask us like its all his so youd give kettle belly twice as much more he wanted a quarter youre very free with the family goods willow turned away its time to start dinner whandall will be hungry carter hammer go find us some wood whandall crawled out through the thicket staying with the shadows sliding through branches without bending them he knew how to hide from kinless there was a lot to think about as he walked back to the main camp rutting deer fawn got them mixed up in the dark whandall thought names were important in teps town you never lei anyone know your true name so whatever name people called you wasnt real to begin with out here your name was your self rutting deer flirting willow said rutting deer and fawn were flirting he didnt know that word what had they been doing before they turned cold theyd been talking about dowries whats a dowry whandall glanced up at the sun still high hours to dinner time to find out there was a person he could ask he bought half a dozen ripe tangerines in the orangetown market mothers mother had liked those when she could get them he took them to ruby fishhawks wagon she didnt hesitate before inviting him into the wagon box tent for tea it was automatic to take off his boots before going in hed learned that much ruby fussed with tea things poured a cup and sat on a cushion across from whandall now what is this about i need help whandall said i dont know anything about girls a boy your age i dont believe it ruby said she grinned to make it clear what she thought girls here whandall said and willow willow oh yes of course i keep forgetting that youre lordkin forgetting whandall leered out of a rainbowcolored snake well its more i forget what lordkin are ruby said and youre not like the ones i remember well usually you arent the way you went after that terror bird now thats how i remember lordkin fearless strong when i was a girl i used to wonder about lordkin men what it would be like to have a protector like you she grinned that was a long time ago you like willow do you yes whandall found it hard to speak about willow what could he say shes the most beautiful woman i ever saw my have you told her that no why dont you i dont know how you just told me ruby said she chuckled whandall are you asking me how to court her what does court mean like flirt well courting is serious flirting ruby said if a boy only wants a girls attention he flirts if hes thinking of marriage he goes courting whandall digested that is that what girls do too flirting isnt serious courting is well yes its a little more complicated than that but yes then i want to know how to court her you cant ruby said no wait youre the only one who could and she knows that and girls like to think they have a choice they usually dont but they like to think they do whandall repeated what he almost understood why am i the only one who can court her she doesnt have a dowry ruby reached over and poured more tea that wont matter to you but it will to all the other boys yes whats a dowry ruby grinned mysteriously a dowry is a fortune money a wagon rugs things girls bring to a marriage whandall you mean boys court girls for what they own whandall was being shown a whole new evil lordkin would never do that they wouldnt would they ruby said id forgotten that too the boys here dont think that way think on it whandall a dowry belongs to the woman if her husband mistreats her or throws her out she takes it back with her ideally it will be enough to live on to support any children she might have and a husband thinks hard about getting rid of his wife if it means he has to hire out as a laborer she laughed i had to have it explained to me you know kinless dont think that way either a girls dowry in teps town some lordkin buck would gather it oh not you dear we dont have kinless and lordkin here thats what carter says whandall mused what does willow need to make a dowry a wagon and team if shes going to live on the road money clothes rugs the more the better whandall the wagon is hers whandall said it always was but i guess she doesnt know that if she has a dowry anyone can court her well ruby said looking at whandalls thick arms and bulging muscles they can but some will be afraid to as long as they think youre involved but thats all right whandall willow will understand that she chuckled of course any boy might find his courage and willow is a lovely girl what do i do after she has her dowry give her presents i did a dress and a necklace she thanked me but she never wore them did you ask her to wear them for you no lunds sake boy but you want her to wear them for someone else no well then you have to ask her ruby said whandall willow grew up kinless kinless never show anyone what they have it took me a year before i wore my nicest clothes outside the wagon tent its not something you think about its just the way kinless live kinless were drab hed thought it was their nature now he began to understand and if i ask her to wear the things i bought her and she says no youll know you need to do some more courting ruby said she winked give her a little time whandall i will whandall said but as he walked back to hiswillows wagon he saw orange blossom smiling at him and two other girls sat with their legs showing and he wondered just how long he could wait it had been hard learning to be a lordkin but at least hed understood what he wanted to be supper was ready when he got to the wagon and then hickamore wanted a story there was no chance to talk to the ropewalkers and millers chapter orangetown wasnt truly a pass but more a level spot on the way up to the high country beyond the next two days led steeply up with no good place to make camp everyone had to help ease the wagons through stony fields the hills rose steeply to each side and ahead and all were covered with brilliant orange flowers whandall had never seen anything like them beautiful he said kettle belly grunted and put his shoulder to the other wheel of the fishhawk wagon ready heave together they lifted the wagon wheel out of the hole the flowers are pretty enough but theres another thing i like about them kettle belly said theyre too low to hide anyone sneaking up on us out here we dont have to worry too much about bandits and tonight we can be in a safe campsite i think well stop there to rest up he waved his arm to indicate the trail ahead after that though well be back in scrub oak and chaparral and rocks theres bandits out therei can smell them you can smell bandits whandall could have used that talent in teps town well maybe not but hickamore can a good wizard can give warning and hickamores good blast now ironfoots wagon is stuck kettle belly the caravan chief looked around at whandalls horrified shout he said ah moving among the mountains grayed by distance was a vastness built to their mountains own scale its legs were as tail as redwoods but so wide that they looked stumpy its torso was another mountain a forest of hair piebald brown and white hung down all around it ears bigger than any sail an arm a boneless arm where a nose might have been lifted and fell as the god turned to study them its behemoth kettle belly said it wont come any closer nobodys ever seen behemoth close give me a shoulder here whandall whandall set back to work from time to time he looked up at behemoth moving among the mountains until the moment when he looked up and the beast god was gone the road became steeper then leveled off whandall was glad of it he and the blacksmith and kettle belly were the strongest men in the wagon train and sometimes it took all three of them to get a heavy wagon over a bad place ill be glad when this day is over whandall told kettle belly kettle belly glanced up at the sun two hours and a little more only one place to camp tonight he said four run ahead and tell the scouts well camp at coyotes den not that they wont know it all right dad coyotes den whandall asked the road forks just up ahead the righthand branch goes uphill well take that one kettle belly grinned as whandall groaned not too steep and its a good road the spotted coyotes see to that theyve made a good place to camp too of course they had to whandall frowned the question kettle belly had expected they had to because there arent enough of them to be tax collectors without giving some service kettle belly said look around you nothing here but some pasturage and not a lot of that over there beyond that ridge theres some better land but no one ever goes that far off the hemp road for some reason the spotted coyote tribe has to live here something about instructions from their god he told them to live here but he didnt give them anything to live on whandall asked what does he do for them beats me kettle belly said coyotes a strange one nobody really knows what he wants anyway the spotted coyotes made the best of it they found a big ring of boulders and over the years theyve made it into a rest stop here we go thats the fork kettle bellys number three son ran out with a long curved cow horn can i do it he asked excitedly sure number three blew six long blasts on the horn that tells the spotted coyotes how many of us to fix dinner for kettle belly said thais how it works you tell them youre coming and they cook up stew to be ready when we get up to the top they teed us and watch out for us kettle bellys lips pursed into a small tight grin and they dont charge any more than they ask for just to pass through their territory are there a lot whandall asked no not really but enough you wouldnt want to fight them and you really wouldnt want them making the road worse than the winter rains do toronexti whandall said when kettle belly gave him a blank look whandall tried to explain tax collectors toll takers but they never give you anything for what they take so you organize a lot of people and go kill them kettle belly said thats what we do if a town gets mean enough we get all the wagoneers together and go burn them out whandall thought about trying to organize enough lordkin to destroy the toronexti nobody knew how many they were where they lived nor even who they were behind those masks they were backed by the lords it was said nobody could fight the lordsmen the top of the hill was a natural fortress a spring bubbled up in the center of a ring of boulders that formed a natural castle large enough to enclose a wagon train and all the livestock over the years the spotted coyote clan had smoothed out the area inside the boulder circle and built corrals and pens and shelters and big cook fire rings the smells of bison stew wafted to the wagon train kettle belly and a small dark man about his age shouted and gesticulated at each other whandall thought they were pretending at passion as they went through a ritual kettle belly would throw up his hands in disgust and the spotted coyote leader would gesture outside the circle grinning as he pointed out a small column of smoke a couple of miles away kettle belly looked worried then shouted again eventually they came to some agreement and money changed hands by then dusk was falling and the stew was done they ate dinner around a big campfire logs had been arranged in a circle to form seats and backrests it was pleasant to sit back and relax with the prospect of a nights sleep without need for guard duty whandall pleaded exhaustion when hickamore wanted to talk about morth of atlantis and soon the wizard was deep in conversation with a man twice his age who wore a mantle of wolf skin a spotted coyote boy came around to fill everyones cup from a goatskin of wine whandall sipped appreciatively it was not as good as the wine kettle belly kept in his wagon but it was smoother and more pleasant than anything that made its way to teps town a pleasant evening willow sat next to him tired because the girls had been hopping on and oft the wagon all day us i he hills became steeper and they had to get out and push flirting courtship is serious flirting flirting meant being amusing and funny and whandall didnt know how he looked around to see how others were doing it not far away carver sat with starfall the blacksmiths darkhaired daughter they sat very close together whandall couldnt hear what they were saying but starfall seemed to be doing all the talking as carver sat listening attentively that seemed like something whandall could do but willow wasnt saying anything did you like the dress i bought you whandall asked yes very much thank you you dont ever wear it well i wouldnt want to wear it here with all these strangers willow said kettle belly says theyre safe whandall said theyre not he cut himself off thieves i was going to say gatherers oh she looked at him with wide eyes i keep forgetting she said thats good she smiled softly be right back carver was still listening to starfall she moved closer to him whandall had no trouble imagining her warmth against his side the boy said something and starfall laughed appreciatively other couples were talking softly boys smiling girls laughing if only he could hear what they were saying willow returned she was wearing the blue dress whandall had bought and the goldandblack onyx necklace thatswonderful he said settling for that although he wanted better words i knew it would look good on you and it does better than i thought whandall said her smile was haunting she sat next to him not as close as carver was sitting to starfall but she had never been so close he could feel her warmth radiating against his side warmer than the fire they didnt talk for a long time whandall kept trying to think of something clever to say but nothing came to mind and it was enough just to be close to her when carver and starfall left the firelight circle and went off into darkness whandall thought willow was about to say something but she didnt he imagined standing up taking her hand and leading her to privacy and secret places hut he did nothing and he wondered if his legs had forgotten how to obey him suddenly she smiled at him and touched his lace her touch was light and smooth as she ran her fingers along his tattoo down his arm still smiling then she sat close to him and they stared at the fire carver had a sappy grin at breakfast it faded when he went to hitch up the mare the pony reared and tried to trample him whandall watched frowning as carver shouted at the pony someone in the next wagon party laughed loudly a few minutes later greathand the blacksmith came to whandalls wagon he wasnt unfriendly but he seemed preoccupied need a favor he said like to have willow bring one of your ponies over to my wagon sure why rather not say until i know greathand said if you dont mind the blacksmith seldom asked favors whandall was pretty sure no one ever refused him when he did ask and there was no reason not to do it was there willow had heard she led the smaller of the horned ponies over to them whandall had to look twice it was as large as the larger one had been the day before and without the black star marking on its forehead whandall would not have known which one it was the ponies changed size sometimes whandall had asked hickamore about it magic changes along the road the wizard had told him then asked how morth cured skin diseases willow followed greathand toward his wagon whandall watched her lead the pony for a moment and remembered her smiles last night but there was work to do loading the wagon when willow came back greathand and kettle belly were behind her they waited until she led the pony back to join the others greathand stood back and let kettle belly talk for him these arent your kin but its your wagon he said willows wagon whandall said youre in charge greathand said that boy carver doesnt have a father and hes in your wagon yes whandall said it sounded like an admission but whandall didnt know why so we can talk to you about him kettle belly said whats his situation profession he knows how to make rope and sell it whandall said why greathand frowned why are you kettle belly held up a hand ropewalking expensive to set up but a ropewalk makes good money he said have to have a place to do it though no on a wagon train he turned to greathand starfall doesnt have a wagon yet want to think about a different dowry she cant take back a ropewalk greathand said but she didnt want a wagon anyway shes always talked about living in a town yearround well we can work that out then kettle belly said how old is the boy sixteen i think whandall said little young kettle belly said starfalls only fifteen greathand growled if the damn fool hadnt made such a big thing about not being able to harness that mare maybe anyway starfalls all excited so i guess its got to be whandall well talk when were over the pass discuss arrangements where the kids want to live what it takes to set up a ropewalk you tell carver hes a damn lucky boy the blacksmith went away still muttering under his breath whandall frowned at kettle belly i saw carver and starfall go off together but they werent the only ones last night theyre the only ones that all of a sudden cant harness onehorns kettle belly said he grinned i always thought you were putting me on but you really dont know he laughed at his enormous joke whandall everyone knows it nobody but a virgin can harness a onehorn yesterday carver could harness the mare and starfall didnt have any trouble with the stallions this morning ive been stupid many cryptic things were becoming plain doesnt work that way in the valley of smokes then no whandall thought about it ponies are smaller dont have real horns it surprised us when ours grew those big horns magic kettle belly what happens now well you heard greathand will have to come up with another kind of dowry i dont know if he can afford a ropewalkhes got fawn to marry off toobut hell do what he can carver have any shares in your stock whandall nodded hes not poor this is all new to me what happens if they dont want to marry come onthey knew there were onehorns in the wagon train carver didnt know what that means starfall did kettle belly said you trying to tell me that its different in the valley of smokes whandall remembered willows story of what happened to dreamlotus no not for kinless he said carver must have known what he was getting into whandall remembered incidents with fawn and rutting deer chances he had things he might have done it was different here because there werent lordkin here and he could never explain that no he repeated kettle belly squinted up at the rising sun burning daylight he said we have to get moving whandall youd better explain this to carver yes does he have any choices well he can take a wagon as dowry if he wants to learn this life being married to greathands daughter wont hurt him a bit what if he runs away hed better run damn far from the hemp road forever chapter they made camp in a boulder field large rocks helped form a natural rectangular fortress nothing so refined as the place the spotted coyotes had built wagons filled in gaps among the big rocks whandall watched their placementall wagons in sight of each other theyd traveled until near sunset to find such an open place an easy trek down the gorge to the river but wouldnt any bandit know just where wagons would stop and the boulders and the rising and falling ground around them could hide all of serpents walk and bull fizzle together but hickamore drank strong hemp tea and sang and when he came out of his trance was satisfied there were bandits near but they only watched they had no plan no purpose only their envy the sun had set but the west was still red and orange whandall sent two of the miller children to keep watch outside the wagon circle stay very still and if you hear anything shout and run under the wagon but yell first then he had willow carver carter and hammer sit down around the fire we need to talk whandall said carver you knew what was expected when you went off with starfall carver looked very solemn yes well i knew it in my head he said i wasnt thinking much though starfall was willow said how are you so sure carter demanded she shrugged girls always are in teps town you might get away with being careful hut its a big risk out herebelieve me starfall knew what she was doing so did you i think its sopermanent carver said thats what im having trouble with carter nodded in sympathy so what do you want to do whandall insisted i think im supposed to negotiate for you where do you want to live i can make rope carver said well if carter will help carter ill teach you my part if youll teach me yours greathand cant afford a ropewalk carter said they all looked at the wagon then they looked at whandall no one said anything whandall grinned depends on willow he said me i dont have anything except the dress you bought me i dont have anything at all and she was near tears dowries was that the problem the wagon the ponies willow theyre all yours hed been thinking how to say that hed waited too long one of the ponies is mine hammer protested whandall shrugged argue that with willow he said but kettle belly says one pony is worth a team of bison so willow has a wagon and team and the mare carver demanded i have a claim whandall said i helped catch her the hemp and tar toopart of thats mine i wont claim it though willow can have my share why willow asked its very nice of you whandall but why i know why carver said dont you she didnt answer but she had the same vague smile that had appeared when whandall said she owned the wagon and ponies she looked quickly at whandall then looked away again dont forget the wagonmaster gets a tenth whandall said now about the gold morth gave that gold to you carter said and carver said firmly yes whandall nodded ill share i needed you to move it for me still do theres enough for your ropewalk i think if you and carter stay together i keep half you all of you share the rest any way you decide half would still be a lot half after the wagonmaster gets his share kettle belly doesnt know about that gold carver said no way he could know we could hide it carter said eagerly no whandall no he repeated we tell the wagonmaster why carter demanded he doesnt knowhe cant know whandall tried hut words came slowly i said i promised a lordkins promise carter said made to a thief kettle bellys not gathering whandall said heshes working with us carter looked to the others some understanding flowed among them carver said all right and shrugged whandall felt like an outsider there was a long silence finally whandall got up and left the wagon no one spoke until he was too far away to make out words then carter and carver began speaking excitedly chapter come in kettle belly said in invitation have some wine no thank you whandall said i have something to show you yes not here at willows wagon kettle belly frowned at the setting sun time to set the watch he said he began pulling on his boots willows wagon you said not yours hers after her father died whandall said in the burning makes sense kettle belly said i keep forgetting about the onehorns the ponies are hers too well of course kettle belly tied off his bootlaces and held out his hand for whandall to help him up they set off at a brisk pace with two of kettle bellys nameless sons following good lets go you and willow getting along all right then whandall didnt answer and it is my business kettle belly said his tone was serious now everything that happens in this wagon train is my business until we get to paradise valley pelzed used to say things like that whos pelzed someone i used to know i think we ought to hurry kettle belly was taking two steps to whandalls one and didnt have breath for an answer leave that alone willow shouted why carver demanded because hello willow kettle belly said carver turned quickly he was holding a gold nugget in both hands it was pulling him to the ground thats what we wanted to show you whandall said we have gold i see that kettle belly said more than that whats in the wagon the wagon bed was open and kettle belly looked he said thats a lot of gold i know its refined gold too where did you get it the shamans voice they turned to see hickamore come out of the shadows damn that lurking spell whandall shouted hickamore grinned i wondered if you would tell the wagonmaster he turned to kettle belly now black kettle behold the skill of your shaman and the value of our bargain dowries for all your daughters in your share alone hickamore cackled suddenly he stiffened he went past carver and reached into the false compartment of the wagon now open stop that carter shouted hickamore ignored them his skinny arms lifted holding two nuggets both as big as his head as if they floated up under his palms refined you said a wizard absorbed its power morth is that who you meant he didnt take it all boy the old mans voice had gained in timbre and volume it must have been audible throughout the camp here he handed a nugget to carter and one to hammer took the nugget carver was holding and lifted it high his face twisted in joy his eyes rolled back into his head and he stood entranced now what have you done kettle belly demanded of whandall his two sons stared at the shaman in the shadows were bison folk who had followed hickamores voice toward possible entertainment carver and carter had given over shouting at kettle belly they watched the shaman willow ignored hickamore to stare at whandall looking at him in a way she never had before not unfriendly certainly not angry but as if shed never really seen him before whandall could speak to her hickamore recovered he grinned wildly more gold calls its kin to this he said were a long way from the river whandall said yes yes it was washed down to the river from above hickamore said the hills are alive with its music i feel the power of it calling me we must find it now kettle belly demanded hickamore nodded ecstatically is this wise kettle belly said there are bandits all about us with the power in the gold i will find and destroy them all years had fallen from hickamores face but they were creeping back again his voice must have carried for miles any bandit spy would hear him you made a spell so you wouldnt get old whandall guessed hickamore grinned craftily i have spoken many spells in my life lordkin kettle belly i must find that gold tonight it wants me how much gold hickamore shook his head as much as this perhaps more you want refined gold i want the gold changed morth whandall said slowly he became someone else younger you told me hickamore said yes and crazy i am already crazy hickamore said with casual conviction whandall come we will search together and you can tell me more of morth of atlantis but recall our bargain hickamore said black kettle will count what is here come before whandall could protest the shaman took his hand and pulled him away from the wagon behind him whandall could hear the others shouting as kettle belly inspected the false wagon bottom he tried to go back hed left kettle belly surrounded by armed adolescents in an argument over wealth missing the point entirely the shaman said your friends are safe with black kettle he is an honest man i have said so and it is true you he turned to one of kettle bellys sons number three run quickly to my wagon and tell twisted cloud that her father needs her instantly to go with him on a journey run why twisted cloud twisted cloud was hickamores fifteenyearold daughter who giggled we seek magic rutting deer has no sense of magic her jaw line is clearly mine else i might be suspicious of my wife hickamore said whandall looked sharply at hickamore but if the shaman noticed he didnt react a halfmoon peeked through scattered streamers of cloud nearly overhead the clouds stirred restlessly the older man strode on before they reached the wagon train they saw twisted cloud running toward them still fastening her skirt her black hair flew in the wind you feel it hickamore demanded something she said she wasnt giggling now father what is it hickamore seemed to sniff at the air this way i think no twisted cloud said she cocked her head to one side more uphill where the flood ran ah yes it is very bright there was nothing bright ahead of them but whandall didnt say so hed seen morth at work they were rushing ahead of him running through poppies and scrub brush and over rocky ground whandall had trouble keeping up a young girl and an old man were leaving whandall in their dust hickamore might be enchantedwas enchantedbut how could twisted cloud outrun whandall she saw him stumblesomehow though she was far aheadturned back and took his wrist and ran again pulling him she babbled breathlessly as she ran i squinted when i was little my father made magic to strengthen my sight it worked a little ive never seen so well as tonight there are spirits about but nothing dangerous follow me oh thats it youre seeingin the dark did hickamore make himselfyoung too a laugh in her voice yes but when he was younger she stopped talking the ground wasnt tripping him anymore they were climbing a steep hill of bare pale rock twisted cloud was steering him aright but hickamore was far above them now outrunning them both power in the halfrefined gold was taking him back through time or else he was running over raw gold left by a flood whandall gasped he doesnt need me as much as he thought her answer was not to the point rutting deer is promised you know doesnt like me my dowry isnt the equal of hers but whandall laughed hickamore wants us together just to see each other it may be to notice a man could be knifed for lusting after a girl this young change the subject when he was younger what kind of magic does a shaman cast she laughed ill tell you one he told me piebald behemoth was dying father was his apprentice a shaman must not be seen to grow ill and die father took the aspect of piebald behemoth and became our shaman twisted cloud was pulling him uphill and chattering as if a fifteenyearold girl had no need to draw breath shed never spoken so much in her older sisters presence the bisons wanted to be fooled you understand father let himself get well over the next year took a new name and of course he blesses crops for the villages we pass and makes weather magic that sometimes works the twisted cloud that was tearing up the camp the clay i was horn father dispersed it before it reached our wagon mother told me about that their path converged with a small and narrow swiftrunning stream hickamore was far ahead twisted cloud raised her voice above the sound of rushing water and once he tried to summon coyote but the god wouldnt come the stream narrowed and was partially dammed so that it formed a falls as high as a tall man twisted cloud and whandall reached the stream just as hickamore was emerging from the pool behind the boulder he was holding a nugget the size of his fist and grinning like a fool lean as a snake he was and muscled like a lordkin black hair fell to his shoulders his eyes were ecstatic and mad all in a moment his black hair curled a wave of gold ran through it and then a wave of dirty white then most of the white mane was dripping into the stream leaving bald and mottled scalp hickamores face contorted gaunt and hollow jaw more square brows more prominent it was not his face at all but the face of a dying stranger hickamore fell backward into the water his twisted features were a grimace of pain and horror one eye turned milky the other stared wildly father twisted cloud screamed she held two smaller nuggets when she ran to her father with them he writhed in pain she threw the gold into the water and reached to wrest the larger nugget from hickamores fingers its the old spells she shouted over her shoulder take the gold whandall ran to help the old mans arms had gone slack but the gold would not release his fingers twisted cloud touched it and yelped she pulled her hands loose as if the gold were sticky and lurched back into whandall shouting an unfamiliar phrase he tried to get around her then his mind caught up shed shouted dont touch it hickamore whimpered and spat teeth the sound in his throat was a death rattle then he was still the current dribbled water into his mouth whandall asked are you all right for twisted cloud was looking around her like a blind woman this wasnt mourning this was something else her eyes found him and pinned him to reality i can see i think i never saw before whandall feath girl what happened to your father all the old spells did morth of atlantis know how to make a failed spell go away i have no idea father didnt know piebald behemoth didnt know father took the old shamans aspect on the night piebald behemoth died before i was born slay here whandall the stream was icy on his shins the shamans daughter spoke before he started to wade to shore he stopped and looked and saw the merest shadow of what was happening on shore both sides of the stream were thickly overgrown with plants it hadnt been like this earlier you could almost see them growing whandall hissed between his teeth he was not a man to take such a thing lightly father blessed crops the girl said and made rain during drought that didnt always work either clouds were forming knots in the half moonlight gearing up for rainstorms decades postponed should we be in a riverbed when the rains come no twisted cloud turned and began to wade downstream we have a few minutes it wont be like this farther down whandall had lost all feeling in his feet the bushes on both shores were closing above them behind their backs the voice of a god laughed they whirled around the dead shaman was sitting up his voice was strong and louder than the falling water cloud dear your father is dead he lived a life very much to his liking and no more can be done for him harpyseshmarlwhandall coyote hickamore once mimicked a shaman freshly dead his spells have succeeded beyond his maddest dreams and i am coyote yes the voice of a god hickamore had tried to call coyote but do you know who coyote is a god among the bison people ive heard stories my people may have known of you coyote the stories make you sound like a clever lordkin coyote laughed his throat was drying out in death whandall glanced aside twisted cloud was basking in a state of worship hed get no help from her dont offend a god he thought and hoped it could be that simple coyote said i must know more of this morth i see that you understand the notion of trading knowledge trading stories will you trade with me that would delight me whandall said and whandall was gone chapter whandall placehold came to himself in black night shadowed by a boulder kneeling in pooled blood above a dead man he was holding his lordkin knife and it dripped he stayed quite stillmore still than the dead man whose heel still jittered against the rockand listened he heard not city noise but campground noise running water forty beasts and a hundred children and elders and men and women settled down for bed the campground must be just the far side of this rock sounds announced a dozen bison gone to gather water nobody did that alone there might be bandits about a smallish bandit lay right at whandalls feet his throat had been cut his knife was better than whandalls and he wore a sheath too whandall took both the moon wasnt up yet but there was starlight and campfire light and in the west a wall of black clouds sputtered with continuous lightning in that near darkness he could see lurkers who moved too often in just these few breaths hed seen too many to be mere spies would they attack the caravan directly or the little watergathering party where was twisted cloud safe where was willow how had he come here memory was there to be fished up if he could find any kind of bait so the dead man and a chesthigh rock rocks everywhere hiding places everywhere but coyote must have had seen this rock as the best a bandit or two must be hiding there so coyote had crept from shadow to shadow until this shadow gave up its lurker coyote cut his throat and now it was his hiding place then then nothing only whandall blinking in the dark ah hed been counting on the gold and it all came flooding back coyote had become whandall whandall had become coyote whandall was gone coyote held out his hand twisted cloud took it and came into his arms with a laugh her joy a nearintolerable glare whandall shied back that memory was too intense it blinded him to the danger in the lightninglit night women had loved whandall for gifts or for status or for love alone and one he had gathered but he had never been adored coyote expected it he knew how to treat a worshipper sending the girl into ecstasy was not the point she might remain rapt wandering in enlightenment while she grew old he had to keep bringing her back with humor with sudden bursts of startling selfishness or for minutes at a time by becoming whandall placehold ignorant and lost puzzled and horny this whandall was a mocking graffito and the memory made whandalls ears burn but it snapped twisted cloud from nirvana into postcoital laughter everything was funny to coyote theyd loved in the freezing stream an hour ahead of a flash flood while plants went crazy all around the old shamans body coyote loved the danger then theyd run downstream ahead of hard rain and a flurry of hail and while they ran coyote had run barefoot through whandalls memories tracing morth matching whandalls life to sketchy tales hed found in hickamores dying brain seeking more whandall had guessed right the shaman didnt know of a lurking spell he hid in shadows like any lordkin gatherer coyote lurked in the same fashion hiding in shadows risking a tookeen eye of course a god need not be seen but that was a cheat as morths lurking spell was a cheat coyote thought contemptuously even as he yearned to try atlantean magic whandall remembering saw what coyote had forgotten he must teach his skills a god cant teach a gods power to his worshippers in whandall only a trace remained of yanginatep the torpid fire god but coyote sensed kinship he saw a city of thieves and arsonists and himself barred forever by his nature the stories coyote loved stories he learned wanshigs tale of jack rigenlord and the port waluu woman and tras preetror confronting lord pelzeds men and others the story hed told hickamore of a boy and girl on samortys balcony coyote balanced against whandalls own memory he reveled in the performance story and music and people pretending lo be what they were not he lived it again while his body ran blind plants lashed coyote unnoticed and now whandall felt scratches and swellings across every exposed square inch of skin what he left behind coyote remembered walking from the frozen east across a wilderness of ice that had been ocean crossing stretches of water he ensorcelled to buoy his followers then south toward the sun he and his people six hundred years moving south under pressure of starvation setting fires to drive game into reach and to leave the forests free of undergrowth afterward he had become coyote while they wandered but he bore other names elsewhere and he was there still tribes encircling the worlds cap of ice shared a trickster god and another lived in the tundra and in atlantis another in the norse lands he was loki who was also a god of fire gods of a same nature shared a life and memories and experience were contagious loki the fire god was being tormented prometheus gave fire and knowledge to men and was punished by zoosh birds tore at his liver yanginatep felt the same agony his life leaked through the gash that was lords town an emptiness made by lords with a warlocks wheel whandall placehold had felt their agony in his sleep coyote had kept his bargain story for story urgency added spice coyote had never forgotten the bandits he and twisted cloud stopped and spread their clothes on bare rock and loved again and again lower down he said presently theyve come to attack your caravan theyll do it while the shamans gone twisted cloud return to your folk i will stop them please twisted cloud said dont let whandall be killed i wont coyote promised he had no idea whether the lordkin would live neither did whandall lordkins promise still twisted clouds last thought for him made him warm inside every few breaths he saw more bandits in the rocks in the dark they had some skill he decided whandall alone would have seen less of these lurkers in their native turf and theyd have seen him but something of coyotes skills stayed with him coyote had intended more he moved ahead of twisted cloud lurking shadow to shadow twisted cloud moved toward the camp slowing as she came with skills taught by her father she would remain hidden from bandits but coyote knew what would happen when she reached the caravan perhaps she did too coyote passed lurking bandits and left them alive save one who just wouldnt get out of the way he passed through the caravans ring of guards they patrolled in pairs the boy hammer and the young man carver were on duty the rest of the miller and ropewalker families were on guard around their own wagon by now most of them should have been asleep little iris miller was out like a doused flame but the rest were up and edgy this was going to be difficult twisted cloud was perhaps twentyfive minutes away coyote would have that long he neednt escape with gold coyote only needed to touch it but for several seconds he needed a disguise wait why not pass himself off as whandall placehold he slid out of their vicinity circled and came back from the uphill direction a lordkin stumbling just a bit in the wild sputtering dark willow you still up carter i saw hammer on sentry duty she said whandall good carter broke in yeah well the entire caravan knows what were carrying thanks to you we dont just have bandits to worry aboutits everyone carter was disappointed in whandall coyote was enjoying himself immensely my first good chance to teach you how to hide what youve gathered and i failed you poor child now hear this he said with the authoritative rasp whandall placehold had spent years perfecting heads snapped up we are not gatherers if we were gatherers we wouldnt know what to gather and what to leave alone because were among strangers town or caravan wed be caught and hanged the first time we tried but none of that matters because we are not gatherers willow was smiling radiantly coyote saw that without looking at her the smaller children looked mutinous but carters jaw hung slack coyote held his eye until he nodded then he went to the wagon theyd closed up the floor coyote made as if to inspect it did kettle belly count this yes whandall willow said good but he was reaching for the manna no need to open the false bed wood planks wouldnt stop the flow no need indeed two wizards had sucked all the power out of all that gold it was as dead inside the wagon bed as so many rocks twisted cloud was ten minutes away any attempt to delay her would eat his time too and he didnt have lime coyoteaswhandall stalked away saying ill go patrol i bet hammers ready for a nap willow stared after him be careful she called be careful out beyond the firelight he melted into the shadows hed needed wild gold coyote was going to miss the battle and all he could do now was set this fool lordkin in place chapter by now whandall knew where most of the bandits were at least those nearby fifty or so there might be many more a messenger was moving among them but whatever his words they were not attack even a strangers body language told him that they werent waiting for anything in particular they watched and envied the shaman had known that in hours or a day they would run out of patience but coyote had been waiting and now whandall knew why a pony whinnied then the others then the firelight showed twisted cloud walking proud and erect with nothing to hide the ponies would have screamed their anger if she had lain with a man with say whandall placehold but twisted cloud had lain with coyote she was carrying coyotes child freshly conceived the ponies went mad they began to destroy the corral the bandits knew a distraction when they saw it without twisted cloud their attack might have come at any time theyd already marked the locations of most of the caravans guards they charged in a scuffling run the scouts ran about whacking laggards to get them moving and whandall was behind them first things first the nearest man was slow and his back was turned whandall could have swung wide but the man ahead of him had a fine knife with a big shiny leafshaped blade whandall would have to kill the first man before he fought the second the bandit never heard him a backhand slash at a leg draw across the thigh until it spurted blood then bring the knife around and high and straight down to the join of neck and shoulder he barely croaked as he fell but the second must have glimpsed something he whirled around to see in the half moonlight a silent giant with a dripping knife he screamed when he should have fought and then the point was in his throat hut whandalls knife stuck in the bone and again hed been seen the bandit to his left turned and charged and ran himself on the knife whandall had taken from the man coyote had killed whandall left his own knife where it stuck he had two bandits knives each long and heavy the hilt grooved for fingers and with a guard treasure indeed in serpents walk and worth his life out here maybe because four or five bandits were spreading through the boulders to surround him again what were they seeing a lordkin should know how to lurk elsewhere the bandits were converging on the wagons yelling like lordkin each pretending he was a mob whandall had been told they would do this among the rocks who could know how many there were kettle belly stood in the center of the wagon camp surrounded by his sons and a dozen others the trained young men he called his army others men and women and adolescent children went to defend their own wagons younger children scrambled under wagons kettle belly shouted ordersand was obeyed at his command fifteen young men with spears and javelins formed a line and threw their javelins at the bandits they could see the wrong band the disorganized gatherers kettle belly couldnt see the bandit lord but whandall could that one his brighter colors flashing in moonlight a burly bandit shouted orders to twenty companions who wore colorful sashes those hesitated awaiting his word the equivalent of pelzeds guard whandall thought but most of the horde were rushing toward the wagons paying no attention to the big man those were no threat they were gatherers who would run if faced with real force it was the bandit chief and his henchmen that the bisons ought to fear memories flooded through whandall riding the shouts of the bandits coyote had run with bandits too and he knew them bandits didnt want to destroy a wagon train they wanted loot women and a wagon to carry it all eight or ten bandits could snatch a wagon and pull it into the dark if other bandits stayed to harry pursuit men could outrun a bison team five bandits were coming at whandall spreading out to surround him not enough to slow the horde yelling wouldnt even be noticed but snake feet snake feet he screamed he danced between two men and turned on one with slashing doubled blades and left him with both arms bleeding then whirled to find the other much too close stabbed him through the heart and delicately plucked his blade serpents walk you ignorant lookers and he ran three still chased him he was lucky to get any attention at all he was only one man with a few corpses around him over there was a wagon train rich with loot these savages were going to kill a lot of people unless he could distract them four of the front rank of gatherers went down before bison clans spears two got up and limped away from the battle kettle bellys army hefted spears in both hands and advanced toward the charging bandits they hadnt seen the bandit chief and his guard moving toward the caravan at a jog holding formation whandall ran to intercept them hed guessed their target he could hear panting behind him he turned once and slashed and was running again three behind him now one wounded and none of them really wanted to catch him in the caravan some of the defenders had noticed whandall from somewhere behind them came a highpitched song that sounded of rushing wind of storms and joy and death twisted cloud her voice carried courage to her friends fear to her enemies and more gold she would be carrying some of the river gold empowered by its wild magic what had she learned from her father her spells would be uncontrolled in the best of times and nowwhandall didnt think he should put much trust in twisted clouds spells still her song rang out and a few of the rear rank of bandits melted away into the night behind them a wind was rising the storm that had gathered above hickamore was coming to bison clan carver stood on willows wagon carter just behind him their slings whirling there wasnt much light and if their stones hit anyone there was no sign of it it was a game coyote would call it a dance the bandits wanted loot women if they could get them the wagonmaster wanted to limit his losses keep his people safe and inflict enough damage to make the bandits think again before attacking his wagon train he would risk men to save women he would risk all to save all the wagons but he would not risk many men to save only one the bandits would choose the wagon least guarded the lightest and easiest to move willow ropewalkers wagon was small and near defended by children and whandall placehold was behind them coyote memories and kettle bellys training were overlaid on what he could see what coyote knew of bandits and raids was all scrambled up with memories of possession by yanginatep that was different hed been possessed of yanginatep but he had been coyote coyote had opened his memory and doused him with knowledge and stories whandall would be days sorting out his own memories from coyotes three of the chieftains score had been cut down by the caravans defenders but other freelance bandits were gathering around that core of men increasing their number the corral splintered the bonehead stallions ran mad through the camp horns flashing in moonlight twisted cloud ran behind them flapping her arms howling like a coyote guiding them into the attackers bandits scattered ahead of them one rose on a horn and was thrown flying and one ran straight into whandalls knife stopped in mortal shock and screamed only when he saw whandalls face whandall moved among them slashing the ponies broke free and ran screaming from twisted cloud the bandit chief shouted more orders five of his guard and half a dozen other bandits heard thought it over and converged toward whandall placehold about time they noticed him whandall backed away from the horde that was coming at him whirled and struck down the tired man at his back turned back and saw them stop as if theyd hit a wall then half of them came on too many too many were coming at him at once if they swarmed ahead theyd have him before he could deal with more than two the bandits knew that no one wanted to be one of the two whandall snatched up a cloak that a dead bandit had gathered from a wagon he wound it around his arm with the skirt dangling just in time to shield himself from a knife thrown from the shadows it was still turning and struck the cloak without penetration whandall leaped forward to slash and felt the chuk of his blade striking bone then he leaped atop a boulder kettle belly shouted orders his spearmen moved forward at a trot spears held waist high in an underhand grip the bandit chief was between kettle bellys spears and a maniac dripping blood and marked with a serpent his companions closed around their chief and shouted in a language whandall had never heard before he understood every word look what i got prairie dog fool my brother is dead its not loot i want its blood drink alone then his face his face you said their shaman was dead run away they were pursued by worse than kettle bellys laughter some had snatched clothing that ropewalker wagon had set out to dry a gale wind pulled at the cloth like sails and they ran off balance and half blind whandall ran after them striking down the slowest who fell with a scream two others turned releasing what they carried drawing knives as their loot flapped away like ghosts then one fell without a sound the other dithered an instant then came on alone whandall killed him he looked around to see a whirling sling a triumphant grin the moons come out carver shouted his sling whirled a bandit with a wooden chest in his arms cursed as the stone hit his back he turned dropping the chest it shattered whandall caught up to him slash the leg chop to the shoulder run past take another whandall kettle bellys voice well behind too far behind to be any help carver laughed beside him whandall do you know what your face is like hed seen himself in morths mirror but carver didnt wait for an answer you light up every time you kill a man the snake lights up in blue fire just for a breath but it scares them out of their minds there must be magical powermannain murder it was lighting up his magical tattoo but only for an instant and now each running man perceived whandall in the dark behind him a man clutching a big wood bucket with a handle turned and saw him and shrieked whandalls utmost burst of speed still couldnt catch him though his staccato scream was announcing his location all across the plain enough carver theyre getting away leave some to tell the tale carver whandall commanded come back to the wagons he had two fine new knives hed left his crude lordkin knife some where on the plain stuck in a mans throat coyote spoke to him from memory or from the shadows not in words but in pictures of a pack of coyotes running away to regroup and fall on a pair of pursuing dogs he urged carver into a run chapter nobody slept conversations clustered around the wounded there was wine whandall was treated as a hero except that nobody offered him wine he said nothing and looked many were heroes that night and great was the praise they received but only the wounded were drinking wine that actually made sense he thought wine dulls pain everybody had a story they all wanted to hear whandalls but they didnt want to shut up weve been counting on you you know we wanted to see how a harpy would fight this from a man who remained cheerful as his wife bound up a deep slash across his back hed never spoken to whandall before after hickamore went off with you we were all twitchy waiting for the attack wondering when it would come why hickamore would leave us now why hed taken the harpy thinking he must be crazy he was crazy whandall affirmed yeah gold fever ah the wounded man found his train of thought then the ponies all went crazy we near jumped out of our skins we saw twisted cloud come back alone and bandits running out of the dark and guards running ahead of them to get into position everyone armed was running somewhere anyone else was looking for weapons twisted cloud saw what was happening and she ran around flapping her arms at the ponies they were miming away from me twisted cloud said and i thought i could steer them into the bandits it worked a little but they wrecked a lot too and i wouldnt count on their coming back she seemed unhurt she smiled at whandall a sudden bedroom smile and he couldnt help leering back she told kettle belly i carry coyotes child thats what they were afraid of fawn and rutting deer were tending mountain cat that looked like a near miss a wide bloody knife stroke across his ribs and chest an inch above cutting his belly open his arm was bleeding too fawn glared at whandall but mountain cat didnt notice you saved me he said know it or not that son of a brokehorned pony cut me and was going into his backslash that would have opened me like a salmon then out there on the desert you pulled your knife out of some poor bastard and looked at us like a hellblue glowing snake and he just couldnt look away and i did i think i sliced up his eye anyway he ran rutting deer seemed bewildered she caught whandall looking and shrugged helplessly i never saw anything just you killing someone in the dark and poor mountain cat fighting for us i cant see it either whandall told her by midnight it was over kettle bellys men took a tally by dim firelight and intermittent moonlight not straying too far and never separating the score was twenty dead bandits against one old man who died of a heart attack and one young boy who was out after stream water they found him facedown in the water his head bashed in and his bucket missing some rope clothing a few pots one mirror some harnesses a couple of spears they lost very little and got some of it back most agreed that it would be a while before these bandits attacked the bison clan again but there are other bandits kettle belly said all along the trail as whandall crossed between fires the man had moved smoothly into place beside him winning this kind of fight can be really expensive it wasnt but it could have been whandall waited hammer saw you and carver running into the dark and out of sight we thought theyd killed you we chased them you have wagons to defend you could get lost they could double back around you kettle belly studied him it doesnt make sense to risk everything like that we couldnt go after you you know and then you wouldnt be there next time look harpy this is how its supposed to work the bandits give up trying to gel a wagon as soon as we show them some blood then they grab anything they can and run typically youll see a couple of bandits lacing off against a wagon family and nobody really wants a fight the owners shout for help a couple of neighbors come and the bandits run away and hit some other wagon whandall began to doubt had he broken some law kettle belly do we have some kind of bargain with them a treaty with bandits no then it doesnt make sense to follow their rules we gave them no guarantees right theyre not holding back to keep some bargain are they lets shake them up a little they want rules let them come and ask for rules kettle belly sighed hickamore said bandits wouldnt know what to make of you he was right youre more interested in killing them than in protecting the wagons now youre telling me you were following a plan plan well i did what ive been taught the placehold never makes half of a war whandall dreaded the moment when he must face willow but when the moment came it didnt matter hickamores storm swept over bison clan they were soaked and blinded the rain was gone as quickly as it came leaving them in a howling hot wind kettle belly and twisted cloud drove them to work the flood was coming just behind the wagons were already on high ground trust kettle belly for that but everything had to be tied down anchored there was the risk that bandits would strike again under cover of the storm and in the midst of all that he and willow could only glimpse each other at a halfblind run in a moonshrouded moment they almost ran into each other willow blinked then gripped his shoulders and bellowed was it the fire god no it was coyote you heard i was afraid she might be wrong she was gone dawn showed the wagons on islands in a flood bandits would drown before they could gather anything it seemed safe to sleep and everyone posted a guard anyway iris miller had slept she started to complain but willow touched her cheek and asked who else could we trust and iris went and they slept whandall woke near noon traces of breakfast remained the rest of the caravan hadnt been up long he could see several of them out on the damp plain finding treasure the bandits had dropped whandall had been thinking willow certainly knew as the whole caravan knew that twisted cloud was pregnant by coyote where the only living manshape was whandalls whandall was prepared to spend months or years explaining to willow that it was willow he loved he would be patient he must satisfy her brothers too not just carverwho had fought beside him joyfully who might be ready to accept himbut carter too it might take forever so be it but twisted cloud was pregnant by his doing and that was another matter whandall had heard too many lordkin say possessed and known it for a threadbare excuse if twisted cloud claimed him he must marry her two wives were rare among the bison people but while whandall was thinking kettle belly acted at high noon kettle belly led twisted cloud to a table helped her up and joined her whandall saw no other signal but conversations chopped off bison clan gathered around them kettle bellys voice rolled like a lords twisted cloud will bear the grandchild of our shaman and the child of coyote himself twisted cloud glowed with pride willow ropewalker stepped up beside whandall what man is worthy of raising such a child coyotes son or daughter daughter twisted cloud shouted happily will be powerful and willful and prone to mischief twisted clouds man must control the child long enough to teach her willow called kettle belly wagonmaster a ripple of discontent kettle belly looked down displeased i claim whandall placehold as mine whandall turned to look at her willow met his eyes forcing herself kettle belly said fine and dismissed her whandall couldnt think of an intelligent question but if she didnt mean it he was going to die women talk about being courted willow told him carefully and i liked that and you gave me a dowry so id have a choice and its been fun whandall she held both of his hands now you courting me and not knowing how and of course my brothers had to get used to you but willow but i thought she might claim you you made her pregnant listen that was so i got in first whandall couldnt stop grinning he dared squeeze her hands then pull her into his arms they turned thus to watch the ceremony she clung to him stroked his tattoo ran her hand down his left arm to touch the misshapen wrist bones then she looked at him and smiled again after a long time whandall became aware of the rest of the world what was kettle belly doing holding an auction she does not seem eager to claim me he observed youre disappointed because i just no just realized you cant see your own tattoo glowing rutting deer cant see it either but anyone else must be keeping his mouth shut because it means he doesnt have shamans blood you cant raise coyotes child oops but orange blossom hello carter did you i heard my shy sister now i suppose you never will teach us how to gather carter said to whandall whandall said no but you can teach us how to fight you do fine stag rampant a young man of leather smith wagon claimed twisted cloud whandall had seen the mans doubts but they were gone now she would certainly be bison clans religious leader until her daughter had gained maturity and maybe beyond and the rustle of activity was bison clan gearing up to travel late as it was they could still make first pines by evening book two whandall feathersnake twentytwo years pass part one the raven chapter whandall just missed the bird he was rooting around in the back of the cart while green stone drove he heard green stone cry out he wriggled backward out of the luggage space whandalls second son was lean and rangy taller than his father he was standing precariously on the wobbling bench while the bison plodded ahead there did you see it it was wonderful a bird colored just like your tattoo father its behind those trees now watch where youre driving stone the trees were bare but whandall still saw nothing he didnt stand up the winter wind cut like a forest of knives the hemp road continued north and east along the base of the low western hills whandall had set new castle on one of those ahead was an open plain and river valley where the hemp road ended whandall fished out bread and cheese for their lunch he could see dust ahead at the horizon or beyond he would not see more for another hour there was a fairsize town at the far end of the hemp road a place for supplies and refitting a market center for all of the caravans roads came together there the coast road that led west to great hawk bay and another that wound through mountain passes north and east to valleys whandall never expected to see in midwinter roads end was six hours travel from the new castle it would be faster in summer slower in the spring mud nobody would travel that distance twice in one day willow wouldnt expect him back for three or four there were just under a hundred wagons in the wagon yard forty bore the fieryfeathered serpent that had become the sign of whandall feathersnake the count was uncertain some wagons were only components wheels lay everywhere mountain cat lifted an axle into place for a feathersnake wagon that had come home on skids hed have used the pulleys but with whandall watching he preferred to show off his strength whandall feathersnake he asked how runs your life whandall hefted the other end of the heavy beam no excitement we want to thank you for the rug rutting deer set it in our gossip den good the public area unspoken he would never see it there though the women stayed polite willow did not visit rutting deer sometimes whandall wondered had rutting deer gone to mountain cats tent in fury because whandall misused her name or was it the night of the battle with mountain cat a wounded hero and the bonehead ponies all fled into the dark did she expect her father to bargain with unicorns for her but hickamore died and still she might have married the man she was promised to but one of the ponies had come back after the battle so shed married mountain cat without a wagon for a dowry theyd settled in roads end and found what work was there he could never ask the feathersnake family had to get along with a man who built their wheels and a woman who served their food he said i just got here what are the hot stories plenty of work mountain cat waved around he told what hed heard a bison clan wagon lost to bandits this year and found in pieces pigeons wagon had lost control on the long hill from high pines to the great valley and disintegrated only the metal parts had come home did you see the bird rainbow colored it circled us for hours looking for something i think no are you in a hurry for anything no but tell me whats finished whandall spent three days inspecting his own wagons trading goods and tools and lore trading stories too as he had for a dozen years and planning the summers route with his firstborn son saber tooth was just twenty hed been leading the wagons for three years now whandall found himself wishing he were going too he had long since given up traveling to raise and guard his family to build and maintain the new castle and to manage the details of trade all of these matters he delighted in hut if only he could he two men let him set seshmarl in charge of the new castle while whandall ran off down the hemp road with the caravan for one more summer they kept telling whandall about the flamecolored bird it had circled the sprawl of partly repaired wagons at roads end three times then flown off down the road whandall grew tired of hearing about the bird everyone had seen it but him past the new castles entry sign a horde of younger children came running to greet him not just his and willows children and grandchildren but millers and ropewalkers and servants children too the new castle was getting crowded whandall thought and then he heard what they were calling the bird the bird well what he scooped up larkfeathers hammer ropewalkers girl who named herself for the startling yellow hair she had seen in a traders mirror did i miss the cursed thing again no no lookup nothing at the sign the sign behind him hed passed right underneath it the new castle buildings were squarebuilt roomy but a bit drab willow didnt like to display their wealth but she had let him sculpt and paint that sign a great gaudy winged snake in all the colors of fire and mount it high above the main gate as a signature and a warning the bird was perched on its head against those colors it was almost invisible but the children were shouting seshmarls come down seshmarls the great bird took flight it wheeled above them flapping hard shadowblackened with the sun behind it it was clearly a crow it cried i am seshmarls in a voice that was eerily familiar it was too big to perch on a childs arm it circled thwarted until whandall lifted his own left arm hardly believing the bird settled crushingly the children cried say it say it i am seshmarls by its shape by its flight it was a crow magic must have changed its colors it could hardly be covered in paint and still fly it turned its head to study whandall first with one eye then the other it said help me whandall seshmarl my hope lies in your shadow whandall whispered morth the wizards voice said come to rordrays attic and morth of atlantis will make you rich i am rich whandall said the bird didnt have an answer for that i am seshmarls it said this lime whandall heard the possessive the children gurgled in delight what else does it say whandall asked them anything we want it to larkfeathers shouted and it knows us by name i can tell it to carry messages to my sisters or to glacier waters daughter two and it does in my voice where does it sleep here mostly but aunt willow lets it in the house if it wants to come in its ever so nice a bird uncle whandall it would have to be whandall thought he turned back to the bird morth of atlantis help me whandall seshmarl my hope lies in your shadow help how come to rordrays attic why should i morth of atlantis will give you wealth and adventure how help me whandall seshmarl my hope lies in your shadow come to rordrays attic green stone laughed not very smart its a bird i meant the wizard who sent it stone said offering you wealth and adventure youre almost as rich as chief farthest land and youve had more adventure than a man can stand i suppose whandall said hed said it himself often enough he looked back to the bird when another messenger comes the bird said wait the kinless didnt like to display their wealth the wonderful dresses whandall had bought her willow had at first worn only for him then only when playing hostess inside her own house what wealth showed was in the private areas of the house willow met him at the door she led him through toward the back the bird on his shoulder willow draped softly along his other side shed set up a roost in the bedroom she must consider the bird immensely valuable and they both knew what would happen next but in front of the bird he said you know it can talk just what someone teaches it oh seshmarls should we cover its ears love do birds have ears willow i think youd better hear this to the bird he said enunciating why should i the bird croaked morth of atlantis morth willow exclaimed will give you wealth and adventure help me whandall seshmarl willow moved the roosting post out into the hall and they returned to the bedroom a sense of priorities could be a valuable thing during the next few winter weeks their discussions formed a pattern morth wanted to enter their lives again morth was not to be trusted his wealth wasnt needed as for whandall leaving the new castle do you remember the last time you went with the caravan we nearly lost the new castle whandall admitted i nearly lost you well then during those first six years a legend had spread up and down the hemp road of a grinning giant who wore a tattoo that flared with light when he killed then whandall feathersnake had retired three years later hed led the summer caravan south he returned to find invaders in the new castle a new tale joined the old but willow had extorted a promise now he said well then they died the storys all along the route the farther you follow it back toward teps town the bigger the numbers get whandall feathersnake was gone three years seven ten snuck back in as a beggar covering this with mud whandall slapped his tattooed cheek depending on whos talking or even shaved the skin off leaving a hideous scar killed twenty thirty forty suitors who wanted to claim his wife and land nobody would dare try me now he didnt say but willow heard the words between the words she changed the subject i never liked it you know sending you in that direction after i was pregnant back toward teps town oh that no love i promised but rordrays attic is on the coast due west of us puma tribe sends wagons every few years theyd told him of rordrays attic it was a mythical place inhabited by shape changers unreachable save by magic the food touched with glamour unequaled anywhere that food was mostly fish it seemed and whandall had not been much tempted later as the caravan route was extended he met a few who had seen the place then a pair of puma who had spent a few days there and been served from rordrays kitchen sometimes another wagons primary heir rode with puma they didnt go to make themselves rich despite the difficulties of crossing two ranges of jagged hills it was a training exercise a lark an adventure now whandall said id add a wagon to their train and take just green stone bring back fish spelled or just dried i never liked fish myself but some do take mmm rope everyone wants rope dear maybe carvers feet are itching too whandall yes my most difficult gathering i do purses leap out to claim you the way i did but you do remember morth ready to make me immortal his for eternity like it or not crazy as a bat morth running up mount joy with a fat frothy wave struggling uphill behind him whandall soothed her two bats but you got us away from him now lets keep it that way yes dear wagons couldnt move in the winter anyway chapter two flaps and a space between made up the placeholds front door a man going in or out would not take all the placeholds warm air with him they didnt build that way in the valley of smokes because it never got that cold and because too fine a house made too fine a gathering on a fine clear cold morning whandall stood in the double door and looked past the outer flap it looked like you could start now take the wagons and run from the gate floated the voices of saber tooth and green stone whandall heard tattoo and tried to ignore the rest morth gave father us too that was stone not us you if you like saber tooth whandall sipped from a dipper of orange juice the air was clear and cold the animals were not quite awake sound carried amazingly well what if morth wizard wants something know that pay with a tattoo mother wont let him go whandall grinned willow spoke at his ear our sons are misinformed whandall feathersnake doesnt obey worth a curse whandall didnt trust his voice shed startled him badly why does stone want that tattoo so much willow wondered he cleared his throat and said its not just the tattoo stone would be my second in command on that trek he could talk to a wizard see the ocean taste food saber tooth has only heard about at the end hed have something his brother doesnt saber tooth now lie thinks he doesnt want a tattoo but he knows hell be riding toward the firewoods with the caravan come spring and nowhere near the ocean wherever his brother might be i wish hed give it a rest talk to him and say what the only thing that ever scared morth was water and now he claims to be at a seaside inn its some kind of trap seshmarls the bird was on her shoulder i am seshmarls it responded i finally remembered seshmarl is the name you used to lie to morth morth of atlantis help me whandall seshmarl my hope lies in your shadow the bird croaked come to rordrays attic and morth of atlantis will make you rich hes afraid willow said sounds like it whandall sipped at his orange juice afraid of what its hard not to wonder wagons couldnt move in the spring mud either two ranges of hills stood between new castle and the sea but the plain between was flat and well watered life was giving birth to life all up and down the hemp road the tribes worked on the wagons and waited the lions messenger was a small man with an odd look to his jaw he came alone making his way downhill wearing nothing but a backpack when the placeholds men had come to meet him he had dressed in a breechcloth and a shorthaired yellow hide youre puma tribe arent you green stone asked him thats right well pumas got five wagons in repair at roads end thiss the new castle that higher hill south thats chief farthest land new castle right im to see whandall feathersnake the stranger said got a contract for him and you aint him youre hard to fool im his second son youre not wearing his tattoo i talked to the guy that gave it to him wait here at the gate stone said and ran for the house the pack bore thick straps intricately knotted about his shoulders it would be difficult to remove whandall thought if you only had paws to work with the tattoos on his cheekspuma the man grinned at the ambiguity yes and yes the tribal names had been more than names once from time to time a shape changer turned up saucer clouds twisted clouds first son was claimed to he a werebison wolf tribe had thrown up a werewolf they were watching him grow with some unease thatd explain why you travel alone why and how names whitecap mountain and im here to offer a contract with rordray called the lion hes a were toothey all are at the attic but theyre seaweres theyre mers can you read no rordray sends refined gold whitecap mountain reached into his pack hold up whandall said my wife should hear this and others should not whandall led him down the path and through the main double door willow greeted him and served hot lemon water she was punctilious if not perhaps cordial whitecap mountain generally traveled with puma wagons he said but this trip hed been sent for whandall feathersnake the refined gold in his pack was a flat sheet with the letters of a message pounded into it yours more on arrival depends on what you bring shall i read it to you rordray wants a noonmarch of rope two sides of bison smoked mammoth if you can get it anywhere near fresh black pepper sage basil rosemary and thyme wood for construction hell send back fish raw or cooked rordrays the best cook known to men weres or gods also he has sea salt and the mers sometimes bring him treasure from lost ships sea salt willow mused were nearly out she caught herself but whandall nodded grinned slightly salt was rare enough on the hemp road and the salt found in dry lakes didnt have the proper savor something was missing that was found in sea salt according to twisted cloud without it your throat could swell up or your children could grow up stupid or twisted it sounded like two wagons worth of goods better take four whandall thought rordray was paying enough and whandall didnt know the traveling conditions two of his own traveling with two of pumas should be safe enough pay them whatever it takes fhe was going at all he looked at willow but she wasnt sending any kind of signal so he negotiated but fish now what if i cant sell it not a lot of us eat fish and those that do they say they like it fresh absolutely fresh and spelled to stay that way the puma said youve got a wizard innocent smile think seshmarl but cups rattled on willows tray the puma said i only saw him once he never comes down the mountain green stone made a nuisance of himself during dinner the children had been hearing about morth of atlantis since they were little stone wanted to know everything the puma obliged i went up with the talisman box filled with rordrays cooking and brought the box back down next morning with the spell renewed i never slept at all that night that wizard he really wants to talk and hes got stories i cant figure why he stays up there whandall only nodded if morth hadnt told him about the water sprite the tale wasnt whandalls to give away they took whitecap mountain to their guesthouse and settled him in when they moved to the bedroom whandall expected to talk all night now we know he said that poor looker the water thing has him trapped on a mountain all alone he told me once how lonely it was to be the last atlantis wizard in teps town why would he think you can help had a vision magic no point trying to guess that you wouldnt miss hawk in flights wedding the household was gearing up to marry their eldest daughter to the second son of farthest land a major coup whandall said thats in spring we could leave right after the ocean its only a third as far as the firewoods at the other end of the hemp road willow nodded whandall said daughters and sons are different problems i think night horse will ask for twisted tree do we accept wed best shes ready shes young this isnt teps town girls arent afraid to be girls where people can see them they grow up faster this way whandall had never quite believed in this form of cause and effect he said sons are easier saber tooth will be wagonmaster green stone is shaping up nicely twisted tree is a little young you had a point yes dear fourteen miller and ropewalker boys ten of em nephews we may get more half of em work the feathersnake wagons half of them are married already the ropewalk is only so big so is the hemp road love though thats not so easy to see there wont be work for everyone by by the time were fifty theyll find lives we raised them right willow looked at him coolly or are you thinking of taking over some of puma turf no thats not the right answer but i think i should look at extending the caravan route travel with puma for guides sec another route see if i could tell them how to do it better it might give me ideas for cooperation i suppose ill have to let you go willow said stone wont let me rest until i say yes no love you dont have to put up with that it would be very easy for me to say that this tattoolook at methis tattoo is mine and no other soul shall wear it i could make that stick do you you like it on me right youre used to it she stroked his cheek as if smoothing feathers he had to shave often or his beard would cover the tattoo he said because maybe morth could take it off no but maybe you just hate the thought of seeing it on stone its more like hes growing up too fast i know thats silly men wear tattoos but if he comes back with a tattoo that good hed better be bringing one for saber tooth or therell be trouble point taken i asked twisted cloud about this you did what did she say willows eyes unfocused as she tried to remember exactly she said in the old drowned tower your people will find what they need of sustenance so she says youre going yes dear chapter whandall had heard of ancient highways built by magic to serve ancient empires in other lands the hemp road was a wilderness compared to those but it was a highway compared to the route to great hawk bay it was hard work going uphill harder going down with everyone hanging back holding ropes to keep the wagons from plunging to their doom the ground was rough in the valleys they lost wheels the bird spent most of its days in flight and returned to the wagons at night whandall had been a young man when last he guided a team of bison he swung back into caravan routine with surprising ease his puma guide lilac was a good driver and bison tender there was work to be done but in between you could be lazy as a lordkin along the hemp road they told stories of places where a simple summoning spell would bring all the game you wanted meat every night partridges rabbits deer they came when summoned and old men remembered those times or said they did lilac sang in the evening dusk three rabbits came and sat on their haunches waiting patiently for her to wring their necks one short scream as the rabbit understood the track led through high grass past stands of scrub oak trees the air hung heavy in the mornings heavy dew and swirling mists no rain here lilac said the dew is all good for garlic and thistle not much else from time to time they encountered a flock of crows seshmarls wheeled up to them squawking in crow language and they would fly away in terror sometimes the bird chased them hut he always returned to whandalls arm in the evening on the hemp road even a lazy lordkin had to watch for gatherers from other bands for bandits on this route bandits couldnt survive there werent enough wagon trains to support them towns were few little more than hunting camps farming and hunting communities could survive and if a badly guarded caravan passed why farmers might gather some opportune treasure one must still keep watch no one had ever heard of him here the feathersnake sign guarded his wagons on the hemp road but not here on the tenth day he saw a restlessly stirring black mass ahead of the caravan he tried to guess what he was seeing he was driving the bird seshmarls perched beside his ear gripping the edge of the roof above the drivers bench from time to time it took wing to hunt they were both enjoying themselves and whandall didnt want company but after a time reasoning that anything he couldnt identify might be dangerous he called down into the covered wagon bed lilac poked her head out she was a pretty nineteenyearold of puma tribe who had made this trip as a girl twice she traveled in whandalls wagon rather than green stones at her mothers insistence those two found each other too interesting she watched for a time she said crows ravens something like that the bird rose from the roof and flapped toward the black mass a crow colored like a flying bonfire he had driven away half the flock when the wagons came in range what the crows had hidden was the whiteandred bones of a beast bigger than any wagon looking over whandalls shoulder lilac said mammoth are they common around here she was awed tribes around here dig pits for em its dinner for two days for a whole tribe and any guests i heard of a war that stopped because prairie dog tribe trapped a mammoth and invited the terror birds to share but it doesnt happen often no theyre not common nobody i know ever saw one alive you fool turkey who drove the wolf tribe wagon for many years told a tale of riding a mammoth for nearly the length of the road before slaughtering it to stave off a famine but fool turkey was a champion liar whandall said no youd think theyd be too big to miss lilac nodded a pit could trap one not just kill it got to dig them deep if it lives through the fall it could climb out and it comes out angry so i mean its big but but the girl smiled and made an excuse to go back into the wagon every tribe has its secrets whandall thought they rolled on toward the sunset then one night they could hear the sea a sound whandall had not heard for twentythree years chapter a wave broke in white spume and rolled toward the children lilac and green stone danced back not quick enough foam and seawater rolled over their legs the wave receded and they followed it dancing with the ocean whandall watched from well back he could swim in a river but this he could almost sense the mass of water ready to roll a swimmer under far across the calm waters of the bay a score of boats bobbed about a cluster of drowned towers theres a fairsize city down there under the water lilac told green stone she turned and called to whandall wagonmaster i suppose you could find drowned cities along any coastline after atlantis sank my brother would know whandall hadnt thought of wanshig in many years what poked above the waves was a handful of ruins solid enough to moor boats to and an extensive flat roof crenellated that stood four stories above the water waves had smashed the southern edge a new wall had been bricked in any storm would make the lower levels unusable whandall thought but that left two stories and an extensive floor plan he could see gardens on the roof as with the placehold it had been four years since puma tribe sent wagons he should stop thinking of these two as children lilac had proven an excellent guide lilac we brought twice as many people as the attic is used to how do you think theyll handle it simplest thing is just not to send a boat lilac said green stone asked why didnt you send the bird ahead father i want to know if they fluster easily behind them the sons and nephews and grandsons of puma and bison tribes were making camp tending beasts pulling the wagons into a defensive ring working the spells that would give them safety and clean water all under carver ropewalkers direction lilac and green stone went to join them whandall left them to it there were mountains in view any of those largest three are you really thinking of climbing a mountain it was carver whandall didnt answer whandall was master of the caravans carver ropewalker stayed home and made rope this trip had firmed him up a bit he bore marks of the kinless round ears pointy nose once these differences had been life itself he looked across the water for a time before he spoke whandall ive lost two belt knots and im stronger than ive been in years i am glad i came but do you believe twisted cloud prophecy works as well as it ever did the magic goes away prophecies go vague and cryptic they tell you less twisted cloud didnt say eat at rordrays attic and youll be rich again carver closed his eyes to remember exactly in the old drowned tower your people will find what they need of sustenance whandall its fifty years since atlantis went under can you imagine how many drowned towers there are along this coast be fun to search them out theyre sending us a boat rordrays attic kitchen and restaurant was the top floor of the old carlem marcle civic centers south tower the roof could house an overflow the next floor down was all guest rooms lilac said the restaurant was full of fishermen rordray and his son directed some of them to push tables together to accommodate pumas thirtythree travelers the sudden influx hadnt bothered rordray and they hadnt run out of food or drink thone had met them with the boat a big blond man rordrays son his smooth round strength and perpetual smile suggested one or another sea mammal he described what his father had prepared for the noon meal as if it were a string of amazing discoveries thones enthusiasm was infectious whandall took a bite of swordfish with only the slightest of qualms lilac was watching him with a grin she laughed loud at the look on whandalls face good whandall said in amazement all the mers were watching him he said i dont think ive ever really tasted fish try the vegetables too in midafternoon the place was still half full though most of whandalls travelers had been rowed ashore rordrays customers liked to take their time many must be were creatures whandall thought the huge smoothly muscled guy had to be a mer whale he had eaten twenty headsman crabs he had picked up a table for ten all by himself carver and whandall loved the attic on sight but of course it was too small now wait carver said you dont doubt rordray can feed a caravan do you after a meal like that and i saw the size of his ovens but rooms most of a caravan would stay in the wagons anyway to save money and hes got storage in those other buildings did you notice that everything came from the sea spices hes got spices from as far back as beesh and some root vegetables too whandall said caravan passengers demand every variety of diet known to man or beast we get vegetarians we get fat going for thin thin going for fat weird going for wizardry or lost youth or moral dominance games some wont touch fish some think fish is poisonouslion their host was just emerging from the kitchen wait now lion was a nickname rordray sir can you favor us with a minute of your time the lion stopped by their table the bird on whandalls shoulder suddenly said morth of atlantis greets you rordray and begs a favor rordray laughed whandall feathersnake i see the wizards message reached you whandall said yes carver ropewalker is my partner green stone my son lilac good to see you again sir lion lilac said a pleasure lady puma youve grown well is morth here asked whandall lionrordraylaughed not likely he was here twice he loves the sea he stayed a day too long nineteen years ago rordrays eyes questioned what secrets should he spill here the water sprite whandall said it came on us here morth fled uphill the wave washed away part of the restaurant shrug none of us drowned gentlemen what have you brought me whandall showed him what spices would ride in a pouch rordray pinched sniffed tasted approved carver described the rest cured deer meat bison on the hoof no mammoth sage rope brandy the puma scout hadnt asked for that of course you can inspect all of this in the morning what can we take back they discussed it rordray could sell them sea salt morth needed a fishing net whandall was to pay for itrordray didnt know why rordrays crew could never get enough rope could the bison clan increase their shipments but puma had slacked off because of a dwindling market perhaps a market could be developed along the hemp road for fish shipping fresh and freshcooked fish east would require another talisman box morth of atlantis would be the only possible source for that we do need another trade route whandall told himself is morth hard to reach i wouldnt try it myself rordray said he settled on the peak of mount carlem there to the south and east no wagon can climb that whitecap mountain can guide you if you can climb carver laughed what whandall cant do is turn down a challenge rosemary thyme bison clan didnt know a source for those morth might whandall wouldnt even recognize these plants rordray fished out tiny brown paper pouches pinched out samples and rubbed them under his nose lilac exclaimed thyme i know that we passed it coming here ive smelled it near the stone needles meat of a terror bird puma had a hairraising tale and so did whandall but the point was made butchering a terror bird was a matter of happenstance not a delicacy one could fully recommend either but as a curiosity as jerky or carry morths back breaker of a cold iron talisman box the hemp road runs from the drylands near condigeo north past firewoods opposite teps town down into the great valley past farthest land to roads end and back carver said now we want to extend the route youre successful then until recently carver said and whandall said fires sake carver carver glared at him yes successful our problem is shall we build up the route west to carlem marcle and the attic or northeast for whatever we find the rumor of rordrays attic would bring us custom all by itself but its not enough and theres a road to build rordray nodded unsurprised i would never have room downstairs for so many not unless the sea sinks by a few floors that wasnt likely was it morth would know without morth there was no trade route they would have to speak with the wizard a man and two women emerged from the kitchen all built on rordrays own heroic scale the older woman reached past carver set down a tray with a pitcher and eight small cups rordray waved my wife and daughter arilta and estrayle youve met thone they were pulling up their own chairs the table had been roomy a moment ago carver poured for them all then sipped whandall sipped from his own cup carefully it was the brandy theyd brought from zantaar tribe and it was deadly stuff he said well carver the prophecy holds weve found sustenance he saw his partners glare and made haste to change the subject rordray when was a child i learned to trade information and stories shall we talk about morth if he led a water sprite to you im surprised youre still friends well you know the lion said it was morth who warned us out of the old castle in minterl do you recall that there were two sinkings of atlantis the caravaners looked at each other talk eased off a bit among the remaining customers where youve lived maybe you never knew the ground shakes then stops near the sea we notice that the lion said we knew of atlantis in minterl we knew when the land shook and the wave covered whole towns i set up my first inn in the tip of a sunken tower in what was once castle minterl we have always traded with atlantis naturally the ocean is no barrier to us there is little of trade in goods but stories travel along the whale path word of that side of the world comes half a year late we heard that the east side of the island had settled drowning beaches and beach cities a third of the way around the island these were fishing communities so there were mers to rescue land dwellers not many died the king declared a disaster and raised taxes the second quake came half a lifetime later rordray said when nobody remembered castle minterl as anything but rordrays attic mers still ran the fishing industry around atlantis but ashore wed lose the shape of men fishing requires boats harbors warehouses weather prediction and a little judicious guiding of the currents the fishers local wizard was a man nearing his thirties named morth word came with a pod of whales morth had foreseen a tidal wave that would wash away whole civilizations morths warning went to many more than just my little attic but he saw the attics doom did he know that atlantis would sink to make that wave wizards cant see their own fate but i guessed so you left no no we had barely heard of morth we consulted local shamans and performed our own spells we saw enough to convince us when the wave and the quake came we were facing a different ocean the lion poured zantaar brandy whandall put his cup in his pocket lion said the wave had to circle the world to reach us here at great hawk bay then came morth in a ship that floated above the land but so low that it must circle trees we made him welcome he told us of the magical thing that hunted him i recalled the burning city we were loading his ship with provisions when a mountain of ice came floating toward us morth sailed away inland the ice sailed south and we knew no more for half of a mans lifetime i assume he filled you in later whandall said rordray grinned he claims holes in his memory after he found gold in riverbeds you may still have tales to tell the evening had grown dark and it seemed to be story time a pointyeared fisher ordered a round of beer for the house i am omarn he told the newcomers when atlantis sank i was near minterl in dolphin form i saw water humping up behind me i swam like mad and when the wave passed me i was going fast enough to ride it the ride of my life i rode the wave almost to the mountains i saw the lions old attic smashed all in an instant mers dont drown but if anyone was still in there rordray i think he must have been smashed under the rocks no we were all clear the innkeeper said whandall asked shall i tell what morth of atlantis was doing in teps town i saw some of that wait now whandall feathersnake the innkeeper said a tale has come to us of a tattooed caravan lord who came home to find himself pronounced dead and his wife attended by a host of suitors can you tell us the truth of this so rordray would trade tales with a stranger but he wanted to name the tale whandall hesitated and saw instantly how they would take that he must not seem to be hiding old murders he said i used a protection if i tell you what i had do not ask where i kept it he had everyones attention now carver and green stone had heard his tale but the rest had not whitey guessed a dagger no it was a handful of gold sand raw gold right out of a river once upon a time i used it to save us from well morth raw gold turns morth crazy i always carry raw gold with me they sipped and listened this was nine years after i married willow ropewalker and three years since i rode with a caravan i set up my life so i could stay home and raise my children i visited nearby towns from time to time and if anyone wanted me he could find me burning grass and three forks came to tell me that men on my wagon had cheated them i asked around and decided it might be true told willow i must ride with the caravan again angry goose was running a game that uses a gold bead and three nut shells and two friends sat in the game to protect him it was a cheat i threw them off and divided their goods but goose and his men should never have been allowed aboard there was more everything went loose and sloppy when black kettle had to leave the caravan i saw them camping in flood basins i saw a man badger twisted cloud into changing a prediction the guards held gambling parties i saw that id have to ride the whole circuit we were a long way back from the firewoods at the southern end of the route before i was sure id straightened things out i had some bruises caravaners are mighty fighters and it must be easy to forget that whats given them to rule isnt theirs did you have to kill anyone no good not then i left the caravan at warbler flats i stopped a couple of nights with friends then rode on through hip high spring and home to the new castle my son saber tooth met me at the gate he was only eight then he carefully explained that the house was full of men who wanted to marry mother and mother was afraid of them i sent saber tooth in to find my wife and if he could talk to her tell her father says to get ready to duck under something then come and tell me where everyone is i told him where id be whandall laughed and gestured at his cheek shoulder twisted arm i cant remember the last time i thought of disguising myself there was nothing for it but to go right in but i didnt have to go in the front door i came by the hay chute rordray laughed what is your house a barn too yes in by the hay chute talk to the bison a bit so they dont raise a ruckus i wasnt sure saber tooth could do it so i wasnt going to wait very long but he came to the hayrack and told me willow would be in the hidey closet with the four youngsters four men were terrorizing the kitchen staff i gave saber tooth a knife and hid him in the hay i went into the kitchen fast four men right three were from armadillo wagonpassenger pigeon and his father and unclebut the fourth was a stranger in lordsman armor i started to say welcome to the new castle gentlemen but they went for weapons as soon as they saw me not meaning to be surrounded i slashed first at the ones who didnt have armor bussards shadow went down spraying blood everywhere and i slashed pigeons knife arm then the armored man stepped between them and me the ones still standing snatched bussards shadow and ran backward pulling his arms while the lordsman came at me that was scary but lordsman armor doesnt cover everything i got a chopping block between him and me thinking id jab at his ankles but he pushed it over and ran after the others i got outside carefully not wanting to be ambushed they were running into the ropewalk the two armadillo wagon men carrying the third and the armored man walking backward after them i started to wonder who of the ropewalker family was in there but the only thing to do about that was run in and look rordray my wifes family doesnt let me in there i saw it once when it was new and near empty it looked no different from a barn years had passed since then the place stank of hot tar the ropewalk was stacked to near the ceiling with spools of rope each about as big as a man the ropewalkers stack them on end so they wont roll the aisle ran down the center back of it at least five armadillo men were getting themselves out of the way somebody yelled like a lordkin on wine it was carter ropewalker he was lying down and wriggling i guessed he was tied up but mostly three men in lordsman armor were facing me in that pose they use with the shields locked edge to edge i saw that once during a fair in teps town nothing can get through that rordray i sure couldnt fight them i could outrun them even moving backward but they had carter what i did was climb the bales of rope and hop to the back of the building the armadillo men were still just staying clear the armored men ran toward me got close and lockstepped their shields again that gave me time to cut carter loose and send him up the spools he got a rope anchored in the smoke hole to the roof he was pretty battered and not climbing very fast i waited until he was through then climbed up after him then i sprinkled my gold sand down into the ropewalk i kept a hand on carter to keep him from looking into the smoke hole we could have gone down the outside then if passenger pigeon hadnt been below us with a long knife lefthanded though he yelled up and threatened to burn down the ropewalk if we didnt surrender i told him he should move the ropeweaving device out first thats the actual ropewalk the most valuable single thing at the new castle we got some of the story out of him while we all circled around and waited for developments the way pigeon tells it this all happened because three lordsmen look ship to escape the lords in teps town pigeon didnt know why they took their armor with them they offered to protect armadillo wagon on the hemp road but pigeon told them about a lordkin gone missing so they attacked the new castle instead armadillo wagon wouldnt have done this to anyone but a lordkin but see id been married nine years now i was going off lordkin dont come back everyone knows it so passenger pigeon and his tribe set forth to marry the abandoned widow willow feathersnake wasnt going anywhere until she agreed there were the children for hostages pigeon told us he never threatened them later willow told me he did by and by carter and i decided that nobody was coming out of the ropewalk i went over the roof fast and slid down the other side and was in fighting stance before pigeon could come around he ran for the ropewalk doors they were closed carter and i blocked his path but we let him pull a door open and look in he backed away gobbling like a turkey rordrays family were nodding mers were sophisticates in magic and whandalls family knew the tale but horror looked out of lilacs eyes they were all strangled whandall said pulled into shapes no sane man ever thought of nobody but pigeon left to tell the tale he sits at the south gate of hip high spring and warns you about hemp even if you dont ask hemp is like that you know it wants to soothe you to sleep and lose you in dreams and then strangle you and hemp rope on wild magic is a thing of nightmares nobody seemed to want to top that story it was full dark by now the remaining fishers went up to the roof and whandall heard splashing then estrayle led them down to their rooms the room was clean the bed a bit damp still it was luxury he could not fall asleep at first and could not think why presently he realized that they didnt turn off the ocean at night the shh sss of the waves went on forever and presently carried him away chapter they left for morths mountain after two days of feasting whandall was inspired people come to roads end tired and ready to be pampered they want fish from rordrays attic they just dont know it yet if we can bring this to roads end we have goods to trade find morth rordray said they took one of the wagons green stone had to come that became clear so whandall made him drive whitey couldnt drive because the bison didnt trust him lilacwhandall wasnt sure why they were taking lilac he and green stone had decided sometime last night someone had to guard the wagon while the others were climbing why lilac willow would have his head or not lilac might be just the girlwomanfor green stone a link to puma tribe could solve some problems for the family and the trade to great hawk bay would never be vast but it could be lucrative they hadnt brought a onehorn but every woman knew she would confront one eventually they rode for four days taking their time hunting letting the bison graze where they would before the ground grew too rough to go nearer whitey spent an extra day leading them around the mountain to the shallower eastern slope they stopped where bison could still forage mount carlem stood above them all that night intimidating they started at dawn leaving lilac in charge of the wagon they climbed in shirts kilts and packs when i he bird settled on whandalls pack whandall chased him away the bird rose with an angry squawk found an updraft and kept rising out of sight green stone carried a flat box of cold iron a rectangle with the corners cut off hat enough to ride a strong mans back this one was empty and not yet ensorcelled whandall had the heavier talisman box loaded with provisions from the attic kitchen they left the heavy fishing net on the wagon if morth somehow needed that to get down someone would have to go back for it the packs held water blankets and clothes why so many clothes because whitey insisted the day grew hot shirts came off early at noon whitey let them stop to drink by then whandall knew he was an old man beyond his strength he had never climbed like this everyone else was making his decisions for him had been for years without his realizing it and he was just beginning to resent it when whitey and green stone went on whandall made himself follow he was at the edge of making his son trade burdens with him but now the way became easier theyd found reserves of strength whandall thought but it rapidly became ridiculous theyd been climbing toward a scary near vertical bare rock slope the tilt seemed less now it had flattened out but the horizon eastward was tilted up like a dandy lords hat it looked like anything loose should be sliding west toward the sea green stone said nothing of this he must have thought he was going mad whitey watched them both with that puma grin whandall bellowed mooorth he just glimpsed a manshaped streak zigzagging at amazing speed among tall stands of lordblades near naked and all knobs red braids flying whandall placehold glimpsed and already here you came whandall looked him over morth wore only a sunbleached and ragged kilt and the bird now settling on his shoulder he was tanned near black his feet were bare and callused hard the morth of twenty years ago had dressed better but was otherwise little changed lean with stringy muscles and prominent ribs high cheekbones long curly red hair washed and braided he was grinning and panting like a dog and even so he did not seem mad whandall said right you know whitey green stone this is morth of atlantis morth my second son willows second son the wizard gripped the boys hand green stone im very pleased you could come may i see your palm the boy looked at his father got a nod and let morth turn his hand palm upward in the sunlight morth said i havent done this since early marriage children branch off soon here twins both girls the wizard pointed with a fingernail that needed tending no dont squint you cant see your own future more children down the line i think but your path gets fuzzy morth looked up with satisfaction in his eyes come i live on the peak can you fly us whandall those days are long gone mythical but i wove a spell for easier climbing so the lions people can visit me he babbled as they climbed the way i left you and the children im embarrassed of course gold fever had my mind and i still had to lead the water elemental away from you we saw that just kept going into the mountains theres manna untouched by any wizard but theres also wild magic virgin gold i have no idea how long i was out of my mind i wound up on some tremendous height in the vedasiras range with no gold around me just a magical place with a view of half the world like this place really but even farther from any decent hunting by the time i had my senses backwhy do they always say that i was sensing everything no path blocked within my mind no way to concentrate on any one thing like eating or bathing digging a jakes raising a shelter tending a wound scatterminded that was what had me so crazy where was i i was stuck on a mountaintop sane but starving and tanned like sheban leather only my own spells were keeping me alive i found meat and firewood down slope and spent some time building my strength back built a talisman to get me through then set out north for great hawk bay rordray told us i thought id lost the sprite all that wild gold should have had it totally confused i was careless when that wave humped itself i just went up the nearest mountain as quick as i could ive been stuck here ever since they put their shirts back on it had grown cold morth didnt notice the mountains peak was a fantastic lacework of stone castle indefensible was whandalls first thought any lordkin tribe could have pulled it down with their hands whats holding it up he looked in vain for supporting beams there was no wood to be seen anywhere it was as if rock had melted and flowed into place there were no corners no straight lines rooms and chambers and corridors spilled over and under and between each other like the insides of a careless knifefighter rising up into a bulb of clear glass a wonderful wizards crows nest morth led them in in a roomy groundfloor chamber the rock walls humped into chairs around a fire four people four chairs and a high ridge for a bird to perch dark rocks were burning in the fireplace whitecap mountain set out both talisman boxes he didnt open them the attics provisions were for morth alone but morth had prepared a meal for four a slew of mountain goat herbs and roots whandall realized that he was ravenous he saw the look in green stones eye and waved him on when they had slaked their hunger a bit the wizard said you came at my asking i can pay that debt now in refined gold he waved at the fireplace take what you like had morth been using wild magic but the gold he was pointing at had drained out of the fireplace and formed a flat pool before it froze whitey and green stone wiggled it loose used an edge of rock to break it in roughly equal halves and slid it into packs energy wants to be heat morth said the simplest thing you can do with any kind of manna is help it to become heat i can burn gold ore with out its hurting me and the expended gold just flows out whandall nodded uh huh the wizard pointed to whandalls crotch what is that morth caught himself secret supposed to be im not surprised youd see it whandall eased a flat metal flask out from just above his groin what does it look like to you a dead spot i can show you how to see the blind spot in your eye but this is a bit more obvious nothing else looks like cold iron whandall held it up without opening it coarse gold right out of a riverbed you wouldnt remember when i threw gold at ensorcelled ponies but whandall waved away morths attempt at an old apology but it broke the spell so i carry raw gold just in case and it did save me once that must be an interesting tale morth said but i want to hear a different one whandall tell me about the last time you did violence whandall looked at him violence we last saw each other twentyone years ago i dont quite remember but i think i tried to take a girl you wanted i think you tried to kill me morth said no not tried i thought i might have to now i hear tales of a wagonmaster whose sign is a feathered serpent he keeps his oaths and enforces honesty with a knife of spelled bronze whandall i have to know what you are the last time i did violence was that it they were all waiting whandall said no it was the last time i saw tras preetror do you remember him the teller six years ago i was up on the house with my sons fixing the roof a servant came to tell me i had a visitor it was tras preetror and a big man in part lordsman armor who stood behind him and didnt say anything theyd got past the guards willow was serving him tea i got her aside and she wanted me to explain what he was doing here hospitality morth said he hadnt asked for food and fire and shelter from the night whandall said i made sure of that hed just barged in invited himself as if he belonged there i had tea with them he told us his tale hes a good teller morth you remember hed taken ship up to great hawk bay to get tales from the mers at rordrays attic id heard of this place from the caravans but tras told us a lot more hed heard rumors from the puma wagons about a new head man in the caravans he tracked the tales of a snake tattoo east and south morth i have to know that a traveler can reach me if my wagons have cheated him the caravan tribes guided tras straight to my house now hes waiting for my story right i showed him my cold iron case and opened it and blew a bit of gold dust on him and his man i didnt see any result morth but i hate your damn lurking spell and i thought he might have used it on my gate guard raw gold i told him it distorts magic spells morth barked a laugh and it saved my life once and i told him just enough of the fight with armadillo wagon to hook him come with me if you like ill show you where the bodies are buried and i stood up and led him out still talking tras every time i think ive given up violence something pops up that got him moving and his man jumped up and went ahead of us he didnt seem to speak the local tongue i switched to condigeo trass man didnt know that either but hey i hadnt practiced in a while i was just finishing the tale of the suitors when we reached the graveyard we bury all our dead here i said and i took them among the graves the armadillo wagon ghosts came out to play they couldnt touch us of course but they tried to attack me tras was used to ghosts he forgot that his lordsman guard wouldnt be the guard was shivering and whimpering and trying to back through a boulder tras tried to interview one of the ghosts i drifted behind three trees growing together went between them and up and hid myself i talked through the treetops tras theres something i should tell you because youll have to translate for me where are you behind you iras always behind you we know how lo lurk tras do you remember starting a riot i tried to shut you up no whandall feathersnake you cant blame me for that and he laughed his man had his nerve back tras spoke to him and he began circling around he had me placed pretty quick he pulled more armor from his pack shin guards and stuff morth i think there must have been some kind of turnover in teps town theres too much armor floating around in the great wide world the gatherers from armadillo tribe had armor too i said lets test your memory again you know how lord pelzeds men left me do you remember thats not my fault either tras you will be in the same condition when i leave here if you tell your man to protect you now there wont be any living man to carry you away ill bury you here in the graveyard if you tell him to step aside he can take you someplace to heal morth asked did you think hed do it whandall shrugged i gave him the chance i dont know what he told his guard when i dropped from the tree the guard moved on me i thought id have to kill him he took some cuts and some bruises and then he backed away protecting himself and then he ran tras was gone i tracked tras down to the crypt and well i kept my promise then i slapped him awake and gave him some water and i told him that if his man didnt come back for him by sunset of the next day well but if he did there were stories i didnt want to hear if i ever hear anyone describe how my household is arranged or what kind of tea i serve if i hear about a flask of gold sand whandall rapped his groin i will know who they heard it from i told him i travel everywhere from condigeo to great hawk bayi was lying of course i told him people are entitled to privacy and some will kill for it im not sure he heard any of that morth i was raving that diseased looker invaded my house nobody but the armadillo clan ever did that ask their ghosts morth was silent tras wasnt hurt any worse than samortys men hurt me but of course hes older i dont know if he healed he was gone at the next days sunset and to hell with what morth thought of him coming here wasnt whandalls idea the night had turned cold fire or no they wore the cloaks whitey had insisted they carry morth donned an impressive robe whitecap mountain broke the silence i know why the town of fair chance came to be deserted thats a good story but a partial truth morth said i sense a tribal secret at its heart you wont tell that as for me my tale hasnt happened yet my tale is that i must destroy the water sprite that wants my life living here is driving me mad go inland whitey said as if he was tired of repeating it when i came here i was running from a wave i climbed thinking that water could not flow up so steep a slope water doesnt have to a wave isnt a moving block of water its a pattern moving through water the sprite can flow like a wave it came to me through the ground water it lives below me when i go down to the spring i go fast ill show you tomorrow if you like green stone asked is that safe oh you can watch from above get a view of the immediate danger whandall what i want from you and your caravan is transport take me inland out of its reach take me to the hemp road youd settle there willow would love that oh no morth said im going to finish this im going to kill the water sprite i think i have to return to the burning city to do that whandall said youre been trapped on a mountain for twenty years this thing has hunted you for more than forty and now youve decided to kill it is that about the size of it morth grinned in the yellow light of burning gold i cant tell you all of it morth you cant even tell me part of it you cant even get off this mountain that i might manage id have to outrun the elemental waters natural path is downhill i might run myself to death but with transport to carry me farther i might make it and then you might just think youd done all a man could do once upon a time i thought i could rob yanginateps life steal the fire gods manna nobody but whandall laughed the others had barely heard of yanginatep they couldnt know his power whandall asked what stopped you i saw less evidence of the god every decade yanginatep must be almost mythical by now and i could never find where his life is centered but the hope kept me there much longer than i should have stayed whandall knew he was staring why didnt you ask yanginatep lives in the cook fires anil he knew carvers look appalled and amused whandall had never learned to hoard information morth paled in the fires im a fool i never asked the thieves they were still arguing when it became impossible not to sleep whandall didnt remember whether he saw flowing rock but the stone chairs were all stone couches in the morning chapter morth stopped at a shallow rainetched dip in the rock damp at the bottom to pick up a bucket then he led them to the edge of an abrupt drop he pointed down along a bare rock face see the streak where the rock changes color thats overflow from the spring whitey said right morth dropped over the edge whandall could have caught his robewould have were he a child or a friend but morth wasnt falling he was running down the mountains side weaving through the rubble once whandall would not have believed what he saw morth dropped as fast as a falling man zigzagging toward the gleam of water that marked the spring he ran past it dragging the bucket and was already moving uphill laughing like a maniac water splashed up after him morth led it still faster than a man but he had been moving faster yesterday the men threw themselves backward as the wave came over the crest morth ran across the dip emptying his bucket halfway then turned and gestured the wave crashed into the dip morth was panting hard as they came up but he was laughing too water half filled the dip it lay almost still rippling as if in a strong wind whitey asked wouldnt you love to be watching first time he tried that i take it you cant trap it whandall asked morth no and enchanting the spring doesnt trap it either a water elemental is a fundamental thing and exceedingly slippery all right if this works youll owe puma tribe and my family too puma you can pay in refined gold whandall said right whitey whitey nodded but ask lilac we change any oaths by mutual agreement only my family might ask other things whandall said tattoos for instance if we can get you as far as roads end the new castle will ask three boons i dont believe i can duplicate that tattoo green stones disappointment didnt show at all the boy was a natural trader whandall said well think of something you pay in magic three tasks i offered one did i accept it got pretty sleepy last night morth looked into whandalls grin and decided not to make that claim he said one when im free of the mountain one at roads end one when the sprite is myth morth you have no reason to think you can myth out a water elemental morth said nothing its two wishes then done its midmorning and the sprite wouldnt stop us from going down whitey it stops morth only trouble i ever had the puma said i tried to stop at the spring for a drink wagonmaster i still think you should have taken gold wizard well be down before nightfall the wagon will move at first light north to the trail and then east we dont stop if i dont get down alive the talisman box is yours and the provisions in it i renewed the spell ill enchant this one too before i go down whandall said thats settled now tell the bird seshmarls help me whandall seshmarl good bird morth you tell the wagons whandall let me teach you how to make the bird carry your messages whandall listened he mimicked the birds secret name then spoke a few words the bird looked at him in disgust whandall grumbled my children learned all by themselves why dont i you have less magical talent than anyone i ever met morth said interesting that your children dont share that disability disability morth grinned youre an emptiness any god can fill you just cant keep them out feathersnake inn and youll never be a wizard of course but this you can learn whandall practiced the birds secret name blowing the syllables out with pulled checks then curling his tongue for the shrill whistle that ended it he spoke his messages tell the puma wagons to return at their own pace whitecap mountain has gold to pay them for their trouble rordray will get his boxes late late and loaded with red meatmammoth if we can get it elk or antelope or bison otherwiseand spices maybe we can find spices in the stone needles keep messages simple morth said was that its getting too long say message ends seshmarls go message ends seshmarls go my hope lies in your shadow the bird said and took flight whandall and the others began their descent the sooner they were down the better lilac drove brush grew everywhere and the land was uneven she had to be exceedingly careful until they reached flat ground and wary after that they wouldnt reach the trade road until after noon a man on foot could run circles around them whandall figured let alone a wizard they saw a column of mist drifting down the mountain and guessed at the waterfall within it near the foot of the mountain lilac made out a dot moving just enough to catch her attention whandall said whitey he might need help shall i hold his hand while he drowns whandall swung down from the wagon ill go tend your wagon whitecap mountain dropped beside him and jogged away whandall lost track of him in some brush and after that he was harder to see and moving faster there was something about weres whandall speculated did their magicdid all magicwork better when nobody watched there must be things processes that an observer could not watch without altering them morth would know whandall jogged back to the wagon sometime later whitey strolled up carrying morths pack whitey stowed it and loped off to rejoin morth whandall wasnt sure theyd reached the trade road until late afternoon several times he was minded to ask lilac to stop the closer morth got the more those dots moved like a pair of cripples no danger showed but whandall could picture water flowing out of the ground into a mountainous bubble over the wagon bison drowning lilac and green stone drowning they should have brought a mer a mer underwater could still act they came closer morth leaned heavily on whitecap mountain whitey wasnt enjoying this at all morth looked like an old man dying of exertion dirty gray hair and beard skin like cured leather eyes too weary to look up he was still moving taster than the wagon but enough was enough whandall told lilac to stop and let the bison graze they laid morth in the wagon bed the sun was setting but a full moon had crested the horizon whandall remembered a stream within their reach if they could keep going by night they were trying to reach water while they fled a water elemental the irony did not escape whandalls attention men could carry water but bison must have a pool or stream the path to great hawk bay followed the water sources ask morth morth was looking better already but best to let him sleep chapter rordrays massive dinner fed them all during the next day morth didnt eat much his strength was slow returning even though he had packed something in the second cold iron box talisman he said dont look he reached in from time to time that night he slept like a dead man the next day he was fizzing with energy lilac taught him something of how to guide a bison team just to keep him occupied later he went off with whitey to hunt they came back with half a dozen rabbits they camped and set the rabbits broiling while there was still light morth lifted a claycapped vessel of wine the last of what rordray had packed and offered it whandall said not for me morth we should know more about whats chasing us who hates you that much where did they get something that powerful oh that was easy they just diverted the nearest water sprite and sent it to kill me it was moving an iceberg morth laughed at their bewilderment the wells in atlantis ran dry a thousand years ago we used to send elementals south to break off mountains of ice and bring them to atlantis for fresh water the southland is all ice and untouched manna because wizards cant survive there elementals gain immense power but thats the real question isnt it why they were in a rage theyd been in a rage for nearly a year we all were why the gift of the king morth carefully cracked the clay stopper and drank before he went on we were the lords of magic our wealth made us targets for every barbarian who might hear tales of us and the very land beneath us was trying to return to the sea every twenty thirty years wed lose a day walk of beachfront if atlantis lost the skills of magic it was all over king tranimel came to decide that the power of magic has no limit its as crazy as thinking a tribe of bandits can steal from each other foreverno offense whandall whandall said after all we dont see wealth being made it just appears always in somebody elses hands we only need to gather it you still say we we lordkin its been a long time so the king decided if wizards had held atlantis above the waves for all these years it must be that we can do anything the king decided to make everything perfect whandall could hear him grinding his teeth then nothing is ever perfect but atlantis came closer than any nation on earth one day a king of atlantis would achieve perfection tranimel would be that king we wizards learn to use spells that do their work without showy side effects spells fail as time passes morth said a palace doesnt need to rise from the earth in a blaze of light better plows and crop rotation make fertility ceremonies more effective you see less gets you more if you do it right but magic always looks too easy the king though willing to admit that water must run downhill never seemed to understand that it must someday reach the sea he passed laws that left us no clear avenue to refuse any act of magic that would improve the general wellbeing our first act was to give homes to the homeless folk of atlantis thousands of architects wizards supervisors from the court created housing across one whole mountain range the gift of the king they needed everyone for the first time in my life i had enough money to live money even for a few luxuries i began seeing a girl ah ah i just realized its been thirty years and i just morth blinked sipped wine started over whandall what the king intended would use the same manna that was keeping us above the waves to use too much was the doom of atlantis its so simple how could the best wizards in the land be unable to explain what was wrong with the gift of the king i only just realized that we werent trying very hard the gift of the king was employment for everyone wizards would get rich architects would get rich every courtappointed supervisor had a nephew who needed work you werent actually one of the best wizards were you morth what no i served the southeast coast fishing industry the mers catch all the fish they herd them into nets to be pulled aboard boats the men bring the fish in and store them other men distribute them were needed to make weather magic and command the elementals and the spell that floats a ship above the water sometimes needs reworking its all spelled out in books a thousand years old doesnt pay much the kingsmen didnt offer a choice mind but they offered twice what i was getting where was i we built the gift of the king along the north atlantis loop a few farms drowned some docks and warehouses slid beneath the water but the homeless now had homes more than they could ever use we thought and when a homeless person got in some citizens way or a thief he or she was conveyed to the estates in the estates a criminal class evolved within it seemed hours rape armed theft extortion casual murder all flourished in the shadows and corners bad enough but the people of the estates didnt stay there their hunting grounds expanded to all who lived nearby the king couldnt have that he ordained that there be light whandall i would have lost my home without these magical projects glinda would have left me i kept my mouth shut i participated in the spell that caused every outside wall in the estates to glow sometimes i have trouble thinking like a kinless whandall confessed why did the king think that light would stop a gatherer thieves rapists killerslordkin said morth dont commit their crimes in daylight if they think theyll be seen and punished but the king stopped the punishments he would cause no pain to his subjects it was part of the gift of the king the estates taught them that they did not need darkness to do whatever they wanted this lesson they practiced the length and breadth of atlantis retreating to the estates before anyone could hamper them the king couldnt have that calmly morth sometimes i miss my home morth fished the wine flask out of whiteys hand and drank its under water i take it taken for taxes the king paid slowly he couldnt collect taxes fast enough and of course if we did get paid some of it went for taxes we never touched it the mers used to pay in fish but at least i got to eat the fish the kings men who paid us also wanted to tell us how to do our jobs and write down everything wed done in crazy detail and wait for payment until each and all were satisfied was ashamed to see glinda with all my heart i wished id never taken money from the king it was too late we were in thrall and now the king had another idea we were summoned for one massive magnificent spell a compulsion of novices simplicity but of huge effect every violent criminalnot every thief one courageous wizard rightly pointed out to the kings advisor that no spell can make the subtle vague distinction between a thief and a tax collector on a good day i honor him on a bad day i wish that the thieves and tax collectors had all been ensorcelled together youre rambling but that would have been fun morth handed the wine flask to green stone and drank from the water bucket we cast the spell whandall on a morning nine days before the lifting of stone every violent lawbreaker went to the city guard to make his confession and on that morning it was as if all hell had let out for a holiday every guard station was surrounded the criminals of the estates outnumbered the guards forty to one no natural inclination could have brought them together in any such cooperative venture but they were here and there was nothing to drink or eat or steal but none who would dare interfere with them the screaming of confessions alone drowned any cry for help when they had satisfied their compulsion they did what they felt like and their will was to tear down the doors and murder the guards at dawn any pair of guards found themselves surrounded by a score of of lordkin who first shouted their crimes in gory hideous detail more bragging than confessing a guard told me that he escaped by being a better climber than any burglar by afternoon there was not a living city guardsman outside the guard stations themselves the king was very angry with the wizards morth picked up the flask of wine with exaggerated care and drank was that when you left how could we leave we had to collect the money the king still owed us but first we had to correct the ill we had done the kings men didnt have but the vaguest idea how that might be done but theyd know it was done when the king showed himself satisfied then again the lifting of stone was only six days away and the achean navy was preparing an attack any lordkin would have left right then i did you did do i look stupid ask me if you look drunk i could see what was coming we couldnt ever satisfy the king but any wizard who wasnt seen trying would be axed seen trying had to mean something even a kings councilor could see using manna we couldnt spare the lifting of stone takes manna the manna would be gone and the wizards would be exhausted this year the lifting of stone just wasnt going to work theyd taken my house and i didnt have anything to save except glinda i went to visit i hinted at what i had in mind her brothers threw me out she didnt stop them i went down to the dock finding work was easy all the other wizards were working for the king the water palace had been sitting in dock for weeks a ship right one of the old ships that floats above the water that style can cross land and ride above the big waves but there are windows and cargo hatches on the underside so it cant go anywhere at all without the occasional blessing over four days i convinced captain trumpeter to keep me aboard and get himself gone ahead of the achean navy id bless the ship at sea wed have been gone and free if the acheans had been a little faster i was half a world away before i knew what the priests had done to me over many days they all exhausted their fund of stories communities were sparse and tiny and the tales they told were local gossip a few memories stood out farmers roasting a pitkilled mammoth and a harvest of spring vegetables they were eager to share by the smell of it the meat had gone pretty high morth told them they were wizards cleansing themselves for a ritual none could eat meat except for their driver watching whitecap mountain devour a mammoth kidney whandall thought that puma must be part scavenger an elk challenged their wagon they killed it then wrestled it into the wagon bed that afternoon they presented it to a loose cluster of a hundred farmers by nightfall a meat and vegetable stew was ready to serve a widow told of her late husbands yearlong duel with what was believed to be a werebear lilac traded childrens stories with the old wives clique whandall told the tale of jack rigenlord and the port waluu woman it was a long lazy time for whandall responsibilities were bounded at one town whandall was tempted by a womans offer dream of flying was lovely by firelight but he pictured green stone wondering where his father was sleeping and then going to ask lilac and he told dream that his wife was u powerful shaman and u mind reader too she said that many husbands were sure of that he agreed the moment passed the next morning he learned that offers had been made to each of them a good place to come back to on another night whitecap mountain told how the town of fair chance came to be deserted and he found that all of the locals wanted to help him tell it the tale went to babbling then became a kind of throwandcatch game they dug a pit to trap a mammoth they dug it well away from the town no mammoth would come near dwellings and if it did there was no telling what damage it would cause they dug it big enough to hold such a beast and deep enough that the fall would kill it and they covered the pit with redwood boughs and went home but before dawn they heard monstrous noise and felt the ground shake when they spilled out to look behemoth itself had wedged its foot in the hole houses were falling as the mountainous beast tried to tear loose it saw the crowd arrayed to look and it turned and bellowed at them its nose reached out and out a days walk long and flung villagers left and right windward and lee they ran in a tumble of falling houses and they never came back said whitey two boys went back to look another said the company argued about what they found these farmers entertained guests rarely wizards were rarer still they pulled morths story out of him of how he had crossed the continent we were safe at sea when the sea roared and sent a wave under the water palaces windows when we reached land there was no shore where men still lived making landfall where that monstrous wave had killed so many would not be prudent the water palace sailed inland we traveled for many days and ultimately set down at the town of neo wraseln along a southwardfacing shore we rested less than a day before i stole the water palace a murmur rose from the farmers gathered whandall said no i saved them all i saw a wave of mist coming out of the ocean and perceived an iceberg within the mist and the elemental within the ice i ran for the ship i didnt have time to stop for any of the crew i took it west to lure the elemental away from the town then north inland at least i had someplace to go in a dream id seen a tremendous wave smash the old attic to rubble and roll onto the land left and right as far as i could see i recognized the attic from the mers description whandall said you sent word rordray told me youll he thinking i should have guessed the rest hut i cant foresee my own paths the sinking of atlantis took me completely by surprise but dreamed where rordray would settle at great hawk bay and i sailed there ultimately they guided me to the burning city where magic doesnt work and a water elemental cant survive and a wizard cant either whandall said but morth only shrugged chapter on the evening of the twentyeighth day they camped in reach of a stream narrow enough to step across the water elemental had not shown itself since a waterfall followed morth down mount carlem it prefers the sea i think morth said its time within the mountain must have been uncomfortable they had been approaching a range of hills for several days now whandall recognized this stretch they would pass north of those hills another eight to twelve days theyd be home now they were close enough to make out the spires that gave the place its name at night the stone needles glowed with manna the wizard said but only he could see it they moved at first light whandall driving morth stirred he scrabbled about in the wagon bed wrinkled around the eyes white beard graywhite hair until he reached into the cold iron box then well nothing much changed the talisman hed made on mount carlem must be fading around midmorning lilac suddenly gasped behemoth and pointed into the stone needles the distant misty heights ahead and right showed nothing morths head popped into sunlight what are you looking for i saw him behemoth plaintively lilac said i never saw him before whitecap mountain strolling alongside the driving bench because it seemed to make the bison walk a little faster was looking back down the road wagonmaster you may want to see this too whandall stood up on the bench to look over the hood dots in their wake seven or eight men scattered across the road were watching the bisondrawn wagon now two jogged off in opposite directions could be farmers going about their business whitey said could be bandits a lone wagon makes a tempting target they were too distant too slow to be seen moving but dust in the air showed that they were following the wagon theyll be a while catching up wont they oh yes theyll take their time sunset we dont have any food morth they couldnt hunt with bandits about whitey asked you know something of bandits dont you whandall feathersnake yes whitecap mountain the first rule is never separate the wagons or let them be separated better skip to the second rule whandall stood to look back along the road men followed far back and in no hurry those others who went jogging off would be bringing reinforcements or weapons or some stored magic maybe a lurking spell never make half of a war he said what do you think if a puma wearing a backpack and a man hideously scarred by a mad wizards tattoo came loping back to meet them would they run could we deal with them before anyone else comes kill them frighten them buy them off whitey said i think they can probably run almost as fast as you if i run ahead its just me and them together we wouldnt catch them before nightfall and if theyve got friends theyd be right there to meet us and if they sent friends ahead who would defend the wagon all right my third plan is when they get close enough ill take off my shirt oh that should scare them you know it might whitey acknowledged they might have heard of you morth spoke get me to the stone needles before they get to us then leave the rest to me thatll be tight whandall said try by noon the five had become a dozen whitecap mountain drifted into the brush and was gone any bandits circling round might meet a puma where it was least wanted but a puma could not attack a dozen farmers by midafternoon stone needles wasnt ahead anymore it was a sixth of a circle rightward the band following the wagon numbered around twenty they were close enough that whandall could make out hoes and scythes and less identifiable arm implements there was time to discuss it ii they turned off the path now despite the rougher ground it would tip bandits to where they were going if the bandits broke into a run attacked short of the stone needles arrived panting and breathless and fought in daylightbad practice but theyd win lilac was driving whandall watching the bandits heard her say i saw it again morth exclaimed so do i and whandalls head snapped around behemoth blurred by mist and distance stood halfway up the stone needles mountains should have collapsed under it behemoth was even bigger than whandall had seen it twentytwo years ago all crags and angles as if it had not fed well tusks to spear the moon the shaggy hair that hung down everywhere was snow white not piebald thats not the same behemoth whandall said there must be two at least two morth said i dont sense a god some lesser being it stood steady on legs like buttes studying the tiny wagon the long boneless arm of its nose lifted in greeting or acknowledgment lilac turned the bison straight toward behemoth whandall watched her do it she didnt look at any of her companions didnt invite comment whandall stood up on the driving bench he stripped to the waist and stood for a time visible above the wagons hood in the near horizontal afternoon light the bandits were black shadows well beyond fighting range body language showed them in excited conversation but they were still coming whandall sat down i believe you have a family secret he said to lilac and thats fine but does it threaten us she said no whandall let his eyes half close he could relax for just a little longer lilac said but we might be safer if i could tell someone speak nothing does whitecap mountain know he might hes of a different family we havent spoken of it she said but i could tell my husband green stone jumped as if stabbed if you have a husband i no no stone stone collected his tattered wits should i be driving lilac shook her head violently green stone i believe i should speak for us now whandall said lilac would you accept my son as your husband as wagonmaster i can declare you mated yes subject to trivia related to dowry before we deal with that are you taking us where you want us lilac smiled dimples formed she hadnt looked back she couldnt know exactly how close the bandits were she was steering straight up into the mountains i thought behemoth might frighten them off you tried that whandall stood to look back well they might be slowing down you have a dowry its mostly in goods of course were not wealthy wagonmaster she described possessions worth the price of a pair of good bison and a onehorn if you were to addabout three times as muchwe could buy a wagon with that or i could buy a wagon for green stone if you left him youd still have enough to live on but i wouldnt have a wagon she said coolly on the mountain above whandall had marked out an imaginary line cross that line and he would be where behemoth could crush his tiny wagon in one step but they hadnt reached it yet our children and i wouldnt have a wagon she mused he said lilac its not easy to set a price on your family secret until you describe it as for the rest do your other suitors have families so eager as mine well be at roads end in twelve days or so you could ask around the wagons wont return from the firewoods for another fifty but you might get some sense of what offers await you come to me then he didnt say have you other suitors he didnt say and well see what the onehorns say but lilac was glaring does it strike you that a onehorn might improve my bargaining position the truth was it hadnt whandall sensed how much green stone wanted to speak he did not look at his son i can mate you under two oaths one or the other will bind us all depending on what the onehorns say have we time for this big as he was behemoth shifted uneasily the wagon had crossed that imaginary line and was within his range whandall stood up for a quick look back the bandits had stopped in the road he asked do you understand the term glamour appearance altered or enhanced by magic some women cast a glamour by instinct with no training at all others are accused unjustly its why lovers dont bargain for themselves if they have family you know ive cast no glamour after seventy days traveling look at me lilac was a goodlooking woman and no illusion with the roads dirt under her nails and in her hair if they hadnt all been so afraid of water these past forty days curse theyd all have been better traders suppose i just suggest he said that mammoths also can cast a glamour hugeness is theirs but they cast an appearance even more vast dead they lose that power a live mammoth trapped in a pit might seem to be behemoth struggling to free his foot she stared straight ahead her face set like stone but a mammoth could still crush this wagon and if hes as close as he seems distant did you say something where are the bandits he stood and looked back just watching and ahead sos behemoth lilac i accept your terms after all it wasnt an argument he wanted to win the feathersnake wagons could not afford to look cheap ill buy you a wagon your family can buy the team you are a fine trader even though you havent fooled feathersnake thank you she smiled dimples again behind them green stone whooped but now id really like to extend the trade route there are getting to be just too cursed many of us morth jumped down from the wagon were high enough he straightened and was taller than he had any right to be behemoth backed up a step then cocked an ear to whatever morth was bellowing in throaty atlantean speech then the godbeasts arm uncoiled reached out and over the wagon and down the farmerbandits scattered tripping over each other their piping screams rose up the mountain morth was dancing on the hillside yes see that you apprentice bandits im a wizard again he saw his companions staring he said i persuaded the beast that those rural lordkin are bushes covered in cranberries the vast rubbery arm rose up and coiled back across the sky holding a bush torn up by its roots or the illusion of one not some luckless sodbusterturnedbandit those were scattered the width of the path and further running west behemoth fed itself chewed found nothing in its mouth bellowed and reached again after the running bandits something called from far above a distant trumpet plaintively played by a madman behemoth turned to answer whandall slammed his hands over his ears a madmans trumpet screamed inside his head the sound of the end of the world or the end of all music behemoth turned away toward the peak and started to climb chapter there was water but no stream was close enough to be a danger it seemed a reasonable place to make camp morth opened one of the talisman boxes and took something out faster than whandall could shield his eyes used up he said i cant even reenchant it lilac was looking too the doll was crude of barely human shape it had a wild white beard and long white braided hair blue beads for eyes and something like morths color whandall asked does it lose magic if too many people see it is that why you didnt want to show it morth didnt answer or were you just embarrassed morth laughed im no artisan he tossed it away ill make another tomorrow around sunset an animal stalked the camp half seen and then whitecap mountain stood among them youre in time whandall said and among the company assembled whandall feathersnake declared green stone feathersnake mated to lilac puma at this time he exercised his first wish and morth wove a blessing of good luck on the marriage afterward he told whandall you know the spell wont work except in the most barren of places then theyll know where to go when things go wrong if willow and i had known that that first year morning morth bounded from his blanket lean and bony and agile as a contortionist and howled in joy whitecap mountain snapped awake with a hairraising snarl green stone and lilac came running to see what the commotion was theyd made their bed in a thicket last night no problems whandall shouted just morth whandall see this rosemary morth pointed out the plant he meant lilac shouted well collect some fatherfound and they ran off morth said im going up climb with me maybe well find thyme too whandall looked up the mountain seemed to rise forever and this time there would be no magic to make it easier how high not far mannas blazing all over this mountain ill be back before noon morth was bouncing around like a happy tenyearold as a hiking mate he would be a pain if you find thyme tell us ill pick whats here the wizard began running whandall shouted hold up morth and pointed to a plant it seemed to be growing everywhere knee high and pallid white whats this how can a plant live if theres no green to it i dont know it morth picked a leaf and nibbled the edge its nothing rordray would want but i taste magic whandall half filled a pack with rosemary no need to keep spices in a talisman box he didnt doubt green stone and lilac would collect more in their copious free time maybe hed try it in his cooking theyd have more than rordray needed from time to time he ran across a stone spire they were all over the place growing thicker uphill noon and morth wasnt back this wasnt the wild magic that drove morth crazy no gold around here was there it didnt look like places where he had seen gold whandall began climbing morth might have gotten lost or stepped on the view was wonderful the breath in his lungs was clean and rare stone pillars stood about him this was heady stuff even for a man with no magical sense he shouted morth and morth of atlantis are you lost but never with real concern he didnt think that anything here could hurt a wizard in his full power except that any other magic thing would be in its full power behemoth say or last nights trumpeter which might be another behemoth a thousand huge stone spires protruded through the ground they didnt look like natural formations here and there stood a stone ridge looking almost like the rib cage of something ages dead bonewhite primitivelooking scrub grew everywhere sage and rosemary grew too whandall picked some sage once he looked down and was shocked at how high hed climbed yet he peak pulled him on the way grew more difficult then insanely difficult whandall kept climbing it just didnt occur to him to turn back the mountain grew more wonderful as it rose now he was finding steps in the most difficult places stairs hacked at seeming random into the naked rock no not hacked rock had flowed a man was watching him from high above the sun had burned him black like morth on the mountain whandall thought though his beard and hair were wild gold and he wasnt wearing any clothes at all the stone needles man watched in silence and whandall wondered what he would sound like thyme he called up theres a plant called thyme but i dont know what it looks like who are you the stone needles man sounded raspy and unpracticed a voice unused for a long time whandall started to tell him his mere name didnt seem adequate so he told more but wherever he tried to start his story something earlier was neededmorth the hemp road the caravan the firewoodsuntil he was babbling about kinless woodsmen in the redwoods around teps town he climbed as he spoke and that had him gasping the man watched and listened even close whandall couldnt guess his age wasnt even sure he was human something odd about his nose or his scowl maybe he was were thyme the old man said there and pointed with his nose all through that patch of dragon nip thats the white stuff whandall had to go back down by a little to reach it um i could call it mammoth nip they like it too thyme is grayish green stuff grows low to the ground yes that rub a leaf in your fingers and sniff never forget that smell nice i used it in the stew come eat the old man started to climb higher yet he turned once and said i want your lunch agreed um i get tired of goat keep changing the spicesits still goat whatve you got nothing the man turned on him a look of baffled rage whandall felt ashamed i didnt know i was going to keep climbing he said and that led him to wonder where do they think i went he should do something about that the wagon was a fantastic distance below him and the sun was halfway down the sky but theyd climbed to the top of the world and here was a small neat garden and a fireplace and an animal skin shelter set on poles stew was simmering whandall was suddenly ravenous morth lay by the fire he looked dead the stone needles man pulled the stew off the coals dont try to eat yet burn yourself morth whandall knelt by the wizard morth was snoring whandall shook him it was too much like shaking a corpse what happened to him got curious you got a bowl cup good he took whandalls cup and scooped stew into it whandall blew to cool it tasted good meat carrots corn bell pepper something else sage and parsley this time its always the same except for the spices i have to grow the parsley the rest is all around us and the old man chuckled feels like ive known you forever whandall said i was trying to remember your name born camno catlony barbarians called me cathalon later i called myself tumbleweed just kept rolling along following the manna wound up here call me hermit i was whandall placehold and seshmarl now whandall feathersnake what happened to morth at the sound of his name morth rolled out of his sleep hungry he said he scooped a bowl of hermits stew whandall tried to talk to him but morth paid no attention hermit said came up here this morning we talked hes a braggart hes got a lot to brag about you know i may be the safest man in the world the oldest love spell in the world is parsley sage rosemary and thyme i grow the parsley and the rest of it covers the whole mountain youre inside a love spell whandall looked around him in surprise great view too i never learned to talk to people reason i kept moving never liked anyone i met they never liked me anyone who can reach me up here hes welcome im lucky you didnt send me back down for your lunch whandall said id have gone the old mans face twisted idiot youd starve on the way and be climbing in the dark hah youre inside a love spell too the hermit stared horror widening his eyes whandall laughed affectionately me asked again what happened to morth hungry said morth burm my mouf curt he went on eating morth of atlantis wanted manna the hermit said and food i did eat his lunch so i started some stew but he wanted manna so i said climb one of the fingers and touch the tip get yourself a real dose fingers hermit waved at a stone pillar twelve feet tall morth heaved himself up to the top of that when he floated down i could perceive the manna blazing up in him he said yes theres a god in there under feel a little sleepy and he curled up and stayed that way till now fingers whats going on suspicion wouldnt come giant with ten thousand fingers ive tried to feel its thoughts but i cant too selfcentered i was that way when i came up here and its been so long if i lost touch with the manna hereabouts id dry up like an egyptian corpse but theres a god under the ground feathersnake did a god touch you theres a trace in your aura yanginatep and coyote both so another touch wouldnt kill you a giant under the ground suspicion would have made sense but the stone needles man wouldnt let him hurt himself would he he couldnt believe it whandall climbed the stone finger and laid the palm of his hand on top the land was in a coma of starvation once these expanses of narcotic white weed had lured dragons out of the sky down to the ridges where they could feed then stone fingers closed on them and they were lost the bones of dragons remained ossified stone ribs but dragons were gone now ten thousand huge fingers poked from the ground questing for prey gone mythical flesh alone was not enough to feed a near god mammoths were big enough and had magic too but they ate the dragon nip and avoided the fingers a mammoths long nose was perfect for that the giant had been dying for ages in a sleep as deep as death sleepy whandall said stumbling back to the fire hungry as a whiff of stew reached him he scooped more stew from the pot working around morths hand barely aware that they were both burning themselves he ate and then slept i remember when dragon nip grew taller hermit said it was morning and he wasnt likely to be interrupted morth and whandall were eating thousand years ago i think it learned to grow shorter than what dragons could pull up plants do fight back you know the pot was clean whandall licked his bowl he wondered if he was being rude but the hermit was amazingly rude and so what morth asked what did you tell them down there nothing whandall said theyll be going crazy id better send a message the rainbowcolored crow came at his call it settled on his shoulder listened to a whispered message then winged away morth said we should be going too he didnt stand up hermit picked up a hollowedout rams horn he asked want to ride down ride the hermit blew into the horn morth and whandall winced away from a blast of sound the sound of behemoth screaming faintly an echo rose from below no wait that wasnt from behind a granite mass too small to hide him behemoth stepped into view and reached whandall threw himself flat beneath nostrils big enough to swallow a wagon i believe ill walk yes indeed morth babbled but thank you very much come visit any time hermit said people do visit they never hurt me or rob me its getting rid of them thats the trick they taught me to be rude they did not morth said immediately the hermit snickered well no but i get tired the cursed language changes every few years and i have to learn to talk all over again i do get lonely though come again the wagon was in sight and green stone was closer yet and climbing morth said it wasnt just different customs hes crazy whandall smiled likable though he keeps giving things away anyone who comes here for the spices will have to climb i think and be glad he did then green stone gasping too hard to speak was nonetheless demanding where theyd been for two days and nights three bisondrawn wagons were in view way off down the road when whandalls wagon reached the flats they were closer yet his own bison were glad to stop and graze while they waited whitey loped off west to make contact feathersnakes other wagon and two puma wagons pulled up around sunset carver told him we were worried a talking bird isnt a message we could verily did bandits give you any trouble no this last village there wasnt anyone in it you didnt i never touched them they just ran away must have thought youd bring behemoth down on them chapter the two puma wagons rolled past the new castles gate the feathersnake wagons stopped green stone helped lilac down whandall waved morth back before morth could join them where was everyone we sent the cursed bird he said well take care of it green stone said go on father tell willow that i have brought morth of atlantis and will take him to roads end he will not be coming in right whandall set his own wagon moving and looked behind to see carvers wagon following they had left considerable cargo in green stones care he didnt intend to pay storage and tax on all of this every wagon fit to roll was gone from roads end the two puma wagons were on their sides stripped of their covers and their wheels puma guarded stacks of cargo carver went searching for the repair crew chief farthest lands men had to be found to open the warehouses i could do that morth said better if they dont know it hello thats whandall called twisted cloud whandall feathersnake twisted cloud made her way toward them but she was limping two boys ran ahead of her youre back in good time yes but why arent you with the caravan i broke an ankle patch of mud wasnt dry yet its almost healed but i couldnt stand at all when the caravan rolled i had to send clever squirrel her daughter coyotes daughter whandalls daughter some would say an obligation it twisted cloud cared to make it one hut she never had beyond the wagon whandall had bought for her daughter the wagons hers and shes old enough now she was born old enough twisted cloud this is morth of atlantis of whom youve heard tales youre both wizards yes i can see the glow twisted cloud said and you theres a familiarity like whandall a god has been in you she blushed well yes the boys watched and listened with interest boys would not be introduced until they discovered their names as green stone found malachite in a cave or as his fathers tales of the black pit shaped saber tooths dreams did you come to join the caravan twisted cloud asked morth said yes to reach the burning city whandall said i fear morth has been sniffing raw gold whandall i cant tell you more your mind is open to too many gods and the gods of fire and trickery all seem to be related twisted cloud said but the wagons are all gone whandall said yes morth they left when we did as soon as the hemp road became passable youll be here until spring that gives you most of a year to come to your senses and then the caravan goes only as far as the firewoods twisted cloud said curse morth said id lose all the power i gained on the mountain whandall noticed that the band around the puma wagons had grown i need to do some business he said ill scrape up a meal for us twisted cloud offered here i brought back some spices chief farthest lands men made meticulous records as whandall stored his gatherings they took a percentage of the estimated value it was worth it to most traders and to whandall too up to a point the new castle was the only hold in these parts that could be called safer than the chiefs safehouse then again like the spotted coyotes or the toronexti in teps town chief farthest land insisted no doubt the chief knewvery likely his clerks knewthat not everything whandall brought home came this far he had never made a point of it and whandall didnt abuse the privilege whandall completed arrangements for repairs on his own wagons puma had arrived first their wagons would be repaired first give them morths preserving box full of whandalls spices to carry to great hawk bay theyd be back before the autumn rains he returned to twisted clouds fire and a rosemaryflavored bison stew morths youth restored in the stone needles had gone to hale middle age twisted cloud had put on some weight since their encounter with coyote and birthed six children too four still alive still a goodlooking woman she had a round face made for laughter the tribes just dont get it she chortled they think i should have seen it coming and walked around the mud patch its like looking at the tip of your own nose morth agreed your own future is all blurred i saw the great wave from the sinking of atlantis and missed the sinking itself got clear though lucky fated whandall told you but there are things he couldnt have known there were three guesthouses at roads end low pits with tents over them rutting deer and mountain cat ran these and lived in one in the absence of her wagon twisted cloud was using one her boys had moved morths baggage into the third while he took care of some business matters now the wizards were verbally dancing around each other each trying to learn what the other knew hoarding secrets for later trade whandall tried to follow their talk feeling more and more left out presently he went off to his travel nest to sleep chapter without a wagon and team it was only a fourhour walk home whandall and carver didnt hurry evening fell and a long twilight it might be the last peace they saw in some time the pile of goods was gone from the new castles gate they parted there carver went on to the ropewalk whandall went in the new castle was a household disrupted by sudden marriage willow had put green stone and lilac in the guesthouse stones room wasnt enough to house two and the noise well newlyweds were expected to be noisy it was hours before whandall and willow could retire the bird had returned to willow hes a good messenger she said but next time you speak the messages i still flinch from morths voice i will and we have a wish coming whandall grinned in the dark yes we have a wizards boon there were two but i used one you awake tell it he launched into his story morth blessed lilac and green stones marriage he concluded now weve reached roads end so he owes us a second wish hell find someone to take him to teps town hell die there i think we should collect before he goes south but that wont be before spring what shall we wish for something for saber tooth if he was affianced i wouldnt even hesitate but weve got a married daughter now we can give the wish to hawk in might or her firstborn too bad well never get our third wish our lives are perfect yeah just asking willow stirred in his arms i thought of asking morth to leave our family alone forever thats easy magic a waste some gift for our childrens children ask him if he can do that hawk in flight had never been happier than when planning her own marriage now seven weeks a wife she entered the field as an expert she and willow began planning a formal wedding for lilac and green stone when the caravan returned the celebrants were seen only at mealtimes whandall kept himself occupied the bison had been well kept but they needed exercise the men who worked the new castle had complaints they could not bring to willow he must hear them out and make judgments two must be married two needed a shamans attention a woman must be put on the road her man went with her and now theyd need a new blacksmith whandall went up to the graveyard by day to pull weeds and tend flowers willow visited the hives nearby whandall didnt go with her willow must keep treaty with the queen bees they didnt deal well with men but you didnt get stung no said willow she showed him bees still exploring her hands well rumor says the teps town bees are above first pines this year they mate with local queens and then all the worker bees grow little poison daggers twisted cloud calls them killer bees he went to the graveyard again at midnight to keep his peace with the dead lest they grow restless it was always freshly surprising how the dead accumulated over a mans lifetime old friends two children no other family and that was rare whandall talked to them reminiscing while they hovered around him it was hard to tell their thoughts from his own the twisted ghosts from armadillo wagon had raged at him for years after that business at the ropewalk tonight they were not to be seen ghosts did fade or perhaps the fools had tired of his jeering three days of that and then lilac joined her prospective mother and sister the servantwomen were drawn into that circle the servantmen and green stone showed the same sense of abandonment that whandall could feel nibbling at his own composure the magic goes away he told green stone they were where the women couldnt hear its the great secret of the age green stone said the honeymoon we tell each other it fades father it happened too soon maybe you started early im not asking whandall said only musing green stone was silent hey this place will survive without us i should supervise repair of the wagons three days want to come along he could exercise the bison too hitch all six to one wagon the puma wagons were upright again looking almost new and ready to go there were no bison about nor puma tribesmen either they would be out finding fresh bison to catch and tame two of the repair crew were about hed expected to find more they tried to rag him about hitching six bison to one wagon whandall made up a story about a troll sometimes seen on the road the troll was willing to bargain a bison for two men this time theyd missed him might meet him coming back whandall spent several hours inspecting his wagons and arranging repairs taking it as an opportunity to teach green stone then he and green stone made their way toward white lightnings workshop lightning wouldnt be awake in daylight but it was near sunset and the days were getting long most boys found their own names but white lightning had been named for the lightning blast that left his pregnant mother blind and deaf for nearly a year the baby she bore had skin as white as snow he was a good glassworker strong and skilled but he couldnt travel the sun would burn him badly white lightning was peering into a whitehot coal fire through the slits in a soaked leather mask stone and whandall closed the door flap and waited standing well clear white lightning pulled a gob of glowing glass out of the fire on the end of a long tube he blew into the tube to make a globe stretched it twisted it now he had two lobes joined by a narrow neck lightning set it gently in a box of black powder and rolled the powder over it then he picked up the black double bottle with wooden paddles and danced it into an oven that was cooler darker than the fire hed been using and closed the door on it dexterous whandall said you look good lightning turned without surprise i never tell better in my life hello whandall feathersnake ah green stone is now a married man boy you all grow faster than i can catch up feathersnake whats your need lamps twenty if youll give us the quantity discount lightning doffed his mask his face was chalk white but there werent any sores and his eyes looked good you need them before fall no then sure take eight for seven oh all right make twentyfour what are you making now whandall saw lightning hesitate dont tell me secrets he didnt say so one bottle but it has to be perfect glass glazed with iron wizards but hes a great medicine man lightning stretched on tiptoe every joint doesnt hurt i can see again too he wants a black bottle come see it after ive fired it ill get two this way he can take his choice rocks burned in a circle of rocks morth of atlantis sat with his back to a small fire so that he could face twisted cloud the medicine woman sat so far back that her face was in darkness it looked awkward stone and whandall joined morth backs to the fire whandall asked gold right twisted cloud said for years theyve been paying me in river gold time comes when wild magic is needed its good to have i suppose but what can i do with it otherwise finally comes a man who can refine it for me a pleasure morth said whandall couldnt exactly ask after coyotes daughter when he had the chance he asked twisted cloud hows the wagon holding up that was mountain cats work wasnt it eight years and weve only had that one broken axle and twice a wheel its clever squirrels first time out alone but shell be fine too shes been running the wagon since she was fifteen her mother said i just go along for the ride its her wagon her dowry given by whandall twisted cloud said to morth though shes coyotes daughter feathersnake i dont think shell marry oh shell find her man green stone said coyotes daughter was his weird halfsister his tone was proprietary shes justexploring hell have to be someone who doesnt listen to unicorns hell need courage too month asked wagonmaster have you settled on a wish not yet where can i find you when i do morth glanced at the shaman ill he in the guesthouse while i take care of some business here then back to the stone needles plenty of manna there ill take things for the hermit make myself welcome fascinating place it sounds like twisted cloud said maybe ill visit youll love the hermit twisted cloud laughed but hes very accommodating you say ill wait there for spring morth said travel with the caravan leave them at the firewoods go on into teps town id like it if you came whandall whandall shook his head i promised willow long ago promised myself too werent you telling me morth asked that you want to extend the trade route find more customers peddle more exotica hire everybodys children im looking around thats true but my children are able morth we raise them that way theyll find another path or make one whandall didnt look at green stone but the boy was listening morth said puma holds the path to rordrays attic no room for you but the lords in teps town whatve they got thats worth having whandall held his arms straight out the left was shorter than the right and a little crooked im not wanted in the lordshills he said and they did this to prove it that was then youll go back as a looker ive heard this tale before more than a looker you have a reputation after twenty years and more of ships carrying tellers the tales are bound to have reached the ears of lords and kinless too kinless wont deal with a lordkin then again do lordkin have anything worth trading well yes if youll allow that some kinless is carrying it for us but you still cant think that wolverines or owl beaks or water devils will deal with a man from serpents walk whandall didnt speak of the deaths in his own family the ruin that had dogged morth morth knew those dangers whandall couldnt yet believe the wizard was serious id be crazy to go back you too get away from that he gestured behind him at the fire of gold ore get your head right think it over then are you enjoying your return to domesticity very much all the same didnt you leave debts behind you in teps town nothing i could ever pay whandall said green stone spoke for the first time whats it like morth spoke of running a shop among kinless and lordkin somehow whandall found himself telling of how hed played with the ghosts in the black pit then morth again whandalls family knew his tales of teps town and had heard willows tales too but morth was speaking secrets hed never known it was late before they slept chapter the next day mountain cat and three more repairmen were all at work on puma wagons whandall and green stone watched for a bit talked to them a bit then they worked on the feathersnake wagons they left both wagons on blocks each with missing wheels whandall had bought three new wheels to replace the old not because they were ruined but to show green stone how to dismount and then mount a wheel green stone had to know this stuff but theyd mount the wheels tomorrow if the mad wizard took it into his head to run for teps town tonight he would not ride a feathersnake wagon it was rare that whandall feathersnake remembered teps town what would his brothers say watching him make repairs ahead of a band of kinless so he wouldnt have to pay them as much enough of the day was left for hunting hunting was better while the wagons were gone from roads end they bagged a deer and some onions and brought it all back to become the evenings dinner twisted cloud and her boys and rutting deer set potatoes corn and bell peppers to roasting too dinner would be late it took time to roast a deer they told stories of teps town while they waited lookers blame the fire god morth said kinless blame the gatherers and a natural human lust for what others have i believe the curse on teps town is a pattern of habits rather than the baneful presence of a moribund fire god green stone asked what do you do to break patterns when nobody had an answer he asked what does it look like lordkin all stand around waiting for someone to set a fire come and see morth said to him then to whandall was there treasure you couldnt carry away with you enemies who couldnt touch a caravan master if there ever was a chance to set things right in teps town this is your best chance youd go with a wizard youll carry refined gold this was beginning to make whandall uncomfortable ill invest some gold with you myself twisted cloud said i like the trade possibilities i bet you do coyotes woman her attitude had coyotes touch any risks would belong to morth and feathersnake but new trade routes would be shared by bison clan and every wagon served by the roads end shaman whandall asked gold refines itself in teps town doesnt it morth yes the wild magic leaks away and your wizardry wont work either whatever you have in mind try to remember that dinners starting to smell wonderful cloud when rutting deer and the boys went to retrieve the food some glowing lizard thing leaped at them out of the burning rocks whandall feathersnake got his blade between them and the threat something like a gila monster stood up four feet high and screamed at him and as it came at him whandall wondered if hed finally bitten off more than he could chew but it tried to eat his knife and died i never saw a thing rutting deer cried oh curse a quarter of deer lay in the dirt something changed by the gold a lizard maybe twisted cloud said deer its not your fault whandall thought of work to be done tomorrow if he went to bed now he could rise early whandall woke before dawn green stone was not in his blanket voices from twisted clouds dying firewood for the gold had run out suggested that theyd been talking all night for white lightning it would be near bedtime he was still up with pride he showed off a black glass bottle another firing had glazed it there were rainbow highlights in the black finish hed made a glazed glass stopper in the same fashion so and this one is second best white lightning laughed yes second best for morth he chose the other one why are you thinking of buying it never crossed my mind the smith settled for a hit of gold half the size of his thumb by examining this thing whandall might learn morths purpose what was morth hiding from whandall the only certainty was that this bottle was intended for magical use glass in a cold iron glaze what would morth perceive to a wizard this would be a hole a blank spot hide it under goldeven refined goldand a wizard would see only gold morth and green stone were packing one of the puma wagons i thought you were staying longer whandall said i had a notion morth said it might be worthless fare you well whandall placehold when you decide what you want ill be in the stone needles growing strong again time we went home too green stone come the sky darkened as they traveled cloud drew itself across the sky but there was no smell of rain the wind made a strange crying sound green stone understood first he didnt warn whandall he casually traded away his place on the drivers bench and crawled under the roof to sleep white dung began to rain down there was no way to hurry bison whandall could hear muffled laughter from under the wagon cover the wagon bison and driver were covered in white when the bison plodded through the new castle gate in a sunset sky dense with passenger pigeons everywhere outside of the burning city elders remembered when evenings dinner could be summoned where civilization grew dense surviving animals learned to avoid people some learned to fight back in these days of dwindling magic seeking meat became an adventure meals were often vegetarian at the new castle but twice a year birds would over fly the land there was nobody to greet whandalls return men women children were all over the landscape all swinging slings sowing a hail of rocks and reaping birds green stone and whandall arrived in time to share the plucking the evening was spent stripping feathers and roasting and eating pigeons everyone gorged they all reached bed very late late breakfast was cold roasted pigeons whandall and willow spoke of mundane matters green stone had been days away from his new bride no need to disturb them as for the wedding plans had firmed up most of the arguing hail stopped with the caravan away not much could he done to prepare if only hawk in flight would stop blurting out new ideas morth would be no bother until next spring hell be on a mountain whandall said if we can pick a wish something mm willow said you were talking and you just trailed off i can find him when i decide what i want morth said maybe he meant the wish he owes us maybe he still thinks ill come with him you wouldnt she looked so worried that whandall laughed hes off to fight a water elemental on my home turf but thats okay hes got a plan only he cant tell me because the fire god wont like it so you wont but if im willing to make the effort i could be standing right next to him when it all happens wont go dear one i will not go a lordkins promise now what shall we wish for something a magician can reasonably be expected to accomplish nothing outrageous we have most of a year i dont think so there was something in his voice willow he wont wait hes thought of something maybe stone knows why would he tell green stone well we generally ate with morth and twisted cloud and told stories well catch him at dinner willow said and now lordkin will you go to encourage the kinless at their work in my dreams whandall said he went out naked it was appropriate for the work and the weather was warm where passenger pigeons had passed every human hand was needed to clean the droppings from every human artifact women worked inside men outside whandall feathersnake in his youth had learned to climb he spent the day scraping roofs alongside those few who didnt fear heights the new castle men and boys spent days end in the pond trying to get each other clean but green stone wasnt there chapter the household was in an uproar again whandalls impatience died when he saw his wifes face and lilacs i almost followed him alone lilac said we have bison and another wagon why not but i dont know enough he tried to tell me it was for the children i called him an idiot and he packed and left fatherfound what happened at roads end for the children what for the children hes off to see the wizard morth of atlantis is going to the burning city and green stone will go with him whandall willow demanded what happened at roads end ah he must sound like hed been punched in the gut the way they looked at him and now the hard part was admitting his mistake green stone was with me the whole time morth wants me to go with him back to teps town didnt i leave anything there unfinished business family debts grudges buried treasure live enemies some crying need for what a traders wagon can carry he cant tell me why he needs me cant tell me any of his plans i am to take some wagons into teps town and find a way to get rich and morth is to come along right willow ive been an idiot he was talking to green stone lilac said well get him back hes a grown man you know he was still speaking to willow if i force him to stay hes a kinless what could morth have offered him think at roads end he learned enough to firm up his plans then he tried to get me involved stay here i want to show you something he needed a lantern by now the droppingscovered roof had been stripped off the wagon and was soaking there was no trapdoor in the wagons floor but with the wagon empty the boards would slide out whandall set aside the bags of gold in the hidden well to reach the glazed black bottle and stopper then brought it inside cold iron he said it must be for holding something magical the one morth took is just like it they looked at it and him he went to roads end he needed a glassblower i have no idea why he wants it all right lets just guess that morth also wants me thirty years ago he saw lines in my hand he looked at stones hand too lilacs hard hand closed on his wrist what did he see early marriage twin girls then nothing a blur her grip tightened twins but why would stones future fuzz out is that death no no daughterfound a wizard cant see a lifeline thats tangled up with his curse he really is going or else hes going to handle raw gold that can screw up a prediction too you have less magical talent than anyone i ever met morth had told whandall could that be why the wizard wanted him all right morth has my son is that because i might go along to protect him dear you have to willow said havent i heard that song sung with different words whandall feathersnake i know curse morth why are we standing here we have to catch him wait now lilac its too dark to load a wagon and take off did any kind of dinner get made we roasted another batch of pigeons willow said last night course you did so we cant leave until morning lilac and that puts stone a day ahead of us but that doesnt matter because stones on foot hell catch morth morth is two days ahead in a wagon drawn by bison you dont expect to run after them well bison move at only one speed wed still be two days behind when our wagon gets to the stone needles they went behind the big house to the stream where an army of roasted pigeons had been buried in mud they talked as they ate presently whandall said i think we shouldnt chase him at all the women waited lets give green stones mind a chance to work hes deserted his wife of what twenty days a marriage blessed by a wizard hes got fifty sixty days to think about that and then everyone he knows comes home and finds out what he did youre pregnant lilac and if he hasnt guessed that morth can tell him whatever morth has in mind for teps town if he cant tell me hell have to tell stone give stone a few days to give morths intentions a hard look they may be plain idiotic in particular i want green stone to feel good sense rushing back into his mind as he leaves a mountainsize love spell its unforgettable on the mountain with morth hell be accepting everything hes told but as soon as he gets to where they left the wagon heyyy lilac youve been there yes fatherfound i didnt realize i just felt like wed been married about a day making love in a scent of crushed spices lilac said with a wonderfully lascivious grin that faded even as they smiled back but you try to share a blanket with him when he rolls up theres nobody in there but him and youd have given me more than just a wagon fatherfound willow asked lilac is whandall talking sense that part one more thing whandall said we can talk to them weve got the bird whandall lifted an arm the bird settled whandall said we should work out what we want to say anything to get them back here my hope lies in your shadow the bird said chapter every message was sent after considerable argument it helped that willow could write i dont want them afraid to come here said willow with all of us waiting to jump him lets not make it too easy curse it the boy betrayed me too lets just leave it that green stone is on a journey and we need to work out details and keep it short dear one does it bother you that he doesnt obey whandall stared at his mate then laughed immoderately willow cant you see i still have trouble saying my son no saber tooth is a good wagonmaster and i cant break up the feathersnake wagons unless ive got two directions to send them so what is there for my second son hed better be able to find his own directions she smiled then does it bother you that he chose the burning city yes you do all the talking then and you talk only to morth right we women arent speaking to green stone were furious you youre talking business seshmarls carry my words morth my son is in your care we need to know what you intend will you leave for teps town this year message ends seshmarls go the bird returned two days later with morths reply we hope to whandall sent return before his autumn wedding three days later hope to stop at the new castle the boys wife and mother are concerned four days later ive lost my transport may wait for spring will come to new castle whatever happens thats good willow exclaimed and made the bird repeat it whandall said lets keep up the pressure i remind you you blessed this marriage disrupting that spell could be perilous dear couldnt he take that as a threat oh you mean magic i meant both curse him four days later understood what we intend will make green stone and lilacs children safe for a hundred years stone says behemoth is on the hemp road i saw behemoth once willow said but why does the wizard want to know about behemoth and the stone needles behemoth it was white that idiot that utter idiot ah curse the women were staring whandall said lilac stone wont turn back now shall we assemble provisions can you grant a second wish the bird returned in three days they must be in transit i cant prepare your second wish if you cant describe it we need there followed a brief list of provisions whandall said morth is keeping the weight down tell him to give us back our man if we wanted a kinless we could have raised one lilac son and husband but not slave green stone stands by his own decisions then carve out a wish that keeps him safe until we see him again spells dont work in teps town they can you know said willow you saw ghosts in the black pit and theres magic along most of the hemp road try this then cast good fortune for travelers under the feathersnake sign done expect us in six days theres one more thing i can try whandall said but we cant count on it willow it stone goes anyway shall i go with him yes the wagon was in sight a good hour before it arrived morth and stone stopped just under the feathersnake sign and there they prepared a brief ritual as soon as whandall realized he was watching magic he went behind the house and waited until he heard the gong green stone guided the bison through the gate whandall made no move to stop or welcome them this had been the topic of much discussion but when they were firmly on his land whandall lifted the black glass bottle and silently showed it to morth green stone reacted with wild laughter yes father it was wonderful you should have seen it morth said you didnt know morth said i should have bought both bottles curse why not one might break well yes but what is it but if its a good story save it for the women whandall led them behind the house to a table and chairs set under a great tree willow and lilac were waiting there and servants had laid out a lunch willow could think of no way to talk to her son without letting morth of atlantis onto new castle land but he wasnt to come inside whandall set the bottle on the table waited until morth was seated and sat down himself green stone was still standing looking at lilac lilac looked back i had to wonder why you came to roads end whandall said to morth nobody but white lightning can make anything like this bottle my guess is you want to carry magic something like a talisman in a cold iron glaze so nothing godlike can leach it out morth said very good father weve got a whole wagon load of them green stone caroled morth swallowed a snarl green stone saw that but morth waved tell it and green stone did father we set up camp by the stream on a nice wide beach of clean white sand on the eighth night in the morning the wizard went up the mountain i waited for two days i wanted to borrow behemoth morth said the hermit would have given him up but i saw that the white behemoth is the hermits only friend lilac dropped her staring contest borrow behemoth i couldnt do that to him morth told her but at least i could deal with the bottles green stone broke in morth brought a chunk of cast iron with him shaped like a heart with lumps around the rim and heavy we half buried that in the sand and he set the bottle on it then we went buck to the wagon night came wed left morths bottle behind a stand of bushes lights made scrollwork in the sky above it curving out like a thousand whirlpools morth wouldnt let me go and look when we went back in the morning there were bottles more than i could count they werent all the same size they trailed off in arcs and spirals and little knots getting smaller and smaller no bigger than sand grains at the tips we left most of them i dont know how morth picked which ones to take morth shrugged i took the biggest the iron was all gone there was just a pit shaped like a lumpy heart so whandall said you need a lot of what virgin gold morth said wild magic i cant tell you any more i wish you didnt know as much as you do but i cant go near raw gold so ill need help to collect it yes well whandall said ive examined that bottle then i wondered what you might not want me thinking when yanginatep looks in there youd come he let his eyes flick toward green stone id have to let the boy work out the rest how often have you felt the touch of the fire god morth asked yanginatep left me about the time you did just that once i think earlier the madness with dreamlotus easy to blame that on the god but he knew better just that once with yanginatep a season later coyote had me for some hours both did me more good than harm we should hire you out as an inn all gods welcome at the sign of the winged serpent so there it was taking whandall into the burning city might tell the fire god too much if morth refused to carry whandall he might leave green stone too and whandall saw now that that wouldnt work he dared not let green stone go alone he said if rumor of the feathersnake sign has reached teps town youll be safer with me along yes if you can go as a legitimate merchant your son and i have spoken of this the caravan must be nearly to the firewoods already well meet them and assemble a few wagons that will be easier with you along theyd finished eating this would have been the time to invite morth to stay the night hut of course that wasnt going to happen ill ask some men to load your wagon whandall said good whandall taking you into teps town might be too dangerous now sorry but i need you to persuade curse curse come we should get on to roads end we may not have much time lilac said ill come that far stone and i should talk ill walk back take the bird willow said they walked into the house to get the bird willow asked whats your intent as morth says get some wagons from the caravan and anyone who wants to come along and goods to sell to the lords in teps town come back with tar for your brothers if nothing else youre going then dont you see morth offered green stone a ride on the piebald behemoth no boy of nineteen could turn that down she said nor can a boy of fortythree seshmarls walked onto her arm and across her shoulder to whandalls let me know whats happening i will part two gold fever chapter whandall drove with morth beside him lilac and green stone talked in the back and whatever they babbled of persuasions and recriminations was lost blue in the distance a shape from the worlds dawn ambled toward them morth said behemoth must be close to roads end by now i wish i could have warned twisted cloud you know this is the craziest thing ive ever done whandall said im not crazy crazy would be waiting for a water elemental to find me i dont know what the sprite is doing ive never known how far it can come inland ive got to keep moving repairs loading rebuilding of warehouses all had stopped while twisted cloud and four of the chiefs men watched behemoth come the men gaped in awe twisted cloud was wild with laughter and delight the shaman caught sight of morth wizard is that yours the beast should be here by morning i wish it were sooner wizards flattery medicine womans sarcasm i feel the elementals cold wet breath on my neck behemoth drifted toward roads end like a storm cloud twisted cloud watched he looks to be covering a league with every step but he isnt wizard how does one summon behemoth like summoning a rabbit for dinner you must know the prey in your mind i have green stones stories of behemoth and his description of a dead mammoth as you see they were enough lilac and green stone would have their chance to make peace whandall thought in one of the guesthouses tonight the magicians would have to share another rumor told that twisted cloud had given up men years ago but she seemed to get along with morth and whandall wondered well after all who wouldnt by dawn light it was as if roads end huddled at the foot of a small hairy mountain behemoth was still a mornings walk uphill and would come no closer morths bottles and a parsimonious few of the goods whandall had sequestered rode in the wagon with lilac twisted cloud morth whandall and green stone the bison ambled straight toward the great beast behemoths illusion was too big to worry them as they neared behemoth he seemed to dwindle when they stood beneath him he was a living image of a mammoth not small he stank like a whole herd of wild bison his trunk took morths proffered hand and morth spoke atlantean gibberish then the beast lifted morth into place morth sang and danced on its back the point of that became clear when dead things began raining out of its hair parasites in wild variety from mites too small to see up to crustaceans the size of a thumb joint morth brushed more from under the beasts great flapping ears under morths direction they girdled the beasts torso with the fishnet theyd carried from great hawk bay the beast picked up the travelers one by one whandall managed not to scream green stone lifted his arms and hugged the beasts trunk it lifted their cargo up to them and they tied every item carefully in the fishnet while the bird fluttered wide around them screaming curses lastly morth summoned the bird with a gesture behemoth turned toward the hills the beast climbed steadily up a ravine brushing aside kneehigh bushes and trees until it reached the ridge line this high the wind was cold whandall imitated morth he huddled prone against the beasts back gripping the net it was like riding a furnace compared to wooden wheels bouncing on a rutted road this ride was wonderfully smooth their motion was barely felt whandall savored the awe and the thrill of riding a moving mountain if not as master at least as a guest was this anything like what wanshig had felt aboard a ship was this thing any faster than a bison team traveling above the hemp road made landmarks hard to find but that already behind them was chief farthest lands high peak and lookout point as the caravan first saw it coming home landscape drifted by much faster than it ever would at a bisons pace behemoth was fast morth asked green stone have you any idea where we might find gold there must be rivers all along green stone was shaking his head i know a hillside covered with virgin gold whandall said if we can find it if it hasnt been mined out i went up it in the dark came down with coyote in my head but its south of first pines now you tell me will we pass close enough to first pines to know this place stone youve actually seen first pines more often than i have ill ask behemoth morth crawled forward to speak into the beasts ear green stone waved to the south those are the pines there where the land starts to dip it looks like behemoth wants to go above them morth returned he said behemoth believes that he goes where he will but hes wrong he cant see places low in manna theyre holes in his map he wont go near towns just as well green stone said so when we run out of pines we just walk on down and get the gold yes father weve covered a day walk already two wagondays morth were you going to travel at night better not they camped on the crest pines ran from the frost line right down into the canyon hiding the canyon and the hemp road morth summoned a yearling deer to roast the bird hunted his own dinner behemoth ate the tops of young trees and pushed down older ones to get at their top foliage next afternoon they ran out of pines now they could see down into the canyon a beige trace was the hemp road running almost parallel to a streams blue thread but higher the ragged slope of the far hill and the stream that ran down the gorge were familiar the caravan passed twice a year but whandall had never been impelled to climb that hill again huddled up against the forest was the town of first pines morth and whandall were lowering cargo from the mammoths back green stone looked from the chaparralcovered hillside across from them down into the canyon then at morths bags of bottles he said you want all of these filled with gold yes his son hadnt quite imagined the sie of this job whandall grinned were far enough from town locals wont bother us bandits might weve been attacked here more than once we can take a first pass this afternoon camp tonight at the caravan campground watch for bandits no come back up sleep here morth said bandits wont bother behemoth sleep with behemothsure that sounds safe couple of days then if theres any gold twisted cloud has known about this place all along she might have told anyone how do i know gold green stone asked how do i know wild from refined whandall wasnt sure he would either gold ore wasnt always bright smooth yellow he said you coming morth morth was torn youve seen what im like when ive touched wild gold do you really need me hopefully resisting whandall said i cant sense it you know dont i just ah take the bird morth said watch seshmarls chapter stone and whandall set out with the bird wheeling above them theyd half filled their packs with empty bottles those didnt weigh much but theyd be heavy coming back the rising wind was to seshmarls taste the rainbow crow flew with motionless wings pretending to be a hawk he had to flap more often than a hawk would without that bird they might have come and gone unnoticed they reached the floor of the canyon in a ring of older children all chasing around under the bird demanding to know whose it was or swearing it must belong to whandall feathersnake whandall introduced himself and his son and the bird when he asked where they were from they pointed up the valley toward first pines they crossed the valley floor and the stream in a circle of children and a flood of questions while they climbed whandall told tales of the bandit attack and of coyotes possession a few of the smallest couldnt keep up and dropped out an older girl went with them complaining bitterly of the excitement she would miss green stone apologized we cant stop we have to finish before dark now ten remained of the original fifteen he just couldnt tell these might be from first pines the children of customers and friends they might be bandits children or first pines might include parttime bandits then again it was a fine day for walking uphill in a gaggle of babbling tens and twelves with bright noon light to guide them around malevolent plants that had ripped half his skin off one black night oh look cried a blackhaired boy and he pointed up the bird was arguing territory with a hawk what had the hawk so confused what had excited the boy was the brighterthanrainbow colors flashing across seshmarls feathers it hurt the eyes to look wild magic whandall murmured and green stone nodded they took note of where they were and continued to climb the stream ran to their right the childrens chattering had dwindled but one boythirteen or so with straight black hair and red skin and an eagles noseurged them on whandall spun them a tale about an atlantis magician in flight from a magical terror he did not speak of gold he let the birds display guide him up the hill gold would not be found where seshmarls kept his accustomed colors where colors rippled across the bird in vibrating bands and whorls hurting the eyes well it seemed they were tracking a flood that might recur once or twice in a mans lifetime gold followed the flooding oh look now the bird sank toward the stream darkening as he fell the children ran greenery thickened blocking passage stone and whandall forced their way through and there in the water with eight children all around it sat the skeleton of a man seshmarls perched on his skull jet black whandall said to them here rests hickamore shaman to bison clan lost these many years gold green stone said and picked up two yellow lumps as big as finger joints he put one in his pouch and gave the other to the oldest boy here he said and pointed out more dully glowing bits of gold for the children to collect until every child had a bit of gold and they were scattered all up and down the streambed green stone and whandall tried to find gold in places a child would miss and thus filled their belt pouches day was dimming whandall gave a tiny black glass bottle to the oldest girl wait three days he said then show it to your folk and tell them where to find piebald behemoth the shaman they all trooped down to the valley floor and parted there whandall and green stone followed the last sunset light up toward the crest and behemoth that was clever whandall said thank you father i wasnt sure no it was brilliant this isnt what morth needs its refined valuable of course but coyote used up all the manna in it but itll draw them morth heard their tale then asked will the children wait dont know we still dont know if those are first pines children or bandits it doesnt matter it doesnt matter it they tell their parents or go themselves the way to gel the refined gold around the shamans skeleton is to go up the river well cross lower down tomorrow and get the wild gold on the slopes we know where it is now the bird settled on morths arm reminds me green stone said keep the bird with you tomorrow morth he attracts too much attention oh thatll do as the bird on morths forearm turned glossy black chapter they crossed the valley at dawn a lone black crow wheeled above them they saw no children they filled some bottles with water water going up gold coming down they panned a little gold in the stream it was only a powder here they stopped again at the bottom of the ancient mud flow whandall thought he saw color in the mud not yellow but the odd tints of gold salts and he felt the pressure of a lurks eyes they kept climbing whandall looked about him taking it all in letting his mind find patterns he didnt look for a face among weeds that was not how you spotted a lurk the bird wheeled above them and suddenly blazed with colors vegetation was low and sparse leaving little cover to hide a man flooding had left whole river bottoms sprawled across this slope then years of rain had washed away the lightest particles of silt leaving what was heaviest and that must have happened over and over gold was everywhere following the firebirds path whandall began collecting nuggets green stone couldnt perceive gold until theyd been at it awhile but then he caught the knack seshmarls flapped uphill in a wide spiral he was black again was he seeking the mad magic in gold or just his dinner the bird dwindled until they almost lost him then they saw his rainbow flare and followed now whandall had no thought for watching eyes nor for anything hut gold when their hell pouches were lull they emptied the gold into their packs by sunset every muscle was screaming their empty bellies cried for food a halfmoon gave them little light it was good theyd brought water but that was gone now unable to see to collect more gold they began sifting the gold sand into bottles in the dark by moonset most of the bottles were full there was no gold left in the packs and no light at all green stone hefted his pack thats heavy put it down we cant walk in the dark itll still be heavy tomorrow im cold hungry father what are we doing here gold fever we should have been on our way hours ago now well be here the night with their gold sealed in cold iron whandall was having second thoughts he thought his sanity had returned green stone said i wish morth were here hed summon something to eat gold drives morth crazy we dont dare build a cook fire anyway well we got his gold for him why does morth want it im not supposed to tell not morths plans no but do you have a plan or did you come just to ride behemoth maybe i can find my fortune in teps town or earn it maybe its my blood calling to me let me tell you about your blood whandall feathersnake said and about morth and they talked whandall had first seen morth of atlantis from lord samortys balcony when he was learning how to lurk one night during the trek to find morth green stone had crawled into lilacs blanket and gotten himself a long and heated lecture involving onehorns rumor custom and the rights of parents lilac was still ticked at his father for suggesting otherwise so was green stone whandalls father had died robbing morth of atlantis the placehold men had died because when the gold fever really did ease off hours later whandall tried to remember the long mad night of laughter and horror how much of this had he actually said things hed never confessed but he had told his son how the placehold men died while whandall stayed to gather a kinless woman and mutilate the man who tried to strangle her told him about ruling the placehold until mother came home with freethspat how mothers lover made him a murderer how whandall made freethspat carry garbage like a kinless and why that was funny green stone was snoring gently whandall wriggled around until his back was to his sons head to foot separated by backpacks stuffed with bottles dozing he suddenly remembered a sense of being watched he swept an arm wide around just above the packs his hand smacked hard into a thin forearm and closed the arm tried to pull away he followed through on the sweep reached across letting go to avoid a possible knife thrust and had the other hand with a knife in it then green stone was twisting the intruders head dont kill him whandall said quickly the struggling shape went rigid whandall took the intruders knife let me speak first he said youre a very good lurk well speak more on this we need this gold for ourselves but i can offer you something youll never refuse but im just not sure i want you yet let him speak stone a boy of twelve or thirteen cried out in anger and terror who have you killed what youre whandall feather snake your face green stone told his father its glowing thats wrong i havent killed anyone in six years must be the raw gold said green stone yes i dont kill lightly boy whats your name silence make one up never mind well call you lurk are you a bandit he didnt say bandits son give the boy his dignity the boy said yes do you need all of those bottles if the wizard would just talk to me i might have an intelligent answer green stone father morth doesnt know how many he needs stay with us lurk whandall said im going to let go in the morning well talk if we dont need you ill send you home with the smallest of these bottles and a tale to make you famous but if we need you youll ride behemoth with us im letting go now he let go the boy went to his belly and backed away whandall had expected that he could have caught him the boy hacked under a stand of thorns and was gone again whandall and his son stretched out head to foot and hack to hack green stone said he heard everything yes im not sure what you said i must have dreamed some of that gold fever did you ever tell mother any of that no you dont either right right why do you want lurk whandall wondered if the bandit boy was still out there ive been thinking if ever we hope to trade in teps town we have to do something about the toronexti by late afternoon they had carried those fearsomely heavy packs up to morth and behemoth they slept the rest of the day and most of the night then up and off at first light down to the river and up the far hill before seshmarls colors flared gold madness had them again theyd have carried more gold and saved a smidgen of weight by piling gold sand loose in their packs whandall convinced green stone that it would drive them mad they would try to carry a mountains weight of gold and it would kill them again darkness caught them and again they filled bottles by moonlight the moon sank they curled back to back with the gold between them from the darkness from beyond a knifes reach came the voice of lurk i think you lie about riding behemoth as you like whandall said hes not so big as all that lurk said but he could crush a man with his foot or his nose how close did you get i touched his hind foot when they didnt answer immediately lurk added his skin is rough his smell is very strong he opened one eye and i smiled at him and he watched me back away youve wrapped his belly in why did you touch him i got that close isnt that what you want that was perceptive i need a man who sees all and is never seen did morth see you no you didnt see me either lurk laughed when you think youre safe you sleep on your back feet apart your arms for a pillow do you have trouble breathing no but i did once story for story whandall spoke his memory aloud was healing from what the lordsmen did to me broken ribs broken arm bruises everywhere knees kidneys they smashed my nose and cheek and some teeth had to breathe through my mouth id try to sleep on my side and wake up suffocating and when i tried to roll over everything hurt so i learned to sleep on my back you listening green stone i tried to go where i wasnt wanted its dangerous in teps town lurk its dangerous you could stay here and be safe what are you offering youll serve the feathersnake wagons thats all what do you have now if you like what you have what you are then go home in the morning lurk was there they knew him a thirteenyearold boy the oldest of the children on the hill straight black hair brown eyes redbrown skin nose developing a hawks prow he wouldnt pass for lord or lordkin or kinless lurk carried his share of goldfilled bottles as they made their way across the valley and up by and by lurk asked whandall what are the tornex to you toronexti theyre gatherers who place themselves between me and what i want between me and the burning city whandall told him what he remembered he could paint a verbal map of the deerpiss the wedge the guardhouse at the narrows but the toronexti if the spotted coyotes never gave anything for what they took if they took whatever they wanted and there was no way around them thats the toronexti none of us knew them well i think its always been one family like the placehold my family they walked and talked like lordkin but lordkin dont have their own wealth where do they shop where do they get their mates it isnt a lordkin who rises from his blanket and goes to a guardhouse because its time be he sleepy or horny and a woman nearby be his throat sore and his nose running and some fool waiting to yell in his face a kinless goes because his lord expects him lords do that too a boy on a roof does that when the bugs are on the plants and so does a toronexti guard theyre weird lurk i need someone to spy on them and why should i come with you thats if morth accepts you you say behemoth already has lurk waited if you live you will have stories your tribe will never believe and never forget you ride behemoths hack with whandall feathersnake a firecolored bird wheels above you and waits to carry your messages you learn what whandall feathersnake can teach youll watch me destroy the most powerful bandit tribe in the burning city with your badly needed help youll help the last wizard of atlantis destroy a water elemental youll get rich too if everything goes right i have never seen everything go right you coming chapter lurk gripped the fishnet like a dead man in rigor mortis his face was buried deep in a patch of lank and matted brown hair but behemoths ride was smooth and by and by he looked up by and by he was sitting upright then he was pointing out landmarks when they stopped that evening lurk vanished whandall set about making camp he tried to think like a hemp road bandit he wished he knew how far they had traveled theyd come a good way maybe farther than a bandits child might find allies did bandits still fear whandall feathersnake or was he legend going myth it wouldnt matter whatever the truth of the stories whether first pines harbored bandits in exchange for a share of their loot none would risk robbing whandall feathersnake without assurance that the tale would never be told but lurk returned unseen bearing rabbits and a fat squirrel and a coyote that was only stunned some folk hold to a coyote totem he said good point let it go whandall said the beast limped away morth summoned raccoons came watching raccoons skin the other creatures cost lurk his appetite but it surged back with the smell of broiling meat languages whandall said if we are to trade in teps town we need more who can speak the language morth can you teach green stone and lurk yes but to what point magic doesnt work in teps town the knowledge would fade like dreams but if you teach them here and they practice here theyll remember what they practiced even when the magic goes away morth nodded sagely well thought that should work we need u safe place safe all three of you must sleep morth said understand there may be effects we do not know they may gather some of your memories as well as your knowledge of the language you know the language whandall said use yourself as model never and for the same reason oh whandall thought on it so be it and afterward on the journey south they spoke only the language of teps town but curiously not as lordkin and not as kinless they sounded like lords almost stone and lurk were speaking as an elevenyearold whandall placehold understood lords to speak your mind does not accept that these two are lordkin morth speculated hah but can they pass not for lords not for kinless not for lordkin lookers lurk green stone you know enough to trade or you might even pose as tellers in a pinch talk condigeano the ridge had descended but the company perched on behemoths back still had a godseye view of firewoods town several new houses had appeared since whandall placehold came out of that forest sixty houses half adobe and the rest wood all built for mass and durability and looking much alike like an art form planned were strung along three parallel dusty streets fenced yards flower gardens all very impressive to a lordkin boy all the townspeople were gathered at the north end of town around and among fifteen big covered wagons drawn in a wide circle there were tents a hundred hands were pointing up up at behemoth lurk whispered do you think they see us as giants whandall said morth i dont know ask the firewoods wheel was turning it was not much more than a wide flat disk mounted horizontally twenty children crowded onto it adults and older children were pushing it around the first goround wheels ran themselves morth said but whats it for lurk asked altered state of consciousness said the wizard in the old days anyone could sense magic it was everywhere talking animals gods in every pond and tree stars and comets would shift position to follow events on earth our ancestors missed that sense so they invented wine and stage magic and the powders and foxglove i used to sell in teps town and the goround wheel now too much of the magic is gone it only makes us dizzy they watched the folk below watched back the wheel slowed green stone said nobodys coming up to help us move this stuff are they the wheel had whandall mesmerized he could almost remember he shook himself morth stay here with behemoth well go down and get someone to carry a crowd of merchants and townsfolk watched them come the wheel slowed with their inattention whandall shouted this is lurk hes with me he moved through the crowd a little faster than anyone could talk to them he and green stone bracketing lurk they jogged to catch up with the rim of the wheel and began to push lurk caught a handhold and pushed too children piled on and crawled inward to reach the padded handles others took the easy way crawling under the wheel emerging in the hole near the hub they sought to hang on if only to each other to resist being thrown off onto the grass until they got too dizzy or the adults were worn out whandall ran and pushed showing off his strength fortythree but not frail but a memory came flooding back with a terrible sadness and he said there was one of these in teps town he told it in gasps whandall and others of serpents walk arrived while lordsmen were anchoring the wheel kinless were already there lordsmen used bulk and muscle to start the wheel turning children surged onto it the armored lordsmen went back to guarding while older children and parents ran round and round the outside of the wheel now serpents walk children bent their efforts to picking purses because it would go hard for them if they didnt but the day wore on and the kinless were careful of their purses and the wheel looked like fun it happened all in a surge the lordkin children moved in and piled on and chased the kinless children off the wheel and the wheel slowed and stopped i wasnt really confused here whandall panted the firewoods wheel was turning nicely they were pushing it townsfolk were still looking uphill toward behemoth but a few were starting to push again the lords let us think thatmagic was turning the wheel and heyi was just a little boy but the kinless wouldnt push if there werent any kinless on it if nobody pushes it stops we barely had time to feel what it was like so we went buck to picking pocketsund the kinless took their children and went away there were plenty of hands turning the wheel now from those who had run out of breath and dropped out whandall picked out a big woman from the feathersnake wagons hidden spice wheres saber tooth she wanted to talk he insisted she pointed that was saber tooth and everyone wanted to talk hard to guess which had more of the crowds attention behemoth or whandall feathersnake sprung up suddenly in their midst or the bandit boy they forged a path through the crowd above the noise saber tooth demanded father how did you get here why im here to protect your brother green stone is here following morth of atlantis my son what the wizards doing is the really interesting part but youve heard me talk about new markets i think ive finally got a handle on that father you cant mean what i think you mean well talk maybe ill come to my senses maybe your brother will too meanwhile saber tooth i need some muscle he said about six of your men to go up the hill to where you see behemoth theyre to do what a redhaired wizard tells them theyll be coming down with heavy loads i need those bottles protected theyre glass and whats inside is dangerous so dont bounce them then we can talk but this is urgent and those bottles are valuable ill go myself thank you and wheres clever squirrel saber tooth waved see the onehorns right the onehorns had all drifted into one corner of the corral i should talk to her lurk green stone come with me the onehorns dont want to be near her green stone laughed see lurk this is coyotes daughter special as a little girl she got to know the onehorns the young colts they thought she was their older sister one morning when she was fifteenshes a season older than saber tooth two years older than meshe went out to the corral and the onehorns freaked she stormed right back at them shes got them cowed they dont like it but if she had to ride one hed carry her hi squirrelly stones have you been riding behemoth fatherfound im not surprised but stones i can ride behemoth and you cant green stone cried they hugged each other hard then the girl turned to the others clever squirrel meet lurk whandall said my name is nothing was seen the bandit boy said shyly clever squirrel had deployed her travel nest with her dowry wagon for one wall and boxes of trade goods for the rest she even had a little fire going and she set a teapot on it with lurk trying to help they found each other interesting whandall thought should he be protective they should at least know something of each other so squirrelly he wouldnt tell us his name nothing was seen how did you find your name i became the best lurk in red canyon tribe he told squirrel how he had spied on whandall feathersnake and the wizard who rode behemoth he told a minimum of what he had heard that first night whandall was glad of that squirrel asked fatherfound what are you doing here waiting for saber tooth and morth of atlantis just now were going into the burning city to see if we can kill a water elemental and set up a trade route she lit up and he said no i cant deprive the caravan of their medicine woman and i have a wizard motherfound willow will kill you we talked she had to raise her voice above a rising background murmur her travel nest must be surrounded by most of the caravan and half the townsfolk all asking each other what whandall and green stone feathersnake were doing here riding behemoth back into the burning city with stones and not me sorry if i can really get a trade route going show me your hand curse stones curse the lines all disappear then were really going green stone was jubilant he must have had his doubts well then what is it like to ride behemoth stones green stone said you never feel a bump we had to stop off to collect wild gold whandall said i have no idea why the wizard wants that but what bothers me is why was it still there your mother has known where that gold is since the night you were conceived in the roar of rumor outside the wall of cargo boxes clever squirrel didnt even drop her voice ill answer if youll tell me about that night all about that night done she laughed mother tells everyone else she never found the place again she was outside her mind with ecstasy the gold wasnt there anyway the whole storys fiction she told me different shes tried to refine raw gold she gets some in payment for a cure or a prophecy but she never learned lo block the flow of chaos manna whandall nodded lurk merely listened and she went on gold lever does things to mother she always winds up getting laid whandall said that and his memory felt his wifes fingertips brushing his lips closed too late coyotes daughter laughed and said yes that explains how i come to have five sibs five times shes refined gold five children plus me a woman who knows can take a man without getting a child but not around gold not mother even during her time of blood the gold changes her thats how she got hairy egg after father went away nothing was seen was staring at whandall clever squirrel laughed no no not fatherfound she said i mean stag rampant he knew mother had conceived me before they were married no one dared put horns on him for coyotes child but my other sibs were too much for him and after he left mother gave up men entirely can you guess what would happen if mother led a man up that goldcovered hill there are stories only the men tell but i know them now tell me of my siring i first saw that hill in black night with your mother pulling me along at a dead run whandall began are you listening lurk i will not answer for advice not taken shes coyotes daughter and feathersnakes too treat her well and warily chapter saber tooth and five strong men came down the mountain carrying heavy bags morth was with them they brought the bags into clever squirrels tent and then saber tooth sent them away above the village behemoth came to his senses shook his great head and turned back to the mountains father youll have to talk to them saber tooth said no need to explain who he meant the crowd outside was larger than ever how long have you been here whandall asked we came in yesterday morning high noon now you were just setting up the market saber tooth nodded good finish doing that set up the tightrope and get your sister ready to perform and set up a stage to talk from tell everyone to come in two hours morth can you show them behemoth again show yes of course morth said as long as no one wants to ride him good one more thing i doubt anyone would try to steal from clever squirrel she grinned there were tales from when she was five and six and eight but just in case have a couple of reliable men sit right here next to those bags squirrel can we meet here for supper good as soon as the market closes now lets give these rubes a show but father what will you tell them saber tooth demanded im not going to tell them anything whandall said youre going to tell them how you brought them the greatest show ever but what will you do saber tooth asked why should i do anything its your wagon train and your show whandall said tell you what ill catch for your sister im still strong enough for that you do the rest burning tower had grown in the months since whandall had last seen her the terror bird costume willow had made for her was tighter and what it revealed was no longer a little girl whandall stood beneath her tightrope a rope set higher than willow had ever dared and hoped she wouldnt fall he was aware of the stares of all the young men wagoneers as well as townsfolk they were going to need more jobs no question about it her mother had taught her well forward somersaults back flips and a grand finale that involved spiraling down the lefthand pole to land on one foot back arched high kick to her forehead then she was away to the changing tent morth appeared on the platform in a cloud of fog he gestured to the hills behemoth came over the brow of a hill far away bigger than the hill as large as the mountain beyond he reared high then stood on one leg kicking high with the other in a hilarious imitation of burning towers finale the crowd went wild supper was local jackrabbit stewed with spices from stone needles whandall insisted they finish eating before they talked then he sent out all but family members morth and lurk saber tooth was relaxed and smiling i dont think we ever made this much profit at firewoods he said burning tower grinned well sell them more tomorrow when they come back to find out which story we told today is true if any lurk said whandall stood carefully he opened one of the bags and spread black glass bottles out with his fingers clever squirrel gasped you can tell whats in them morth demanded the iron is thin on that one squirrel said she set it aside and i saw how heavy they were morth looked worried what are they squirrel saber tooth demanded she laughed gold wild gold aflame with magic and chaos gold saber tooth looked at the bags all of that no wonder my arms ache father this is more than well make in two years three if the leather men keep moving their wagons ahead of ours gold he reached for the flawed bottle no son whandall said listen first i have a talc to tell he laughed and said and i dont know the ending yet i dont even know what the wizard intends with these cursed bottles and you cant tell me can you morth well have to make an ending but i need lurk i need the wizard and he needs all of these wonderful bottles what can you do thats worth three years profits saber tooth demanded a new trade route whandall said saber tooth frowned like the one to quaking aspen whandall laughed i grant you that was costly but well make it back in about seven years saber tooth muttered so where this time to the burning city at least green stone had the wit to keep unspoken his im going and youre not while saber tooth thought that through wow are we taking the whole caravan not worried about the profits burning tower asked innocently saber tooth struggled with his dignity before putting his tongue out at his sister i cant risk taking the whole caravan whandall said not this time i need four wagons and son i can leave you refined gold to hire more but ill need the best traders and fighters you have no not quite the best the most ambitious same people curse you we need trade goods anything that cant get to teps town by ship terror bird feathers grain cooking pots nothing magical not for teps town well pick as many miller and ropewalker kids as we can get because theyve got relatives in there i have more refined gold and thats a lot more valuable in teps town than out here but what do the harpies have that we need saber tooth demanded burning tower giggled were harpies too brother saber tooth grinned at her sure but its still a good question i dont know whandall said whatever we buy well have storage after we get rid of morths bottles after that they all talked at once chapter late that night whandall dismissed the others and went to saber tooths travel nest they sat on ornate carpets in a wagon den of polished wood youll be wanting this wagon of course saber tooth said well its yours father i have my own whos in that hammer miller is his wagon here yes its loaned to one of his wifes relatives hammer had married a girl from a town in paradise valley and was content to be a wagoneer foreman complicated whandall said think hammer would like to come to teps town i think you would have to tie him to a wagon tongue to keep him out and you as well saber tooth didnt say anything son i would rather have you with me whandall said realizing that it was true but feathersnake cant spare you it can spare me father it can so long as youre in charge whandall said and you know it youre a better trader than i will ever be saber tooth didnt answer they both knew it was true so i can be lost and green stone can be lost and feathersnake goes on your mother will grieve but she wont starve and neither will your sisters and their kin number one we need you out here saber tooth was a long time answering finally father ill take the caravan on to condigeo having a new opportunity doesnt make an old one less worthwhile ive always wanted to be the feathersnake wagon boss most never see their dreams in old age let alone as young as me he sighed ive always wanted to see teps town too but that can wait you go in well travel light to condigeo and we may be back here when you come out if not you can wait here for us good plan what are you carrying to condigeo marsyl poppy seeds german hemp some bad carpets that will still be better than anything they have that far south whandall nodded to himself the feathersnake wagons didnt go all the way south unless they had cargo condigeo would pay for and time to reach roads end before the snows storms chopped off the condigeo leg two years out of three and civet cat glands saber tooth said two jars i want one whandall said did your nose die of old age or do they make perfume in teps town not that i heard whandall said just an idea i wont need a whole jar two cups of the juice will do be sure its sealed tightly saber tooths nose wrinkled dont worry about that so whandall said its my wagon and hammer millers and who else do i take four you said four wagons if i can get em saber tooth poured tea sipped not fighting cat fishhawk he said his mothers getting pretty old now shell expect to see him how is she sorry she retired i think saber tooth said but she was too damn old to be on the road he brooded thinking of the first hard decision hed had to make as a wagonmaster beaching one his fathers oldest friends the worst of it was that whandall should have done it years before and hadnt so who insolent lizard saber tooth said positively whandall nodded kettle bellys fourth son reliable and skilled if a bit of a smartass one more then youll need a blacksmith saber tooth said i can hire another for a while take greathand hed follow you anywhere starfall ropewalkers brother not her father the son took the fathers name when the first greathand died six years ago a skilled giant to his last jay he wasnt blood but he was kin good ill talk to them alter weve loll this town behind saber tooth nodded agreement the less the townfolk knew of family affairs the better he liked it sure youll be all right letting me have this wagon truth is father i like my own better this is the nicest travel nest on the road but but you designed and built yours whandall finished for him yup all right now for supplies this is going to be like herding snakes we have to cut out four wagons take all the condigeo cargo off them put anything you want for teps town onto them and get it done out of town without making camp before the damn leathermaster caravan catches up and sees us no doubt you are competent saber tooth took on a cagey look this will be tricky and tricky is expensive never knew id have to bargain with my own son whandall said sure you did saber tooth looked thoughtful its morth who needs the gold in those bottles whandall nodded i do not exactly see why we need morth theres me and theres morth and nobody else on this expedition knows a cursed thing about teps town and we need him that much i could sell everything we have and not come up with that much gold whandall sighed son its wild gold unrefined but contained there are wizards in condigeo who would be more than pleased to refine it for us its not mine morth helped gather it its a matter of our word whandall said oh i take it this is entirely a feathersnake enterprise yes if we can keep it that way do that saber tooth said chapter every wagon owner expected to call at whandall feathersnakes wagon den to present respects and get a glass of the best wine or tea or both to meet the wizard who was whandalls guest to learn why whandall feathersnake kept a boy from a bandit family as guest to test bargaining skills had whandall feathersnake gone soft from living in town fighting cat fishhawk hailed whandall with a glad cry ruby fishhawks son was four years older than whandall a touch of his mothers kinless ancestry in the ears give my warmest respects to your mother whandall said wont you see her yourself curse perhaps not i will not go farther than the springs this trip whandall said tea or wine both please but little of the wine the springs so you believe the stories of gold in the hills above lurk make us some tea whandall had taught him how it was best to have something to do to cover a social gaffe and burning tower was eager to be hostess for her father but whandall had sent her on errands she wanted to help too much condigeo is getting soft fighting cat said i sold a marsyl carpet used for seven sea turtle shells good price are sea turtles so common now fighting cat grinned no more common than ever whandall sensed a story how i dont talk so much whandall grinned and waited and lighting cat grinned hack whandall said excellent and they moved on to what whandall needed which was two repaired wheels water jars root vegetables and dried meat when fighting cat left whandall told lurk my first trip the caravan had just found out we had a wagonload of refined gold im passing fighting cats wagon he pulls me into his travel nest by the arm shows me a necklace that would look wonderful on willow i admired it he wanted nine thumbweights of gold far too much but it really was a beautiful necklace and i wasi wanted very much to please willow he showed me each turquoise blue to match willows eyes tiny gold flecks he pointed out the absence of cracks that there was no yellow or green which are flaws but i didnt know it then i kept looking it was clear i wanted it but the gold wasnt all mine we hadnt divided it yetand i wasnt saying anything he told me its history offered me three shambit figurines to go with it still nine thumbweights y lurk wasnt listening closely getting bored some things you say because theyll be understood later i already knew nobody could force me to buy without actually drawing a knife so i was entertained he showed me everything he had and i smiled and admired and watched him go from nine thumbweights to two and a half willow loved it and i told fighting cat what hed done wrong a year later part three the year of two burnings chapter they left firewoods town at dawn of the third day at noon they came to a side road that led steeply downhill and off to the west a score of locals had been overjoyed to find there was suddenly employment in the feathersnake wagon trains where the road forked they watched in astonishment as four wagons were separated out fallen wolf had been hired to replace a guard who was going with whandall thats where you came up from the river twenty years and more ago he said youd felled some trees big ones whandall remembered two trees had blocked the wagons it had taken all day to cut them and hed been much younger and stronger then id hate doing it again he said my uncle badwater found them he said youd already started a road in uncle logged them out and thats been a logging road ever since whandall frowned does it go all the way to teps town then great coyote no fallen wolf was horrified down and along the stream up the other side of the hill then the creepers start creepers and vines and stuff that wants to kill you and no one has explored farther fallen wolf looked from whandall to saber tooth and back thinking okay you hired me you hired what i know when i was about sixteen maybe nine years ago there was a lot of smoke out of the valley of smokes a lot more than usual me and three friends put on leather stuff took axes and food and tried to get in the creepers were bad enough theyll be worse now we hid from three armored men who were coming out four days we cut our way through chopping tangled crap youll be glad to find gone then we saw a wall big stone house masked men in leathers spears saw them just in time we ran they came after us we brushed some stuff wed avoided going in got away but i sure wouldnt want to go back we were a month getting over the itch want to come with us now whandall asked you all going just four wagons whandall said with me so its true whats true saber tooth demanded crazy old woman in town babbling that whandall feathersnake is going home fallen wolf said look all my life i wanted to work in the feathersnake wagon trains but if its all the same to you ill stay with the main wagon train id hate to get killed my first trip out fighting cats wagon came by not going farther than the springs he called i see you havent lost your skill farther south thank you and good luck wish i were going in with you mother would love to know ill visit her afterward fighting cat went on he wasnt expecting whandall back hed heard about teps town all his life of thirtyone volunteers whandall rejected five that gave him twentyeight fighters counting himself and green stone one spyhed better not count on lurk to fightand one wizard they had four wagons he took leathers axes long poles to make severs morth gathered herbs to make remedies against touchme and thorns they carried weapons but not to sell a mixed bag for trade goods a sampling of things based on old memories memory said that clay and metal pots would be best but they had few because there were good markets for those along the hemp road mostly they had anything that should have sold somewhere but hadnt saber tooth stood by as whandalls band turned off down the logging road farewell good trading whandall waved then all his attention was taken with guiding the bison down the old road when he looked back saber tooth and the feathersnake wagon train were gone they reached the stream by evening and made camp high it reached you in three clays last time whandall told morth how long until it finds you morth shook his head theres no knowing but i wouldnt stay here very long i dont intend to at dawn he sent lurk and hammer miller ahead to scout out the old route up the hill then a crew with axes and brush hooks to clear the way they were moving up the stream by noon the wagons jouncing along the old streambed a big flood cleared out many of the boulders whandall said i suppose that was your flood morth there was no way to know but bison moved up the streambed as fast as the boneheads had taken them down by nightfall they were ready to climb up the embankment and whandall had torches lit he would not let them camp until they were high above the water and he remembered what he had learned while he was eldest in the placehold everyone complains to the lord and they do it all the time they found the first of the touchme creepers just over the brow of the hill the trail whandall had burned through the forest was clear of big trees but vines had grown into it one rustled slightly as the bison approached it the bison stopped could it sense danger or did it feel whandalls thoughts but the way didnt seem too bad there was more creeper than anything else here and there were the bright flowers of lordkinskiss and the duller lavender of creepyjulia but the plants mostly defended the big trees the road they would take wound through those a few redwoods had sprouted up and were now a dozen years and more tall still small among the giants small armies grew around their bases it would be tedious but not impossible whandall halted the wagon train and drew everyone around ive told you of touchme before this is what it looks like does it strangle you lurk asked no but the poisons can make you wish it had whandall said and it doesnt just lie there it can come after you thats lordkiss over there stay away from it lizard serve out the tools and lash blades to the poles we brought ill show you how to deal with lordkiss all of you i dont know what this stuff will do to a bison but i dont think we want to find out we certainly dont want to brush up against a bison whos got the oils on his coat remember that when youre clearing the path thiswhack his palm against a slim trunkis an apple tree you can eat the fruit theres other stuff you can eat trees and bushes and patches of brambles but most of them are poison ask morth or me morth can see poison yes father burning tower you were supposed to go on with saber tooth did i say i would of course she had never agreed and it was too late to send her back now whandall looked into her triumphant smile remembering willows nightmares that first year hed grown used to waking in willows grip coming out of a nightmare she would wrap herself around him for reassurance yes youre here im out of the city im free the nightmares faded over the second and third years and she faced the old terrors when she named her third child if something happened to burning tower willow would be long getting over the loss so would he use rakes whandall said never touch it with your hands and use the yellow blankets we brought to clean tools wear leathers and dont touch the leathers when youre taking them off or putting them on when you do begin to itch see morth and dont put that off dont forget we may want to come out fast with heavy loads and enemies behind green stone reminded them so make the way smooth now now lets get to it it felt good at first to swing an ax again he left the creeper to the younger men and women and took greathand to attack the first tree to bar their way it was a small redwood no more than ten years old perhaps less they used severs to clear away the defending brush greathand stepped forward with his ax wait whandall said he approached the tree and bowed im sorry youre in our way he said he bowed again now greathand chopped through the armthick trunk in one blow when burning tower found a patch of redberry brambles she called him he was unspeakably relieved drop all your weapons here he told the assembled workers yes the knives too now go look they walked cautiously closer to the brambles then the magic reached them and they surged forward they gorged fighting like children for the berries and left only twigs hours later he held them back from a darker bramble patch poison he told burning tower raising his voice so others would hear the creepersll wind around your ankles and hold you while you die they want your body for fertilizer the only thing that can eat those berries is a kind of bird those little and yellow with scarlet wings fluttering among the brambles watch for the flushers flushers and thornberries they made a deal long ago the flushers swallow the seeds and carry them father how do you know what was he remembering coyote he said coyote made the bargain he can eat thornberries too would that protect whandall not bloody likely he decided they made camp in the wagons in a wider area they had cleared it was not wide enough to allow them to unload the wagon boxes whandall was hungry chopping wood and vines was harder work than he was used to but dinner was delayed father burning tower called all the fires are out i cant light the brazier curse of course you cant whandall said he called for greathand youll have to strike fire for us keep it outside from here on fire wont burn inside a house or a home and our wagons must seem too much like houses to yanginatep it may be more than that morth said you have a vision no but does yanginatep ive lost most of my perception whandall the toronexti were waiting for them just after first light on the fifth day the wagon train rounded a curve to see a thick wedge of grass cleared of creeper and brash leading like a funnel to a brick gatehouse seven men in leathers wearing fancy hats with tassels perched ridiculously above their leather masks stood in a line in front of the brick gatehouse more were on the roof and whandall thought there were others concealed in the thick chaparral on both sides of the road the seven were armed but their weapons were sheathed whandall couldnt see the men in the gatehouse beyond the gatehouse four men tended a big cook fire with an iron pot suspended over it as the last wagon rounded the bend lurk dropped away from the wagon train sure you can find us whandall asked i know the language how can you hide a wagon train nothing was seen asked reasonably tonight or tomorrow i dont remember their acting like this hammer said he had come up to walk beside whandall as others drove their wagons his sling was barely concealed and he had a bag full of rocks nor i dont show our strength yet the toronexti seemed to be engaged in a ritual one came forward holding a leather strip something was wrong with the hand that held it two fingers were missing right to the wrist because he was hidden beneath the masks and leathers there was no other way to identify him at all he unrolled the leather strip and held it in iron of him as he spoke greetings strangers to our land this is tops town we are the toronexti spokespeople and servants to the lords witnesses of lordshills lords town and teps town you are welcome here your trade goods are safe here we regret that there is a small charge for this protection and another for passage through our territory our inspectors will assess the charges depending on what goods you are carrying do you submit to the authority of the lords witnesses you have some proof of your authority morth asked dryly the toronexti spokesman beamed we do we have a charter from the lords witnesses ah morth seemed boundlessly amused may i see it whatever for whandall demanded morth shrugged half hand turned to his colleagues they huddled finally the spokesman emerged and said one of you may approach the charter it is kept inside the gatehouse inside whandall said to morth so it wont burn im guessing a reasonable guess morth said note the cook fire to placate yanginatep louder he said i will approach i am morth of atlantis wizard to the wagon train of whandall feathersnake whose fame is known to the four winds morth went inside whandall conferred with hammer and insolent lizard did anyone see them last night lizard said i thought i heard something up the road but nobody came close and id swear no one came through the forest so they knew wagons were coming but not how many whandall said maybe they didnt bring their whole strength greathand was shouting hey harpy the wagon train boiled with activity every armed man turned out the women slammed the wagon covers closed hammer and insolent lizard were already running toward greathands wagon before whandall could react to the traditional shout of a wagonman for help two toronexti stood menaced by greathand and his hammer four more had drawn swords and another held a spear greathand was shouting the toronexti were shouting and no one understood a word what is this whandall demanded we are toronexti inspectors and this man is resisting one of the toronexti said hold off greathand whandall said if you please to the toronexti our wizard is inspecting your documents surely you can wait for this please go back to your guardhouse for instructions from your officers interestingly they did not lordkin hammer said not as i remember lordkin anyway its an old puzzle lordkin wouldnt acknowledge any authority of officers and wouldnt worry about charters in the first place but he knew toronexti only from the lordkins viewpoint whandall drew his wagon owners around him this could be tricky watch me and be careful we do not want to fight stone go see whats keeping morth green stone returned a few minutes later hes looking at an enormous pile of parchment stone said they wont let him touch it but one of them a crazylooking guy in a robe and a funny hat is spreading out the stuff on a table one of the sheets has huge writing that says witnesseth and then some other stuff i wasnt close enough to see you can read it greathand asked willow had taught all the children to read the languages of the hemp road but sure its in that language mother and dad use when they dont want us kids to understand them stone said morth taught me that speech and the letters are the same as we use did morth say how long hed be he said give him a quarter hour but it wouldnt make much difference whatever that means dad there was something else scrawled across the ceiling in big black letters i killed sapphire my wife i burned my house to hide her corpse but yanginateps rage took me and i burned more fire surrounded and killed me but i am not yanginateps i am kinless some old memory was knocking at his skull demanding entry but there just wasnt time all right time to get ready well have to let them inspect the wagons whandall said the only thing we have to hide is gold and thats hidden as well as it can be those bottles arent hidden hammer said a whole wagonload leave those to me morth returned chuckling its a charter all right and regulations what they can collect what they cant in theory theyre limited to one part in ten except they can collect up to nine parts in ten of any tar being imported no one would bring tar into teps town whandall protested green stone said one part in ten isnt all that bad then there are the exceptions morth said whandall that document seems to have grown over the fifty years or so when there was still trade from outside into teps town i dont remember there ever being any land trade hammer protested neither do they nor does anyone living morth said but there are still regulations and rules and what it amounts to is they can take anything they want if they read it all closely enough and theyre sure to have read it whandall said well no they havent morth said they cant read except for that one the odd one with the robe who keeps babbling about old crimes egon forigaft forigaft a lordkin name again the old memory would not come he appears to be their clerk they treat him with an elaborate respect that he does not deserve but whandall he is the only one of them who can read they dont care what that charter says i think they will take what they believe is in their best interest maybe thats why these costumes and showing us the charter whandall mused theyve never seen foreign trade lets find out he strolled rapidly up to the gatehouse noble toronexti he said hed learned long ago flattery was cheap goods we are the first of our kind in many years others will come bearing many goods cook pots pottery of the finest make skins of exotic animals furs and feathers and gems to adorn your women all this can we bring but none will come if we do not return happy the toronexti officer grinned behind his mask and what do you bring this time little of value for this is an exploration but we do have these as gifts for your officers he waved and one of the boys brought a cheap carpet laid it down and unrolled it three bronze knives lay there with half a dozen showy rings with glass stones the kind that whandall was accustomed to giving hemp road children as trinkets the toronexti scooped them up eagerly carpet and all the officer eyed whandalls knife yours is even more elaborate take it if you like the toronexti was already stepping forward as whandall said thats how i got it the toronexti officer stopped he eyed whandalls ears then his tattoo you have been here before whandall said nothing a good way to get a knife the toronexti said what more have you brought there will be more of value when we leave whandall said if you trade well we will whandall sighed i show you the most valuable thing we have he waved again and green stone brought another cheap carpet curse whandall thought i should have realized they have no real carpets here theyll all want them stone unrolled the carpet twelve black glass bottles were nested in wood shavings i know the people of lords town will pay well for these he said lets think now the lords town kinless will give me more for these bottles than theyd give you a lot more because i dont work for the lords whandall watched the tax mans face was that still an insult and would the man see past it to see that whandall was right with the tax man said work with show me those two he pointed to the smallest bottles the little ones theyre finer work whandalls face didnt change as he realized the toronexti had nothing like glass bottles they were common enough outside but he had never seen a glass bottle in teps town they must not be in the sea trade and they liked the smallest ones whandall remembered green stones tale of the spirals of bottles made by morths magic theyd left thousands of bottles smaller than these what might they be worth here later carefully whandall lifted out the two tiny bottles as he put one in the toronextis hand he winked at morth the wizard did nothing whandall could see but the bottle broke into a paste of sand and putrid liquid that ran on the officers fingers curse whandall exclaimed curse indeed what is that the toronexti demanded extract from civet cat glands whandall said it is used to make perfume perfume that he reached for the other bottle it too broke into putrescence whandall stared bugeyed and cried out as if strangling then he put a third bottle in the tax mans limp hand again the glass crumbled into sand and stinking liquid the toronexti flung it away with a curse the other tax man broke into wild laughter magic magic doesnt work here you fool morth said im sorry feathersnake these magic bottles will disintegrate at the touch of anyone in this cursed town theyll have to be emptied over a basin you say the kinless of lords town will pay for this to make perfume the toronexti officer demanded well they do in condigeo then let them do it we certainly dont want that stuff the bottles now another lime morth said they can be made without magic i had not realized the backwardness of this place backward us but the toronexti guard was laughing so what else do you have little for we thought those the best things to sell whyd you think that the toronexti asked craftily we speak to ship captains whandall said we learn what would you know all the secrets of a master trader he smiled broadly behind him his wagoneers had arrayed themselves greathand leaned on a twohanded sword point down hammer and some of the younger kinless idly held slings and rocks green stone held an ax and wore a big lordkin knife they all smiled and listened to their wagonmaster and stood with weapons ready whandall had no trouble reading the toronexti leaders thoughts the wagoneers might be telling truththere were more and richer trains to come if this one came out whole there were thirty armed men more than the strength the toronexti had brought today the wagon train would be more valuable coming out than going in and it would come at a time when they could bring their entire strength do you have more of those rings a dozen as a gift whandall said food whandall threw down a box of dried bison meat the toronexti grinned pass friends chapter the trail crossed the deerpiss a final time now whandall told green stone well see teps town as soon as weve got around this grove the town lay ahead down a gentle slope thirty men armed and wearing lordsmen armor blocked the road they stood to attention not menacing but there was no way around them bandits green stone shouted whandall stood on the driving bench and gestured violently at the following wagons both hands out flat empty pushing down put down your weapons green stone saw the urgency in his fathers face he rushed back to the others urging calm whandall dropped from the wagon he stepped forward the big engraved knife prominently sheathed hail hail the spokesman was elderly his face hidden in the lordsman helmet and armor but the voice sounded familiar whandall feathersnake we have heard the stories he turned to speak to someone behind him a man hidden by the ranks of guardsmen its him lord whandall placehold returned he turned back looked at the caravan and turned again come back rich he has peacevoice waterman whandall said master peacevoice waterman to you sir there was some amusement and no malice in the voice not surprised you remember me sir is that lord samorty in command then no sir lord samorty is dead these five years sir somehow he was surprised but lords did die they only seemed to live forever may we pass we come to trade whandall said up to the commander sir with patience whandall said then lets talk to the commander watermans face didnt change he turned and shouted whandall placehold wishes to speak with the commander lord the hidden lord said something in a low voice lord says a quarter hour master peacevoice a guardsman shouted quarter hour sir waterman said he returned to a position of rigid attention when it was clear he wasnt going to say or do anything else whandall went back to the wagons morth was grinning interesting why whandall demanded look morth pointed a small cart drawn by one of the big horses the lords used had pulled up behind the ranks of guards three workers had taken a small tent from the wagon and were busily setting it up another set a charcoal burner down it was clear from the way he handled it that it held a live fire and sure enough he put a tea kettle on top of it another worker brought a table then two chairs went away for a while then returned with a third chair the kinless workers were dressed all in yellow and black shirts whandall remembered samortys gardeners but those werent the same colors morth frowned quintana he said say those are quintanas colors morth said and it appears from his age that thats lord quintana himself he must be seventy years old now and no magic to help and he came himself whandall they are certainly taking you seriously is this good morth shrugged a corporal came up to them whandall feathersnake lord chief witness quintana requests your company at tea he said formally and asks that you permit the sage morth of atlantis to accompany you morths grin turned sour but he said we will be delighted come whandall it was whandalls turn to grin a servant stood behind quintana and held his chair as quintana stood whandall feathersnake i am delighted to meet you morth of atlantis it is good to see you again you look younger than the last time we met indeed i am younger lord quintana quintana smiled wryly i dont suppose you can sell me anything that will do the same for me not so long as you insist on living in that blighted area you call the lordshills morth said ah but elsewhere nowhere short of the distant mountains morth said ive found a wonderful place half a hundred days walk west by north quintana nodded hardly surprising please be seated wagonmaster sage i can offer you tea weak hemp tea with a smoky flavor of tar morth sipped and made appreciative noises whandall smiled the lord wasnt trying to drug him may i be blunt quintana said wagonmaster what are your intentions we bring trade goods whandall said some fit for lords if we have reason we will send in more wagons with more goods i had hoped to make camp at lords town there is no suitable accommodation for all of you there quintana said we can offer lodging for you and the sage in lords town but there is no place for all of you and i am certain you would prefer to remain together oh yes get separated here so welcome back to teps town quintana said morth chuckled you are amused sage mildly so morth said and curious as to why the chief witness would come personally to greet a trader quintanas expression didnt change we are not often visited by wealthy caravans even so i would wager this is the first one you have met it is also the first i have seen as you must know and i grow old i grow bored quintana said he stood abruptly i grow frail master peacevoice waterman will escort you to a suitable camping ground perhaps i may visit you there welcome to teps town whandall invited waterman to ride on the wagon with him dont mind if i do sir waterman said not getting any younger beaten up any boys lately whandall asked conversationally a few waterman said comes with the job didnt fancy youd have forgotten sir truth is whandall said that was nicely judged here he pulled the sleeve from his left arm i cant forget no but i can still pick things up i wonder if youve seen the teller tras preetror lately not for ten years he doesnt come to lords town of course but i keep track why whandall told the tale as they drove so ive been on both sides of that fence master peacevoice they drove in silence for a few minutes there was something lord quintana wasnt saying whandall said yes sir there was waterman said readily enough youre still not welcome in lordshills butlord samortys dead oh yes watermanquintanathe lords were keeping a promise made to a dead man because he was dead the order could never be changed lords were strange whandall had not guessed how strange them toronexti waterman said huh what about them waterman said nothing why had he brought up the subject at all do you work for the toronexti whandall prompted waterman sucked air through his teeth an ugly sound why ask that not to offend the toronexti had to send you a runner whandall said he must have waited just long enough to seehe brushed his tattooed cheekme and then run like the wind and you came with lord quintana and most of your army not most waterman said some as to the toronexti what you think you know about them is likely wrong please do go on we like to trade stories and its my turn waterman grinned most lordkin think theyre just another band a few think they work for the lords dont they used to waterman said used to collect taxes and keep some of course they kept the kinless from running away looked after trade stuff for the lords but my fathers father told me trade stopped coming through the woods and then there were more toronexti and they kept more of what they took waterman spat over the side he said gathered i guess maybe they still keep to some of their tasks some goods get through from the forest they did send a runner to tell us about your wagons but mostly they work for themselves now we never knew where they lived how they lived what they did with all that wealth who their neighbors were if they were lordkin wheres their turf if theyre kinless are they kinless i know how they started the master peacevoice said our forebears burned their way through the forest and took teps town you know that but lords and lordkin didnt want to live together when things had settled down there were im told exactly sixty boys and girls who had a lord for a lather and a lordkin for a mother never the other way around no silence could often be the essence of tact waterman said a place had to be found for them they were set to guard the way through the forest kinless must not escape you see they might bring allies but the tax men lived on site and built their homes along the deerpiss it was their duty no homes there now whandall remembered just that guardhouse and the barrier that big center section is stone must have been built by kinless the wings are crude work more recent they didnt become kinless waterman said nothing whandall asked what do you wonder when you wonder about the toronexti theyd passed the edge of town and were moving through flower market territory the streets looked empty until whandalls mind adjusted then here was the snapdragon sign crudely painted on a crumbling wall motion along a roof a clumsy lurker a whole line of them motion in window slits an audience was watching the parade waterman hadnt answered whandall asked why tell me waterman stared straight ahead they rolled along in a silence that might have been companionable whandall waited some secrets must be hidden but some may be traded the caravan skirted the edge of serpents walk along the road between serpents walk and flower market whandall remembered the road lordkin came out of houses to stare at them no one was going to try gathering from wagons escorted by marching lordsmen over there was an empty lot a large square building must have covered that and another behind it now both gone ahead was a ruined wall remains of a burned out building and ahead of that a field once paved with cobblestones grass and mustard stalks grew among the stones all the walls around the field were ruins buildings long burned out a fountain stood in the center water trickled from it but this is peacegiven square whandall shouted waterman nodded his expression unreadable amused wry whandall couldnt tell that is it sir its where lord quintana said you was to make camp good roads from here room to set up a market not much water but more than most places he thought it would be a good place whandall stared at the ruins all right he has a point this will do master peacevoice it strikes me that you could have told me about this where were to set up our market and why and what happened here in the twentytwo years ive been gone but you decided to talk about the toronexti was i supposed to know something i never came anywhere near the deerpiss until until wanshig got involved in making wine theres a question hes waiting for it whandall asked did lord quintana ask you to mention toronexti wouldnt say yes wouldnt say no waterman said what would the lords do if the toronexti just disappeared one day find someone to take their place waterman said someone more reasonable and a lot fewer i think me and ten men could do their job sons nephews theres a notion chapter whandall raised his hand above his head and brought his arm around in a wide circle circle the wagons but with only four they made a square there were wagonssmall flatbeds with no roofs in the kinless styleat the far end of the square waterman went over to them whandall was just unhitching the bison when waterman returned leading a young man he was shaven clean no tattoos and no more than twenty perhaps less it was difficult to tell his age because of his clothing he wore a dark robe and a closefitting cap that came down over his forehead and was low enough to cover his ears witness clerk sandry waterman said i present you to wagonmaster whandall feathersnake wagonmaster clerk sandry is here to assist you any questions you may have any requests hell help you thank you master peacevoice as waterman went back to his troops whandall inspected the younger man he was taller than whandall remembered any witness clerk as being and of course whandall had been younger and shorter then most of his body was hidden by the loose robe but where his arms showed they were more muscular than any clerks his cap wasnt new but it didnt fit him very well whandalls expression didnt change welcome clerk sandry just sandry will do sir very well i presume you can read yes sir i can read and calculate good find us a place to corral the bison then find where we can buy fodder for them bison eat a lot clerk sundry more than you would expect well want a full wagonload of hay or straw as you wish sir sandry said he inspected the trickle of water from the fountain might i also suggest a water wagon sir what will that cost us ill find out sir but not so much if its river water only for animals of course whandall remembered the stinking water of the rivers in teps town hed been glad enough of it at one time now he was used to better and the memory of that water choked him the fountain water wasnt good but it had to be better than river water please arrange it yes sir green stone came up to watch sandry walking across the square whandall explained who do you think he is father green stone asked whandall shook his head i never knew that much about the lords and witnesses and their clerks he may be just what he says he is but i doubt it remember that he can read dont leave anything around he shouldnt see i never do stone said of course you dont handsome boy burning tower said from behind him too old for you blazes green stone said well maybe burning tower said and maybe not dont you two have work to do whandall placehold feathersnake asked at the far end of the square kinless workmen set up a camp for waterman and his lordsmen guards one of the kinless a boy about fifteen came over to whandall he took off his cap and shuffled from one foot to the other whandall stared in confusion then embarrassing memories returned a kinless who wanted to speak to a lordkin but was afraid talk to me master peacevoice waterman said i was to ask if you need workers to help setting up camp no thank you were used to doing it ourselves the kinless boy watched as whandalls people unloaded wagon boxes he seemed astonished of course there was green stone with a lordkins ears carrying a box with one of the miller boys the millers all looked kinless except for those who looked like bison tribesmen and mother quail daughter to a bison man and the younger miller girl an exotic mix whose beauty edged the supernatural burning tower looked like a slim young lordkin girl and they all worked together firewood whandall said well pay for firewood the kinless boy nodded we can get you some he seemed hesitant spit it out lad whandall said the boy flinched come onwhat is it my name is adz weaver weaver ah youll be kin to my wife then its true you married willow ropewalker more than twenty years now whandall said stone he called green stone is our second son stone this is adz weaver hell be some kind of cousin stone held up his hand in greeting whandall nodded approval it was a hemp road gesture not used in teps town but then in teps town there wasnt any gesture a lordkin would use to greet a kinless adz weaver glanced around obviously aware that a knot of lordkin were watching from the serpents walk side of peacegiven square youre welcome here whandall said but it might be best if you come back after we have the walls up no sense in gathering lordkins attention and we do need firewood yes sir weaver said whandall smiled to himself adz weaver had used the tone that kinless used when addressing an older relative not the more obsequious falling tone used to address lordkin progress well before the lordsmen guards camp was up the wagon boxes had been offloaded carpets unrolled awnings erected and the bison corralled in a nearby vacant lot sandry appeared with kinless driving a wagonload of hay and another wagon with a water tank whandall recognized one of the fire prevention wagons kinless used more kinless brought firewood when stone offered a kinless the smallest fleck of gold they had for a heap of wood it was obvious that theyd paid far too much whandall negotiated for shells and was pleased they bought several bags of shells too many to count for one gold nugget trading would be good here whandalls travel nest was divided into two rooms the inner was more ornate than most as befitted a wealthy merchant prince willow worried about that so the outer sides of whandalls wagon boxes were scarred and unfinished and the outer room was plain in the inner room the wood was polished rubbed with the shells of laq beetles until it shone two mirrors hung so that they faced each other making a magical display the children never tired of wool for his carpets came from highland sheep sheared alter a hard winter and his cushions were tilled with wool and down outside was poverty but inside the nest everything said i can afford to ignore your inadequate offer dinner was locally bought chicken stewed with local vegetables between what the toronexti took and what theyd sold here there wasnt any more bison jerky or fruit whandall had just filled his bowl for a second helping when stone came into the nest theres an old man wants to see you you should be specific whandall said kinless lordkin lordsman witness lord even not just man i cant tell stone said patiently he has a knife lordkin whandall said old a lot older than you father no teeth not much hair ill come out old described him the lordkin still stood erect and proud and wore his big lordkin knife defiantly but whandall thought hed better have sons with him if he wanted to walk far in teps town whandall held out his hand lordkin to lordkin they slapped palms the old mans eyes twinkled dont know me do you whandall whandall frowned know anything about wine alferth thats me come in have some tea whandall said he led him into the outer nest no point in giving too much away alferth looked around and laughed tarnisos said you took a kinless wagon and i heard you married a kinless now you live like one he grinned you must be rich i am whandall admitted how is tarnisos dead most everyone you knew is dead whandall lordkin killed each other even men who lived here forgot something ive wondered about all these years alferth said tarnisos said you really were possessed by yanginatep burned a torch right out of his hand was he lying no i did that whandall tried to remember that time alferth and the others beating a kinless manwillows fatherinto something unidentifiable the rage that filled his mind and flowed through his fingers was gone i burned our way through the forest i always hoped it was true alferth said never happened to me i mocked yanginatep pretended to be possessed when i wasnt he shrugged too old now i think why would yanginatep be interested in an old man he looks twenty years older than me whandall thought but it cant be more than five hungry whandall asked nearly always alferth admitted whandall clapped his hands stone please ask burning tower to bring dinner for my friend alferth this is my son green stone alferth stared son whandall thought i said son and alferth isnt kin alferth came to himself and nodded greeting hed been studying green stones ears of course he would well the lordkin could just damned well get used to it burning tower brought in a pot of stew alferth took a carved wooden cup from his belt and held it out she filled it not bothering to hide her curiosity about this strange man who sat as a friend in her fathers nest things have not been good whandall asked not good not since the year we had two burnings in one year yeah nine years ago now first burning that was fun but the second was bad we burned things we needed thats when peacegiven square went with half the city how did it start alferth shrugged i never did know whandall because i never really believed in yanginatep but that time that second burning everyone was possessed they ran around pointing and fires roared up and we all went damn near mad gathering i went right into a fire and came out with an armload of burning bath towels took me half a year healing from the burns ill never have a beard again this side pelzed smelled roasting meat and ran into a burning butcher shop and staggered out hugging a side of ox his heart quit lord pelzed is dead then whandall wasnt much surprised surehey whandall your brother is lord of serpents walk now shastern alferths face wrinkled shastern oh him naw hes been dead what fifteen years no the old one lord wanshig hes lord of serpents walk now matter of fact thats why im herebe sure its really you and see how the land lies whandall thought tell my brothertell lord wanshig im delighted and i would like to see him again here or anywhere hed like alferths face twisted into a grin thought you would be he looked around the plain boxes he leaned close and dropped his voice i could help you find a better place to feed him whandall stood let me try first he said he pushed aside a tall mans height of boxes that turned out to be nailed together and led alferth into the inner nest yanginateps eyes you do live fancy he said so those stories are all trueyou went off and got rich theres a lot more whandall said he gestured eastward out there i can bring more in except i cant hmm toronexti they took a lot of what we brought theyll take more going out testing whandall said id kill them all if i could alferth had felt that way once thought of it myself alferth said i hired toronexti to guard lord quintanas grapes and move his wine that he put in my charge they let some lordkin gather one of our wagons just what they was supposed to stop and two of them dead and the rest screaming at me that was you and freethspat wasnt it whandall sure and we all took our lumps quintana and the toronexti and me and let it go but you know strong as they were supposed to be they shouldnt let go so easily i should have known but i kept my toronexti guards and paid them high out of what i was getting and when that wave of gatherers came out of teps town they ran they let that mob into the vineyards and the vats some of em were in the mob quintana had a price on my head for a year and he never spoke to me again sure id like to kill the toronexti but you cant fight lords lords protect toronexti which toronexti all whandall everyone knows that they collect for the lords well maybe you dont know it alferth conceded but everyone who ever tried to make anything of himself knows it if you nose around their territory the lords take a big interest in you toronexti have a territory is this something everyone knows too we only knew alferth held out his empty cup whandall clapped and waited for burning tower to fill the cup again he said we only knew about the deerpiss and the gatehouse we never knew where they lived alferth said they dont talk but i knew they had a territory they must they hide their faces the leathers they always wear that must hide a band mark there had to be a way to hurt them what else could i think about while i hid i asked around and i thought then the search got hotter and i had to stop looking i had to leave serpents walk i live on the beach at sea cliffs and nobody knows anything there that sounds but before they shut me down i learned some foot of granite knob thats theirs them alferth no the wolverines dont live near the deerpiss id bet my patch of dry sand on it against the rest of this stew not a heavy bet whandall thought back hed never been on wolverine turf children were told to avoid it it was over toward the forest backed up against a chaparralcovered granite hill not isolated but easily defended near two hours walk from the deerpiss no one ever went there uninvited and there werent many invitations you saw wolverines raiding but rarely and in big packs funny nobody ever wondered nobody but a merchant would ever wonder how bands that big could gather enough to share like they did it just to fight just for practice wolverine territory youre pretty near guessing whandall said whandall do you remember those crazies who could read at your party they got too much of your powder got into a graveyard heads full of ghosts pelzed traded them to the wolverines for a wagonload of oranges that used to itch at me how did he get anyone to take them at all a slow grin four teeth in it alferth asked why would wolverines want readers too crazy to remember secrets forigaft right the brothers forigaft egon was the youngest sold to the wolverines and now clerk to the toronexti i owe you alferth have an orange show your belly some variety yeah does my brother live in pelzeds old house whandall asked he let pelzeds women keep it alferth said lord wanshig lives in that big stone place you come from i think his lady wess didnt want to move wess whandall felt a twinge in his loins wess was alive shed be the first lady of the placehold alferth wouldnt know about that they talked until well after dark when alferth left whandall noticed that four young lordkin were waiting under a torch he merged with them they doused the torch and all merged into the shadows then one of the shadows became lurk lurk glided in almost supernatural silence but slowly sideways and twisted over one arm was swollen into a red pillow streaked with purple whandall knew those marks he didnt touch them he set him down on a burlap sheet and sent for morth morth looked ancient worse than alferth he came leaning heavily on sundrys arm the wizard examined nothing was seen without touching the boy he muttered words in a language none of them knew they watched fearing to interrupt morth snarled i sold ointments for plant poisons for near thirty years now ill have to make more on the spot clerk sandry i need any breed of belladonna tomato bell pepper potato chilis sandry was slow to react as if he werent used to taking orders then at once sage they could hear him speaking rapidly to someone outside morth moved them out of the nest under the awning outside he tended a firepot set water to boiling added chipped dried roots and some leaves from the forest soaked a clean shirt wash yourself if you can stay awake what were you doing in the chaparral boy lurk looked to whandall speak in front of the wizard whandall said go ahead whandall set me to watch the tax men lurks voice was slurred a wagon came out of those low woods a tiny wagon with a tiny pony driving it i tried to follow it home they went straight into the woods there was just a trace of path i know that wagon was wider than i am and it got through but it wasnt trying to hide too he scrubbed his arm tenderly when my arm swelled up i was deep in the woods and getting dizzy here something scratched me here too before i could get out three puffy parallel lines along his hip i swear it reached out wash that too idiot the wizard snarled get your clothes off well have to bury them whandall said they reach you remember what i told you going through the forest its the same stuff it wants to kill you you were smart not to go in very far lucky too lurk said but i lost them he sounded disgusted sandry was back with a double handful of bell peppers morth went to work they were carrying a big pile of stuff that stack morth was looking at in their gatehouse lurk said they loaded it in that wagon and maybe ten of them went with it like it was the most valuable thing they had what did they do with it whandall asked dont know i told you got away lurks voice was fading fast what do you think they were doing clerk sandry whandall asked sundrys face was a mask to match whandalls trading face no idea sir none at all i see whandall turned back to lurk and said softly maybe i found them at the other end lurk looked less puzzled than dizzy but whandall was making maps in his head do it on parchment later check it out no one had ever walked it really but it must be near two hours from alferths grape fields down the deerpiss and across to wolverine turf by the streets those streets curved around a knob of hill covered with chaparral thickening to dwarf forest but as the crow flies how could he have seen staxirs armor and kreeg millers leathers and never made the connection they go into the woods kinless woodsmen can do that and so can i the toronexti have to to move what they take which way did they go whandall asked show me on a map he called for lamps and parchment while they waited morth wrapped pastecovered cloths around puffy red blotches on nothing was seens arm and lower belly and drink this lurk sipped he protested man thats coffee sorry if i had honey oh just drink it i will send for honey sandry said and we were speaking condigeo which sandry hasnt admitted knowing whandall thought thank you with stone and morth and sandry at his elbows whandall drew maps of teps town whandall gave his attention to wolverine turf and the deerpiss and the streets that curved around a peninsula of forest through the forest was much shorter but slower too if a man didnt want to die horribly but morth was concentrating his efforts from the black pit west toward the sea sketching in detail on a path that evaded the lordshills otherwise following the lowlands when sandry refused to help them work on lords town morth protested these have to be accurate ill need them later and at least twenty of your lordkin whandall i tire of your hints maps wont help whandall said morth no lordkin knows maps he turned to the kinless boy huddled at the outer edge of the band adz weaver do you understand maps no sir i never saw anything like that the young kinless said but ive been watching i think i have the idea youre making a picture of where we are whandall was startled yes come here help us mark this they watched adz draw detail into kinless territory and it was all filling in nicely if he can learn that quickly so can others morth said whandall nodded it kinless could learn lordkin could learn lordkin were smarter than kinless he said nothing was seen lurk stood with difficulty he leaned on his arms above the map is this the big stone gatehouse that blocks the way to the forest they went along here up the deerpiss about here they went off the road and uphill and i last saw them here bush getting thick whandall grinned good good i lost them up and across whandalls fingertip ran through the mapped forest to the suburb of granite knob ill go see wait for dawn no lurk said stone would have stopped him but whandall shook his head it would be a matter of pride with lurk let him go not into the forest understand i only want to know where they come out lurk nodded then faded they worked on maps all night chapter master peacevoice waterman and two men came to whandalls wagon when the sun was an hour high message sir waterman said lady shanda wishes to see you here at the sixth hour today sir shanda who is lady shanda master peacevoice watermans expression changed only slightly first lady of lords town sir shes married to quintana whandall asked waterman was shocked no sir she is married to lord quintanas nephew and lord quintana being a widower she is the official hostess for his household sir his voice held reproach as if whandall should know better you like her dont you master peacevoice everybody likes lady shanda sir that right corporal driver yes master peacevoice interesting sixth hour five hours from now she must be partway here already please send word to lady shanda that we will be delighted to have her join us at the sixth hour whandall said a conventional phrase but he found that he meant it shanda they set up the market before noon a tightrope high the way burning tower liked it hammer miller and a kinless boy stood under to catch neither lordkin nor lord would do that in teps town and for the moment it was better if whandall feathersnake kept his dignity even if he didnt like it nothing went wrong burning towers act was flawless and clerk sandry stood mouth open watching her in fascination as she wheeled and spiraled hallway down the pole then deftly climbed feet on the pole back up it again smitten whandall heard green stone say behind him with my sister and well he might whandall said softly with blazes but all right shes good on that rope that wasnt the entire reason i had in mind whandall said it was only after burning tower finished her act and went to the changing tent that sandry went to negotiate for another wagonload of hay and another of water for the bison as whandall had guessed no one in teps town would have dreamed that animals could eat so much or make so much waste for the kinless to clean up shanda arrived in a small wagon drawn by four lords horses a teenage girl rode with her two chariots one in front and one behind clattered along with her each chariot held an armored man if they were trying to convince him that shanda was important they succeeded he knew she was younger than he was but she looked whandalls age he would not have recognized her the selfassurance he remembered was there but the little girl had become regal desirable attractive rather than beautiful but extremely so she wore a short skirt of thin wool belt with ornate silver buckle a brooch with blue and amber stones her hair was coiled atop her head and although she must have been traveling all day in a wagon she looked cool and fresh the girl with shanda carried a large pine cone shanda smiled faintly whats it like outside she asked it took whandall a moment to remember dont they let you go outside yet he asked she laughed you do remember she pointed to the pine cone and keep your promises too is that really the same one no of course not she said this is my daughter roni roni greet whandall placehold feathersnake merchant prince and a very old friend of your mothers whandall bowed and this is green stone my son and burning tower my daughter i think the girls will be about the same age will you come in lady shanda we have tea he led her into the inner nest shanda marveled you have done well two mirrors and id love to know the secret of how you get wood to shine like that she stared admiringly at the carpets you have dune well indeed whandall feathersnake thank you lady and have things been well for you not as well as we would like shanda said serious for a moment before her smile returned but well enough did you ever finish the new aqueduct her smile faded again not yet we keep hoping peacegiven square whandall said i was shocked she nodded waited until burning tower poured tea sipped and nodded again thank you whandall it shocked us all that second burning what happened lord chanthor always hoped to buy dragon bones shanda said i remember we were hiding on shandas balcony whandall said to his son green stone and burning tower knew the story but roni looked at her mother some captain sold chanthor rocks in a fancy box he had the man killed yes and another promised but couldnt deliver but he didnt take any money chanthor kept trying one day it came dragon bones in an iron box terribly terribly expensive we really couldnt afford them but well we planned to do so much for the people shanda said make rain in just the right places to clear out the waterways wash all the filth out to sea repair buildings heal the sick finish the aqueduct it would have been worth what we paid she was talking as much to green stone as to whandall maybe it was the ears green stone could absolve her speaking for the kinless forgive her for the crushing weight of taxes to buy this disaster resalet had opened a cold iron box back there at that building the witnesses had an office shanda pointed through the doorway to where no building stood dark ground charred lord chanthor brought the box there to be registered then they set up by the fountain for the ceremony she waved at the fountain blackened and split by heat and near waterless with our wizard we tried to find morth of atlantis hed gone like smoke in a burning years later we were told he left with you whandall so we hired the wizard from the ship that brought the dragon bones and on the fountain he opened it she fell silent and the last thing his eyes ever saw she stared yanginatep took the magic whandall prompted shandas daughter roni jumped yes she said hes right isnt he mother we were home waiting mother was so excited all the good we could do and she was watching for dark storm clouds for rain and suddenly black smoke was pouring up everywhere burning roni said wed just had a burning it was horrible whandall shanda whispered they burned so much the square the new ropewalk wed paid so much to build after we lost the ropewalker family to you they told me you took the ropewalkers out of teps town i dont think i ever quite forgave you for that i didnt know who they were when we started through the forest whandall said or what ropewalkers do but shanda id have freed those children anyway what yes yes of course shanda said and blushed violently whandall i almost went outside my stepfather thought of marrying me to a condigeo merchant prince and id have lived in condigeo but he didntmaybe the man lost his nerveand then i met quyuma her voice and expression changed and for a moment whandall envied quyuma green stone asked yanginatep took the dragon bone manna to himself like with new gold and came violently awake said his father and possessed whoever he could and the city has never been the same roni said he thought really he remembered better than that shanda brightened but now youre here you can help how whandall asked trade we can use more trade shanda said its hard for wagons to compete with the sea captains whandall said roni started to say something looked to her mother and kept silence whandall let the silence stretch on it was painful but he was whandall feathersnake and his son was watching better to win the bargain and then be generous than to let anyone think he could be cozened there arent so many ships now shanda said trying to keep it light she sipped weak hemp tea they came for the rope of course and the words were escaping slipping free it was all that brought them father explained it to me when the ropewalk disappeared we had to import another system and that evil captain screwed us against a wallsorry sorry but he took every coin we could find and then the ropewalk was gone in the two burnings ships still come for tar but now the harbor is silting up she said its hard to get in and worse we dont have as much to trade as we used to theres only the little ropewalk now so theres not much rope for the ships tar whandall said tar is always valuable and we have lots yes shanda said but i may as well he honest they found tar somewhere south of here some lagoon between here and condigeo its hard to get to but if we charge what we need the ships will go there instead but youll help wont you why should he green stone demanded whandall gestured this was not the time to play roles in the game of negotiation was it its his home shanda said simply no lady green stone said not anymore whandall feathersnake lives in the new castle at roads end everyone along the hemp road knows that burning tower looked admiringly at her brother and its all true but this was my home whandall thought good or bad it was my home ill do what i can whandall said well look to see whats plentiful here and valuable on the hemp road there must be something and however easy or hard these new tar fields are to get to by ship this place is easiest for me decide whats your price for tar itll tell me whether i come back a pony nickered outside whandalls expression didnt change as he thought how valuable a bonehead pony grown into a onehorn stallion would be he said ponies maybe there are places along the hemp road that might buy a pony there must be other such things magical items and animals stunted by yanginatep well look but theres a problem whandall said the toronexti make it very difficult for traders weve spoken to them about that shanda said but im afraid they go their own way much as the lordkin do and they have a charter scrapedoff skins whandall asked covered with black marks i never saw it shanda said writings yes witnessed by lords in every generation granting them privileges promises made long ago by dead men she shrugged still promises written and witnessed written and witnessed summon them up and ask but this is teps town if they lost that charter her eyes twinkled just a touch like the young girl hed known deviling her governess no one else saw it theyd never do that it would be likelike it never was wouldnt it how is miss batty whandall asked suddenly she married a senior guard shanda said but i didnt know for years samorty dismissed her alter we she glanced at her daughter then said it anyway spent the night in the forest they keep a shop in lords town roni said her daughter is learning to be a governess for my children after im married roni was very serious and serana roni smiled shes chief cook which means she doesnt do any work and orders everyone around even me shanda said good tell her i remember her puddings wait here he found it tucked under an owl tribe basin rosemary in a little parchment bag tell her to crush this and rub some on red meat before roasting bison or goat or terror bird and ill send her some spices with the next caravan i send in here oh good you will be back roni asked if this works out shanda i will need some help chariots ill need at least twothree would be betterwith drivers lords horses not ponies if i send my clerks around to look for trade goods i want to know they can outrun gatherers and because hed seen morth mapping out a path a daywalk long ill send for drivers shanda said the kinless hire out but it will be better if your people are with a lordsman fewer problemsi know roni your cousin sandry and his friends do you think theyd like to do this sandry whandall asked we know a sandry green stone said master peacevoice waterman brought him to assist us said he was a clerk shanda smiled thinly i hope youre not angry whandall grinned id guessed he was more than a clerk he said what of the others will they be drivers sandry will roni said im not sure about all the others well send several shanda said whandall can choose those he likes best ill have them here in the morning and ill speak to master peacevoice waterman about deceptions and what will you say to him be more clever next time thank you now who sells me tar us shanda said the black pit belongs to the lords a kinless family takes care of that for us roni see to that please find out how many jars whandall will want and arrange for them to be filled and sealed and brought here its time you learned some of that aspect of city management i think its a mans job mother of course it is hut if women dont understand these things how can we make sure the men do them right she grinned at whandall the old shanda again for an instant im sure our merchant prince understands she said and if i dont willow will explain my wife he said in case shed missed it earlier both of us married with children right right he was ready for bed when morth came in i walked up observation hill he said i used to go there a lot those ruins at the top that was an old kinless fort i can see the ocean from there way off i couldnt see anything but with my talisman i perceived the elemental talisman another doll yes it wont last long whandall the elemental perceived me i should go out to look for myself sea cliffs take a fast chariot ill have chariots tomorrow chapter two hours after daybreak seven chariots clattered into peacegiven square and drew up in a line in front of the lordsman camp an earnest young driver in lordsman armor stood beside each one one was sandry no longer wearing a clerks cap the horses were big grays matched pairs at each chariot they were well groomed and well fed the chariots would hold two adults in each chariot was a leather sheath holding a long thrusting spear and two shorter throwing spears ready to hand between driver and passenger they were smaller than whandall remembered hed imagined lords chariots big enough to hold half a dozen men they looked that big coming at you but of course that was silly not even the big lords horses could pull such a load master peacevoice waterman walked up and down the line examining each horse and driver he muttered something and one of the drivers flicked dust off his gleaming armor another tightened the harness of his horse when waterman was satisfied he strode briskly to whandalls tent chariots and drivers waiting inspection sir morth and whandall crossed the square to the waiting line whandall moved closer to waterman im not used to chariots he confided not surprised at that waterman said trick is to spread your feet out brace one against the sidework theres a brace built into the floor to wedge your other foot against bend your knees so theres some spring in them otherwise youll bounce right out when you hit a bump chariots arc last but they tire the horses last too are these horses tired morth asked not too bad sir they led these in at first light no load the horses that pulled the chariots here from lords town are resting up theyll all be fresh come tomorrow morning good whos the best driver for what purpose sir morth considered finding the right questions wasnt easy here speed distance whandall said we might have to cross most of the city maybe fighting best fighting driver would be young heroul there whandall regarded the charioteer young clear eyed armor polished he stood impatiently is he reliable depends on what for waterman said hell take orders just fine and hes got the fastest horses in the corps who for just speed and distance and a passenger who cant fight thats not heroul he likes to win waterman said you can depend on young sandry there lord samortys grandson he is and best officer cadet in the corps lord rabblies son waterman looked at him oddly reckon they called lord rabilard something like that when he was a lad yes sir thats his father and the lords still talk about family to strangers brag even not like lordkin like us hell be steady then id trust him waterman said you neednt tell him i said that cadets head doesnt need more swelling thanks you wont need to introduce us reckon i wont sir waterman said morth you take sandry then no i want speed morth said you said that one is fastest yes sir ill take heroul and put some handhold lashings in that chariot if you dont know how i do i had one of these in atlantis whandall stood uncertainly in sandrys chariot it was hard enough keeping his footing on streets the potholes rattled him around inside this bucket on wheels it would be a lot harder going across country if sandry noticed whandall having difficulty keeping his footing he didnt say anything about it can you carry an old man in one of these whandall asked sundry nodded he needed all his attention to avoid a young lordkin who had darted into the street then he answered yes wagon master we can strap a chair where youre standing strap a man into the chair but youre doing fine for a beginner he didnt add not me whandall said morth he didnt seem that old he can get older fast oh aunt shanda says shes known you a long time sandry said yes more than thirty years he looked at sandry and made a decision did you ever know of a servant girl named dreamlotus kinless from the ropewalk area no but i can ask sandry said is it important not very id just like to know turn right just ahead there the streets were in worse repair and there were more burned buildings than whandall remembered now left ahead lay the serpents walk meetinghouse curse it had a roof now and a new fence oversize cactus plants grew against the fence two kinless were raking the yard although it didnt appear to need raking neat whandall thought wanshig always was neat after he came back from the sea the placehold looked neat too in whandalls time there was a halfruined house down the block that was gone its lot planted with what looked like cabbages tended by kinless and a small cottage stood behind the cabbage patch whandall pointed to the front door of the placehold stop just there and wait for me you wont be allowed inside sandry nodded he looked glad of the armor he wore sure youll be welcome no whandall said whats the best way out of here sandry asked whandall chuckled straight ahead left at the end of the block and stay in the middle of the street you know it boys lounged at the doorway that hadnt changed tell lord wanshig that whandall wishes to speak with him he lowered his voice so that sandry wouldnt be able to hear whandall placehold two of the boys ran inside another stayed in the door staring at whandalls tattoo the doorway stood invitingly open whandall grinned to himself at least one probably several armed lordkin adults would be in there one behind the door waiting for anyone to come in uninvited a girl about fifteen came to the door she wore a bright dress too fancy for housework be welcome whandall she said loud enough that everyone near would hear thank you im firegift uncle whandall my mother is wess and calling me uncle says im accepted as one of the men of the placehold not that shes wanshig s daughter whandall thought she could be but she wont claim that just her mother the lordkin ways were coming back to him but as a halfremembered dream lord wanshig is waiting upstairs wanshig sat at one end of the big meeting hall it seemed full of people none whandall could recognize except wess she stood in the doorway of the corner room the room that was his with her for a while when whandall placehold was the eldest man in the placehold a lifetime ago she was still pretty not as pretty as willow but to whandall no woman ever had been but wess was a fine woman still firegift went to stand by her mother they looked more alike side by side than they had when they were apart hail brother wanshig said lord wanshig wanshig laughed hard then he got up and came to whandall slapped hands hugged him in a wiry embrace that showed wanshig hadnt lost his strength neither had whandall and they stood half embracing and half testing for a minute been a long time wanshig said that it has youve come up in the world wanshig looked at the ornate knife whandall wore so have you thats nothing whandall said he took off the knife and sheath revealing a plainer and more functional blade underneath a present whandall said and held out the ornately decorated knife among others im rich brother thats nice i can make the placehold rich whandall said ill need help doing it actually ill need placehold and serpents walk together after lunch youll tell me wanshig said he gestured dismissing the men and women who had crowded around youll all meet whandall later he said give me time to talk with my brother brother we had the same mother not necessarily the same father and in our case certainly not the same lordkin the others went away or settled in corners of the big room well eat in here wanshig said he led whandall into the big corner room a table had been set up and firegift was bringing food and tea youll remember wess shes my lady now first lady of the placehold wanshig said whandall didnt say anything what ah thats right youll remember elriss wanshig said and mother wanshig nodded dead brother dead together with shastern fifteen years ago sixteen wess said firegift is fifteen sixteen years ago the burning started by tarnisos tarnisos killed our family no he started the burning it was a mothers day the women had gone to peacegiven square the lords still gave mothers day presents there you remember yes shastern went with them they had collected the gifts were coming back when the burning started wanshig shook his head we went looking for them found them dead two bull fizzles dead with them everything they had was gathered of course later pelzed and freethspat went looking for pizzles to settle the score but the fizzles claimed their people were killed helping shastern could have been even could have been who did they say whandall demanded wanshigs expression was bleak you think youll get even now after sixteen years when you werent here little brother you think i havent tried sorry of course you did wanshig nodded grimly what happened to freethspat he tried too mother was his woman he was really close to her closer than i was to elriss by then i think he went looking one day never came back and wanshig became eldest in the placehold wess said and didnt say that firegift was born a few months later but that was clear enough so how can we help you little brother wanshig asked two ways if you can work with me whandall said its possible wanshig admitted what two ways first burn out the wolverines thats hard little brother hard you know who they are i hope i do ive got no quarrel with the wolverines but alferth says theyre the toronexti i have reasons to think hes right so do i wanshig said and the toronexti work for the lords he looked thoughtful and you you have u chariot and a lordsman driver have the lords told you can burn out the toronexti pretty close whandall said they wont help but if it happens theyll be happy enough to take credit there wont be a blood war if theres a blood price i can give it back to you i need to think on this whats your other task morth of atlantis needs help well explain later but it needs reliable people he needs a truce with sea cliffs at least to take a chariot there and wanshig i can use some help outside out of teps town if theres anyone who wants to go wanshig stared at him out theres a whole world out there twenty years ago id have come with you he said not now and i need all the men i have in placehold and in serpents walk these are hard times little brother we like it here wess said possessively but i have a son shastern she nodded at whandalls look named for your younger brother hes a wild boy i dont think hell live long here take him with you how old ten wess said he can come but wess if he comes with us he wont be a lordkin anymore hell learn different ways i doubt he can ever come back you did wess said whandall there are some whod like adventure wanshig said he sighed and im still lordkin and theyll never let me go to sea again unless you own ships little brother thats not the route i took let me show you big brother did you learn maps while you were sailing maps we knew about maps never saw them they were locked up in the captains cabin the idea is to make a picture of where you are and where you want to be and things you see on the way landmarks whandall began drawing on the table teps town as a little black blotch firewoods in dried chili seeds the hemp road in charcoal wess watched the mess being made looked at wanshig and decided not to interfere this is where we went me and a wagon with children hidden like wine wildest battle of my life here my tattoo lights up when i kill out there where theres still magic by first pines hed run out of room i have to draw it smaller so thats how it works may i teach this in the courtyard it would he something to give back whandall said anyone who worked the caravans would have to learn maps eventually who could he take best find out who had the knack best find out big brother do you remember when i tried to teach you about knives wanshig grimaced yes may i try again teach them all tomorrow maps today wanshig looked into his face youre older and smarter im a better teacher line up your best knife fighters watch me watch them this time youll get it you meant it whandall made no answer yes i want to watch that wanshig said well listen to your wizard and ill send a gift to sea cliffs give me a day or so to get the word out whandall of serpents walk is back and is welcome at the placehold your woman too of course shes not here whandall thought of willow coming into a lordkin castle shes outside they returned to peacegiven square to find morth raving hes a madman morth shouted he pointed to heroul who stood grinning on his chariot it looked odd with no horse hitched to it then morth turned jubilant but its there the wave heroul drove me out to sea cliffs the wave stood up and came at us way too low of course hit the cliff hard enough to shake our shoes then this maniac drove us right down into the lowlands heroul are you all right sandry asked the young charioteers grin was wide it was wonderful he burbled the water just humped itself and came right at us real magic nothing like qirintys dancing cups and this madman toyed with it morth said he stayed just ahead of it all the way along dead seal flats it slowed when it started up the ridge heroul said i could see it was slowing and i didnt want to founder the horses so slowed and it came on almost to the top then it slumped and ran back down toward the ocean ran like water i mean not fled you were teasing it maybe a little sir and we still exhausted the horses heroul waved to indicate two chariot horses being groomed by some of watermans men ill get new ones for tomorrow let these rest up a day not for me you wont you maniac morth said whandall grinned younglord heroul can drive me tomorrow he said sundry if you please shepherd this ancient wizard around the city certainly sir morth gave them a sour look that water sprite has chased me half my life and today was as close as it ever came to catching me but it didnt heroul said sir part four heroes and myths chapter at dawn the next morning a half dozen kinless came to peacegiven square and began work on the ruins of an adobe house at one corner whandall remembered the house as belonging to a bull pizzle lordkin or was it flower market but the big lordkin who came with the kinless wore a serpent from left eye to left hand in an hour they had cleared out the front yard and set up a cook fire in another they had set out tables and chairs and hung up a sign painted with a cup and roasted birds leg a tea shop at peacegiven square another sign went up a serpent but this was set at the edge of the lot right at the corner the sign in front of the shop bore a palmetto fan to indicate peace all welcome pelzed had dreamed of taking another side of peacegiven square but he had never dared of course now it wasnt worth as much whandall went over to inspect sandryyounglord sandryfollowed the kinless waitress was in her thirties well dressed elaborately polite yes lords welcome whandall lifted his hand in greeting it was a useful gesture a way to be polite without losing status the big serpents walk lordkin came out of the house he was young and hadnt had the tattoo long lagdret he said youll be whandall welcome he pointed to the back of the house ill be living here until the bakers here get the house next door fitted up lord wanshig says if you need me call he went back into the shop without waiting to be introduced to sandry polite whandall said sundry looked the question he hasnt anything to say to you and lie wont lake up your time he came out here to tell me only because wanshig asked him to his jobnever say job its just what hes agreed to dois it protect this place what he gets out of it is a new house kept up by the kinless he protects whandall smiled thinly probably his first house now he can attract a woman of his own i should learn more about lordkin sandry said whandall smiled our custom it is to swap information and stories ah i never knew much about lords whandall said no more than i could learn watching from a distance sometimes you were closer sandry said what do you want to know there are bandits on the hemp road sometimes enough of them get together to set up a town and collect tolls now all towns collect tolls one way or another but most of them give something back keep the roads up provide dinners drive away gatherers keep a good market square open bandit towns just take when that happens all the wagon trains get together and go burn them out sandry your aunt shanda wants us to bring wagon trade into teps town we all do so tell me about the toronexti sandry looked surprised i distinctly remember lord quintana telling waterman to talk to you about the toronexti maybe he didnt tell me enough they have a charter sandry said promises made over the years some of them were bad promises stupid promises but theyve kept the decrees every one of them and if we try to do anything about them they can produce a promise signed and sealed saying we cant do that lords are big on keeping promises formal written signed and sealed of course did you promise to help them against all outside enemies sandry said not against lordkin no theyd never ask at least they never have and if they did now well it would take three full meetings of all the lords even to consider extending the toronexti charter but it wouldnt happen the charter says they protect us against revolt whandall sipped tea it was good root tea not hemp the shop wanted three shells a cup a high price but prices always went up when the wagon train was in town sandry are you afraid of master peacevoice waterman wouldnt you be well maybe but by that light i should be afraid of greathand the blacksmith whandall said but watermans a lordsman and youre a lord younglord sandry corrected apprentice if you like to think of it that way waterman would take my orders if i were dumb enough to talk back to him then it would get back to my father wagonmaster you tell your blacksmith what to make but you dont tell him how to make it i wouldnt know how and i wouldnt know how to train men or get them to fight whandall said that parts easy its called leadership sandry said and blushed a little getting them to fight together to do things all of them at once not one at a time thats hard like learning knife fighting whandall thought but if you learn one thing at a time you can put it all together he thought about battles theyd had with bandits kettle belly had taught him to get as many men together as you can make them stay together and fight together twenty on three always won and usually with none of the twenty getting hurt and the lords knew all that and the lordkin didnt and so what shall we do today sandry asked ill send you with morth but hold up a breath or two whandall considered you cant tell me how to fight the toronexti he got a confirming nod but what can you tell me about dealing with the wolverines under granite knob sandry smiled i asked about that after last night fights between lordkin are not my concern i wont help you fight them but i can tell you anything you want to know about wolverines and whandall was sure now the toronexti were the wolverines but what good did it do to know that it was known that he intended to take a few people out of serpents walk out of teps town some were willing to help him choose several lordkin tried to extract promises from him take my nephew he doesnt fit in my daughter shes sleeping with the wrong men my son hes murdered someone powerful my brother he keeps getting beaten up whandall didnt promise nobody can force you to buy without actually drawing knife and that happened only once fubgire was one of wanshigs guards in his late twenties brawny and agile whandall retreated from the room where fubgire confronted him into the courtyard and there he turned it into a knife fighting lesson kinless and lordkin came to him driven by distaste for the ways of the burning city he would make an offer to a few of these he set some of the kinless to working on maps yesterday the courtyard had been covered with maps sketched in sawdust today morth and wanshig and a few visitors from other turf were making maps inside lured by the fight with fubgire or by wanshigs wonderful new knife or by rumor and curiosity nearly forty men waited at dawn to be trained in knife fighting by whandall placehold too many by far of course one was fubgire older than most of these but bandaged and determined to learn from his mistakes try him on maps too whandall began to teach more drifted up until there were sixty in the placehold courtyard many felt that they already knew how to fight that no outsider had anything to teach them they spoke this truth or it showed in their sneers they began to drift away some stuck to it some stayed to laugh at the rest and they had a point that was why he had practiced in secret because it did look funny when wanshig finally emerged around noon the numbers were down to thirty the essence of knife training as whandall taught it was to practice each of several moves separately until the mind turned to jelly whandall looked for those who could stick to it for an hour perfecting one move and move on to the next and end the day without screaming in anyones face to them and to those who could work with maps and still not scream in anyones face he would make an offer there were too many he had no confidence in most of them the cursed trouble was that you could not set tests for a lordkin because he wouldnt put up with it you learned what a lordkin was made of by watching him sometimes for years whandall didnt have years his bed was waiting but so was morth the wizard asked how are you feeling worn out ive been training lordkin in knife fighting how would you feel want some tea yes please whandall do these lordkin make you angry youve been away a long time embarrassed i used to be them i kept my temper all day i expected you to lose your temper with the toronexti morth its a dance theyre clumsy at bargaining that bottle trick was fun has anything made you angry lately is this about anger morth yes whandall considered not angry shocked this wilderness was peacegiven square it wasnt just the place where our mothers gathered what our families needed to live it was order order where we lived like the houses in the lordshills youre shocked but not angry well i i wasnt asking whandall yanginatep hasnt even looked at you these three days not a flicker i can tell and thats why you dont get angry if i threw a calming spell at you id have to tell you about it later but can you keep it up merchants dont get angry morth good merchants dont even fake it then it could work heres what i need whandall listened presently he asked why and presently he asked why should i oh make up your own cursed motives what has a water elemental ever done for you it gave me water to drink when i was a boy i thought that was me but all right yanginatep burned burned my family yes i see morth this is the craziest idea ive ever heard even from you but i i think i see how to use this i mean for the caravan for my family for feathersnake if youll do it my way yes and morth listened the next days mapmaking went on in the dining hall behind locked doors whandall spent some time in the courtyard supervising knife fighters at their practice and some time with the map the gulls at sea cliffs hadnt seen morth dancing on the cliff above them they knew only that a tremendous wave stood up and smashed four houses before it washed against the cliff three housed kinless but in the biggest house three or four lordkin lived in every room two were killed nine were homeless now came word from wanshig of serpents walk their people were drowned their stronghold smashed and washed away by a water demon wanshigs runners told the gulls what had hurt them and who could kill it and what was needed the sprites route inland would begin there so we hold sea cliffs and they brought in those that hold dead seal flats now you want to put people all along here wanshig said if you dont want them attacked nobody had better know what youre giving them and we still need truce for he whole length this is ogre turf here theyre crazy we cant get truce and we couldnt trust it why not go around wed never get a moving wave up here too high lord wanshig that was artcher one of wanshigs entourage likely a nephew hed shown some skill with maps now he asked what if we ran the line along here its long avenue the road runs this way because deer followed the low route and its weasel turf from here all the way to here they keep their truce too they take cursed big gifts to make truce i think i hear my secret name whandall said an ornate knife some glass jewelry honey candy and half their route was secured right there as they nailed down the route wanshig sent out runners the blades whandall had brought for lords were all going to lordkin but that was all right the lords wanted him much more than he had expected thats a nice low run dark mans cup bull fizzles wanshig said dont tell me that freethspat was good little brother but he didnt keep other peoples promises its a garbage dump again too look dark mans cup is perfect if those fizzles will trust me not to snatch it back offer to scour it clean for two coils of hemp say weve got a wizard if theyve heard the rumors theyll know its true say they can pay on delivery runners began flowing in with answers long avenue was under truce bull fizzles would deal if serpents walk would wait half a year for the hemp now send a credible messenger to get the kinless out of dark mans cup no details could be given as they might leak but get out dirty birds were easy still allies after all these years silly rabbits would not make truce they had to have that stretch send another offer but count on sending guards to protect whandalls chosen that evening whandall gathered his chosen in the banquet room now map room he spoke briefly and he passed out bottles anyone who wants to leave teps town here is a cold ironglazed bottle dont open it tonight knife training and mapmaking gave him men who could keep their temper millers and ropewalkers he gave special consideration this woman could read this one cooked a stew from random gatherings green stone watched children pulling weeds on the placehold roof garden and chose three freethspats boy whandalls last half brother aged thirty was worth a look hed rejected the maps and the knife practice but he got a bottle any of his chosen might take a mate when they left none were told what would be done yanginatep might take anyones mind back in peacegiven square whandall went to morths quarters to choose his running gear pick something colorful something distinctive dont you have anything that isnt gray or black morth ive seen your motley crew none of them dress like any other those flower market lordkin make seshmarls look diffident and you want distinctive whandall sighed sandry doesnt your cousin roni know a seamstress likely enough sir green stone write roni morth must have a wizards robe by tomorrow night something anyone can see from a mountaintop on a cloudy day please carry my word to your seamstress this is her price whandall chose a swath of the finest cloth in the caravan lavender with highlights in it then sheets of bright green and bright gold and this for morth chapter the bottles had been given out the previous evening this day was given to more knifeplay and mapmaking after dinner all gathered to be given their final instructions morth wore robes in blazing green patched with huge golden stars whandall stared the cursed robe was perfect just perfect from a mountaintop on a cloudy day hed said that it would be bad to laugh but morth you really look like a wizard morth oh shut up morth hurled the pointed cap at the floor how was that supposed to stay on did you think this is morth whandall bellowed and waved grandly look at him know him when you see him again there was laughter none of it muffled these were lordkin good morth now i need you to ferret out every bottle that has been opened laughter died as morth moved among the giggling horde and pointed pointed wanshigs musclemen moved after him and saw to it that certain men and women went away i only had it open for an instant morth took the stopper off nothing refined keep it but go another complained morth pulled the stopper out and back fast still some power left how long did you have this open long enough for tarcress to finish cooking sand dabs just time to pour a bit out to think that that was gold and put it back keep your place morth opened another bottle no gold fool keep the bottle and gel out gathered by my brother fool wanshig asked above the noise youre sure they keep the bottles if they go quietly fifteen of my heroes are clean missing bottle and all but these came whandall said i count eleven missing morth tapped five in a clump of six the sixth boy watched them depart whandall asked him what happened we all live in a room at the placehold last night flaide opened his bottle and poured out a handful of gold he told the rest of us why didnt you open yours silence good your name sadesp were you all six stationed next to each other curse whandall all of these other bottles stayed closed hold up morth i dont know some of these people fifteen gone but four replaced by strangers the woman was looking at him did i give you that bottle pride and terror no feathersnake im taking leathersmith millers place where is he smitty slept beside me last night im sapphire carpenter and i know more about love than any woman in the inner city wanshig said she speaks the truth sapphire youre leaving morth look her over shes clean no diseases no curses a few fleas shes left the bottle stopped sapphire can you throw yes smitty showed me his place i have his map shed kept the bottle unopened for several hours take your place morth said and sapphire if you think you know every pleasure that may pass between a man and a woman we should talk three more carried black bottles whandall hadnt given them three men had backed out or gotten high or drunk orface itbeen killed for their places too late to tell whandall sent one away with a gold nugget and no bottle because he didnt like his look he would risk the others he nodded to wanshig wanshig unbarred a door and they trooped in watch your step whandall called then followed with green stone they had been all day working on this map using charcoal and props whandall said green stone take over the boy had been familiar with the general plan for months he believed where whandall didnt quite and whandall should not fully concern himself a curious fire god might still look into whandalls mind traders were trained to project their voices above rushing rivers storms bandit raids green stone used his caravan voice youre the chosen in your lives you have seen just enough magic to know that its real you are going to witness and be part of the most powerful wizardry this city has ever seen those who stay behind will never see the like again play your part and you will leave teps town and see sights youve not yet had the wit to dream those of you who understand maps will recognize whats going on here this wanshigs gold saltbox gathered long ago long emptied is the placehold here the black pita dark pool on the floor ancient blood theyd started their map there here the lordshills forest deerpiss and the wedge and the toronexti herea brass coin these jagged lines way out here are shoreline here at sea cliffs here at good hand harbor we got some help on these from a water devil we dont know whats between them more shore off beyond sea cliffs is ocean and a water elemental morth of atlantis can tell you more about it its been trying to kill morth since atlantis sank morth intends to kill it that has never been done before the elemental will show itself as a mountain of water it will chase morth morthsee these paired lines one red one green all the way across the map morth will follow the green line from sea cliffs across dead seal flats uphill here down along long avenue to dark mans cupsee and on inland the wave will follow the lowlands well be strung out all along the red line above it all watching we want to throw bottles ahead of the wave when morth is past take the stopper out and throw the black bottle throw it at something hard like a rock it has to break take the stopper out or break itboth would workbut these were lordkin they might forget yanginatep takes the magic all in an instant if they break too soon yousintothokyou opened your bottle but not long enough for yanginatep to gather all the manna in the gold but break it just in front of the wave the elemental will take it and thats the point of all this the wave will sink and flow back to the ocean if we dont give it the power to go on the wild magic will keep it moving until it gets here here at the black pit is where morth will trap it with no manna to move it and no way to get more and here morth will kill it afterward gather at peacegiven square questions lordkin dont raise their hands and wait they bellow green stone pointed and said hey hey you ive seen waves theyre fast your wizard is nuts morth can outrun lightning ive seen it you will too if you miss it youll regret it the rest of your life you you want to move the wave uphill here and here well have the wave going uphill yes ill bunch you up a little there because well really need the gold and because some of these wont throw whandall thought but you cant tell them that some of them cant be trusted corntham what how do you kill a water elemental morth said thats the tricky part green stone said morth has made gifts to us for our part in this our gifts to you will be freedom from teps town just as youve been promised youll have a place in the caravans on the hemp road or you may find better lives than that whandall placehold was one of you what he is now brought him back as greater than a lord my father green stone watched them flinch at that word and he grinned chapter some of the bottle throwers those with the most distant posts must be sent off that night in a protected band sea cliffs would house them the rest dowsed down in the placehold for what remained of the night the caravan would have to take care of itself whandall and green stone needed their sleep the sale at peacegiven square would have nearly emptied out the kinless quarters lordkin who knew nothing of morths plan wouldnt be interfering with morths route theyd be burgling empty houses while the kinless were away or trying to profit from the fair or so whandall hoped morth and whandall boarded their chariots behind sandry and heroul wanshig hadnt caught the hang of mapping and at his age no wonder two sisters sons had they rode wanshigs chariot placing bottle throwers from dark mans cup southeast to the black pit whandall moved west his chosen were not standing beside friends to hold them steady each could just see the next to either side not too far for a voice to carry except that yawning gap five of six boys gone and sadesp standing alone whandall slowed to space them more regularly now morth was far ahead his chariot slashed through the weeds that lined dark mans cup while whandall and heroul followed him along the ridge whandall couldnt see deep enough into the chaparral to pick i out kinless houses or the warrens of the hemp growers theyd been warned theyd got out or they hadnt the beach was in sight sandry stopped his chariot on the ridge above dead seal flats and morth got out and went on the last runner a woman of sea cliffs had slowed to a walk and was checking her map to find her place her man had already taken his whandall had heroul pull up between them he walked to the edge he would have driven on to the bluff above sea cliffs beach hed see it all from there from here morth was already out of sight but whandalls chariot would need the head start if what he remembered was no hallucination a wave rose up and rolled forward crested in white climbing as it came where was morth already gone there a green and gold dot unmistakablelook at that man move the wave came after him too slowly losing ground but higher every second throw whandall thought but he wouldnt speak this was how he would know his own if they threw or if they didnt whandall jumped aboard go go heroul used the reins horse then chariot lurched into motion delirious laughter rose above the waves roar and whandall wondered why the sound was so delayed when morth was halfway to the first rise the woman threw her man threw too bottles arced down and shattered and a mountain of water rolled past raising thunder and spume just below whandalls whirling wheels the big horse looked terrified heroul was elated the wave so far down was no threat to them morth was nearly out of sight disappearing in chaparral where dead seal flats rose uphill morth stopped as if hed hit a wall the wave rolled on whandall rolled past an elderly kinless man curled up with his hands over his ears crying bottle abandoned wrinin of flower market hurled her bottle it bounced unbroken and rolled but left a trail of yellow gold sapphire carpenter waited until she was in his full view then threw beautifully the bottle smashed just under the wave morth was in a tottering run and the wave was closing bald scalp thin white fringe teeth showed in a snarl of effort as he turned back just for an instant and grinned at the showers of gold and glass splinters and the wave rose to hide him but sandry was waiting with the chariot and was helping morth to board now the wave was moving uphill losing water losing mass whandalls chariot was pulling ahead of it below the wizard and sandry came back into view the lords son drove like while lightning twisting a gob of molten glass carefully aware of danger not hurrying doing his job swabotts mother was first lady of flower market theyd needed truce with flower market to post their bottle throwers whandall had prepped him swabott knelt with bottle in hand the stopper already out as the wave came toward him even from far away whandall could see him shaking with terror when he stood to throw the bottle jittered in his hand and gold showered all about him the wave was ahead of whandall here and now it was passing swabott and he hadnt thrown he turned toward whandall and a serene joy was in his face he wasnt shaking at all he took it all in his smile widened to a manic grin before whandall could twitch swabott was running alongside whandalls horse the horse was running full out but when swabott swung onto its back the horse screamed and surged faster swabott dug his heels into its sides and yelled whandall was ready to jab a spear into him when he threw the bottle dropped neatly in front of the wave and smashed whandall turned the spear around and rapped swabott smartly on the back of his head get off my chariot swabott leaped from the horse rolled and was on his feet and running laughing like a madman gold fever and hed earned his place the low path turned here and became dark mans cup padanchi the lop still had one good arm his bottle shattered ahead of the wave then the wave turned to follow morths chariot and the foamy crest slapped padanchi off the cliff kencchi of the long avenue froze at the sight he didnt hear his woman screaming at him to throw nor did whandall he only saw her wide mouth straining throat but when the time came she threw kencchi didnt decide later morths properly terrified horse was pulling him nicely through dark mans cup following its own trail of smashed vegetation the wave rolled on no less monstrous feeding on the wild magic in the smashed bottles here several of his chosen were missing the wave began to slump and there was fighting ahead four of whandalls bottle throwers had managed to reach each other and were fighting back to back against six men of the north quarter north quarter had broken truce whandall signaled heroul who pulled toward the ring of lordkin around the four survivors they saw him coming running wouldnt help his first target braced himself to duck aside whandall outguessed him and punched his blade deep into the mans torso his grip on the long halt twisted the man halfway around and then whandall could pull the blade free all in a background of screaming the ring of gatherers was broken and running whandall reached out with the long shaft and stabbed another heroul was looking for another target keep it moving whandall shouted the wave was gaining on morth its dark green face had crosscurrents in it interference patterns the ground leveled off ahead whandalls advantage of altitude was dwindling he had no reason to think that this mindless water elemental would take an interest in him but but whandalls path had grown rougher the wave was past him behind him he could see its wake of black wet ground morth might die in this crazy project whandall would not mourn long his promise bound him but this was also his chance to choose whom he might rescue from the burning city if whandall could survive he might die rescuing the idiot wizard morth was almost under the wave already beyond rescue morth opened a black bottle and showered gold all over himself sandry turned in surprise morths hair flashed brick red and he was moving the chariot was left behind horse and all swallowed by foam in the next instant but morth was running on the vertical cliff with the charioteer held wriggling above his head he dropped sandry on the lip of the crest and veered back into the valley leaving a wake of mad laughter the charioteer was on hands and knees coughing then vomiting whandall waved at sandry but didnt slow then the horse stumbled and heroul had to slow horse and driver hed get no more out of either whandall jumped out and ran wobbling from the beating his sense of balance had taken heroul followed shouting where sir where are we follow morth he was passing the last bottle carrierreblay of silly rabbits sitting spraddlelegged his bottle thrown running on flat land now past a broken chariot and three men on their backs gasping for air wanshig and his two nephews those werent the nephews hed started with whandall ran if he lived hed hear the story the black pit was ahead whandall could see its ripple and gleam water covering black tar a death trap shining in the sun morth was slowing again gray with fatigue he looked back and from the look in his eyes what he saw was his death manna in raw gold had energized the water sprite and driven it mad the wave had followed morth and a trail of wild magic deep into the heart of the burning city now it was stranded in a place where the magic was gone and now there was nothing behind it but refined gold it still stood higher than any building of that age whitecrested with weird ripples rolling across its green face it rolled toward the staggering gasping wizard reblay was not the last bottle carrier here was where freethspats son should have been where lay a black bottle no bigger than whandalls fist whandall scooped it up and kept running he neared morth pulled the stopper and threw gold and glass sprayed around the wizards feet morth whooped and ran over the fence in a leap across the dark water too fast to sink into it to the far side of the black pit and over the far fence a mountain of water rolled into the black pit absorbed the pond water and grew the tar burst into flame whandall barely felt his hair and eyebrows singed to ash for an instant that seemed to last forever he perceived what yanginatep perceived chapter yanginatep loki prometheus moloch coyote the hearth fires of the indoeuropean tribes uncountable fire gods were one and many he she they had the aspect powers of bilocation and shared minds pleasure or pain seeped from lands where a lord of fire and mischief might be worshipped or tortured every cook fire was a nerve ending for yanginatep whandall could feel the gods shape the terrible freezing wound at his heart the numb places where parts of the city were abandoned and no fires were lit the long trailing tail through the firewoods he felt sensation where lord and lordkin armies had passed the path of whandalls escape and return yanginatep stirred rarely it was only his attention that moved but where yanginateps attention fell things happened fires went out when yanginatep took their energy he put out forest fires cook fires he allowed to burn if he snuffed them too early they were of no use fires indoors went out yanginatep in whandalls mind remembered why an ancient chief had bargained with yanginatep had woven a spell to prevent his nomad people from settling in houses cook fires gave him his life but there was not enough magic even in fire every several years yanginatep fell into deathlike sleep then fires raged unchecked even indoors yanginateps faminemadness would fall on receptive worshippers and people called that the burning in his coma yanginatep might not respond to the burning for clays yet his chosen would feel the casing of his hunger his growing strength their own grief was eased by the fires when yanginatep revived it was all in a surge he took fire where it was hottest and though some fools might continue to throw torches the burning was over but now the trickle of life in yanginatep was trickling away and a line of bleeding emptiness crawled toward him from the sea it was water water come to challenge him the manna that kept a water elemental alive was the life of yanginatep the fire gods attention moved across the burning city and centered on the black pit tar and oil the pond water that covered the black pit had been rolled up into the greater mass of the sprite tar lay naked and exposed yanginateps attention set it afire flames cradled the sprite the sprite danced like a bead of water on a skillet trying to withdraw from the fire ancient dead animals played in the flames sabertooth cats pawed at the air swatting at the water above them great flaming birds circled a mastodon formed then grew until it loomed above the sprite behemoth stamped down with both forefeet and was gone and the sprite was unharmed the child whandall had seen these ghosts as holes in fog now they were flame but whandalls perception saw more yanginatep was summoning them to absorb their manna the fire god was eating the ghosts morth lay limp on the far side of the pit whandall made his way around the fence toward morth his haft and blade forgotten in his hands it was a long way around he could barely see hear feel with the fire gods senses raging in his head the elemental knew what it wanted and yanginatep felt it too yanginatep raised fire to block the elemental from its prey from morth of atlantis the elemental countered with a blast of wild magic gold magic nearly its last if whandall couldnt feel magic the fire god could yanginateps attention snuffed out then snapped back and morth half dead beside the black pit fence snapped awake and strong awash in manna he spilled his pack stripped to the waist and smeared his arms and chest with white paint all in great haste he faced the pit and his arms began to wave to whandall it looked like he was conducting music or a dance indeed lirebeasts danced in response even as they winked out one by one the war was half seen hall felt half hidden whandall wasnt perceiving it all in flashes of clarity he made his way to morth morths back was turned just stay clear he said without turning around gold rings glittered on every finger cant i do something clear morth danced on then whandalls only senses were yanginateps water wanted to cool fire fire wanted to burn water yanginatep wrapped the elemental like an eggcup around an egg water sizzled fire dimmed both were dying some power remained in the black pit to feed the ghosts of the ancient animals and that power was being used now yanginatep reached out for more and was blocked at the fence but there was enough the sprite died in a blast of live steam whandall covered his face with his arms and fell to the tarry ground heat scalded his hands morths arms never missed a beat but whandall heard his howl yanginatep hunted if there had been a trace of the water elemental yanginatep would have eaten the manna in it but the water thing was dead myth gone yanginatep reached farther there was nothing outside the black pit now whandall felt claustrophobic terror a sudden shrinkage from occupying the valleys vastness enclosed by forest and sea fed by cook fires yanginatep was numb and paraplegic beyond the border of the black pit some enemy was weavinghad wovena wall yanginatep twitched to the rhythm of the spell and sought a new enemy and found him too late whandall recognized morth of atlantis his dancing arms and fingers but the wall was complete and morth was outside untouchable manna streamed thinly from the stars but yanginatep couldnt feel it morth had woven a lid to the box yanginatep pushed against it whandall heard morths bellow of agony dimly but he felt the fire gods agony the magical barrier was pitifully thin but it was water magic yanginatep hunted with the ferocity of a lordkin and found a lordkin then whandall and yanginatep were two aspects of the fire god the fire god reached down and picked up his haft and lordkin blade whandall feathersnake let it fall yanginatep stooped to pick up the spear stooped and reached bent his knees and reached desperate to make this body move move why wouldnt the lordkin move morth danced like a marionette his back turned whandall feathersnake stood at peace with himself and the god raging in his mind whandall was familiar with the hard sell every merchant in the world thinks he can make you buy but he cant listen nod enjoy the entertainment offer tea at the right price buy whandall felt the fire fill him running down his arms little flames licked his fingernails fire lit his mind the toronexti well burn them out houses gatehouse forest paths men we ii burn them all take the children hostage to hold the women next the bull fizzles what you offer has value of course but how can i risk so much if i lose my people starve my family all who trust feathersnake no your price is too high flame licked his fingertips rage frivolously high fire you cant be serious burn control relax stand smile breathe there was no manna left yanginatep faded to a dying spark not here on the surface but deep down beneath the tar where no wizard could ever have been the last trace of the fire god found a last spark of manna the fire god sank faded and was myth yanginatep was myth whandalls face hurt clothing had covered the rest of him but his hands and the left side of his face and scalp were hot with pain his hand found no eyebrows no lashes no hair on that side morth was a stick figure bald as an egg clothing charred black across the front of him and his arms waved conducting unseen musicians whandall dared not interfere there was no trace of ancient animal ghosts now and every fire was out morth lowered his arms bowed and fell on his face whandall rolled him over morths eyes were half open seeing nothing whandall said the sprite is dead morth morth sucked air alive cant know that morth i strangled it myself and ate every trace of it its dead excuse me did i say i was being yanginatep feathersnake inn all gods welcome i want no more of it morth wont happen again whats left of yanginatep i wove deep into the tar whatever the fire god has been doing to this town its over ten thousand years maybe more maybe forever yanginatep sleeps below the tar maybe you can make something of that im burned get me to the sea for the manna wash me with salt water wait you sure the sprite is dead good part five feathersnake chapter sandry and burning tower clattered up horses lathered heroul was just behind him with green stone father burning tower shouted im all right his children began to inspect him they looked to be caught between horror and laughter whandall said its morth who needs help sandry can you get him to the sea he doesnt look strong enough to ride in a chariot sandry said ill get a wagon heroul said coming he asked green stone see to it whandall said get morth into the water i will heroul shouted he wheeled away and lashed the horses dashing across the uneven ground well stay with you whandall said burning tower knelt beside the aged wizard stay there morth said some say theres magic in a young girls smile whandall we did it heroul was back with a kinless in quintana colors driving a fourhorse wagon whandall and green stone lifted the wizard into the wagon and laid him on the blankets that filled it whandall demanded morth how long morth smiled with no teeth get me into the sea morth said distinctly the sea is magical everywhere quick enough i might live the wagon moved away with herouls chariot as escort shouldnt we go with him burning tower asked hes in good hands whandall said im more worried about the caravan now sandry can this thing carry three if one is as light as she is he said i can ride the wagon tongue burning tower said see blazesburning tower that isnt safe sandry said safer than a tightrope you just drive it was the finalday sale for the caravan pitchmen were shouting it last day everything goes never be lower prices burning tower leaped from the chariot before it stopped she raced to the sign outside whandall feathersnakes market pitch snatched up a charcoal from the fire and began to scrawl huge black letters across the neatly scribed sign nothing was seen came out of the nest to stare as if he could read lurk are you all right the bandit boy looked nearly healed but still swollen in spots feathersnake theyre working me like a kinless he must have learned that from a customer see i speak your language you look half fried and wheres the wizard tell me a story later back to work sandry was half strangling on his own laughter whandall had never seen him do that he demanded what does it say sandry looked at whandall it was clear what he was seeing a tattooed man with every hair of his body singed off burn spots and blisters on his arms and hands and on one cheek sandry struggled with laughter and lost sir it says fire sale i should never have let her mother teach her to read whandall growled i want a new shirt then lets see if i can sell something the sale was a roaring success kinless and lordkin alike come to see what the traders from outside had brought what they could buy heroul and green stone returned in late afternoon whandall was selling a carpet out of his own travel nest hed run out of stock early two lordsmen were paying a manweight of tar and some jewelry the lord waited silent behind them whandall asked is the wizard dead morth is well green stone said whandall looked around you left him alone abandoning an ally was much different from leaving ones dead hes not alone though il was hull killing them they both waited for whandall to complete the sale then green stone babbled we ran straight to good hand harbor some water devil gatherers would have stopped a wagon but not herouls chariot they followed us theres a boat bigger than all the boats we saw at lions and there were seamen all about but theres a beach we didnt want to move him so we ran the wagon right down into the water i got in and held morths head up there were seamen and water devils all wanting our story they saw the same thing we did morth lay there looking drowned grinning with no teeth and bragging in a guttural whisper about what wed done hes got deep burns meat burns but some blisters healed while we watched he grew some hair just stubble in patches where he was burned least but its red stubble he grew teeth he started to laugh heroul said last i saw him he was up to his neck in sea water asking the crew for food said he could pay wants to know if the ship needs a wizard a crewman was going for the captain a wizard in his element whandall mused did he say when he was coming back father he wont even try to stand up green stone said he said he cant leave the sea not for weeks we cant stay weeks father hes done his part green stone said you look worried burning tower said oh stones is right blazes but now we have to fight our way out past the toronexti without a wizard oh but weve got sandry well escort you out sandry said burning tower caught his tone sandry you wont fight we can defend ourselves if they attack us maybe theyre that stupid and maybe that will be enough whandall said green stone was looking out at the crowd good business he said yes but stones none of them seem to know burning tower said yanginateps gone mythical and they dont know morth said it would take a while green stone said manna is low and there arent any wizards theyve been gone for centuries how will anyone know magic works here he rubbed his hands together father we get out we join up with saber tooth and come back with clever squirrel and every shaman we can hire think what theyll pay here just for rain well clean up youre thinking like saber tooth burning tower told her brother about time whandall said peacegiven square buzzed like a hive and trade was brisk a few lordkin were to be expected and whandall had counted twenty or so they were looking not gathering much the merchants must have educated them early but whandall was keeping his eye on a cluster of lordkin seeing them as trouble wondering when theyd split up and begin gathering serpents walk would have filtered in not come in a bunch others had noticed merchants and customers were all beginning to bristle whandall wondered if it might make sense to pay off the toronexti get out then return in two weeks with weapons and magic and plant poison rubbed on sever blades no too late in the year after the tax men stripped them they wouldnt have wealth to show outside they wouldnt get enough fighting men to bring back and winning a few battles wouldnt help if they had to stay the winter no the knot of a dozen lordkin hed been watching had crossed the square to hammer millers wagon they began gathering goods when hammer came out to collect one backhanded him with a laugh hey harpy the whole square glittered for a moment the cry of hey harpy rose in a chorus whandall jumped the counter knife in hand he was surprised to see sandry and heroul wheel their chariots around and leave the fight rolling at top speed toward the lordsmen camp but the rest of the action was familiar kinless took cover most of the lordkin decided it wasnt their business and took cover too a few enraged at having their fun interrupted readied to fight but the harpies were behaving like wolverines clustered back to back in the open square giving themselves room to fight allowing nobody near caravaners armed themselves and moved toward the gatherers at a trot the flurry of slingshot missiles surprised the harpies they didnt notice what else was going on among the lordsmen whandall barely saw it himself but running to test his knifework against teps town harpies he slowed waterman had been watching as the two chariots neared the camp they were joined by three more riders mount up waterman shouted men ran from their tents to take places beside the charioteers go get em sir waterman shouted sandry waved toward the knot of harpies at a walk at a trot he took the long spear in his right hand the other drivers were doing the same the riders held short spears at the ready charge five chariots in line hurtled across the square throw five short spears arched out and four of the intruding lordkin fell the others ran dropping their loot dropping everything else they carried only one turned to raise his lordkin knife in defiance he got herouls spear dead in his chest for his effort the charioteers came to a halt across the square waterman was still forming up his infantry troops but there was no need heroul set his foot on a corpse and wrenched his spear loose three of the gatherers were dead two others probably wouldnt live not if that was the care they were getting whandall went to a dead harpy and turned him over with a foot a stylized longnosed animal was tattooed on the upper arm the style had changed in twentytwo years butwolverines whandall said glad thats over burning tower said she stood half fascinated by the dead men every now and then glancing up toward sandry sandry looked both pleased with himself and astonished that all his training had paid offit worked just the way his teachers had said it would its not over whandall said he pointed lagdret of serpents walk lay dead in front of the miller tea shop the pretty waitress behind him was bleeding from a knife wound to her shoulder wanshig arrived half an hour later he sent two of his lordkin to wrap lagdrets body carry him home he said wanshig inspected the dead wolverine these whandall said these or the ones that got away wolverines anyway doesnt matter no whandall was astonished at his brothers cold voice doesnt matter wanshig said again wolverines killed my man killed a placeholder on neutral ground never make half a war whandall is it true weve put yanginatep to sleep yes i had to try it i took a torch indoors of course that would work wanshig looked around him lordkin and kinless were coming out from cover watching each other warily wanshig said softly during the burning ten thousand years morth said but a torch burns indoors and the wolverines dont know it wanshig said well theyll know it soon enough by noon tomorrow every damn one of them will know it do you have enough men to attack the wolverines whandall asked theyre strong so are we wanshig said whandall ive done my best to stay out of wars build alliances do favors now im calling in every favor i have coming flower market and bull fizzle wont want to send anyone but they cant keep me from asking from spreading the word that were going to gather in rich territory got room for anyone who wants some loot can i tell them the lordsmen fought wolverines when i talk about gathering they fought here yes but they may not carry it farther dont promise anything well be leaving in the morning whandall said the toronexti are sure to be watching we cant get to their gatehouse before noon theyll want a lot of their strength there wanshig said youd be rich pickings like nothing theyve seen in their lifetimes and they wont expect me to be looking for them right away they sent a man to offer blood money whandall looked at his brother wanshig grinned never found me cant find me he went to the serpents walk clubhouse at the clubhouse they said i was gone back to the placehold placehold will send him to pelzeds old place hes always just missed me curse you did bring some excitement whandall i never quite found the right time to take back dark mans cup but i contracted to clean it right its as clean as a river bottom and the bull pizzles dont want to pay so when will you go into wolverine territory whandall asked was planning on first thing in the morning but its even better at noon about the time they see you their turf will be burning wanshig laughed never fight half a war i taught my people i taught mine whandall wess will bring her boy over in the morning you take care of him i will wanshig the gold is still down there you know under the water all along the long avenue ah wanshig stood its been instructive dall and maybe ill see you again maybe not you too shig ill be back i think you will maybe ill be here too chapter it was barely light when wess came wesss son looked nothing like shastern he was a small boy big eyes a thoughtful look like i remember you were wess said but hes smaller than you were take care of him whandall things will be different here whandall said maybe not that different that soon wess said please he can come with us wess but we have to get past the toronexti if that goes bad he thought for a moment if that goes bad ill send him home with one of the lordsmen sandry has been to the placehold hell take him all right wess kissed her son he stared with big eyes at her then at whandall goodbye she turned and ran burning tower this is shastern whandall said keep him out of trouble shastern you stay with her and just maybe whandall thought that will keep both of you out of the fight thirtyseven of whandalls tested bottle throwers came at dawn ten were kinless all carried large sacks all the possessions they would be taking outside they chattered eagerly of a new life whos missing whandall asked i thought everyone would come fubgire had endured the knife lessons and thrown his bottle he said wanshig was persuasive they went to gather at granite knob the rest of us are here lord im not a lord we have no lords im wagonmaster close enough for me lord but fubgire was laughing all of you stay together whandall said green stone will tell you what to do a couple of the lordkin muttered get used to that whandall snapped working with us means following instructions the way to win in a fight is to stay together and act together green stone knows your language listen to him i ask you to walk alongside the last wagon keep your weapons ready dont hide them but dont threaten anyone if you have to raise a weapon use it were going to see if the lords can talk us past the toronexti i dont expect them to do it well have to fight then hammer miller asked i think so hammer dont you yes he turned to the ten kinless who were coming out with them you all have your slings it wasnt a question and they all did the ceremonial nooses around their necks came off quickly be sure you have a good supply of rocks the lordkin frowned kinless without nooses kinless with weapons the wagon train left as soon as it was light enough to see but waterman had his men on the road first the lordsmen marched on ahead whandall glimpsed lurk and shastern in the last wagon and thought no more of it he had larger concerns there were seven chariots sandry and his friends every chariot held a driver and a spear thrower the charioteers tried to stay with the wagon train but horses hated to match a bisons pace they learned to hang back then dash ahead to catch up it was enough of an escort that no one wanted trouble word had spread wolverines had attacked the wagons and the lordsmen had killed wolverines leave the wagon train alone even the stupidest of lordkin could understand that the bison moved at their slow pace through streets deceptively quiet near noon an old man hobbled out of the shade of the biggest tree he leaned heavily on a giant the giant was elderly gone to fat and his smile was more goofy than challenging still a giant they approached without fear bent and twisted as the master was whandall wondered at his equally goofy grin like a lordkin springing a trap then whandall recognized him tras whandall feathersnake always surprising i much prefer this to your last surprise i shall i tell you how i got myself off your land alive after i crawled back into the crypt i fainted when my man hejak hold up tras arshur arshur the magnificent the giant confirmed not sure i remember you got a drink i was with alferth when you got your first drink here you getting beaten up that started the burning twentyodd years back i thought youd be leaving on the next ship i like it here they rounded the last bend the toronexti were ahead the caravan moved toward them whandalls merchants moved to the tailgates ready to jump down the new recruits huddled around green stone they would be at the gatehouse in minutes hobbling along with his stick in one hand the other on arshurs arm tras was still keeping up with the burdened bison hejak gave up on me and was leaving when i crawled out but i whandall said in some haste tras im just too busy right now but can you climb a tree tras preetror gaped do i look he can climb a tree arshur said or i can throw him up a tree should i do that both of you watchman had pounded arshurs head with sticks the treatment seemed to have done some permanent damage now tras preetror saw the armored toronexti ahead that officeri know how he hurt his hand ive stopped caring three lordsmen wanted out of teps town with their armor the tax men tried to stop them they wanted one suit of armor tras you two are about to see a really good story happen right in front of you theyre more careful now do you mean tras was finally seeing the danger story may i call it the death of whandall feathersnake if thats what you see thats what you tell but see it from a height tras and in hiding if you live you owe me the kinless bonehead ponies were getting larger horns growing as they approached the forest that hadnt happened this close to teps town last time whandall remembered yanginatep was myth whoever saw the implications first would make fortunes waterman was ahead of them his band grown to nearly fifty men drawn up in three ranks an officers tent was set up behind them whandall didnt recognize the lord but sundry rode up alongside the wagon my lather he said he whipped up his horses to go to his lathers tent the wagons reached the toronexti gale the big toronexti officer with the injured hand was waiting there were more of the masked and armored tax collectors fifty that whandall could see more in the tollgate building probably some behind the building whandall waited sandry brought his chariot up let them pass now why should i do that half hand demanded orders from the lord chief witness this wagon train passes without taxes now does it chief clerk the shuttered door on the second floor of the brick gatehouse popped open there stood egon forigaft and a glimpse of dark ancient tapestries behind him he leaned far out over the tenfoot drop to put daylight on the sheet of parchment in his hands a toronexti guard held his sash decree of lord chief witness harcarth the toronexti shall have the right of taxation on all goods departing through the forest there is more enough i think the scarred officer said younglord we have a charter witnessed and signed younglord witnessed and signed sandry shrugged helplessly toronexti moved forward whandall said hey harpy the fighting men of the wagon train leaped down to join the lordkin and kinless walking alongside the wagons together they made a formidable band women took over the reins closed the gaps in the wagon covers you want our goods come and take them whandall shouted a decree egon forigaft shouted the lords will assist the toronexti when they are attacked by outsiders whos an outsider whandall jumped to a wagon roof and stripped off his shirt i am whandall of serpents walk who dares say i am not lordkin no one moved sandry laughed what does it say about lordkin clerk egon found it the toronexti shall protect the lords and their agents from civil unrest sandry said we owe you no protection from lordkin you protect us you misbegotten goblins one of the toronexti threw a stone it struck sandrys spearman in the stomach the spearman bent over retching sandry gave a wide grin and lifted his spear a proclamation of lord qirinthal the first egon shouted from his upper story there shall be truce between lords and toronexti so long us this charter endures if toronexti shall strike a lordsman that toronexti shall he liable for double the injury in blood two eyes for an eye two limbs for a limb two lives for a life and this be paid the truce shall endure we pay the toronexti officer shouted bring me that man he pointed to the window though the man who had thrown the stone had vanished two toronexti dragged him over the officer hit him in the stomach with all his strength then again do the lords demand another man be punished he shouted sandry turned away in disgust its that stack of old parchments isnt it whandall said sandry nodded what if it were to burn sandry grinned go stone distract them while i get that paper whandall shouted the toronexti wouldnt understand the language of the hemp road stone led his band toward the toronexti whandall charged forward to dash inside the gatehouse but someone inside saw what he intended the gatehouse door slammed shut with a crash greathand break the door greathand had a sword in one hand and a hammer in the other he ran forward whandall ran with him his cloak wrapped around his arm to protect them both he blocked a slash felt his cloak yield to a sharp blade a toronexti moved toward them then fell to hammer millers sling now a dozen slingers were in action and stones fell among the toronexti they held up their arms to protect their heads two more fell twenty of the tax men came around the building they held shields and moved in behind them in a rattle of stones from the kinless slings they got between the other toronexti and the slingers whandalls lordkin stalwarts rushed forward but despite all stone could do they didnt stay together they came in ones and twos and in ones and twos they were cut down whandall saw a dozen of his men on the ground to half that many enemies smoke one of the toronexti gibbered and pointed a black cloud of smoke rose over granite knob smoke thats our homes whandall smiled grimly we have to protect our homes stand fast half hand shouted its a trick its just smoke to draw us away stand fast greathand pounded on the door with his hammer the door did not yield i need an ax he shouted hammer miller ran to a wagon and got an ax he ran toward greathand with a tax man behind him hammer swung the ax the toronexti ducked and lashed out with his lordkin knife hammer fell in a shapeless heap see younglords how we protect you the toronexti officer gestured to send ten armored men to face whandall greathand and four others at the door one of the newcomers took the ax from hammer miller started forward and went down under a toronexti knife greathand shouted defiance and moved toward the ax the battle surged around him four men charged greathand turned and struck two men with his hammer before he was beaten to his knees more toronexti moved toward whandall moving together carefully and slowly whandalls wagon curtain opened and burning tower ran out right whandall had foisted shastern on her but shed passed the boy on to nothing was seen and now she was free to run at the toronexti line with a torch in her hand she leaped onto the back of one of the bison over his head and down to the ground before laughing toronexti could catch her she reached the flagstaff in front of the building and climbed it from the top she leaped across to the open doorway where egon forigaft stood she waved her torch in triumph the toronexti officer roared in laughter torches inside here on yanginateps spine his laughter turned to horror as burning tower put her torch to the thin parchments egon forigaft was holding they blazed she whirled the torch about and ancient ceremonial tapestries were burning flames everywhere there she shouted wheres your charter now read it now she kicked blazing parchment out of the doorway its gone sandry then she was out of the doorway climbing toward the roof two toronexti chasing her sandry shouted waterman sir clean out these vermin sir lock shields spears high forward the line of lordsmen moved toward the toronexti sandry grabbed the throwing spear from his crippled spearman it arched high the toronexti on the roof screamed and fell burning tower stood on the roof and shouted good throw sandry and six more chariots were charging the toronexti line javelins flew and now there was only whandall and the toronexti leader with the ruined hand half hand backed away whandall feinted high then drove his knife point just below the line of the mans leather armor it went in to the hilt he turned to see everyone staring at him your face tenyearold shastern said in awe it lit up for the last time whandall said i hope what did they see there were eleven dead four from the wagon train six more probably wont make it green stone said three times that if we dont get out to a healer pretty quick too bad we dont have morth well go whandall said the ways clear get loaded up shall i come with you sandry asked arent you needed here sandry looked at the piled bodies it will all be different now yes sir i may be needed but shell be back whandall said in a year if you still remember her he will burning tower said from behind him i will well know that next year whandall said stone are we loaded we are move them out whandall looked back teps town wasnt visible from here but there was dark smoke over the hill below granite knob not many of the toronexti would be going home to defend wolverine territory smoke rose elsewhere too wanshig hadnt done that and the time of yanginateps burning was over but teps town was only now discovering that fires would burn indoors given their lack of faith in the fire god kinless didnt have the habit of leaving flammable trash about lordkin did sailors didnt a few days from now the placehold might be the last stronghold unburned and it wasnt feathersnakes problem move them out stone its your wagon route not too soon for you to take charge of it im going home afterward over millennia the hemp road spread from condigeo south through the isthmus and deep into the southern continent when the caravans died out the feathered serpent remained a symbol of civilization the native americans who invaded the american continents from siberia fourteen thousand years ago found that they could use the native mammoths and horses as meat these creatures they ultimately exterminated when the americas were later invaded from europe there were no suitable riding beasts from which to fight the los angeles times says redwood fossils discovered in pit indicate that the big trees now generally seen only in the mountain forests of northern california grew along what is now wilshire boulevard when the redwoods were gone the truce of the forest died too california chaparral has lost much of its malevolence but some plants still maintain their blades needles and poisons hemp still soothes distracts then strangles its victims at any opportunity the killer bees of teps town ultimately armed every hive on earth with poisoned weapons bees no longer negotiate worth a damn foxglovedigitalishas lost much of its power the pretty little flower is still a euphoric and a poison the madness that comes of touching river gold is still remembered in germany in die nibelungen and in the united states in such movies as the treasure of the sierra madre the legend of a madmans lost gold remains current parents continued to tell the tale of a charismatic man who contracted to resolve a towns infestation of vermin when the lords refused to pay him he led away not just the vermin but all the youth of the town ultimately his tale became that of the pied piper of hamelin the story of jispomnoss murders which spread with the tellers from teps town to condigeo and then returned to teps town as an opera spread farther yet ultimately it fell into the hands of the playwright william shakespeare to become othello yanginatep lay mythical for nearly fourteen thousand years entombed in petroleum tar until two men came to dig for oil in the la brea tar pits their names were canfield and doheny yanginateps call and the lust for precious metal played a resonance with the gold fever in their brains at the la brea tar pits they tried to dig an oil well with shovels they didnt stop until they were one hundred and sixtyfive feet down a few inches above death by asphyxiation bubbles of unbreathable gas crackled under their shovels fumes made them dizzy and sick at last they went to find a partner who knew about pipes and then they woke the fire god and built an empire on petroleum in the authors found pinnacles national park to be exactly as described sage rosemary thyme and pallid dragon nip still grow there and the giants fingers and dragons rib cages are still in place yanginatep feeds the fires that move a billion automobiles and a million airplanes everywhere in the world not cook fires alone but also automobile and diesel motors are each a nerve ending for yanginatep the gods nerve trunks reach along freeways paths that once ran through forest then and still yanginateps tail from time to time the fire gods attention shifts and then the burning comes again some people like to play with fire
