 episodes in van bibbers life by richard harding davis her first appearance it was at the end of the first act of the first night of the sultana and every member of the lester comic opera company from lester himself down to the wardrobe womans son who would have had to work if his mother lost her place was sick with anxiety there is perhaps only one other place as feverish as it is behind the scenes on the first night of a comic opera and that is a newspaper office on the last night of a presidential campaign when the returns are being flashed on the canvas outside and the mob is howling and the editorinchief is expecting to go to the court of st james if the election comes his way and the officeboy is betting his wages that it wont such nights as these try mens souls but van bibber passed the stagedoor man with as calmly polite a nod as though the piece had been running a hundred nights and the manager was thinking up souvenirs for the one hundred and fiftieth and the prima donna had as usual begun to hint for a new set of costumes the stagedoor keeper hesitated and was lost and van bibber stepped into the unsuppressed excitement of the place with a pleased sniff at the familiar smell of paint and burning gas and the dusty odor that came from the scenelofts above for a moment he hesitated in the crosslights and confusion about him failing to recognize in their new costumes his old acquaintances of the company but he saw kripps the stagemanager in the centre of the stage perspiring and in his shirtsleeves as always wildly waving an arm to some one in the flies and beckoning with the other to the gasman in the front entrance the stage hands were striking the scene for the first act and fighting with the set for the second and dragging out a canvas floor of tessellated marble and running a throne and a practical pair of steps over it and aiming the high quaking walls of a palace and abuse at whoever came in their way now then van bibber shouted kripps with a wild glance of recognition as the whiteandblack figure came towards him you know youre the only man in new york who gets behind here tonight but you cant stay lower it lower it cant you this to the man in the flies any other night goes but not this night i cant have it i where is the backing for the centre entrance didnt i tell you men van bibber dodged two stage hands who were steering a scene at him stepped over the carpet as it unrolled and brushed through a group of anxious whispering chorus people into the quiet of the stars dressingroom the star saw him in the long mirror before which he sat while his dresser tugged at his boots and threw up his hands desperately well he cried in mock resignation are we in it or are we not are they in their seats still or have they fled how are you john said van bibber to the dresser then he dropped into a big armchair in the corner and got up again with a protesting sigh to light his cigar between the wires around the gasburner oh its going very well i wouldnt have come around if it wasnt if the rest of it is as good as the first act you neednt worry van bibbers unchallenged freedom behind the scenes had been a source of much comment and perplexity to the members of the lester comic opera company he had made his first appearance there during one hot night of the long run of the previous summer and had continued to be an almost nightly visitor for several weeks at first it was supposed that he was backing the piece that he was the angel as those weak and wealthy individuals are called who allow themselves to be led into supplying the finances for theatrical experiments but as he never peered through the curtainhole to count the house nor made frequent trips to the front of it to look at the box sheet but was on the contrary just as undisturbed on a rainy night as on those when the standing room only sign blocked the front entrance this supposition was discarded as untenable nor did he show the least interest in the prima donna or in any of the other pretty women of the company he did not know them nor did he make any effort to know them and it was not until they inquired concerning him outside of the theatre that they learned what a figure in the social life of the city he really was he spent most of his time in lesters dressingroom smoking listening to the reminiscences of lesters dresser when lester was on the stage and this seclusion and his clerical attire of evening dress led the second comedian to call him lesters father confessor and to suggest that he came to the theatre only to take the star to task for his sins and in this the second comedian was unknowingly not so very far wrong lester the comedian and young van bibber had known each other at the university when lesters voice and gift of mimicry had made him the leader in the college theatricals and later when he had gone upon the stage and had been cut off by his family even after he had become famous or on account of it van bibber had gone to visit him and had found him as simple and sincere and boyish as he had been in the days of his hastypudding successes and lester for his part had found van bibber as likable as did every one else and welcomed his quiet voice and youthful knowledge of the world as a grateful relief to the boisterous camaraderie of his professional acquaintances and he allowed van bibber to scold him and to remind him of what he owed to himself and to touch even whether it hurt or not upon his better side and in time he admitted to finding his friends occasional comments on stage matters of value as coming from the point of view of those who look on at the game and even kripps the veteran regarded him with respect after he had told him that he could turn a set of purple costumes black by throwing a red light on them to the company after he came to know them he was gravely polite and to those who knew him if they had overheard amusingly commonplace in his conversation he understood them better than they did themselves and made no mistakes the women smiled on him but the men were suspicious and shy of him until they saw that he was quite as shy of the women and then they made him a confidant and told him all their woes and troubles and exhibited all their little jealousies and ambitions in the innocent hope that he would repeat what they said to lester they were simple unconventional lighthearted folk and van bibber found them vastly more entertaining and preferable to the silence of the deserted club where the matting was down and from whence the regular habitues had departed to the other side or to newport he liked the swing of the light bright music as it came to him through the open door of the dressingroom and the glimpse he got of the chorus people crowding and pushing for a quick charge up the iron stairway and the feverish smell of oxygen in the air and the picturesque disorder of lesters wardrobe and the wigs and swords and the mysterious articles of makeup all mixed together on a tray with halffinished cigars and autograph books and newspaper notices and he often wished he was clever enough to be an artist with the talent to paint the unconsciously graceful groups in the sharply divided light and shadow of the wings as he saw them the brilliantly colored fantastically clothed girls leaning against the bare brick wall of the theatre or whispering together in circles with their arms close about one another or reading apart and solitary or working at some piece of fancywork as soberly as though they were in a rockingchair in their own flat and not leaning against a scene brace with the glare of the stage and the applause of the house just behind them he liked to watch them coquetting with the big fireman detailed from the precinct enginehouse and clinging desperately to the curtain wire or with one of the chorus men on the stairs or teasing the phlegmatic sceneshifters as they tried to catch a minutes sleep on a pile of canvas he even forgave the prima donnas smiling at him from the stage as he stood watching her from the wings and smiled back at her with polite cynicism as though he did not know and she did not know that her smiles were not for him but to disturb some more interested one in the front row and so in time the company became so well accustomed to him that he moved in and about as unnoticed as the stagemanager himself who prowled around hissing hush on principle even though he was the only person who could fairly be said to be making a noise the second act was on and lester came off the stage and ran to the dressingroom and beckoned violently come here he said you ought to see this the children are doing their turn you want to hear them theyre great van bibber put his cigar into a tumbler and stepped out into the wings they were crowded on both sides of the stage with the members of the company the girls were tiptoeing with their hands on the shoulders of the men and making futile little leaps into the air to get a better view and others were resting on one knee that those behind might see over their shoulders there were over a dozen children before the footlights with the prima donna in the centre she was singing the verses of a song and they were following her movements and joining in the chorus with high piping voices they seemed entirely too much at home and too selfconscious to please van bibber but there was one exception the one exception was the smallest of them a very very little girl with long auburn hair and black eyes such a very little girl that every one in the house looked at her first and then looked at no one else she was apparently as unconcerned to all about her excepting the pretty prima donna as though she were by a piano at home practising a singing lesson she seemed to think it was some new sort of a game when the prima donna raised her arms the child raised hers when the prima donna courtesied she stumbled into one and straightened herself just in time to get the curls out of her eyes and to see that the prima donna was laughing at her and to smile cheerfully back as if to say we are doing our best anyway arent we she had big gentle eyes and two wonderful dimples and in the excitement of the dancing and the singing her eyes laughed and flashed and the dimples deepened and disappeared and reappeared again she was as happy and innocent looking as though it were nine in the morning and she were playing school at a kindergarten from all over the house the women were murmuring their delight and the men were laughing and pulling their mustaches and nudging each other to look at the littlest one the girls in the wings were rapturous in their enthusiasm and were calling her absurdly extravagant titles of endearment and making so much noise that kripps stopped grinning at her from the entrance and looked back over his shoulder as he looked when he threatened fines and calls for early rehearsal and when she had finished finally and the prima donna and the children ran off together there was a roar from the house that went to lesters head like wine and seemed to leap clear across the footlights and drag the children back again that settles it cried lester in a suppressed roar of triumph i knew that child would catch them there were four encores and then the children and elise broughten the pretty prima donna came off jubilant and happy with the littlest girls arms full of flowers which the management had with kindly forethought prepared for the prima donna but which that delightful young person and the delighted leader of the orchestra had passed over to the little girl well gasped miss broughten as she came up to van bibber laughing and with one hand on her side and breathing very quickly will you kindly tell me who is the leading woman now am i the prima donna or am i not i wasnt in it was i you were not said van bibber he turned from the pretty prima donna and hunted up the wardrobe woman and told her he wanted to meet the littlest girl and the wardrobe woman who was fluttering wildly about and as delighted as though they were all her own children told him to come into the propertyroom where the children were and which had been changed into a dressingroom that they might be by themselves the six little girls were in six different states of dishabille but they were too little to mind that and van bibber was too polite to observe it this is the little girl sir said the wardrobe woman excitedly proud at being the means of bringing together two such prominent people her name is madeline speak to the gentleman madeline he wants to tell you what a great big hit youse made the little girl was seated on one of the cushions of a double throne so high from the ground that the young woman who was pulling off the childs silk stockings and putting woollen ones on in their place did so without stooping the young woman looked at van bibber and nodded somewhat doubtfully and ungraciously and van bibber turned to the little girl in preference the young womans face was one of a type that was too familiar to be pleasant he took the littlest girls small hand in his and shook it solemnly and said i am very glad to know you can i sit up here beside you or do you rule alone yes maam yes sir answered the little girl van bibber put his hands on the arms of the throne and vaulted up beside the girl and pulled out the flower in his buttonhole and gave it to her now prompted the wardrobe woman what do you say to the gentleman thank you sir stammered the little girl she is not much used to gentlemens society explained the woman who was pulling on the stockings i see said van bibber he did not know exactly what to say next and yet he wanted to talk to the child very much so much more than he generally wanted to talk to most young women who showed no hesitation in talking to him with them he had no difficulty whatsoever there was a doll lying on the top of a chest near them and he picked this up and surveyed it critically is this your doll he asked no said madeline pointing to one of the children who was much taller than herself its at ittle durls my doll hes dead dear me said van bibber he made a mental note to get a live one in the morning and then he said thats very sad but dead dolls do come to life the little girl looked up at him and surveyed him intently and critically and then smiled with the dimples showing as much as to say that she understood him and approved of him entirely van bibber answered this sign language by taking madelines hand in his and asking her how she liked being a great actress and how soon she would begin to storm because that photographer hadnt sent the proofs the young woman understood this and deigned to smile at it but madeline yawned a very polite and sleepy yawn and closed her eyes van bibber moved up closer and she leaned over until her bare shoulder touched his arm and while the woman buttoned on her absurdly small shoes she let her curly head fall on his elbow and rest there any number of people had shown confidence in van bibber not in that form exactly but in the same spirit and though he was used to being trusted he felt a sharp thrill of pleasure at the touch of the childs head on his arm and in the warm clasp of her fingers around his and he was conscious of a keen sense of pity and sorrow for her rising in him which he crushed by thinking that it was entirely wasted and that the child was probably perfectly and ignorantly happy look at that now said the wardrobe woman catching sight of the childs closed eyelids just look at the rest of the little dears all that excited they cant stand still to get their hats on and she just as unconcerned as you please and after making the hit of the piece too shes not used to it you see said the young woman knowingly she dont know what it means its just that much play to her this last was said with a questioning glance at van bibber in whom she still feared to find the disguised agent of a childrens aid society van bibber only nodded in reply and did not answer her because he found he could not very well for he was looking a long way ahead at what the future was to bring to the confiding little being at his side and thinking of the evil knowledge and temptations that would mar the beauty of her quaintly sweet face and its strange mark of gentleness and refinement outside he could hear his friend lester shouting the refrain of his new topical song and the laughter and the handclapping came in through the wings and open door broken but tumultuous does she come of professional people van bibber asked dropping into the vernacular he spoke softly not so much that he might not disturb the child but that she might not understand what he said yes the woman answered shortly and bent her head to smooth out the childs stage dress across her knees van bibber touched the little girls head with his hand and found that she was asleep and so let his hand rest there with the curls between his fingers are are you her mother he asked with a slight inclination of his head he felt quite confident she was not at least he hoped not the woman shook her head no she said who is her mother the woman looked at the sleeping child and then up at him almost defiantly ida clare was her mother she said van bibbers protecting hand left the child as suddenly as though something had burned it and he drew back so quickly that her head slipped from his arm and she awoke and raised her eyes and looked up at him questioningly he looked back at her with a glance of the strangest concern and of the deepest pity then he stooped and drew her towards him very tenderly put her head back in the corner of his arm and watched her in silence while she smiled drowsily and went to sleep again and who takes care of her now he asked the woman straightened herself and seemed relieved she saw that the stranger had recognized the childs pedigree and knew her story and that he was not going to comment on it i do she said after the divorce ida came to me she said speaking more freely i used to be in her company when she was doing aladdin and then when i left the stage and started to keep an actors boardinghouse she came to me she lived on with us a year until she died and she made me the guardian of the child i train children for the stage you know me and my sister ada dyer youve heard of her i guess the courts pay us for her keep but it isnt much and im expecting to get what i spent on her from what she makes on the stage two of them other children are my pupils but they cant touch madie she is a better dancer an singer than any of them if it hadnt been for the society keeping her back she would have been on the stage two years ago shes great she is shell be just as good as her mother was van bibber gave a little start and winced visibly but turned it off into a cough and her father he said hesitatingly does he her father said the woman tossing back her head he looks after himself he does we dont ask no favors of him shell get along without him or his folks thank you call him a gentleman nice gentleman he is then she stopped abruptly i guess though you know him she added perhaps hes a friend of yourn i just know him said van bibber wearily he sat with the child asleep beside him while the woman turned to the others and dressed them for the third act she explained that madie would not appear in the last act only the two larger girls so she let her sleep with the cape of van bibbers cloak around her van bibber sat there for several long minutes thinking and then looked up quickly and dropped his eyes again as quickly and said with an effort to speak quietly and unconcernedly if the little girl is not on in this act would you mind if i took her home i have a cab at the stage door and shes so sleepy it seems a pity to keep her up the sister you spoke of or some one could put her to bed yes the woman said doubtfully adas home yes you can take her around if you want to she gave him the address and he sprang down to the floor and gathered the child up in his arms and stepped out on the stage the prima donna had the centre of it to herself at that moment and all the rest of the company were waiting to go on but when they saw the little girl in van bibbers arms they made a rush at her and the girls leaned over and kissed her with a great show of rapture and with many gasps of delight dont said van bibber he could not tell just why dont why not asked one of the girls looking up at him sharply she was asleep youve wakened her he said gently but he knew that was not the reason he stepped into the cab at the stage entrance and put the child carefully down in one corner then he looked back over his shoulder to see that there was no one near enough to hear him and said to the driver to the berkeley flats on fifth avenue he picked the child up gently in his arms as the carriage started and sat looking out thoughtfully and anxiously as they flashed past the lighted shopwindows on broadway he was far from certain of this errand and nervous with doubt but he reassured himself that he was acting on impulse and that his impulses were so often good the hallboy at the berkeley said yes mr caruthers was in and van bibber gave a quick sigh of relief he took this as an omen that his impulse was a good one the young english servant who opened the hall door to mr carutherss apartment suppressed his surprise with an effort and watched van bibber with alarm as he laid the child on the divan in the hall and pulled a covert coat from the rack to throw over her just say mr van bibber would like to see him he said and you need not speak of the little girl having come with me she was still sleeping and van bibber turned down the light in the hall and stood looking down at her gravely while the servant went to speak to his master will you come this way please sir he said you had better stay out here said van bibber and come and tell me if she wakes mr caruthers was standing by the mantel over the empty fireplace wrapped in a long loose dressinggown which he was tying around him as van bibber entered he was partly undressed and had been just on the point of getting into bed mr caruthers was a tall handsome man with dark reddish hair turning below the temples into gray his mustache was quite white and his eyes and face showed the signs of either dissipation or of great trouble or of both but even in the formless dressinggown he had the look and the confident bearing of a gentleman or at least of the man of the world the room was very richlooking and was filled with the medley of a mans choice of good paintings and fine china and papered with irregular rows of original drawings and signed etchings the windows were open and the lights were turned very low so that van bibber could see the many gas lamps and the dark roofs of broadway and the avenue where they crossed a few blocks off and the bunches of light on the madison square garden and to the lights on the boats of the east river from below in the streets came the rattle of hurrying omnibuses and the rush of the hansom cabs if mr caruthers was surprised at this late visit he hid it and came forward to receive his caller as if his presence were expected excuse my costume will you he said i turned in rather early tonight it was so hot he pointed to a decanter and some soda bottles on the table and a bowl of ice and asked will you have some of this and while he opened one of the bottles he watched van bibbers face as though he were curious to have him explain the object of his visit no i think not thank you said the younger man he touched his forehead with his handkerchief nervously yes it is hot he said mr caruthers filled a glass with ice and brandy and soda and walked back to his place by the mantel on which he rested his arm while he clinked the ice in the glass and looked down into it i was at the first night of the sultana this evening said van bibber slowly and uncertainly oh yes assented the elder man politely and tasting his drink lesters new piece was it any good i dont know said van bibber yes i think it was i didnt see it from the front there were a lot of children in it little ones they danced and sang and made a great hit one of them had never been on the stage before it was her first appearance he was turning one of the glasses around between his fingers as he spoke he stopped and poured out some of the soda and drank it down in a gulp and then continued turning the empty glass between the tips of his fingers it seems to me he said that it is a great pity he looked up interrogatively at the other but mr caruthers met his glance without any returning show of interest i say repeated van bibber i say it seems a pity that a child like that should be allowed to go on in that business a grown woman can go into it with her eyes open or a girl who has had decent training can too but its different with a child she has no choice in the matter they dont ask her permission and she isnt old enough to know what it means and she gets used to it and fond of it before she grows to know what the danger is and then its too late it seemed to me that if there was any one who had a right to stop it it would be a very good thing to let that person know about her about this child i mean the one who made the hit before it was too late it seems to me a responsibility i wouldnt care to take myself i wouldnt care to think that i had the chance to stop it and had let the chance go by you know what the life is and what the temptation a woman van bibber stopped with a gasp of concern and added hurriedly i mean we all know every man knows mr caruthers was looking at him with his lips pressed closely together and his eyebrows drawn into the shape of the letter v he leaned forward and looked at van bibber intently what is all this about he asked did you come here mr van bibber simply to tell me this what have you to do with it what have i to do with it why did you come because of the child what child your child said van bibber young van bibber was quite prepared for an outbreak of some sort and mentally braced himself to receive it he rapidly assured himself that this man had every reason to be angry and that he if he meant to accomplish anything had every reason to be considerate and patient so he faced mr caruthers with shoulders squared as though it were a physical shock he had to stand against and in consequence he was quite unprepared for what followed for mr caruthers raised his face without a trace of feeling in it and with his eyes still fixed on the glass in his hand set it carefully down on the mantel beside him and girded himself about with the rope of his robe when he spoke it was in a tone of quiet politeness mr van bibber he began you are a very brave young man you have dared to say to me what those who are my best friends what even my own family would not care to say they are afraid it might hurt me i suppose they have some absurd regard for my feelings they hesitate to touch upon a subject which in no way concerns them and which they know must be very painful to me but you have the courage of your convictions you have no compunctions about tearing open old wounds and you come here unasked and uninvited to let me know what you think of my conduct to let me understand that it does not agree with your own ideas of what i ought to do and to tell me how i who am old enough to be your father should behave you have rushed in where angels fear to tread mr van bibber to show me the error of my ways i suppose i ought to thank you for it but i have always said that it is not the wicked people who are to be feared in this world or who do the most harm we know them we can prepare for them and checkmate them it is the wellmeaning fool who makes all the trouble for no one knows him until he discloses himself and the mischief is done before he can be stopped i think if you will allow me to say so that you have demonstrated my theory pretty thoroughly and have done about as much needless harm for one evening as you can possibly wish and so if you will excuse me he continued sternly and moving from his place i will ask to say goodnight and will request of you that you grow older and wiser and much more considerate before you come to see me again van bibber had flushed at mr carutherss first words and had then grown somewhat pale and straightened himself visibly he did not move when the elder man had finished but cleared his throat and then spoke with some little difficulty it is very easy to call a man a fool he said slowly but it is much harder to be called a fool and not to throw the other man out of the window but that you see would not do any good and i have something to say to you first i am quite clear in my own mind as to my position and i am not going to allow anything you have said or can say to annoy me much until i am through there will be time enough to resent it then i am quite well aware that i did an unconventional thing in coming here a bold thing or a foolish thing as you choose but the situation is pretty bad and i did as i would have wished to be done by if i had had a child going to the devil and didnt know it i should have been glad to learn of it even from a stranger however he said smiling grimly and pulling his cape about him there are other kindly disposed people in the world besides fathers there is an aunt perhaps or an uncle or two and sometimes even today there is the chance samaritan van bibber picked up his high hat from the table looked into it critically and settled it on his head goodnight he said and walked slowly towards the door he had his hand on the knob when mr caruthers raised his head wait just one minute please mr van bibber asked mr caruthers van bibber stopped with a prompt obedience which would have led one to conclude that he might have put on his hat only to precipitate matters before you go said mr caruthers grudgingly i want to say i want you to understand my position oh thats all right said van bibber lightly opening the door no it is not all right one moment please i do not intend that you shall go away from here with the idea that you have tried to do me a service and that i have been unable to appreciate it and that you are a muchabused and muchmisunderstood young man since you have done me the honor to make my affairs your business i would prefer that you should understand them fully i do not care to have you discuss my conduct at clubs and afternoon teas with young women until you van bibber drew in his breath sharply with a peculiar whistling sound and opened and shut his hands oh i wouldnt say that if i were you he said simply i beg your pardon the older man said quickly that was a mistake i was wrong i beg your pardon but you have tried me very sorely you have intruded upon a private trouble that you ought to know must be very painful to me but i believe you meant well i know you to be a gentleman and i am willing to think you acted on impulse and that you will see tomorrow what a mistake you have made it is not a thing i talk about i do not speak of it to my friends and they are far too considerate to speak of it to me but you have put me on the defensive you have made me out more or less of a brute and i dont intend to be so far misunderstood there are two sides to every story and there is something to be said about this even for me he walked back to his place beside the mantel and put his shoulders against it and faced van bibber with his fingers twisted in the cord around his waist when i married said mr caruthers i did so against the wishes of my people and the advice of all my friends you know all about that god help us who doesnt he added bitterly it was very rich rare reading for you and for every one else who saw the daily papers and we gave them all they wanted of it i took her out of that life and married her because i believed she was as good a woman as any of those who had never had to work for their living and i was bound that my friends and your friends should recognize her and respect her as my wife had a right to be respected and i took her abroad that i might give all you sensitive fine people a chance to get used to the idea of being polite to a woman who had once been a burlesque actress it began over there in paris what i went through then no one knows but when i came back and i would never have come back if she had not made me it was my friends i had to consider and not her it was in the blood it was in the life she had led and in the life men like you and me had taught her to live and it had to come out the muscles of mr carutherss face were moving and beyond his control but van bibber did not see this for he was looking intently out of the window over the roofs of the city she had every chance when she married me that a woman ever had continued the older man it only depended on herself i didnt try to make a housewife of her or a drudge she had all the healthy excitement and all the money she wanted and she had a home here ready for her whenever she was tired of travelling about and wished to settle down and i was and a husband that loved her as she had everything everything that a mans whole thought and love and money could bring to her and you know what she did he looked at van bibber but van bibbers eyes were still turned towards the open window and the night and after the divorce and she was free to go where she pleased and to live as she pleased and with whom she pleased without bringing disgrace on a husband who honestly loved heri swore to my god that i would never see her nor her child again and i never saw her again not even when she died i loved the mother and she deceived me and disgraced me and broke my heart and i only wish she had killed me and i was beginning to love her child and i vowed she should not live to trick me too i had suffered as no man i know had suffered in a way a boy like you cannot understand and that no one can understand who has not gone to hell and been forced to live after it and was i to go through that again was i to love and care for and worship this child and have her grow up with all her mothers vanity and animal nature and have her turn on me some day and show me that what is bred in the bone must tell and that i was a fool again a pitiful fond fool i could not trust her i can never trust any woman or child again and least of all that womans child she is as dead to me as though she were buried with her mother and it is nothing to me what she is or what her life is i know in time what it will be she has begun earlier than i had supposed that is all but she is nothing to me the man stopped and turned his back to van bibber and hid his head in his hands with his elbows on the mantelpiece i care too much he said i cannot let it mean anything to me when i do care it means so much more to me than to other men they may pretend to laugh and to forget and to outgrow it but it is not so with me it means too much he took a quick stride towards one of the armchairs and threw himself into it why man he cried i loved that childs mother to the day of her death i loved that woman then and god help me i love that woman still he covered his face with his hands and sat leaning forward and breathing heavily as he rocked himself to and fro van bibber still stood looking gravely out at the lights that picketed the black surface of the city he was to all appearances as unmoved by the outburst of feeling into which the older man had been surprised as though it had been something in a play there was an unbroken silence for a moment and then it was van bibber who was the first to speak i came here as you say on impulse he said but i am glad i came for i have your decisive answer now about the little girl i have been thinking he continued slowly since you have been speaking and before when i first saw her dancing in front of the footlights when i did not know who she was that i could give up a horse or two if necessary and support this child instead children are worth more than horses and a man who saves a soul as it says he flushed slightly and looked up with a hesitating deprecatory smile somewhere wipes out a multitude of sins and it may be id like to try and get rid of some of mine i know just where to send her i know the very place its down in evergreen bay on long island they are tenants of mine there and very nice farm sort of people who will be very good to her they wouldnt know anything about her and shed forget what little she knows of this present life very soon and grow up with the other children to be one of them and then when she gets older and becomes a young lady she could go to some school but thats a bit too far ahead to plan for the present but thats what i am going to do though said the young man confidently and as though speaking to himself that theatrical boardinghouse person could be bought off easily enough he went on quickly and lester wont mind letting her go if i ask it and and thats what ill do as you say its a good deal of an experiment but i think ill run the risk he walked quickly to the door and disappeared in the hall and then came back kicking the door open as he returned and holding the child in his arms this is she he said quietly he did not look at or notice the father but stood with the child asleep in the bend of his left arm gazing down at her this is she he repeated this is your child there was something cold and satisfied in van bibbers tone and manner as though he were congratulating himself upon the engaging of a new groom something that placed the father entirely outside of it he might have been a disinterested lookeron she will need to be fed a bit van bibber ran on cheerfully they did not treat her very well i fancy she is thin and peaked and tiredlooking he drew up the loose sleeve of her jacket and showed the bare forearm to the light he put his thumb and little finger about it and closed them on it gently it is very thin he said and under her eyes if it were not for the paint he went on mercilessly you could see how deep the lines are this red spot on her cheek he said gravely is where mary vane kissed her tonight and this is where alma stantley kissed her and that lee girl you have heard of them perhaps they will never kiss her again she is going to grow up a sweet fine beautiful woman are you not he said gently drawing the child higher up on his shoulder until her face touched his and still keeping his eyes from the face of the older man she does not look like her mother he said she has her fathers auburn hair and straight nose and finercut lips and chin she looks very much like her father it seems a pity he added abruptly she will grow up he went on without knowing him or who he is or was if he should die she will never speak with him or see him or take his hand she may pass him some day on the street and will not know him and he will not know her but she will grow to be very fond and to be very grateful to the simple kindhearted old people who will have cared for her when she was a little girl the child in his arms stirred shivered slightly and awoke the two men watched her breathlessly with silent intentness she raised her head and stared around the unfamiliar room doubtfully then turned to where her father stood looking at him a moment and passed him by and then looking up into van bibbers face recognized him and gave a gentle sleepy smile and with a sigh of content and confidence drew her arm up closer around his neck and let her head fall back upon his breast the father sprang to his feet with a quick jealous gasp of pain give her to me he said fiercely under his breath snatching her out of van bibbers arms she is mine give her to me van bibber closed the door gently behind him and went jumping down the winding stairs of the berkeley three steps at a time and an hour later when the english servant came to his masters door he found him still awake and sitting in the dark by the open window holding something in his arms and looking out over the sleeping city james he said you can make up a place for me here on the lounge miss caruthers my daughter will sleep in my room tonight van bibbers man servant van bibbers man walters was the envy and admiration of his friends he was english of course and he had been trained in the household of the marquis bendinot and had travelled in his younger days as the valet of young lord upton he was now rather well on in years although it would have been impossible to say just how old he was walters had a dignified and repellent air about him and he brushed his hair in such a way as to conceal his baldness and when a smirking slavish youth with red checks and awkward gestures turned up in van bibbers livery his friends were naturally surprised and asked how he had come to lose walters van bibber could not say exactly at least he could not rightly tell whether he had dismissed walters or walters had dismissed himself the facts of the unfortunate separation were like this van bibber gave a great many dinners during the course of the season at delmonicos dinners hardly formal enough to require a private room and yet too important to allow of his running the risk of keeping his guests standing in the hall waiting for a vacant table so he conceived the idea of sending walters over about halfpast six to keep a table for him as everybody knows you can hold a table yourself at delmonicos for any length of time until the other guests arrive but the rule is very strict about servants because as the head waiter will tell you if servants were allowed to reserve a table during the big rush at seven oclock why not messenger boys and it would certainly never do to have half a dozen large tables securely held by minute messengers while the hungry and impatient waited their turn at the door but walters looked as much like a gentleman as did many of the diners and when he seated himself at the largest table and told the waiter to serve for a party of eight or ten he did it with such an air that the head waiter came over himself and took the orders walters knew quite as much about ordering a dinner as did his master and when van bibber was too tired to make out the menu walters would look over the card himself and order the proper wines and side dishes and with such a carelessly severe air and in such a masterly manner did he discharge this high function that the waiters looked upon him with much respect but respect even from your equals and the satisfaction of having your fellowservants mistake you for a member of the few hundred are not enough walters wanted more he wanted the further satisfaction of enjoying the delicious dishes he had ordered of sitting as a coequal with the people for whom he had kept a place of completing the deception he practised only up to the point where it became most interesting it certainly was trying to have to rise with a subservient and unobtrusive bow and glide out unnoticed by the real guests when they arrived to have to relinquish the feast just when the feast should begin it would not be pleasant certainly to sit for an hour at a big empty table ordering dishes fit only for epicures and then just as the waiters bore down with the little neck clams so nicely iced and so cool and bitterlooking to have to rise and go out into the street to a table dhote around the corner this was walterss state of mind when mr van bibber told him for the hundredth time to keep a table for him for three at delmonicos walters wrapped his severe figure in a frockcoat and brushed his hair and allowed himself the dignity of a walkingstick he would have liked to act as a substitute in an evening dresssuit but van bibber would not have allowed it so walters walked over to delmonicos and took a table near a window and said that the other gentlemen would arrive later then he looked at his watch and ordered the dinner it was just the sort of dinner he would have ordered had he ordered it for himself at some one elses expense he suggested little neck clams first with chablis and peasoup and caviare on toast before the oyster crabs with johannisberger cabinet then an entree of calves brains and rice then no roast but a bird cold asparagus with french dressing camembert cheese and turkish coffee as there were to be no women he omitted the sweets and added three other wines to follow the white wine it struck him as a particularly wellchosen dinner and the longer he sat and thought about it the more he wished he were to test its excellence and then the people all around him were so bright and happy and seemed to be enjoying what they had ordered with such a refinement of zest that he felt he would give a great deal could he just sit there as one of them for a brief hour at that moment the servant deferentially handed him a note which a messenger boy had brought it said dinner off called out town send clothes and things after me to youngs boston van bibber walters rose involuntarily and then sat still to think about it he would have to countermand the dinner which he had ordered over half an hour before and he would have to explain who he was to those other servants who had always regarded him as such a great gentleman it was very hard and then walters was tempted he was a very good servant and he knew his place as only an english servant can and he had always accepted it but tonight he was tempted and he fell he met the waiters anxious look with a grave smile the other gentlemen will not be with me tonight he said glancing at the note but i will dine here as i intended you can serve for one that was perhaps the proudest night in the history of walters he had always felt that he was born out of his proper sphere and tonight he was assured of it he was a little nervous at first lest some of van bibbers friends should come in and recognize him but as the dinner progressed and the warm odor of the dishes touched his sense and the rich wines ran through his veins and the women around him smiled and bent and moved like beautiful birds of beautiful plumage he became content grandly content and he half closed his eyes and imagined he was giving a dinner to everybody in the place vain and idle thoughts came to him and went again and he eyed the others about him calmly and with polite courtesy as they did him and he felt that if he must later pay for this moment it was worth the paying then he gave the waiter a couple of dollars out of his own pocket and wrote van bibbers name on the check and walked in state into the cafe where he ordered a green mint and a heavy black and expensive cigar and seated himself at the window where he felt that he should always have sat if the fates had been just the smoke hung in light clouds about him and the lights shone and glistened on the white cloths and the broad shirtfronts of the smart young men and distinguished foreignlooking older men at the surrounding tables and then in the midst of his dreamings he heard the soft careless drawl of his master which sounded at that time and in that place like the awful voice of a condemning judge van bibber pulled out a chair and dropped into it his side was towards walters so that he did not see him he had some men with him and he was explaining how he had missed his train and had come back to find that one of the party had eaten the dinner without him and he wondered who it could be and then turning easily in his seat he saw walters with the green mint and the cigar trembling behind a copy of the london graphic walters said van bibber what are you doing here walters looked his guilt and rose stiffly he began with a feeble if you please sir go back to my rooms and wait for me there said van bibber who was too decent a fellow to scold a servant in public walters rose and left the halffinished cigar and the mint with the ice melting in it on the table his one evening of sublimity was over and he walked away bending before the glance of his young master and the smiles of his masters friends when van bibber came back he found on his dressingtable a note from walters stating that he could not of course expect to remain longer in his service and that he left behind him the twentyeight dollars which the dinner had cost if he had only gone off with all my waistcoats and scarfpins id have liked it better said van bibber than his leaving me cash for infernal dinner why a servant like walters is worth twentyeightdollar dinners twice a day the hungry man was fed young van bibber broke one of his rules of life one day and came downtown this unusual journey into the marts of trade and finance was in response to a call from his lawyer who wanted his signature to some papers it was five years since van bibber had been south of the north side of washington square except as a transient traveller to the ferries on the elevated road and as he walked through the city hall square he looked about him at the new buildings in the air and the bustle and confusion of the streets with as much interest as a lately arrived immigrant he rather enjoyed the novelty of the situation and after he had completed his business at the lawyers office he tried to stroll along lower broadway as he did on the avenue but people bumped against him and carts and drays tried to run him down when he crossed the side streets and those young men whom he knew seemed to be in a great hurry and expressed such amused surprise at seeing him that he felt very much out of place indeed and so he decided to get back to his club window and its quiet as soon as possible hello van bibber said one of the young men who were speeding by what brings you here have you lost your way i think i have said van bibber if youll kindly tell me how i can get back to civilization again be obliged to you take the elevated from park place said his friend from over his shoulder as he nodded and dived into the crowd the visitor from uptown had not a very distinct idea as to where park place was but he struck off broadway and followed the line of the elevated road along church street it was at the corner of vesey street that a miserablelooking dirty and redeyed object stood still in his tracks and begged van bibber for a few cents to buy food ive come all the way from chicago said the object and i havent tasted food for twentyfour hours van bibber drew away as though the object had a contagious disease in his rags and handed him a quarter without waiting to receive the mans blessing poor devil said van bibber fancy going without dinner all day he could not fancy this though he tried and the impossibility of it impressed him so much that he amiably determined to go back and hunt up the object and give him more money van bibbers ideas of a dinner were rather exalted he did not know of places where a quarter was good for a square meal including one roast three vegetables and pie he hardly considered a quarter a sufficiently large tip for the waiter who served the dinner and decidedly not enough for the dinner itself he did not see his man at first and when he did the man did not see him van bibber watched him stop three gentlemen two of whom gave him some money and then the object approached van bibber and repeated his sad tale in a monotone he evidently did not recognize van bibber and the clubman gave him a halfdollar and walked away feeling that the man must surely have enough by this time with which to get something to eat if only a luncheon this retracing of his footsteps had confused van bibber and he made a complete circuit of the block before he discovered that he had lost his bearings he was standing just where he had started and gazing along the line of the elevated road looking for a station when the familiar accents of the object again saluted him when van bibber faced him the beggar looked uneasy he was not sure whether or not he had approached this particular gentleman before but van bibber conceived an idea of much subtlety and deceived the object by again putting his hand in his pocket nothing to eat for twentyfour hours dear me drawled the clubman sympathetically havent you any money either not a cent groaned the object an im just faint for food sir s help me i hate to beg sir it isnt the money i want its jest food im starvin sir well said van bibber suddenly if it is just something to eat you want come in here with me and ill give you your breakfast but the man held back and began to whine and complain that they wouldnt let the likes of him in such a fine place oh yes they will said van bibber glancing at the bill of fare in front of the place it seems to be extremely cheap beefsteak fifteen cents for instance go in he added and there was something in his tone which made the object move ungraciously into the eatinghouse it was a very queer place van bibber thought and the people stared very hard at him and his gloves and the gardenia in his coat and at the tramp accompanying him you aint going to eat two breakfasts are yer asked one of the very toughlooking waiters of the object the object looked uneasy and van bibber who stood beside his chair smiled in triumph youre mistaken he said to the waiter this gentleman is starving he has not tasted food for twentyfour hours give him whatever he asks for the object scowled and the waiter grinned behind his tin tray and had the impudence to wink at van bibber who recovered from this in time to give the man a halfdollar and so to make of him a friend for life the object ordered milk but van bibber protested and ordered two beefsteaks and fried potatoes hot rolls and two omelettes coffee and ham with bacon holy smoke watcher think i am yelled the object in desperation hungry said van bibber very gently or else an impostor and you know if you should happen to be the latter i should have to hand you over to the police van bibber leaned easily against the wall and read the signs about him and kept one eye on a policeman across the street the object was choking and cursing through his breakfast it did not seem to agree with him whenever he stopped van bibber would point with his stick to a still unfinished dish and the object after a husky protest would attack it as though it were poison the people sitting about were laughing and the proprietor behind the desk smiling grimly there darn ye said the object at last ive eat all i can eat for a year you think youre mighty smart dont ye but if you choose to pay that high for your fun i spose you can afford it only dont let me catch you around these streets after dark thats all and the object started off shaking his fist wait a minute said van bibber you havent paid them for your breakfast havent what shouted the object paid em how could i pay him youse asked me to come in here and eat i didnt want no breakfast did i yousell have to pay for your fun yerself or theyll throw yer out dont try to be too smart i gave you said van bibber slowly seventyfive cents with which to buy a breakfast this check calls for eightyfive cents and extremely cheap it is he added with a bow to the fat proprietor several other gentlemen on your representation that you were starving gave you other sums to be expended on a breakfast you have the money with you now so pay what you owe at once or ill call that officer across the street and tell him what i know and have you put where you belong ill see you blowed first gasped the object van bibber turned to the waiter kindly beckon to that officer said he the waiter ran to the door and the object ran too but the tough waiter grabbed him by the back of his neck and held him lemme go yelled the object lemme go an ill pay you everybody in the place came up now and formed a circle around the group and watched the object count out eightyfive cents into the waiters hand which left him just one dime to himself you have forgotten the waiter who served you said van bibber severely pointing with his stick at the dime no you dont groaned the object oh yes said van bibber do the decent thing now or ill the object dropped the dime in the waiters hand and van bibber smiling and easy made his way through the admiring crowd and out into the street i suspect said mr van bibber later in the day when recounting his adventure to a fellowclubman that after i left fellow tried to get tip back from waiter for i saw him come out of place very suddenly you see and without touching pavement till he lit on back of his head in gutter he was most remarkable waiter love me love my dog young van bibber had been staying with some people at southampton l i where the fall before his friend travers made his reputation as a crosscountry rider he did this it may be remembered by shutting his eyes and holding on by the horses mane and letting the horse go as it pleased his recklessness and courage are still spoken of with awe and the place where he cleared the water jump that every one else avoided is pointed out as traverss leap to visiting horsemen who look at it gloomily and shake their heads miss arnett whose mother was giving the houseparty was an attractive young woman with an admiring retinue of youths who gave attention without intention and for none of whom miss arnett showed particular preference her whole interest indeed was centred in a dog a scotch collie called duncan she allowed this dog every liberty and made a decided nuisance of him for every one around her he always went with her when she walked or trotted beside her horse when she rode he stretched himself before the fire in the diningroom and startled people at table by placing his cold nose against their hands or putting his paws on their gowns he was generally voted a most annoying adjunct to the arnett household but no one dared hint so to miss arnett as she only loved those who loved the dog or pretended to do it on the morning of the afternoon on which van bibber and his bag arrived the dog disappeared and could not be recovered van bibber found the household in a state of much excitement in consequence and his welcome was necessarily brief the arriving guest was not to be considered at all with the departed dog the men told van bibber in confidence that the general relief among the guests was something ecstatic but this was marred later by the gloom of miss arnett and her inability to think of anything else but the finding of the lost collie things became so feverish that for the sake of rest and peace the houseparty proposed to contribute to a joint purse for the return of the dog as even nuisance as it was it was not so bad as having their visit spoiled by miss arnetts abandonment to grief and crossness i think said the young woman after luncheon that some of you men might be civil enough to offer to look for him im sure he cant have gone far or if he has been stolen the men who took him couldnt have gone very far away either now which of you will volunteer im sure youll do it to please me mr van bibber now you say youre so clever were all the time hearing of your adventures why dont you show how full of expedients you are and rise to the occasion the suggestion of scorn in this speech nettled van bibber im sure i never posed as being clever he said and finding a lost dog with all long island to pick and choose from isnt a particularly easy thing to pull off successfully i should think i didnt suppose youd take a dare like that van bibber said one of the men why its just the sort of thing you do so well yes said another ill back you to find him if you try thanks said van bibber dryly there seems to be a disposition on the part of the young men present to turn me into a dogcatcher i doubt whether this is altogether unselfish i do not say that they would rather remain indoors and teach the girls how to play billiards but i quite appreciate their reasons for not wishing to roam about in the snow and whistle for a dog however to oblige the despondent mistress of this valuable member of the household i will risk pneumonia and i will at the same time in order to make the event interesting to all concerned back myself to bring that dog back by eight oclock now then if any of you unselfish youths have any sporting blood you will just name the sum they named one hundred dollars and arranged that van bibber was to have the dog back by eight oclock or just in time for dinner for van bibber said he wouldnt miss his dinner for all the dogs in the two hemispheres unless the dogs happened to be his own van bibber put on his greatcoat and told the man to bring around the dogcart then he filled his pockets with cigars and placed a flask of brandy under the seat and wrapped the robes around his knees i feel just like a relief expedition to the north pole i think i ought to have some lieutenants he suggested well cried one of the men suppose we make a pool and each chip in fifty dollars and the man who brings the dog back in time gets the whole of it that bet of mine stands doesnt it asked van bibber the men said it did and went off to put on their riding things and four horses were saddled and brought around from the stable each of the four explorers was furnished with a long rope to tie to duncans collar and with which he was to be led back if they found him they were cheered ironically by the maidens they had deserted on compulsion and were smiled upon severally by miss arnett then they separated and took different roads it was snowing gently and was very cold van bibber drove aimlessly ahead looking to the right and left and scanning each back yard and side street every now and then he hailed some passing farm wagon and asked the driver if he had seen a stray collie dog but the answer was invariably in the negative he soon left the village in the rear and plunged out over the downs the wind was bitter cold and swept from the water with a chill that cut through his clothes oh this is great said van bibber to the patient horse in front of him this is sport this is the next time i come to this part of the world ill be dragged here with a rope nice hospitable people those arnetts arent they ask you to make yourself at home chasing dogs over an ice fjord dont know when ive enjoyed myself so much every now and then he stood up and looked all over the hills and valleys to see if he could not distinguish a black object running over the white surface of the snow but he saw nothing like a dog not even the track of one twice he came across one of the other men shivering and swearing from his saddle and with teeth chattering well said one of them shuddering you havent found that dog yet i see no said van bibber oh no ive given up looking for the dog im just driving around enjoying myself the airs so invigorating and i like to feel the snow settling between my collar and the back of my neck at four oclock van bibber was about as nearly frozen as a man could be after he had swallowed half a bottle of brandy it was so cold that the ice formed on his cigar when he took it from his lips and his feet and the dashboard seemed to have become stuck together i think ill give it up he said finally as he turned the horses head towards southampton i hate to lose three hundred and fifty dollars as much as any man but i love my fair young life and im not going to turn into an equestrian statue in ice for anybodys collie dog he drove the cart to the stable and unharnessed the horse himself as all the grooms were out scouring the country and then went upstairs unobserved and locked himself in his room for he did not care to have the others know that he had given out so early in the chase there was a big open fire in his room and he put on his warm things and stretched out before it in a great easychair and smoked and sipped the brandy and chuckled with delight as he thought of the four other men racing around in the snow they may have more nerve than i he soliloquized and i dont say they have not but they can have all the credit and rewards they want and ill be satisfied to stay just where i am at seven he saw the four riders coming back dejectedly and without the dog as they passed his room he heard one of the men ask if van bibber had got back yet and another say yes he had as he had left the cart in the stable but that one of the servants had said that he had started out again on foot he has has he said the voice well hes got sporting blood and hell need to keep it at fever heat if he expects to live im frozen so that i cant bend my fingers van bibber smiled and moved comfortably in the big chair he had dozed a little and was feeling very contented at halfpast seven he began to dress and at five minutes to eight he was ready for dinner and stood looking out of the window at the moonlight on the white lawn below the snow had stopped falling and everything lay quiet and still as though it were cut in marble and then suddenly across the lawn came a black bedraggled object on four legs limping painfully and lifting its feet as though there were lead on them great heavens cried van bibber it s the dog he was out of the room in a moment and down into the hall he heard the murmur of voices in the drawingroom and the sympathetic tones of the women who were pitying the men van bibber pulled on his overshoes and a greatcoat that covered him from his ears to his ankles and dashed out into the snow the dog had just enough spirit left to try and dodge him and with a leap to one side went off again across the lawn it was as van bibber knew but three minutes to eight oclock and have the dog he must and would the collie sprang first to one side and then to the other and snarled and snapped but van bibber was keen with the excitement of the chase so he plunged forward recklessly and tackled the dog around the body and they both rolled over and over together then van bibber scrambled to his feet and dashed up the steps and into the drawingroom just as the people were in line for dinner and while the minutehand stood at a minute to eight oclock how is this shouted van bibber holding up one hand and clasping the dog under his other arm miss arnett flew at the collie and embraced it wet as it was and ruined her gown and all the men glanced instinctively at the clock and said youve won van but you must be frozen to death said miss arnett looking up at him with gratitude in her eyes yes yes said van bibber beginning to shiver ive had a terrible long walk and i had to carry him all the way if youll excuse me ill go change my things he reappeared again in a suspiciously short time for one who had to change outright and the men admired his endurance and paid up the bet where did you find him van one of them asked oh yes they all chorused where was he that said mr van bibber is a thing known to only two beings duncan and myself duncan cant tell and i wont if i did youd say i was trying to make myself out clever and i never boast about the things i do
