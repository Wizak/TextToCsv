tomorrow tomorrow by eugene oneil it was back in my sailor days in the winter of my great downandoutness that all this happened in those years of wandering to be broke and on the beach in some seaport or other of the world was no new experience but this had been an unusually long period of inaction even for me six months before i had landed in new york after a voyage from buenos aires as able seaman on a british tramp since that time i had loafed around the water front eking out an existence on a small allowance from my family too lazy of body and mind too indifferent to things in general to ship to sea again or do anything else i shared a small rear room with another gentlemanranker jimmy anderson an old friend of mine over an allnight dive near south street known as tommy the priests this is the story of jimmy my roommate and it begins on a cold night in the early part of march i had waited in tommy the priests hunched up on a chair near the stove in the back room all the late afternoon until long after dark my nerves were on edge as a result of a two days carouse ensuing on the receipt of my weekly allowance now all that money was gone over the bar and the next few days gloomed up as a dreary sober and hungry ordeal which must barring miracles be endured patiently or otherwise three or four others of the crowd i knew were sitting near me equally sick and penniless we stared gloomily before us in listless attitudes spitting dejectedly at the glowing paunch of the stove every now and then someone would come in bringing with him a chill of the freezing wind outside we would all look up hopefully no only a stranger nothing in the way of hospitality to be expected from him close that damned door we would growl in chorus and huddle closer to the stove shivering muttering disappointed curses in mocking contrast the crowd at the bar were drinking singing arguing in each others ears with loud carefree voices none of them noticed our existence surely a bad night for good samaritans i thought and reflected with bitterness that i counted several in that jubilant throng who had eagerly accepted my favors of the two nights previous now they saw me and nodded but that was all suddenly sick with human ingratitude i got out of my chair and grumbling a surly goodnight all to the others went out the side door and up the rickety stairs to our room jimmys and mine the thought of spending a long evening alone in the room seemed intolerable to me i lit the lamp and glanced around angrily a fine hole the two beds took up nearly all the space but jimmy had managed to cram in in front of the window a small table on which stood his dilapidated typewriter the typewriter of course was broken and wouldnt work jimmy was always going to have it fixed tomorrow but then jimmy lived in a dream of tomorrows and nothing he was ever associated with ever worked the lamp on the table threw a stream of light through the dirty window revealing the fireescape outside inside on a shelf along the windowsill a dyspeptic geranium plant sulked in a small red pot this plant was jimmys garden and his joy even when he was too sick to wash his own face he never forgot to water it the first thing after getting up it goes without saying the silly thing never bloomed nothing that jimmy loved ever bloomed but he always hoped in fact he was quite sure it would eventually blossom out in the dawn of some vague tomorrow for me it had value only as a symbol of jimmys everlasting futility of his irritating inefficiency however at that period in my life all flowers were yellow primroses and nothing more and jimmys pet was out of place i thought and in the way books were piled on the floor against the walls and what books where jimmy got them and what for god only knows he never read them except a few pages at haphazard to put him to sleep yet there must have been fifty at least cluttering up the room books about history about journalism about economics books of impossible poetry and incredible prose written by unknown authors and published by firms one had never heard of he had a craze for buying them and never failed on the days he was paid for the odd bits of work he did as occasional stenographer for a theatrical booking firm to stagger weakly into tommys very drunk with two or three of these unreadable volumes clutched to his breast books with titles like a commentary on the bulls of pope leo xiii or god and the darwinian theory by john jones or sunflowers and other verses by lydia smith think of it i used to grow wild with rage as i watched him showing them to tommy or big john if he was on or to anyone else who would look and listen with all the besotted pride in the world i would think of the drinks and the food kippered herring and bread and good italian cheese he might have purchased for the price of these dull works and i would swear to myself to thrash him good and hard if he even dared to speak to me and then jimmy would come and lay his idiotic books on my table and i would look up at him furiously and there he would stand wavering a bit smiling his sweet goodnatured smile trying to force half his remaining change into my hand his lonely wistful eyes watching me with the appealing look of a lost dog hungry for an affectionate pat what could i do but laugh and love him and show him i did by a slap on the back or in some small way or another it was worth while forgetting all the injuries in the world just to see the light of gratitude shine up in his eyes this night i am speaking of i picked up one of the books in desperation and lay down to read with the lamp at the head of the bed but i couldnt concentrate i was too sick in body brain and soul to follow even the words i threw the book aside and lay on my back staring gloomily at the ceiling the inmate of the next room a brokendown telegrapher the lunger we used to call him had a violent attack of coughing which seemed to be tearing his chest to pieces i shuddered he used to spit blood in the back room below in fact when drunk he was quite proud of this achievement but grew terrified at all allusions to consumption and wildly insisted that he only had bloody bronchitis and that he was getting better every day he died soon after in that same room next to ours perhaps his treatment was at fault a quart and a half of fivecent whiskey a day and only a plate of free soup at noon to eat is hardly a diet conducive to the cure of any disease not even bloody bronchitis he coughed and coughed until in a frenzy of tortured nerves i yelled to him for gods sake shut up then he subsided into a series of groans and querulous choking complaints i thought of consumption the danger of contagion and remembered that the window ought to be open but it was too cold besides what was the difference con or something else today or tomorrow it was all the same the end what did i care i had failed or rather i had never cared enough about it all to want to succeed i must have dozed for i came to with a nervous jump to find the lamp sputtering and smoking and the light growing dimmer every minute no oil that fool jimmy had promised to brink back some i had given him my last twenty cents and he had taken the can with him he was sober had been for almost a week was suffering from one of his infrequent and brief efforts at reformation no there was no excuse i cursed him viciously for the greatest imbecile on earth the lamp was going out i would have to lie in darkness or return to the misery of the back room downstairs just then i recognized his step on the stairs and a moment later he came in bringing the oil i glared at him whereve you been i shouted look at that lamp you idiot id have been in the dark in another second jimmy came forward shrinkingly a look of deep hurt in his faded blue eyes he murmured something about office and stooped down to fill the lamp office i taunted scornfully what office what do you take me for ive heard that bunk of yours a million times jimmy finished filling the lamp and sat down on the side of his bed opposite me he didnt answer only stared at me with an irritating sort of compassionate pity how prim he was sitting there is his black suit wispy grey hair combed over his bald spot his jowly face scraped close and chalky with too much cheap powder the vile odor of which filled the room i noticed for the first time his clean collar his fresh shirt he must have been to the chinamans and retrieved part of his laundry this was what he usually did when he had a windfall of a dollar or so from some unexpected source never took out all his laundry that would have been too expensive just called at the chinks and changed his shirt and collar his other articles of clothing he washed himself at the sink in the hallway i eyed him up and down resentfully here was a man who ought always to remain drunk sober he was a respectable nuisance and his shoes were shined why the profound meditation i asked youd think to look at you you were sitting up with my corpse cheer up i feel bad enough without your adding to the gloom thats just it art he began in slow doleful tones i hate to see you in this condition you wouldnt ever feel this way if youd only only he hesitated as he saw my sneer only what i urged only stop your hard drinking he mumbled avoiding my eyes this is almost too much jimmy the water wagon is fatal to your sense of humor after a weeks ride youve accumulated more cheap moralizing than any anchorite in all his years of fasting im your friend he blundered on and you know it art or i wouldnt say it and it hurts you more than it does me ill bet jimmy had the piqued air of the rebuffed but wellintentioned if thats the way you want to take it he was staring unhappily at the floor we were silent for a time then he continued with the obstinacy of the reformed turned reformer im your friend the best friend youve got his eyes looked up into mine and his glance was timidly questioning you know that dont you art all my peevishness vanished in a flash before his woeful sincerity i reached over and grabbed his hand his white pudgy little hand so in keeping with the rest of him warm and soft of course i know it jimmy dont be foolish and take what ive said seriously ive got a fullsized grouch against everything tonight jimmy brightened up and cleared his throat he evidently thought my remarks an expression of willingness to serve as audience for his temperance lecture still he hesitated politely i know you dont want to listen i laughed shortly go ahead shoot im all ears then he began you know the sort of drool introduced by a sage wag of the head and the inevitable remark ive been through it all myself and i know i wont bore you with it coming from jimmy it was the last word in absurdity i tried not to listen concentrating my mind on the man himself my nerves soothed by the monotonous flow of his softvoiced syllables yes hed been through it all there was no doubt of that from soup to nuts what he didnt realize was that none of it had ever touched him deeply forgetful of the last kick his eyes had always looked up at life again with the same appealing timid uncertainty pleading for a caress fearful of a blow and life had never failed to deal him the expected kick never a vicious one more of a shove to get him out of the way of a spirited boot at someone who really mattered spurned jimmy had always returned affectionate uncomprehending wagging his tail ingratiatingly so to speak the longedfor caress would come he was sure of it if not today then tomorrow ah tomorrow i looked searchingly at his face the squat nose the wistful eyes the fleshy cheeks hanging down like dewlaps on either side of his weak mouth with its pale thick lips the usual marks of dissipation were there but none of the scars of intense suffering the whole effect was characterless unfinished as if some sculptor at the last moment had suddenly lost interest in his clay model of a face and abandoned his work in disgust i wondered what jimmy would do if he ever saw that face in the clear cruel mirror of truth straggle on in the same lost way no doubt and cease to have faith in mirrors although most of his lecture was being lost on me i couldnt prevent a chance word now and then from seeping into my consciousness wasted youth your education ability a shame lost opportunity drink some nice girl these words my ears retained against my will and each word had a sting to it gradually my feeling of kindliness toward jimmy petered out i began to hate him for a pestiferous little crank what right had he to meddle with my sins some of the things he was saying were true and truth that kind of truth should be seen and not heard i was becoming angry enough to shrivel him up with some contemptuous remark about his hypocrisy and the doubtful duration of time he would stay on the wagon when he suddenly disgressed from my misdeeds and began virtuously holding himself up as a horrible example he began at the beginning and even though i welcomed the change of subject i swore inwardly at the prospect of hearing the history of his life all over again he had told me this tale at least fifty times while in all stages of maudlin drunkenness usually he wept which was sometimes funny and sometimes not depending on my own condition at all events it would be a novelty to hear his sober version i might get at some facts this time to my surprise this story seemed to be identical with the others i had been lulled to sleep by on so many nights making allowances for the natural exaggeration of one in liquor there was but little difference it started with the anderson estate in scotland where jimmy had spent his boyhood this estate of the family extended over the greater part of a scotch county so jimmy claimed and he was touchy when anyone seemed skeptical regarding its existence he loved to dilate on the beauty of the country the old manor house the farms the game park and all the rest of it all this was heavily mortgaged he admitted and he was not in good standing with most of his relatives on the other side but he declared that there was one aunt far gone in years and hoarded wealth who still treasured his memory and he promised all the gang in the back room a rare blowout should the old lady pass away in the proper frame of mind to all of this the crowd would listen with an amiable pretence of belief for after all he was jimmy and they all swore by him and a fairy tale like that is no great matter to hold against a man but here he was spinning the same yarn in all its details i looked at him suspiciously no he was certainly stone sober could there be any truth in it then impossible i finally concluded that jimmy after the fashion of liars had ended by mistaking his own fabrications for fact he continued on through his years in edinburgh university his graduation with honors his going into journalism first in scotland then in england afterwards as a correspondent on the continent and finally his work in south africa during the boer war as representative of some news service i had never been able to verify any of this except that relating to the boer war an old friend of his had once told me that jimmy did hold a responsible position in south africa during the war and had received a large salary then the old friend oldfriendlike shook his head gravely and muttered too bad too bad drink whether the rest of jimmys life as related by him had ever been lived or not hardly mattered i thought undoubtedly he had been well educated and what is called a gentleman over there of course the anderson estate was a work of fiction or at best a glorified country house and mind you art up to that time jimmys story had reached the point where he was at the front in south africa for the news service company i had never touched a drop except a glass of wine with dinner now and again that was ten years ago and i was thirtyfive then something happened ten years he repeated sadly and now look where i am he stared despondently before him for a moment then brightened up and squared his bent shoulders but thats all past and gone now and im through with this kind of life for good and all theres always tomorrow i ventured ironically yes and im going to make the most of it his eyes were bright with the dream of a new hope or rather the old hope eternally redreamed he glanced at the table ill have to have that typewriter fixed up tomorrow yes tomorrow if i can spare the time he hadnt noticed my sarcasm why is your day all taken up i asked marvelling at his imagination pretty well so he put on an air of importance i saw edwards today edwards was a friend of his who had risen to be an editor on one of the big morning papers and hes found an opening for me a real opening which will give me an opportunity to show them all im still in the race and you start in tomorrow i was dumbfounded yes in the afternoon his face was alive with energy oh ill show them all art that im still one of the best when i want to be theyve sneered at me long enough then you really are about to become a wage slave i simply couldnt believe it honestly art tomorrow do you think im spoofing you about it i must admit you seem to be confessing the shameless truth well at any rate you seem to be pleased so here i jumped up and pumped his hand up and down a million congratulations jimmy old scout jimmys joy was good to see there were tears in his eyes as he thanked me good old jimmy it took him quite a while to get over his emotion then as if he had suddenly remembered something he began hurriedly fumbling through all his pockets i must have lost it he said finally giving up the search i wanted to show it to you what a letter i received today from aunt mary aunt mary was the elderly relative in whose will jimmy hoped to be remembered she complains of having felt very feeble for the past half year she appears to be entirely ignorant of my present condition thank god writes that im to come and pay her a long visit should i decide to take a trip abroad this spring fancy and youve lost the letter i asked trying to hide my skepticism yes was showing it to edwards must have dropped on the floor or else he jimmy stopped abruptly i think he must have sensed my amused incredulity for he seemed very put out at something and didnt look at me i do hope the poor old lady isnt seriously ill he murmured after a pause what i laughed have you the face to tell me that when you know youve been looking forward to her timely taking off ever since ive known you jimmys face grew red and he stammered confusedly he knew hed said things which might have sounded that way when hed been drinking it was whiskey talking and he didnt mean it really he liked her a lot he remembered shed been very kind to him when he was a lad had hardly seen her since then twentyfive years ago no money or no money he wanted her to live to be a hundred but youve told me shes almost ninety now isnt she yes eightysix i think then i said with finality shes overlingered her welcome and youre a simpleton to be wasting your crocodile tears in advance at that besides ive never noticed her sending you any of her vast fortune she might at least have made you a present once in a while if she cared to earn any regrets over her demise ive never written her about my hard luck i hardly ever wrote to her jimmy said slowly his tones were ridiculously dismal and he sat holding his face in his hands in the woebegone attitude of a mourner well you should have written a sudden thought made me smile what will the bunch in the back room say when they hear this you may give them that longpromised blowout tomorrow i added maliciously jimmy stirred uneasily and turned on me a glance full of dim suspicion why do you keep repeating that word tomorrow youve said it now a dozen times because tomorrow is your day jimmy i answered carelessly doesnt your career as a sober industrious citizen begin then oh he sighed with relief i thought he walked up and down in the narrow space between the beds his hands deep in his pockets finally he stopped and stood beside me there was an exultant ring to his voice ah i tell you art its great to feel like a man again to know youre done for good and all with that mess downstairs after a pause he went on in a coaxing motherly tone dont you think you ought to go to work and do something i hate to see you like this you know what a pal i am art you can listen to me its a shame for you to let yourself go to seed this way really art i mean it now jimmy i got up and put my hands on his shoulders i say it without any hard feeling but ive had about enough of your reform movement for one night itll be more truly charitable of you to offer me the price of a drink if you have it your day of reformation is none so remote you cant realize from experience how rotten i feel i can hear polar bears baying at the northern lights jimmy sighed disconsolately and dug some small change out of his pocket i borrowed a dollar from edwards he explained ill pay him back out of my first salary the selfsufficient pride he put into that word salary but his financial aid proved to be unnecessary as i was about to take half of his change there was a great trampling from the stairs outside our door was kicked open with a bang and lyons the stoker and paddy mehan the old deepwater sailor came crowding into the room lyons was in the first jovial frenzy of drink but poor paddy was already awash and rapidly sinking they had been paid off that afternoon after a trip across on the american liner st paul hello lyons hello paddy jimmy and i hailed them in pleased chorus hello yourself lyons crushed jimmys hand in one huge paw and patted me affectionately on the back with the other the jar of it nearly knocked me off my feet but i managed to smile lyons and i were old pals i had once made a trip as sailor on the philadelphia when he was in her stokehold and we had become great friends through a chance adventure together ashore in southampton which is another story he stood grinning swaying a bit in the lamplight a great hard bulk of a man dwarfing the proportions of our little room paddy lurched over to one of the beds and fell on it thick weather thick weather he groaned to himself and started to sing an old chanty in a thin quavering nasal whine aroving aroving since rovings been my ruiin no more ill go arooving with you fair maid shut up roared lyons and turned again to me art how are ye i dodged an attempt at another lovetap and replied that i was well but thirsty thirsty is ut dye hear that paddy ye slimy corkonian heres a mate complainin av thirst and we wid a full pay day in our pockets he pulled out a roll of bills and flaunted them before me with a splendid spendthrift gesture oh whiskey killed my poor old dad whiskey o johnny carolled paddy dolorously listen to im lyons reached over and shook him vigorously thats the throuble wid all thim lazy deckscrubbers the loike av im they cant stand up to their dhrink loike men wake up paddy well be goin below he hauled paddy to his feet and held him there come on art theres some av the boys ye know below waitin yell have all the dhrink ye can pour down your throat and welcome and anything more youre wishful for yeve but to name come on jimmy youre wan av us ive got something to do before i go down ill join you in a few minutes jimmy replied wisely evading a direct refusal see that ye do me sonny boy warned lyons pushing paddy to the door i turned to jimmy as i was going out well good luck till tomorrow jimmy if i dont see you before then thank you art he murmured huskily and shook my hand i started down from the bottom of the flight below i heard lyons rough curses and paddy wailing lugubriously old joe is dead and gone to hell poor old joe yell be in hell yourself if ye fall in this black hole lyons cautioned steering him to the top of the second flight as i caught up with them the fiesta which began with our arrival in the bar didnt break up until long after daylight the next morning it was one of the old lusty debauches of my sailor days songs of the sea and yarns about ships punctuated by rounds of drinks the last i remember was lyons bawling out for someone to come down to the docks and strip to him and see which was the better man have a bit av fun wid im was the way he put it i believe i was dutchcourageous enough to accept his challenge but he pushed me back in my chair with a warning to be a good bye or id get a spanking so the party had no fatal ending as you can well imagine i slept like a corpse all the next day and didnt witness jimmys departure for his long hard climb back to respectability and the man who was when he came home that night he appeared very elated full of the dignity of labor tremendously conscious of his position in life provokingly solicitous concerning my welfare it would have been insufferable in anyone else but jimmy well jimmy was jimmy and the most lovable chap on earth you couldnt stay mad at him more than a minute if you had the slightest sense of humor had he toiled and spun much on his first day i asked him no he admitted after a moments hesitation he had spent the time mostly in feeling about getting the hang of his work now tomorrow hed get the typewriter fixed so he could do sunday special stuff in his spare moments stories of what hed seen in south africa and things of that kind wasnt that a bully idea i agreed that it was and retreated to the gang below who were still celebrating leaving jimmy with pencil poised over a blank sheet of paper determined to map out one of his stories then and there i didnt see him the next day or the day after i was touring the water front with lyons and paddy and never returned to the room the fourth day of his job i ran into him for a second in the hallway he said hello in a hurried tone and brushed past me for my part i was glad he didnt stop i felt hed immediately start on a hearttoheart talk which i was in no mood to hear later on i remembered his manner had been strange and that he looked drawn and fagged out the fifth day paddy and lyons were both broke but i collected my puny allowance and we sat at a table in the back room squandering it lingeringly on enormous scoops of lager and porter which were filling and lasted a long time we were still sitting there talking when jimmy came back from work he looked in from the hallway saw us and nodded but went on upstairs without speaking whats the matther wid jimmy grumbled lyons cant he speak to a man he looks like he was sick said paddy go up art thats a good lad and ask him if he wont take a bit of a drink maybe ill go i said getting up but he wont drink anything jimmys strictly temperance these days hes more likely to give us all a sermon on our sins divil take him then growled lyons but run and get him all the same he looks loike hed been drawn through a crack in the wall i ran quickly up the stairs and opened the door of our room jimmy was sitting on the side of his bed his head in his hands i glanced at the typewriter the keys were still grey with a layer of longaccumulated dust then he hadnt had it fixed the same old tomorrow i thought to myself jimmy i called to him he jumped to his feet with a frightened start when he saw who it was a flush of anger came over his face why dont you scare the life out of a man he said irritably i was astonished id never known him to flare up like this over a trifle come down and join us for a while you dont have to drink you know you look doneup whats the trouble been working too hard he winced at this last remark as if id shaken my fist in his face then he made a frantic gesture with his arms as though he were pushing me out of the room go go back his voice was unnaturally shrill leave me alone i want to be alone jimmy i went to him in genuine alarm whats the matter anything wrong he pressed my hand and tried a feeble attempt at a smile there were dark rings under his eyes and somehow in some indefinable manner he seemed years older a broken old man no art im all right dont mind me ive a splitting headache dont be a fool and let them work you to death he raised his hands as if he were going to clap them over his ears to shut out my words leave me alone art will you im going to bed he stammered righto thats the stuff get a good sleep and youll be o k i went downstairs slowly vaguely worried about him wondering what the trouble could be in the end i laid his peculiar actions to a struggle he was having with his craving for drink paddy and lyons agreed with this opinion and called him a game little swine for sticking to his guns and as such we toasted him in our lager and porter when i went up to the room to turn in he was asleep or pretending to be and i was careful not to disturb him the next morning i heard him moving about but as soon as he saw i was awake he appeared in a nervous flurry to get away and we didnt speak more than a few words to each other that night he never came home at all i went to bed early everyone was broke and there was nothing else to do and when i was roused out of my slumber by the sun shining on my face through the dirty window i saw that his bed hadnt been touched a somber presentiment of evil seemed to hover around that bed the white spread threadbare and full of holes which he had tucked in with such precise neatness had the suggestion of a shroud about it a shroud symbolically woven for one whose life had been threadbare and full of holes i tried to laugh at such grim imaginings jimmy had stayed with edwards or someone else from his paper what was strange in that this wasnt the first time hed remained away all night was it if i was to give way to such worries i might just as well put on skirts and be done with it but my phantoms however foolish refused to be laid i got dressed in a hurry anxious to escape from this room bright with sunlight dark with uncanny threat before i went down struck by a sentimental mood i got some water from the sink in the hallway and poured it on his ridiculous geranium plant after a breakfast of free soup i walked with paddy and lyons down to the battery we spent the afternoon there lounging on one of the benches it was as warm as a day in spring and we sat blinking in the sunshine drowsily listening to each others yarns about the sea and lazily watching the passing ships when the sun went down we returned to tommy the priests on the way back i remembered this was jimmys pay day and wondered if he would show up he owed me some money which i hoped would be forthcoming otherwise the night was liable to prove an uneventful one and a farewell bustup was imperative because paddy and lyons would have to go on board ship the following day if they wanted to make the next trip the evening didnt pass off as dully as we had feared old mcdonald the printer was in a festive mood and invited us to join him two of the telegraph operators out of a job at that time had borrowed some money somewhere and were anxious to return the many treats they had received from us in the past so the time whiled away very pleasantly it was shortly after midnight when jimmy came in as soon as i saw his face i knew that something had happened to him something very serious he was incredibly haggard and pale and there were deep lines of suffering about his mouth and eyes his eyes i cant describe them there was nothing behind them he nodded and took his place at the bar beside us then he spoke asked us what wed have in a strained forced voice as though it cost him a tremendous effort to talk he took whiskey himself poured out a glass brim full and downed it straight big john changed a bill for him and without looking at me he held out the couple of dollars he owed me i put them in my pocket jimmy motioned to big john and called for another round a spell of silence was on the whole barroom everyone there knew him well they had all joked with him during the week about his being on the wagon but they had secretly admired his firmness of will now they stared at him with genuine regret that he should have fallen their faces grew sad they had done the same thing themselves so many times they understood jimmy he caught the reproach in my voice and turned to me with a twisted smile it doesnt matter he said nothing matters his voice became harsh dont forget what you said about my lectures and start in yourself he immediately felt sorry for having said this no art i dont mean that never mind what i say im upset about something tell me what it is jimmy maybe i can help help he laughed hysterically no no help please after all why shouldnt i tell you now youre bound to find out sooner or later theyll all know it he indicated the others who feeling that jimmy wanted to be alone with me had taken their drinks to a table in the rear and were sitting around talking in low constrained voices jimmy blurted out my job art is gone to hell what i pretended more astonishment than i felt i had guessed what the trouble was yes they asked me to quit politely requested edwards was very nice about it very kind very charitable he put all the bitterness of his heart into these last words the rotten swine oh no art it wasnt his fault if they hadnt fired me id have had to resign anyway i i couldnt do the work thats all nonsense jimmy well cheer up all said and done its only a job the less you can always get another for the asking he looked at me with a sort of wild scorn in his eyes cant you understand any better than that what do i care for the job itself it isnt that i tell you i couldnt do the work i tried and tried what i wrote was rot i couldnt get any news no initiative no imagination no character no courage all gone nothing left not even cleverness no memory even he stopped breathing hard the perspiration glistening on his forehead it came to me gradually therealization i couldnt believe it i had been so sure of myself all these years all i needed was a chance it had been so easy for me in the past long ago these last few days ive guessed the truth ive been going crazy last night i walked walked and walked thinking and finally i knew he paused choking back a sob his face twitching convulsively with the effort he made to control himself then he uttered a cracked sound intended for a laugh im done burnt out wasted its time to dump the garbage nothing here he tapped his head with a silly gesture and laughed again i began to be afraid he really was going mad no art it isnt the job thats lost im lost now youre talking like a fool i spoke roughly trying to shake him out of this mood i wont talk any more he said quite calmly dont worry im all shot to pieces no sleep he broke down suddenly and turned away from me but its hell art to realize all at once youre dead i put my arm around his shoulders have a drink jimmy hey you john a little service what else was there to do life had jammed the clear cruel mirror in front of his eyes and he had recognized himself in that pitiful thing he saw have a drink jimmy and forget it take a real drink i urged what else was there to do after we had had a couple at the bar jimmy filling his glass to the brim each time i led him in back and we sat down at the table with the crowd more drinks were immediately forthcoming and it wasnt long before jimmy became very drunk he didnt say anything but his eyes glazed his lips drooped loosely his head wagged uncertainly from side to side i saw hed had enough and i hoped his tired brain had been numbed to a forgetful oblivion come on to bed jimmy i shook him by the arm he stared at me vacantly bed yes sleep sleep he mumbled and came with me willingly enough i helped him up the stairs to the room and lit the lamp he sat on the side of the bed swaying unlacing his shoes with difficulty presently he began to weep softly to himself its you alice cause of all this damn you no didnt mean that beg pardon he muttered he lifted his head and saw me sitting on the other bed one word advice art never get married all rotten all of em this was something new what do you know about marriage i asked curiously nothing from experience surely he winked at me with drunken cunning dont i though not half never told you that what never told you what happened cape town no you never did what was it might swell tell art best friend tell you everything tonight all over yes married in england english girl prettys picture big blue eyes just before war took her south africa with me n left her in cape town when i went to front i was called back to cape town sdenly found her with staff officer dirty swine no chance for doubt didnt expect me to turn up saw them with my own eyes flagrante delictu you know dirty swine of a staff officer good bye jimmy anderson all over drink drink forget he blubbered to himself his face a grotesque masque of tragedy in a flash it came back to me how hed always stopped in the stories of his life at the point where hed commenced drinking even at his drunkest hed always ended the history there by saying abruptly and then something happened id never attached much importance to it thought he merely wanted to suggest a mysterious reason as an excuse for his tobogganing now i knew who could doubt the truth of his statements knowing all he had been through that day he was in a mood for truth so this was the something which happened here was real tragedy real tragedy and there he was sobbing hiccuping rolling his eyes stupidly scratching with limp fingers at the tears which ran down and tickled the sides of his nose i felt a mad desire to laugh i suppose you and she were divorced i asked after a pause no i couldnt no proof no money besides whatd i care about

to death no he interrupted himself hastily cant be that not sbad s that not alice no no mustnt say that not right for me to say that dont know her reason never can tell about women damn shoes he gave up the attempt to get his shoes off and flung himself on the bed fully dressed in a minute he was dead to the world and snoring i left him and went downstairs most of the people in the back room were asleep but paddy and lyons and the operators were still drinking at one table and i sat down with them i talked at random on every subject that came up seeking to forget jimmy and his woes for a time at least his two confessions that night had got on my nerves later on i must have dozed for i was jolted out of a half dream by a sharp cracking smash in the back yard everyone was awake and cursing in an instant big john appeared from behind the curtain grumbling dots right leave bottle on the fire escape you fellers dots right und i have to sweep up we heard someone racing down the stairs and jimmy burst into the room his face was livid his eyes popping out of his head he rushed to the chair beside me and sat down shaking his teeth chattering as if he had a chill i told big john to bring him a drink whats the trouble now jimmy i asked him when hed calmed down a little he appeared to be quite sober after his sleep the geranium he began his lips trembling his eyes filling up so thats what fell down just now is it yes i woke up and i remembered id forgotten to water it i got up and went to get the water the window was open i must have stumbled over something i put out my hand to steady myself it was so dark i couldnt see i knocked it out on the fire escape then i heard it crash in the yard he put his hands over his face and cried heartbrokenly like a sick child whose only remaining toy has been smashed not drunken tears this time but real tears which made all of us at the table blink our eyes and swear fiercely at nothing after a while he grew quiet again attempted a smile asked our pardons for having created a foolish scene he stared at his drink standing untouched on the table in front of him but never made any motion to take it didnt seem to realize what it was for fully fifteen minutes he sat and stared as still as stone never moving his eyes never even seeming to breathe then he got up from his chair and walked slowly to the door like a man in a trance as he was going out he turned to me and said im tired art i think ill go to sleep and something like a wan smile trembled on his pale lips he left the door open behind him and i heard him climbing the stairs and the slam of our door as he closed it behind him a buzz of conversation broke out as if his going had lifted a weight of silence off the roomful of men then it happened a swish a sickish thud as of a heavy rock dropping into thick mud we looked wildly at one another we knew we rushed into the hall and out to the yard there it was a motionless dark huddle of clothes a splintered protruding bone or two a widening pool of blood black against the grey flags jimmy the sky was pale with the light of dawn tomorrow had come
