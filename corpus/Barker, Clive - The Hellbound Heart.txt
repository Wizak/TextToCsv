the hellbound heart by clive barker copyright i long to talk with some old lovers ghost who died before the god of love was born john donne loves deitie one so intent was frank upon solving the puzzle of lemarchands box that he didnt hear the great bell begin to ring the device had been constructed by a master craftsman and the riddle was thisthat though hed been told the box contained wonders there simply seemed to be no way into it no clue on any of its six black lacquered faces as to the whereabouts of the pressure points that would disengage one piece of this threedimensional jigsaw from another frank had seen similar puzzlesmostly in hong kong products of the chinese taste for making metaphysics of hard woodbut to the acuity and technical genius of the chinese the frenchman had brought a perverse logic that was entirely his own if there was a system to the puzzle frank had failed to find it only after several hours of trial and error did a chance juxtaposition of thumbs middle and last fingers bear fruit an almost imperceptible click and thenvictorya segment of the box slid out from beside its neighbors there were two revelations the first that the interior surfaces were brilliantly polished franks reflectiondistorted fragmentedskated across the lacquer the second that lemarchand who had been in his time a maker of singing birds had constructed the box so that opening it tripped a musical mechanism which began to tinkle a short rondo of sublime banality encouraged by his success frank proceeded to work on the box feverishly quickly finding fresh alignments of fluted slot and oiled peg which in their turn revealed further intricacies and with each solutioneach new half twist or pulla further melodic element was brought into playthe tune counterpointed and developed until the initial caprice was all but lost in ornamentation at some point in his labors the bell had begun to ringa steady somber tolling he had not heard at least not consciously but when the puzzle was almost finishedthe mirrored innards of the box unknottedhe became aware that his stomach churned so violently at the sound of the bell it might have been ringing half a lifetime he looked up from his work for a few moments he supposed the noise to be coming from somewhere in the street outsidebut he rapidly dismissed that notion it had been almost midnight before hed begun to work at the birdmakers box several hours had gone byhours he would not have remembered passing but for the evidence of his watchsince then there was no church in the cityhowever desperate for adherentsthat would ring a summoning bell at such an hour no the sound was coming from somewhere much more distant through the very door that lemarchands miraculous box had been constructed to open everything that kircher who had sold him the box had promised of it was true he was on the threshold of a new world a province infinitely far from the room in which he sat infinitely far yet now suddenly near the thought had made his breath quick he had anticipated this moment so keenly planned with every wit he possessed this rending of the veil in moments they would be herethe ones kircher had called the cenobites theologians of the order of the gash summoned from their experiments in the higher reaches of pleasure to bring their ageless heads into a world of rain and failure he had worked ceaselessly in the preceding week to prepare the room for them the bare boards had been meticulously scrubbed and strewn with petals upon the west wall he had set up a kind of altar to them decorated with the kind of placatory offerings kircher had assured him would nurture their good offices bones bonbons needles a jug of his urinethe product of seven days collectionstood on the left of the altar should they require some spontaneous gesture of selfdefilement on the right a plate of doves heads which kircher had also advised him to have on hand he had left no part of the invocation ritual unobserved no cardinal eager for the fishermans shoes could have been more diligent but now as the sound of the bell became louder drowning out the music box he was afraid too late he murmured to himself hoping to quell his rising fear lemarchands device was undone the final trick had been turned there was no time left for prevarication or regret besides hadnt he risked both life and sanity to make this unveiling possible the doorway was even now opening to pleasures no more than a handful of humans had ever known existed much less tastedpleasures which would redefine the parameters of sensation which would release him from the dull round of desire seduction and disappointment that had dogged him from late adolescence he would be transformed by that knowledge wouldnt he no man could experience the profundity of such feeling and remain unchanged the bare bulb in the middle of the room dimmed and brightened brightened and dimmed again it had taken on the rhythm of the bell burning its hottest on each chime in the troughs between the chimes the darkness in the room became utter it was as if the world he had occupied for twentynine years had ceased to exist then the bell would sound again and the bulb burn so strongly it might never have faltered and for a few precious seconds he was standing in a familiar place with a door that led out and down and into the street and a window through whichhad he but the will to tear the blinds backhe might glimpse a rumor of morning with each peal the bulbs light was becoming more revelatory by it he saw the east wall flayed saw the brick momentarily lose solidity and blow away saw in that same instant the place beyond the room from which the bells din was issuing a world of birds was it vast black birds caught in perpetual tempest that was all the sense be could make of the province from whicheven nowthe hierophants were comingthat it was in confusion and full of brittle broken things that rose and fell and filled the dark air with their fright and then the wall was solid again and the bell fell silent the bulb flickered out this time it went without a hope of rekindling he stood in the darkness and said nothing even if he could remember the words of welcome hed prepared his tongue would not have spoken them it was playing dead in his mouth and then light it came from them from the quartet of cenobites who now with the wall sealed behind them occupied the room a fitful phosphorescence like the glow of deepsea fishes blue cold charmless it struck frank that he had never once wondered what they would look like his imagination though fertile when it came to trickery and theft was impoverished in other regards the skill to picture these eminences was beyond him so he had not even tried why then was he so distressed to set eyes upon them was it the scars that covered every inch of their bodies the flesh cosmetically punctured and sliced and infibulated then dusted down with ash was it the smell of vanilla they brought with them the sweetness of which did little to disguise the stench beneath or was it that as the light grew and he scanned them more closely he saw nothing of joy or even humanity in their maimed faces only desperation and an appetite that made his bowels ache to be voided what city is this one of the four enquired frank had difficulty guessing the speakers gender with any certainty its clothes some of which were sewn to and through its skin hid its private parts and there was nothing in the dregs of its voice or in its willfully disfigured features that offered the least clue when it spoke the hooks that transfixed the flaps of its eyes and were wed by an intricate system of chains passed through flesh and bone alike to similar hooks through the lower lip were teased by the motion exposing the glistening meat beneath i asked you a question it said frank made no reply the name of this city was the last thing on his mind do you understand the figure beside the first speaker demanded its voice unlike that of its companion was light and breathythe voice of an excited girl every inch of its head had been tattooed with an intricate grid and at every intersection of horizontal and vertical axes a jeweled pin driven through to the bone its tongue was similarly decorated do you even know who we are it asked yes frank said at last i know of course he knew he and kircher had spent long nights talking of hints gleaned from the diaries of bolingbroke and gilles de rais all that mankind knew of the order of the gash he knew and yethe had expected something different expected some sign of the numberless splendors they had access to he had thought they would come with women at least oiled women milked women women shaved and muscled for the act of love their lips perfumed their thighs trembling to spread their buttocks weighty the way he liked them he had expected sighs and languid bodies spread on the floor underfoot like a living carpet had expected virgin whores whose every crevice was his for the asking and whose skills would press himupward upwardto undreamedof ecstasies the world would be forgotten in their arms he would be exalted by his lust instead of despised for it but no no women no sighs only these sexless things with their corrugated flesh now the third spoke its features were so heavily scarifiedthe wounds nurtured until they balloonedthat its eyes were invisible and its words corrupted by the disfigurement of its mouth what do you want it asked him he perused this questioner more confidently than he had the other two his fear was draining away with every second that passed memories of the terrifying place beyond the wall were already receding he was left with these decrepit decadents with their stench their queer deformity their selfevident frailty the only thing he had to fear was nausea kircher told me there would be five of you frank said the engineer will arrive should the moment merit came the reply now again we ask you what do you want why should he not answer them straight pleasure he replied kircher said you know about pleasure oh we do said the first of them everything you ever wanted yes of course of course it stared at him with its alltoonaked eyes what have you dreamed it said the question put so baldly confounded him how could he hope to articulate the nature of the phantasms his libido had created he was still searching for words when one of them said this worldit disappoints you pretty much he replied youre not the first to tire of its trivialities came the response there have been others not many the gridded face put in true a handful at best but a few have dared to use lemarchands configuration men like yourself hungry for new possibilities whove heard that we have skills unknown in your region id expected frank began we know what you expected the cenobite replied we understand to its breadth and depth the nature of your frenzy it is utterly familiar to us frank grunted so he said you know what ive dreamed about you can supply the pleasure the things face broke open its lips curling back a baboons smile not as you understand it came the reply frank made to interrupt but the creature raised a silencing hand there are conditions of the nerve endings it said the like of which your imagination however fevered could not hope to evoke yes oh yes oh most certainly your most treasured depravity is childs play beside the experiences we offer will you partake of them said the second cenobite frank looked at the scars and the hooks again his tongue was deficient will you outside somewhere near the world would soon be waking he had watched it wake from the window of this very room day after day stirring itself to another round of fruitless pursuits and hed known known that there was nothing left out there to excite him no heat only sweat no passion only sudden lust and just as sudden indifference he had turned his back on such dissatisfaction if in doing so he had to interpret the signs these creatures brought him then that was the price of ambition he was ready to pay it show me he said theres no going back you do understand that show me they needed no further invitation to raise the curtain he heard the door creak as it was opened and turned to see that the world beyond the threshold had disappeared to be replaced by the same panicfilled darkness from which the members of the order had stepped he looked back towards the cenobites seeking some explanation for this but theyd disappeared their passing had not gone unrecorded however theyd taken the flowers with them leaving only bare boards and on the wall the offerings he had assembled were blackening as if in the heat of some fierce but invisible flame he smelled the bitterness of their consumption it pricked his nostrils so acutely he was certain they would bleed but the smell of burning was only the beginning no sooner had he registered it than half a dozen other scents filled his head perfumes he had scarcely noticed until now were suddenly overpoweringly strong the lingering scent of filched blossoms the smell of the paint on the ceiling and the sap in the wood beneath his feetall filled his head he could even smell the darkness outside the door and in it the ordure of a hundred thousand birds he put his hand to his mouth and nose to stop the onslaught from overcoming him but the stench of perspiration on his fingers made him giddy he might have been driven to nausea had there not been fresh sensations flooding his system from each nerve ending and taste bud it seemed he could suddenly feel the collision of the dust motes with his skin every drawn breath chafed his lips every blink his eyes bile burned in the back of his throat and a morsel of yesterdays beef that had lodged between his teeth sent spasms through his system as it exuded a droplet of gravy upon his tongue his ears were no less sensitive his head was filled with a thousand dins some of which he himself was father to the air that broke against his eardrums was a hurricane the flatulence in his bowels was thunder but there were other soundsinnumerable soundswhich assailed him from somewhere beyond himself voices raised in anger whispered professions of love roars and rattlings snatches of song tears was it the world he was hearingmorning breaking in a thousand homes he had no chance to listen closely the cacophony drove any power of analysis from his head but there was worse the eyes oh god in heaven he had never guessed that they could be such torment he whod thought there was nothing on earth left to startle him now he reeled everywhere sight the plain plaster of the ceiling was an awesome geography of brush strokes the weave of his plain shirt an unbearable elaboration of threads in the corner he saw a mite move on a dead doves head and wink its eyes at him seeing that he saw too much too much appalled he shut his eyes but there was more inside than out memories whose violence shook him to the verge of senselessness he sucked his mothers milk and choked felt his siblings arms around him and more so much more a short lifetime of sensations all writ in a perfect hand upon his cortex and breaking him with their insistence that they be remembered he felt close to exploding surely the world outside his headthe room and the birds beyond the doorthey for all their shrieking excesses could not be as overwhelming as his memories better that he thought and tried to open his eyes but they wouldnt unglue tears or pus or needle and thread had sealed them up he thought of the faces of the cenobites the hooks the chains had they worked some similar surgery upon him locking him up behind his eyes with the parade of his history in fear for his sanity he began to address them though he was no longer certain that they were even within earshot why he asked why are you doing this to me the echo of his words roared in his ears but he scarcely attended to it more sense impressions were swimming up from the past to torment him childhood still lingered on his tongue but there were adult feelings joining it now he was grown he was mustached and mighty hands heavy gut large youthful pleasures had possessed the appeal of newness but as the years had crept on and mild sensation lost its potency stronger and stronger experiences had been called for and here they came again more pungent for being laid in the darkness at the back of his bead he felt untold tastes upon his tongue bitter sweet sour salty smelled spice and shit and his mothers hair saw cities and skies saw speed saw deeps broke bread with men now dead and was scalded by the heat of their spittle on his cheek and of course there were women always amid the flurry and confusion memories of women appeared assaulting him with their scents their textures their tastes the proximity of this harem aroused him despite circumstances he opened his trousers and caressed his cock more eager to have the seed spilled and so be freed of these creatures than for the pleasure of it he was dimly aware as he worked his inches that he must make a pitiful sight a blind man in an empty room aroused for a dreams sake but the wracking joyless orgasm failed to even slow the relentless display his knees buckled and his body collapsed to the boards where his spunk had fallen there was a spasm of pain as he hit the floor but the response was washed away before another wave of memories he rolled onto his back and screamed screamed and begged for an end to it but the sensations only rose higher still whipped to fresh heights with every prayer for cessation he offered up the pleas became a single sound words and sense eclipsed by panic it seemed there was no end to this but madness no hope but to be lost to hope as he formulated this last despairing thought the torment stopped all at once all of it gone sight sound touch taste smell he was abruptly bereft of them all there were seconds then when he doubted his very existence two heartbeats three four on the fifth beat he opened his eyes the room was empty the doves and the pisspot gone the door was closed gingerly he sat up his limbs were tingling his head wrist and bladder ached and thena movement at the other end of the room drew his attention where two moments before there had been an empty space there was now a figure it was the fourth cenobite the one that had never spoken nor shown its face not a he now saw but she the hood it had worn had been discarded as had the robes the woman beneath was gray yet gleaming her lips bloody her legs parted so that the elaborate scarification of her pubis was displayed she sat on a pile of rotting human heads and smiled in welcome the collision of sensuality and death appalled him could he have any doubt that she had personally dispatched these victims their rot was beneath her nails and their tonguestwenty or morelay out in ranks on her oiled thighs as if awaiting entrance nor did he doubt that the brains now seeping from their ears and nostrils had been driven to insanity before a blow or a kiss had stopped their hearts kircher had lied to himeither that or hed been horribly deceived there was no pleasure in the air or at least not as humankind understood it he had made a mistake opening lemarchands box a very terrible mistake oh so youve finished dreaming said the cenobite perusing him as he lay panting on the bare boards good she stood up the tongues fell to the floor like a rain of slugs now we can begin she said two its not quite what i expected julia commented as they stood in the hallway it was twilight a cold day in august not the ideal time to view a house that had been left empty for so long it needs work rory said thats all its not been touched since my grandmother died thats the best part of three years and im pretty sure she never did anything to it towards the end of her life and its yours mine and franks it was willed to us both but when was the last time anybody saw big brother she shrugged as if she couldnt remember though she remembered very well a week before the wedding someone said he spent a few days here last summer rutting away no doubt then he was off again hes got no interest in property but suppose we move in and then he comes back wants whats his ill buy him out ill get a loan from the bank and buy him out hes always hard up for cash she nodded but looked less than persuaded dont worry he said going to where she was standing and wrapping his arms around her the place is ours doll we can paint it and pamper it and make it like heaven he scanned her face sometimesparticularly when doubt moved her as it did nowher beauty came close to frightening him trust me he said i do all right then what say we start moving in on sunday sunday it was still the lords day up this end of the city even if the owners of these welldressed houses andwellpressed children were no longer believers they still observed the sabbath a few curtains were twitched aside when lewtons van drew up and the unloading began some curious neighbors even sauntered past the house once or twice on the pretext of walking the hounds but nobody spoke to the new arrivals much less offered a hand with the furniture sunday was not a day to break sweat julia looked after the unpacking while rory organized the unloading of the van with lewton and mad bob providing the extra muscle it took four roundtrips to transfer the bulk of the stuff from alexandra road and at the end of the day there was still a good deal of bricabrac left behind to be collected at a later point about two in the afternoon kirsty turned up on the doorstep came to see if i could give you a hand she said with a tone of vague apology in her voice well youd better come in julia said she went back into the front room which was a battlefield in which only chaos was winning and quietly cursed rory inviting the lost soul round to offer her services was his doing no doubt of it she would be more of a hindrance than a help her dreamy perpetually defeated manner set julias teeth on edge what can i do kirsty asked rory said yes said julia im sure he did where is he rory i mean gone back for another vanload to add to the misery oh julia softened her expression you know its very sweet of you she said to come round like this but i dont think theres much you can do just at the moment kirsty flushed slightly dreamy she was but not stupid i see she said are you sure canti mean maybe i could make a cup of coffee for you coffee said julia the thought of it made her realize just how parched her throat had become yes she conceded thats not a bad idea the coffeemaking was not without its minor traumas no task kirsty undertook was ever entirely simple she stood in the kitchen boiling water in a pan it had taken a quarter of an hour to find thinking that maybe she shouldnt have come after all julia always looked at her so strangely as if faintly baffled by the fact that she hadnt been smothered at birth no matter rory had asked her to come hadnt he and that was invitation enough she would not have turned down the chance of his smile for a hundred julias the van arrived twentyfive minutes later minutes in which the women had twice attempted and twice failed to get a conversation simmering they had little in common julia the sweet the beautiful the winner of glances and kisses and kirsty the girl with the pale handshake whose eyes were only ever as bright as julias before or after tears she had long ago decided that life was unfair but why when shed accepted that bitter truth did circumstance insist on rubbing her face in it she surreptitiously watched julia as she worked and it seemed to kirsty that the woman was incapable of ugliness every gesturea stray hair brushed from the eyes with the back of the hand dust blown from a favorite cupall were infused with such effortless grace seeing it she understood rorys doglike adulation and understanding it despaired afresh he came in at last squinting and sweaty the afternoon sun was fierce he grinned at her parading the ragged line of his front teeth that she had first found so irresistible im glad you could come he said happy to help she replied but he had already looked away at julia hows it going im losing my mind she told him well now you can rest from your labors he said we brought the bed this trip he gave her a conspiratorial wink but she didnt respond can i help with unloading kirsty offered lewton and mb are doing it came rorys reply oh but id give an arm and a leg for a cup of tea we havent found the tea julia told him oh maybe a coffee then right said kirsty and for the other two theyd kill for a cup kirsty went back to the kitchen filled the small pan to near brimming and set it back on the stove from the hallway she heard rory supervising the next unloading it was the bed the bridal bed though she tried very hard to keep the thought of his embracing julia out of her mind she could not as she stared into the water and it simmered and steamed and finally boiled the same painful images of their pleasure came back and back while the trio were away gathering the fourth and final load of the day julia lost her temper with the unpacking it was a disaster she said everything had been parceled up and put into the tea chests in the wrong order she was having to disinter perfectly useless items to get access to the bare necessities kirsty kept her silence and her place in the kitchen washing the soiled cups cursing louder julia left the chaos and went out for a cigarette on the front step she leaned against the open door and breathed the pollengilded air already though it was only the twentyfirst of august the afternoon was tinged with a smoky scent that heralded autumn she had lost track of how fast the day had gone for as she stood there a bell began to ring for evensong the run of chimes rising and falling in lazy waves the sound was reassuring it made her think of her childhood though notthat she could rememberof any particular day or place simply of being young of mystery it was four years since shed last stepped into a church the day of her marriage to rory in fact the thought of that dayor rather of the promise it had failed to fulfillsoured the moment she left the step the chimes in full flight and turned back into the house after the touch of the sun on her upturned face the interior seemed gloomy suddenly she tired to the point of tears they would have to assemble the bed before they could put their heads down to sleep tonight and they had yet to decide which room they would use as the master bedroom she would do that now she elected and so avoid having to return to the front room and to evermournful kirsty the bell was still pealing when she opened the door of the front room on the second floor it was the largest of the three upper roomsa natural choicebut the sun had not got in today because the blinds were drawn across the window the room was consequently chillier than anywhere else in the house the air stagnant she crossed the stained floorboards to the window intending to remove the blind at the sill a strange thing the blind had been securely nailed to the window frame effectively cutting out the least intrusion of life from the sunlit street beyond she tried to pull the material free but failed the workman whoever hed been had done a thorough job no matter shed have rory take a claw hammer to the nails when he got back she turned from the window and as she did so she was suddenly and forcibly aware that the bell was still summoning the faithful were they not coming tonight was the hook not sufficiently baited with promises of paradise the thought was only half alive it withered in moments but the bell rolled on reverberating around the room her limbs already aching with fatigue seemed dragged down further by each peal her head throbbed intolerably the room was hateful shed decided it was stale and its benighted walls clammy despite its size she would not let rory persuade her into using it as the master bedroom let it rot she started toward the door but as she came within a yard of it the corners of the room seemed to creak and the door slammed her nerves jangled it was all she could do to prevent herself from sobbing instead she simply said go to hell and snatched at the handle it turned easily and the door swung open from the hall below a splash of warmth and ocher light she closed the door behind her and with a queer satisfaction the root of which she couldnt or wouldnt fathom turned the key in the lock as she did so the bell stopped but its the biggest of the rooms i dont like it rory its damp we can use the back room if we can get the bloody bed through the door of course we can you know we can seems a waste of a good room he protested knowing full well that this was a fait accompli mother knows best she told him and smiled at him with eyes whose luster was far from maternal three the seasons long for each other like men and women in order that they may be cured of their excesses spring if it lingers more than a week beyond its span starts to hunger for summer to end the days of perpetual promise summer in its turn soon begins to sweat for something to quench its heat and the mellowest of autumns will tire of gentility at last and ache for a quick sharp frost to kill its fruitfulness even winterthe hardest season the most implacabledreams as february creeps on of the flame that will presently melt it away everything tires with time and starts to seek some opposition to save it from itself so august gave way to september and there were few complaints with work the house on lodovico street began to look more hospitable there were even visits from neighbors whoafter sizing up the couplespoke freely of how happy they were to have number fiftyfive occupied again only one of them made any mention of frank referring in passing to the odd fellow whod lived in the house for a few weeks the previous summer there was a moment of embarrassment when rory revealed the tenant to have been his brother but it was soon glossed over by julia whose power to charm knew no bounds rory had seldom made mention of frank during the years of his marriage to julia though he and his brother were only eighteen months apart in age and had as children been inseparable this julia had learned on an occasion of drunken reminiscinga month or two before the weddingwhen rory had spoken at length about frank it had been melancholy talk the brothers paths had diverged considerably once theyd passed through adolescence and rory regretted it regretted still more the pain franks wild lifestyle had brought to their parents it seemed that when frank appeared once in a blue moon from whichever corner of the globe he was presently laying waste he only brought grief his tales of adventures in the shallows of criminality his talk of whores and petty theft all appalled their parents but there had been worse or so rory had said in his wilder moments frank had talked of a life lived in delirium of an appetite for experience that conceded no moral imperative was it the tone of rorys telling a mixture of revulsion and envy that had so piqued julias curiosity whatever the reason she had been quickly seized by an unquenchable curiosity concerning this madman then barely a fortnight before the wedding the black sheep had appeared in the flesh things had gone well for him of late he was wearing gold rings on his fingers and his skin was tight and tanned there was little outward sign of the monster rory had described brother frank was smooth as a polished stone she had succumbed to his charm within hours a strange time ensued as the days crept toward the date of the wedding she found herself thinking less and less of her husbandtobe and more and more of his brother they were not wholly dissimilar a certain lilt in their voices and their easy manner marked them as siblings but to rorys qualities frank brought something his brother would never have a beautiful desperation perhaps what had happened next had been inevitable and no matter how hard shed fought her instincts she would only have postponed the consummation of their feelings for each other at least that was how she tried to excuse herself later but when all the selfrecrimination was done with she still treasured the memory of their firstand lastencounter kirsty had been at the house hadnt she on some matrimonial business when frank had arrived but by that telepathy that comes with desire julia had known that today was the day shed left kirsty to her listmaking or suchlike and taken frank upstairs on the pretext of showing him the wedding dress that was how she remembered itthat hed asked to see the dressand shed put the veil on laughing to think of herself in white and then hed been at her shoulder lifting the veil and shed laughed on laughed and laughed as though to test the strength of his purpose he had not been cooled by her mirth however nor had he wasted time with the niceties of a seduction the smooth exterior gave way to cruder stuff almost immediately their coupling had had in every regard but the matter of her acquiescence all the aggression and the joylessness of rape memory sweetened events of course and in the four years since that afternoon shed replayed the scene often now in remembering it the bruises were trophies of their passion her tears proof positive of her feelings for him the day following hed disappeared flitted off to bangkok or easter island some place where he had no debts to answer shed mourned him couldnt help it nor had her mourning gone unnoticed though it was never explicitly discussed she had often wondered if the subsequent deterioration of her relationship with rory had not started there with her thinking of frank as she made love to his brother and now now despite the change of domestic interiors and the chance of a fresh start together it seemed that events conspired to remind her again of frank it wasnt just the gossip of the neighbors that brought him to mind one day when she was alone in the house and unpacking various personal belongings she came across several wallets of rorys photographs many were relatively recent pictures of the two of them together in athens and malta but buried amongst the transparent smiles were some pictures she couldnt remember ever having seen before family portraits that went back decades a photograph of his parents on their wedding day the black and white image eroded over the years to a series of grays pictures of christenings in which proud godparents cradled babies smothered in the family lace and then photographs of the brothers together as toddlers with wide eyes as surly schoolchildren snapped at gymnastic displays and in school pageants then as the shyness of acneridden adolescence took over the number of pictures dwindleduntil the frogs emerged as princes the other side of puberty seeing frank in brilliant color clowning for the camera she felt herself blushing he had been an exhibitionist youth predictably enough always dressed d la mode rory by comparison looked dowdy it seemed to her that the brothers future lives were sketched in these early portraits frank the smiling seductive chameleon rory the solid citizen she had packed the pictures away at last and found when she stood up that with the blushes had come tears not of regret she had no use for that it was fury that made her eyes sting somehow between one breath and the next shed lost herself she knew too with perfect certainty when her grip had first faltered lying on a bed of wedding lace while frank beset her neck with kisses once in a while she went up to the room with the sealed blinds so far theyd done little decorating work on the upper floors preferring to first organize the areas in public gaze the room had therefore remained untouched unentered indeed except for these few visits of hers she wasnt sure why she went up nor how to account for the odd assortment of feelings that beset her while there but there was something about the dark interior that gave her comfort it was a womb of sorts a dead womans womb sometimes when rory was at work she simply took herself up the stairs and sat in the stillness thinking of nothing or at least nothing she could put words to these sojourns made her feel oddly guilty and she tried to stay away from the room when rory was around but it wasnt always possible sometimes her feet took her there without instruction to do so it happened thus that saturday the day of the blood she had been watching rory at work on the kitchen door chiseling several layers of paint from around the hinges when she seemed to hear the room call satisfied that he was thoroughly engrossed in his chores she went upstairs it was cooler than usual and she was glad of it she put her hand to the wall and then transferred her chilled palm to her forehead no use she murmured to herself picturing the man at work downstairs she didnt love him no more than he beneath his infatuation with her face loved her he chiseled in a world of his own she suffered here far removed from him a gust of wind caught the back door below she heard it slam downstairs the sound made rory lose his concentration the chisel jumped its groove and sliced deeply into the thumb of his left hand he shouted as a gush of color came the chisel hit the floor hell and damnation she heard but did nothing too late she surfaced through a stupor of melancholy to realize that he was coming upstairs fumbling for the key and an excuse to justify her presence in the room she stood up but he was already at the door crossing the threshold rushing toward her his right hand clamped ineptly around his left blood was coming in abundance it welled up between his fingers and dribbled down his arm dripping from his elbow adding stain to stain on the bare boards what have you done she asked him what does it look like he said through gritted teeth cut myself his face and neck had gone the color of window putty shed seen him like this before he had on occasion passed out at the sight of his own blood do something he said queasily is it deep i dont know he yelled at her i dont want to look he was ridiculous she thought but this wasnt the time to give vent to the contempt she felt instead she took his bloody hand in hers and while he looked away prized the palm from the cut it was sizable and still bleeding profusely deep blood dark blood i think wed better take you off to the hospital she told him can you cover it up he asked his voice devoid of anger now sure ill get a clean binding come on no he said shaking his ashen face if i take a step i think ill pass out stay here then she soothed him youll be fine finding no bandages in the bathroom cabinet the equal of the staunching she fetched a few clean handkerchiefs from his drawer and went back into the room he was leaning against the wall now his skin glossy with sweat he had padded in the blood hed shed she could taste the tang of it in the air still quietly reassuring him that he wouldnt die of a twoinch cut she wound a handkerchief around his hand bound it on with a second then escorted him trembling like a leaf down the stairs and out to the car at the hospital they waited an hour in a queue of the walking wounded before he was finally seen and stitched up it was difficult for her to know in retrospect what was more comical about the episode his weakness or the extravagance of his subsequent gratitude she told him when he became fulsome that she didnt want thanks from him and it was true she wanted nothing that he could offer her except perhaps his absence did you clean up the floor in the damp room she asked him the following day theyd called it the damp room since that first sunday though there was not a sign of rot from ceiling to skirting board rory looked up from his magazine gray moons hung beneath his eyes he hadnt slept well so hed said a cut finger and he had nightmares of mortality she on the other hand had slept like a babe what did you say he asked her the floorshe said again there was blood on the floor you cleaned it up he shook his head no he said simply and returned to the magazine well i didnt she said he offered her an indulgent smile youre such a perfect hausfrau he said you dont even know when youre doing it the subject was closed there he was content apparently to believe that she was quietly losing her sanity she on the other hand had the strangest sense that she was about to find it again four kirsty hated parties the smiles to be pasted on over the panic the glances to be interpreted and worst the conversation she had nothing to say of the least interest to the world of this she had long been convinced shed watched too many eyes glaze over to believe otherwise seen every device known to man for wheedling oneself out of the company of the dull from will you excuse me i believe i see my accountant to passing out dead drunk at her feet but rory had insisted she come to the housewarming just a few close friends hed promised shed said yes knowing all too well what scenario would ensue from refusal moping at home in a stew of selfrecrimination cursing her cowardice and thinking of rorys sweet face the gathering wasnt such a torment as it turned out there were only nine guests in toto all of whom she knew vaguely which made it easier they didnt expect her to illuminate the room only to nod and laugh where appropriate and roryhis hand still bound upwas at his most winning full of guileless bonhomie she even wondered if nevilleone of rorys work colleagueswasnt making eyes at her behind his spectacles a suspicion that was confirmed in the middle of the evening when he maneuvered himself to her side and inquired whether she had any interest in cat breeding she told him she hadnt but was always interested in new experiences he seemed delighted and on this fragile pretext proceeded to ply her with liqueurs for the rest of the night by eleventhirty she was a whoozy but happy wreck prompted by the most casual remark to ever more painful fits of giggling a little after midnight julia declared that she was tired and wanted to go to bed the statement was taken as a general cue for dispersal but rory would have none of it he was up and refilling glasses before anyone had a chance to protest kirsty was certain she caught a look of displeasure cross julias face then it passed and the brow was unsullied once again she said her goodnights was complimented profusely on her skill with calfs liver and went to bed the flawlessly beautiful were flawlessly happy werent they to kirsty this had always seemed selfevident tonight however the alcohol made her wonder if envy hadnt blinded her perhaps to be flawless was another kind of sadness but her spinning head had an inept hold on such ruminations and the next minute rory was up and telling a joke about a gorilla and a jesuit that had her choking on her drink before hed even got to the votive candles upstairs julia heard a fresh bout of laughter she was indeed tired as shed claimed but it wasnt the cooking that had exhausted her it was the effort of suppressing her contempt for the damn fools who were gathered in the lounge below shed called them friends once these halfwits with their poor jokes and their poorer pretensions she had played along with them for several hours it was enough now she needed some cool place some darkness as soon as she opened the door of the damp room she knew things were not quite as they had been the light from the shadeless bulb on the landing illuminated the boards where rorys blood had fallen now so clean they might have been scrubbed beyond the reach of the light the room bowed to darkness she stepped in and closed the door the lock clicked into place at her back the dark was almost perfect and she was glad of it her eyes rested against the night their surfaces chilled then from the far side of the room she heard a sound it was no louder than the din of a cockroach running behind the skirting boards after seconds it stopped she held her breath it came again this time there seemed to be some pattern to the sound a primitive code they were laughing like loons downstairs the noise awoke desperation in her what would she not do to be free of such company she swallowed and spoke to the darkness i hear you she said not certain of why the words came or to whom they were addressed the cockroach scratches ceased for a moment and then began again more urgently she stepped away from the door and moved toward the noise it continued as if summoning her it was easy to miscalculate in the dark and she reached the wall before shed expected to raising her hands she began to run her palms over the painted plaster the surface was not uniformly cold there was a place she judged it to be halfway between door and window where the chill became so intense she had to break contact the cockroach stopped scratching there was a moment when she swam totally disoriented in darkness and silence and then something moved in front of her a trick of her minds eye she assumed for there was only imagined light to be had here but the next spectacle showed her the error of that assumption the wall was alight or rather something behind it burned with a cold luminescence that made the solid brick seem insubstantial stuff more the wall seemed to be coming apart segments of it shifting and dislocating like a magicians prop oiled panels giving on to hidden boxes whose sides in turn collapsed to reveal some further hiding place she watched fixedly not daring to even blink for fear she miss some detail of this extraordinary sleightofhand while pieces of the world came apart in front of her eyes then suddenly somewhere in this ever more elaborate system of sliding fragments she saw movement only now did she realize that shed been holding her breath since this display began and was beginning to become lightheaded she tried to empty her lungs of the stale air and take a draught of fresh but her body would not obey this simple instruction somewhere in her innards a tic of panic began the hocuspocus had stopped now leaving one part of her admiring quite dispassionately the tinkling music that was coming from the wall the other part fighting the fear that rose in her throat step by step again she tried to take a breath but it was as if her body had died and she was staring out of it unable now to breathe or blink or swallow the spectacle of the unfolding wall had now ceased entirely and she saw something flicker across the brick ragged enough to be shadow but too substantial it was human she saw or had been but the body had been ripped apart and sewn together again with most of its pieces either missing or twisted and blackened as if in a furnace there was an eye gleaming at her and the ladder of a spine the vertebrae stripped of muscle a few unrecognizable fragments of anatomy that was it that such a thing might live beggared reasonwhat little flesh it owned was hopelessly corrupted yet live it did its eye despite the rot it was rooted in scanned her every inch up and down she felt no fear in its presence this thing was weaker than her by far it moved a little in its cell looking for some modicum of comfort but there was none to be had not for a creature that wore its frayed nerves on its bleeding sleeve every place it might lay its body brought pain this she knew indisputably she pitied it and with pity came release her body expelled dead air and sucked in living her oxygenstarved brain reeled even as she did so it spoke a hole opening up in the flayed ball of the monsters head and issued a single weightless word the word was julia kirsty put down her glass and tried to stand up where are you going neville asked where do you think she replied consciously trying to prevent the words from slurring do you need any help rory inquired the alcohol made his lids lazy and his grin lazier still i am housetrained she replied the riposte greeted with laughter all around she was pleased with herself offthecuff wit was not her forte she stumbled to the door its the last room on the right at the end of the landing rory informed her i know she said and stepped out into the hall she didnt usually enjoy the sensation of drunkenness but tonight she was reveling in it she felt looselimbed and lighthearted she might well regret this tomorrow but tomorrow would have to take care of itself for tonight she was flying she found her way to the bathroom and relieved her aching bladder then splashed some water onto her face that done she began her return journey she had taken three steps along the landing when she realized that somebody had put out the landing light while she was in the bathroom and that same somebody was now standing a few yards away from her she stopped hello she said had the cat breeder followed her upstairs in the hope of proving he wasnt spayed is that you she asked only dimly aware that this was a singularly fruitless line of inquiry there was no reply and she became a little uneasy come on she said attempting a jocular manner that she hoped masked her anxiety who is it me said julia her voice was odd throaty perhaps tearful are you all right kirsty asked her she wished she could see julias face yes came the reply why shouldnt i be within the space of those five words the actress in julia seized control the voice cleared the tone lightened im just tired she went on it sounds like youre having a good time down there are we keeping you awake goodness me no the voice gushed i was just going to the bathroom a pause then you go back down enjoy yourself at this cue kirsty moved toward her along the landing at the last possible moment julia stepped out of the way avoiding even the slightest physical contact sleep well kirsty said at the top of the stairs but there was no reply forthcoming from the shadow on the landing julia didnt sleep well not that night nor any night that followed what shed seen in the damp room what shed heard and finally feltwas enough to keep easy slumbers at bay forever or so she began to believe he was here brother frank was here in the houseand had been all the time locked away from the world in which she lived and breathed but close enough to make the frail pitiful contact he had the whys and the wherefores of this she had no clue to the human detritus in the wall had neither the strength nor the time to articulate its condition all it said before the wall began to close on it again and its wreckage was once more eclipsed by brick and plaster was julia then simply its frank and at the very end the word blood then it was gone completely and her legs had given way beneath her shed half fallen half staggered backward against the opposite wall by the time she gathered her wits about her once more there was no mysterious light no wasted figure cocooned in the brick realitys hold was absolute once again not quite absolute perhaps frank was still here in the damp room of that she had no doubt out of sight he might be but not out of mind he was trapped somehow between the sphere she occupied and some other place a place of bells and troubled darkness had he died was that it perished in the empty room the previous summer and now awaiting exorcism if so what had happened to his earthly remains only further exchange with frank himself or the remnants thereof would provide an explanation of the means by which she could lend the lost soul strength she had little doubt he had given her the solution plainly blood hed said the syllable had been spoken not as an accusation but as an imperative rory had bled on the floor of the damp room the splashes had subsequently disappeared somehow franks ghostif that it washad fed upon his brothers spillage and gained thereby nourishment enough to reach out from his cell and make faltering contact what more might be achieved if the supply were larger she thought of franks embraces of his roughness his hardness of the insistence he had brought to bear upon her what would she not give to have such insistence again perhaps it was possible and if it wereif she could give him the sustenance he neededwould he not be grateful would he not be her pet docile or brutal at her least whim the thought took sleep away took sanity and sorrow with it she had been in love all this time she realized and mourning for him if it took blood to restore him to her then blood she would supply and not think twice of the consequences in the days that followed she found her smile again rory took the change of mood as a sign that she was happy in the new house her good humor ignited the same in him he took to the redecoration with renewed gusto soon he said he would get to work on the second floor they would locate the source of dampness in the large room and turn it into a bedroom fit for his princess she kissed his cheek when he spoke of this and she said that she was in no hurry that the room they had already was more than adequate talk of the bedroom made him stroke her neck and pull her close and whisper infantile obscenities in her ear she did not refuse him but went upstairs meekly and let him undress her as he liked to do unbuttoning her with paintstained fingers she pretended the ceremony aroused her though this was far from the truth the only thing that sparked the least appetite in her as she lay on the creaking bed with his bulk between her legs was closing her eyes and picturing frank as he had been more than once his name rose to her lips each time she bit it back finally she opened her eyes to remind herself of the boorish truth rory was decorating her face with his kisses her cheeks crawled at his touch she would not be able to endure this too often she realized it was too much of an effort to play the acquiescent wife her heart would burst thus lying beneath him while septembers breath brushed her face from the open window she began to plot the getting of blood five sometimes it seemed that eons came and went while he lingered in the wall eons that some clue would later reveal to have been the passing of hours or even minutes but now things had changed he had a chance of escape his spirit soared at the thought it was a frail chance he didnt deceive himself about that there were several reasons his best efforts might falter julia for one he remembered her as a trite preening woman whose upbringing had curbed her capacity for passion he had untamed her of course once he remembered the day among the thousands of times he had performed that act with some satisfaction she had resisted no more than was needful for her vanity then succumbed with such naked fervor he had almost lost control of himself in other circumstances he might have snatched her from under her wouldbe husbands nose but fraternal politics counseled otherwise in a week or two he would have tired of her and been left not only with a woman whose body was already an eyesore to him but also a vengeful brother on his heels it hadnt been worth the hassle besides thered been new worlds to conquer he had left the day after to go east to hong king and sri lanka to wealth and adventure hed had them too at least for a while but everything slipped through his fingers sooner or later and with time he began to wonder whether it was circumstance that denied him a good hold on his earnings or whether he simply didnt care enough to keep what he had the train of thought once begun was a runaway everywhere in the wreckage around him he found evidence to support the same bitter thesis that he had encountered nothing in his lifeno person no state of mind or bodyhe wanted sufficiently to suffer even passing discomfort for a downward spiral began he spent three months in a wash of depression and selfpity that bordered on the suicidal but even that solution was denied him by his newfound nihilism if nothing was worth living for it followed didnt it that there was nothing worth dying for either he stumbled from one such sterility to the next until all thoughts were rotted away by whatever opiate his immoralities could earn him how had he first heard about lemarchands box he couldnt remember in a bar maybe or a gutter from the lips of a fellow derelict at the time it was merely a rumorthis dream of a pleasure dome where those who had exhausted the trivial delights of the human condition might discover a fresh definition of joy and the route to this paradise there were several he was told charts of the interface between the real and the realer still made by travelers whose bones had long since gone to dust one such chart was in the vaults of the vatican hidden in code in a theological work unread since the reformation anotherin the form of an origami exercise was reported to have been in the possession of the marquis de sade who used it while imprisoned in the bastille to barter with a guard for paper on which to write the days of sodom yet another was made by a craftsmana maker of singing birdscalled lemarchand in the form of a musical box of such elaborate design a man might toy with it half a lifetime and never get inside stories stories yet since he had come to believe in nothing at all it was not so difficult to put the tyranny of verifiable truth out of his head and it passed the time musing drunkenly on such fantasies it was in dьsseldorf where hed gone smuggling heroin that he again encountered the story of lemarchands box his curiosity was piqued once more but this time he followed the story up until he found its source the mans name was kircher though he probably laid claim to half a dozen others yes the german could confirm the existence of the box and yes he could see his way to letting frank have it the price small favors here and there nothing exceptional frank did the favors washed his hands and claimed his payment there had been instructions from kircher on how best to break the seal on lemarchands device instructions that were part pragmatic part metaphysical to solve the puzzle is to travel hed said or something like that the box it seemed was not just the map of the road but the road itself this new addiction quickly cured him of dope and drink perhaps there were other ways to bend the world to suit the shape of his dreams he came back to the house on lodovico street to the empty house behind whose walls he was now imprisoned and prepared himselfjust as kircher had detailedfor the challenge of solving lemarchands configuration he had never in his life been so abstemious nor so singleminded in the days before the onslaught on the box he led a life that would have shamed a saint focusing all his energies on the ceremonies ahead he had been arrogant in his dealing with the order of the gash he saw that now but there were everywherein the world and out of itforces that encouraged such arrogance because they traded on it that in itself would not have undone him no his real error had been the naive belief that his definition of pleasure significantly overlapped with that of the cenobites as it was they had brought incalculable suffering they had overdosed him on sensuality until his mind teetered on madness then theyd initiated him into experiences that his nerves still convulsed to recall they had called it pleasure and perhaps theyd meant it perhaps not it was impossible to know with these minds they were so hopelessly flawlessly ambiguous they recognized no principles of reward and punishment by which he could hope to win some respite from their tortures nor were they touched by any appeal for mercy hed tried that over the weeks and months that separated the solving of the box from today there was no compassion to be had on this side of the schism there was only the weeping and the laughter tears of joy sometimes laughter coming just as paradoxically in the face of some new horror fashioned by the engineer for the provision of grief there was a further sophistication to the torture devised by a mind that understood exquisitely the nature of suffering the prisoners were allowed to see into the world they had once occupied their resting placeswhen they were not enduring pleasurelooked out onto the very locations where they had once worked the configuration that had brought them here in franks case onto the upper room of number fiftyfive lodovico street for the best part of a year it had been an unilluminating view nobody had ever stepped into the house and then theyd come rory and the lovely julia and hope had begun again there were ways to escape hed heard it whispered loopholes in the system that might allow a mind supple or cunning enough egress into the room from which it had come if a prisoner were able to make such an escape there was no way that the hierophants could follow they had to be summoned across the schism without such an invitation they were left like dogs on the doorstep scratching and scratching but unable to get in escape therefore if it could be achieved brought with it a decree absolute total dissolution of the mistaken marriage which the prisoner had made it was a risk worth taking indeed it was no risk at all what punishment could be meted out worse than the thought of pain without hope of release he had been lucky some prisoners had departed from the world without leaving sufficient sign of themselves from which given an adequate collision of circumstances their bodies might be remade he had almost his last act bar the shouting had been to empty his testicles onto the floor dead sperm was a meager keepsake of his essential self but enough when dear brother rory had let his chisel slip there was something of frank to profit from the pain he had found a fingerhold for himself and a glimpse of strength with which he might haul himself to safety now it was up to julia sometimes suffering in the wall he thought she would desert him out of fear either that or shed rationalize the vision shed seen and decide shed been dreaming if so he was lost he lacked the energy to repeat the appearance but there were signs that gave him cause for hope the fact that she returned to the room on two or three occasions for instance and simply stood in the gloom watching the wall shed even muttered a few words on the second visit though hed caught only scraps the word here was amongst them and waiting and soon enough to keep him from despair he had another prop to his optimism she was lost wasnt she hed seen that in her face whenbefore the day rory had chiseled himselfshe and his brother had had occasion to be in the room together hed read the looks between the lines the moments when her guard had slipped and the sadness and frustration she felt were apparent yes she was lost married to a man she felt no love for and unable to see a way out well here he was they could save each other the way the poets promised lovers should he was mystery he was darkness he was all she had dreamed of and if she would only free him he would service heroh yesuntil her pleasure reached that threshold that like all thresholds was a place where the strong grew stronger and the weak perished pleasure was pain there and vice versa and he knew it well enough to call it home six it turned cold in the third week of september an arctic chill brought on a rapacious wind that stripped the trees of leaves in a handful of days the cold necessitated a change of costume and a change of plan instead of walking julia took the car drove down to the city center in the early afternoon and found a bar in which the lunchtime trade was brisk but not clamorous the customers came and went young turks from firms of lawyers and accountants debating their ambitions parties of wineimbibers whose only claim to sobriety was their suits and more interestingly a smattering of individuals who sat alone at their tables and simply drank she garnered a good crop of admiring glances but they were mostly from the young turks it wasnt until shed been in the place an hour and the wage slaves were returning to their treadmills that she caught sight of somebody watching her reflection in the bar mirror for the next ten minutes his eyes were glued to her she went on drinking trying to conceal any sign of agitation and then without warning he stood up and crossed to her table drinking alone he said she wanted to run her heart was pounding so furiously she was certain he must hear it but no he asked her if she wanted another drink she said she did clearly pleased not to have been rebuffed he went to the bar ordered doubles and returned to her side he was ruddyfeatured and one size larger than his dark blue suit only his eyes betrayed any sign of nervousness resting on her for moments only then darting away like startled fish there would be no serious conversation that she had already decided she didnt want to know much about him his name if necessary his profession and marital status if he insisted beyond that let him be just a body as it was there was no danger of a confessional shed met more talkative paving stones he smiled occasionallya short nervous smile that showed teeth too even to be realand offered more drinks she said no wanting the chase over with as soon as possible and instead asked if he had time for a coffee he said he had the house is only a few minutes from here she replied and they went to her car she kept wondering as she drovethe meat on the seat beside herwhy this was so very easy was it that the man was plainly a victimwith his ineffectual eyes and his artificial teethborn did he but know it to make this journey yes perhaps that was it she was not afraid because all of this was so perfectly predictable as she turned the key in the front door and stepped into the house she thought she heard a noise in the kitchen had rory returned home early ill perhaps she called out there was no reply the house was empty almost from the threshold on she had the thing planned meticulously she closed the door the man in the blue suit stared at his manicured hands and waited for his cue i get lonely sometimes she told him as she brushed past him it was a line shed come up with in bed the previous night he only nodded by way of response the expression on his face a mingling of fear and incredulity he clearly couldnt quite believe his luck do you want another drink she asked him or shall we go straight upstairs he only nodded again which i think maybe ive drunk enough already upstairs then he made an indecisive move in her direction as though he might have intended a kiss she wanted no courtship however skirting his touch she crossed to the bottom of the stairs ill lead she said meekly he followed at the top of the steps she glanced round at him and caught him dabbing sweat from his chin with his handkerchief she waited until he caught up with her and then led him halfway along the landing to the damp room the door had been left ajar come on in she said he obeyed once inside it took him a few moments to become accustomed to the gloom and a further time to give voice to his observation theres no bed she closed the door and switched on the light she had hung one of rorys old jackets on the back of the door in its pocket shed left the knife he said again no bed whats wrong with the floor she replied the floor take off your jacket youre warm i am he agreed but did nothing so she moved across to him and began to slip the knot of his tie he was trembling poor lamb poor bleatless lamb while she removed the tie he began to shrug off his jacket was frank watching this she wondered her eyes strayed momentarily to the wall yes she thought hes there he sees he knows he licks his lips and grows impatient the lamb spoke why dont you he began why dont you maybedo the same would you like to see me naked she teased the words made his eyes gleam yes he said thickly yes id like that very much very much he was unbuttoning his shirt maybe you will she said he gave her that dwarf smile again is it a game he ventured if you want it to be she said and helped him out of his shirt his body was pale and waxy like a fungus his upper chest was heavy his belly too she put her hands to his face he kissed her fingertips youre beautiful he said spitting the words out as though theyd been vexing him for hours am i you know you are lovely loveliest woman i ever set eyes on thats gallant of you she said and turned back to the door behind her she heard his belt buckle clink and the sound of cloth slipping over skin as he dropped his trousers so far and no farther she thought she had no wish to see him babenaked it was enough to have him like this she reached into the jacket pocket oh dear the lamb suddenly said she let the knife lie what is it she asked turning to look at him if the ring on his finger hadnt already given his status away she would have known him to be a married man by the underpants he wore baggy and overwashed an unflattering garment bought by a wife who had long since ceased to think of her husband in sexual terms i think i need to empty my bladder he said too many whiskies she shrugged a small shrug and turned back to the door wont be a moment he said at her back but her hand was in the jacket pocket before the words were out and as he stepped towards the door she turned on him slaughtering knife in hand his pace was too quick to see the blade until the very last moment and even then it was bemusement that crossed his face not fear it was a shortlived look the knife was in him a moment after slicing his belly with the ease of a blade in overripe cheese she opened one cut and then another as the blood started she was certain the room flickered the bricks and mortar trembling to see the spurts that flew from him she had a breaths length to admire the phenomena no more before the lamb let out a wheezing curse andinstead of moving out of the knifes range as she had anticipatedtook a step toward her and knocked the weapon from her hand it spun across the floorboards and collided with the skirting then he was upon her he put his hand into her hair and took a fistful it seemed his intention was not violence but escape for he relinquished his hold as soon as hed pulled away from the door she fell against the wall looking up to see him wrestling with the door handle his free hand clamped to his cuts she was quick now across to where the knife lay up and back toward him in one fluid motion he had got the door open by inches but not far enough she brought the knife down in the middle of his pockmarked back he yelled and released the door handle she was already drawing the knife out and plunging into him a second time and now a third and a fourth indeed she lost count of the wounds she made her attack lent venom by his refusal to lie down and die he stumbled around the room grieving and complaining blood following blood onto his buttocks and legs finally after an age of this farcical stuff he keeled over and hit the floor this time she was certain her senses did not deceive her the room or the spirit in it responded with soft sighs of anticipation somewhere a bell was ringing almost as an afterthought she registered that the lamb had stopped breathing she crossed the bloodspangled floor to where he lay and said enough then she went to wash her face as she moved down the landing she heard the room groanthere was no other word for it she stopped in her tracks almost tempted to go back but the blood was drying on her hands and its stickiness revolted her in the bathroom she stripped off her flowerpatterned blouse and rinsed first her hands then her speckled arms and finally her neck the dowsing both chilled and braced her it felt good that done she washed the knife rinsed the sink and returned along the landing without bothering to dry herself or to dress she had no need for either the room was like a furnace as the dead mans energies pulsed from his body they didnt get far already the blood on the floor was crawling away toward the wall where frank was the beads seeming to boil and evaporate as they came within range of the skirting boards she watched entranced but there was more something was happening to the corpse it was being drained of every nutritious element the body convulsing as its innards were sucked out gases moaning in its bowels and throat the skin dessicating in front of her startled eyes at one point the plastic teeth dropped back into the gullet the gums withered around them and in mere moments it was done anything the body might have usefully offered by way of nourishment had been taken the husk that remained would not have sustained a family of fleas she was impressed suddenly the bulb began to flicker she looked to the wall expecting it to tremble and spit her lover from hiding but no the bulb went out there was only the dim light that crept through the agebeaten blind where are you she said the walls remained mute where are you still nothing the room was cooling her breasts had grown gooseflesh she peered down at the luminous watch on the lambs shriveled arm it ticked away indifferent to the apocalypse that had overtaken its owner it read rory would be back anytime after depending on how dense the traffic was she had work to do before then bundling up the blue suit and the rest of his clothes she put them in several plastic bags and then went in search of a larger bag for the remains she had expected frank to be here to help her with this labor but as he hadnt shown she had no choice but to do it herself when she came back to the room the deterioration of the lamb was still continuing though now much slowed perhaps frank was still finding nutriments to squeeze from the corpse but she doubted it more likely the pauperized body sucked clean of marrow and every vital fluid was no longer strong enough to support itself when she had parceled it up in the bag it was the weight of a small child no more sealing the bag up she was about to take it down to the car when she heard the front door open the sound undammed all the panic shed so assiduously kept from herself she began to shake tears pricked her sinuses not now she told herself but the feelings would simply not be suppressed any longer in the hallway below rory said sweetheart sweetheart she could have laughed but for the terror she was here if he wanted to find herhis sweetheart his honeybunwith her breasts newwashed and a dead man in her arms where are you she hesitated before replying not certain that her larynx was the equal of the deception he called a third time his voice changing timbre as he walked through into the kitchen it would take him a moment only to discover that she wasnt at the cooker stirring sauce then he would come back and head up the stairs she had ten seconds fifteen at most attempting to keep her tread as light as possible for fear he heard her movements overhead she carried the bundle to the spare room at the end of the landing too small to be used as a bedroom they had used it as a dump halfemptied tea chests pieces of furniture they had not found a place for all manner of rubbish here she laid the body to rest awhile behind an upended armchair then she locked the door behind her just as rory called from the bottom of the stairs he was coming up julia julia sweetheart are you there she slipped into the bathroom and consulted the mirror it showed her a flushed portrait she picked up the blouse shed left hanging over the side of the bath and put it on it smelled stale and there was undoubtedly blood spattered between the flowers but she had nothing else to wear he was coming along the landing she heard his elephantine tread julia this time she answeredmaking no attempt to disguise the tremulous quality of her voice the mirror had confirmed what she feared that there was no way she could pass herself off as undistressed she was obliged to make a virtue of the liability are you all right he asked her he was outside the door no she said im feeling sick oh darling ill be fine in a minute he tried the handle but shed bolted the door can you leave me alone for a little while do you want a doctor no she told him no really but i wouldnt mind a brandy brandy ill be down in two ticks whatever madam wants he quipped she counted his steps as he trudged to the stairs then descended once shed calculated that he was out of earshot she slid back the bolt and stepped onto the landing the late afternoon light was failing quickly the landing was a murky tunnel downstairs she heard the clink of glass on glass she moved as quickly as she dared to franks room there was no sound from the gloomed interior the walls no longer trembled nor did distant bells toll she pushed the door open it creaked slightly she had not entirely tidied up after her labors there was dust on the floor human dust and fragments of dried flesh she went down on her haunches and collected them up diligently rory had been right what a perfect hausfrau she made as she stood up again something shifted in the everdenser shadows of the room she looked in the direction of the movement but before her eyes could make sense of the form in the corner a voice said dont look at me it was a tired voicethe voice of somebody used up by events but it was concrete the syllables were carried on the same air that she breathed frank she said yes came the broken voice itsme from downstairs rory called up to her are you feeling better she went to the door much better she responded at her back the hidden thing said dont let him near me the words coming fast and fierce its all right she whispered to him then to rory ill be with you in a minute put on some music something soothing rory replied that he would and retired to the lounge im only halfmade franks voice said i dont want you to see medont want anybody to see menot like this the words were halting once more and wretched i have to have more blood julia more and soon how much more she asked the shadows this time she caught a better glimpse of what lay in wait there no wonder he wanted no one to look just more he said though the volume was barely above a whisper there was an urgency in the voice that made her afraid i have to go she said hearing music from below this time the darkness made no reply at the door she turned back im glad you came she said as she closed the door she heard a sound not unlike laughter behind her nor unlike sobs seven kirsty is that you yes who is this its rory the line was watery as though the deluge outside had seeped down the phone still she was happy to hear from him he called up so seldom and when he did it was usually on behalf of both himself and julia not this time however this time julia was the subject under discussion theres something wrong with her kirsty he said i dont know what ill you mean maybe shes just so strange with me and she looks terrible have you said anything to her she says shes fine but she isnt i wondered if maybe shed spoken with you i havent set eyes on her since your housewarming thats another thing she doesnt even want to leave the house thats not like her do you want me toto have a word with her would you i dont know if itll do any good but ill try dont say anything about me talking to you of course not ill call in at the house tomorrow tomorrow it has to be tomorrow yesi know im afraid ill lose my grip julia start slipping back ill give you a call from the office on thursday you can tell me what you make of her slipping back theyll know ive gone by now who will the gash the bastards that took me theyre waiting for you just beyond the wall rory told her how grateful he was and she in turn told him that it was the least a friend could do then he put down the phone leaving her listening to the rain on the empty line now they were both julias creatures looking after her welfare fretting for her if she had bad dreams no matter it was a kind of togetherness the man with the white tie had not bided his time almost as soon as he set eyes on julia he came across to her she decided even as he approached that he was not suitable too big too confident after the way the first one had fought she was determined to choose with care so when white tie asked what she was drinking she told him to leave her be he was apparently used to rejections and took it in his stride withdrawing to the bar she returned to her drink it was raining heavily todayhad been raining now for seventytwo hours on and offand there were fewer customers than there had been the week before one or two drowned rats headed in from the street but none looked her way for more than a few moments and time was moving on it was already past two she wasnt going to risk getting caught again by rorys return she emptied her glass and decided that this was not franks lucky day then she stepped out of the bar into the downpour put up her umbrella and headed back to the car as she went she heard footsteps behind her and then white tie was at her side and saying my hotels nearby oh she said and kept on walking but he wasnt going to be shrugged off so easily im only here for two days he said dont tempt me she thought just looking for some companionship he went on i havent spoken to a soul is that right he took hold of her wrist a grip so tight she almost cried out that was when she knew she was going to have to kill him he seemed to see the desire in her eyes my hotel he said i dont much like hotels theyre so impersonal have you got a better idea he said to her she had of course he hung his dripping raincoat on the hall stand and she offered him a drink which he welcomed his name was patrick and he was from newcastle down on business cant seem to get much done whys that he shrugged im probably a bad salesman simple as that what do you sell she asked him what do you care he replied razor quick she grinned she would have to get him upstairs quickly before she started to enjoy his company why dont we dispense with the small talk she said it was a stale line but it was the first thing that came to her tongue he swallowed the last of his drink in one gulp and went where she led this time she had not left the door ajar it was locked which plainly intrigued him after you he said when the door swung open she went first he followed this time she had decided there would be no stripping if some nourishment was soaked up by his clothes then so be it she was not going to give him a chance to realize that they werent alone in the room going to fuck on the floor are we he asked casually any objections not if it suits you he said and clamped his mouth over hers his tongue frisking her teeth for cavities there was some passion in him she mused she could feel him hard against her already but she had work to do here blood to spill and a mouth to feed she broke his kiss and tried to slip from his arms the knife was back in the jacket on the door while it was out of reach she had little power to resist him whats the problem he said no problem she murmured theres no hurry either weve got all the time in the world she touched the front of his trousers to reassure him like a stroked dog he closed his eyes youre a strange one he said dont look she told him huh keep your eyes closed he frowned but obeyed she took a step backward toward the door and half turned to fumble in the depths of the pocket glancing back to see that he was still blind he was and unzipping himself as her hand clasped the knife the shadows growled he heard the noise his eyes sprang open what was that he said reeling round and peering into the darkness it was nothing she insisted as she pulled the knife from its hiding place he was moving away from her across the room theres somebody dont here the last syllable faltered on his lips as he glimpsed a fretful motion in the corner beside the window whatin gods he began as he pointed into the darkness she was at him and slicing his neck open with a butchers efficiency blood jumped immediately a fat spurt that hit the wall with a wet thud she heard franks pleasure and then the dying mans complaint long and low his hand went up to his neck to stem the pulse but she was at him again slicing his pleading hand his face he staggered he sobbed finally he collapsed twitching she stepped away from him to avoid the flailing legs in the corner of the room she saw frank rocking to and fro good woman he said was it her imagination or was his voice already stronger than it had been more like the voice shed heard in her head a thousand times these plundered years the door bell rang she froze oh jesus her mouth said its all right the shadow replied hes as good as dead she looked at the man in the white tie and saw that frank was right the twitching had all but ceased hes big said frank and healthy he was moving into her sight too greedy for sustenance to prohibit her stare she saw him plainly now for the first time he was a travesty not just of humanity of life she looked away the door bell was ringing again and for longer go and answer it frank told her she made no reply go on he told her turning his foul head in her direction his eyes keen and bright in the surrounding corruption the bell rang a third time your caller is very insistent he said trying persuasion where demands had failed i really think you should answer the door she backed away from him and he turned his attentions back to the body on the floor again the bell it was better to answer it perhaps better to open the door to the day it would be a man selling insurance most likely or a jehovahs witness with news of salvation yes she wouldnt mind hearing that the bell rang again coming she said hurrying now for fear he leave she had welcome on her face when she opened the door it died immediately kirsty i was just about to give up on you i wasi was asleep oh kirsty looked at the apparition that had opened the door to her from rorys description shed expected a washedout creature what she saw was quite the reverse julias face was flushed strands of sweatdarkened hair glued to her brow she did not look like a woman who had just risen from sleep a bed perhaps but not sleep i just called bykirsty saidfor a chat julia made a half shrug well its not convenient just at the moment she said i see maybe we could speak later in the week kirstys gaze drifted past julia to the coat stand in the hall a mans gabardine hung from one of the pegs still damp is rory in she ventured no julia said of course not hes at work her face hardened is that what you came round for she said to see rory no i you dont have to ask my permission you know hes a grown man you two can do what the fuck you like kirsty didnt try to debate the point the volteface left her dizzied go home julia said i dont want to talk to you she slammed the door kirsty stood on the step for half a minute shaking she had little doubt of what was going on the dripping raincoat julias agitationher flushed face her sudden anger she had a lover in the house poor rory had misread all the signs she deserted the doorstep and started down the path to the street a crowd of thoughts jostled for her attention at last one came clear of the pack how would she tell rory his heart would break she had no doubt of that and she the luckless taleteller she would be tainted with the news wouldnt she she felt tears close they didnt come however another sensation more insistent overtook as she stepped onto the pavement from the path she was being watched she could feel the look at the back of her head was it julia somehow she thought not the lover then yes the lover safely out of the shadow of the house she succumbed to the urge to turn and look in the damp room frank stared through the hole he had made in the blind the visitorwhose face he vaguely recognizedwas staring up at the house at his very window indeed confident that she could see nothing of him he stared back he had certainly set his eyes on more voluptuous creatures but something about her lack of glamour engaged him such women were in his experience often more entertaining company than beauties like julia they could be flattered or bullied into acts the beauties would never countenance and be grateful for the attention perhaps she would come back this woman he hoped she would kirsty scanned the facade of the house but it was blank the windows were either empty or curtained yet the feeling of being watched persisted indeed it was so strong she turned away in embarrassment the rain started again as she walked along lodovico street and she welcomed it it cooled her blushes and gave cover to tears that would be postponed no longer julia had gone back upstairs trembling and found white tie at the door or rather his head this time either out of an excess of greed or malice frank had dismembered the corpse pieces of bones and dried meat lay scattered about the room there was no sign of the gourmet himself she turned back toward the door and he was there blocking her path mere minutes had passed since shed seen him bending to drain energy from the dead man in that brief time he had changed out of all recognition where there had been withered cartilage there was not ripening muscle the map of his arteries and veins was being drawn anew they pulsed with stolen life there was even a sprouting of hair somewhat premature perhaps given his absence of skin on the raw ball of his head none of this sweetened his appearance a jot indeed in many ways it worsened it previously there had been scarcely anything recognizable about him but now there were scraps of humanity everywhere throwing into yet greater relief the catastrophic nature of his wounding there was worse to come he spoke and when he spoke it was with a voice that was indisputably franks the broken syllables had gone i feel pain he said his browless halflidded eyes were watching her every response she tried to conceal the queasiness she felt but knew the disguise inadequate my nerves are working again he was telling her and they hurt what can i do about it she asked him maybemaybe some bandages bandages help me bind myself together if thats what you want but i need more than that julia i need another body another she said was there no end to this whats to lose he replied moving closer to her at his sudden proximity she became very anxious reading the fear in her face he stopped his advance ill be whole soon he promised her and when i am id better clear up she said averting her gaze from him when i am sweet julia rory will be home soon rory he spat the name out my darling brother how in gods name did you come to marry such a dullard she felt a spasm of anger toward frank i loved him she said and then after a moments pondering corrected herself i thought i loved him his laugh only made his dreadful nakedness more apparent how can you have believed that he said hes a slug always was always will be never had any sense of adventure unlike you unlike me she looked down at the floor a dead mans hand lay between them for an instant she was almost overwhelmed by selfrevulsion all that she had done and dreamed of doing in the last few days rose up in front of her a parade of seductions that had ended in deathall for this death that she had hoped so fervently would end in seduction she was as damned as he she thought no fouler ambition could nest in his head than presently cooed and fluttered in hers wellit was done heal me he whispered to her the harshness had gone from his voice he spoke like a lover heal meplease i will she said i promise you i will and then well be together she frowned what about rory were brothers under the skin frank said ill make him see the wisdom of this the miracle of it you dont belong to him julia not anymore no she said it was true we belong to each other thats what you want isnt it its what i want you know i think if id had you i wouldnt have despaired he said to her wouldnt have given away my body and soul so cheaply cheaply for pleasure for mere sensuality in you here he moved toward her again this time his words held her she didnt retreat in you i might have discovered some reason to live im here she said without thinking she reached across and touched him the body was hot and damp his pulse seemed to be everywhere in every tender bud of nerve in each burgeoning sinew the contact excited her it was as if until this moment she had never quite believed him to be real now it was incontestable she had made this man or remade him used her wit and her cunning to give him substance the thrill she felt touching this too vulnerable body was the thrill of ownership this is the most dangerous time he told her before now i could hide myself i was practically nothing at all but not anymore no ive thought of that we must be done with it quickly i must be strong and whole at whatever cost you agree of course after that therell be an end to the waiting julia the pulse in him seemed to quicken at the thought then he was kneeling in front of her his unfinished hands were at her hips then his mouth forsaking the dregs of her distaste she put her hand upon his head and felt the hairsilken like a babysand the shell of his skull beneath he had learned nothing of delicacy since last hed held her but despair had taught her the fine art of squeezing blood from stones with time she would have love from this hateful thing or know the reason why eight there was thunder that night a storm without rain which made the air smell of steel kirsty had never slept well even as a child though her mother had known lullabies enough to pacify nations the girl had never found slumber easy it wasnt that she had bad dreams or at least none that lingered until morning it was that sleep itselfthe act of closing the eyes and relinquishing control of her consciousnesswas something she was temperamentally unsuited to tonight with the thunder so loud and the lightning so bright she was happy she had an excuse to forsake her tangled bed and drink tea and watch the spectacle from her window it gave her time to think as welltime to turn over the problem that had vexed her since leaving the house on lodovico street but she was still no nearer an answer one particular doubt nagged suppose she was wrong about what shed seen suppose shed misconstrued the evidence and julia had a perfectly good explanation she would lose rory at a stroke and yet how could she remain silent she couldnt bear to think of the woman laughing behind his back exploiting his gentility his naпvetй the thought made her blood boil the only other option was to wait and watch to see if she could gain some incontrovertible evidence if her worst suppositions were then confirmed she would have no choice but to tell rory all shed seen yes that was the answer wait and watch watch and wait the thunder rolled around for long hours denying her sleep until nearly four when finally she did sleep it was the slumber of a watcher and waiter light and full of sighs the storm made a ghost train of the house julia sat downstairs and counted the beats between the flash and the fury that came on its heels she had never liked thunder she a murderess she a consorter with the living dead it was another paradox to add to the thousand shed found at work in herself of late she thought more than once of going upstairs and taking some comfort with the prodigy but knew that it would be unwise rory might return at any moment from his office party he would be drunk on past experience and full of unwelcome fondness the storm crept closer she put on the television to block out the din which it scarcely did at eleven rory came home wreathed in smiles he had good news in the middle of the party his supervisor had taken him aside commended him for his excellent work and spoken of great things for the future julia listened to his retelling of the exchange hoping that his inebriation would blind him to her indifference at last his news told he threw off his jacket and sat down on the sofa beside her poor you he said you dont like the thunder im fine she said are you sure yes fine he leaned across to her and nuzzled her ear youre sweaty she said matteroffactly he didnt cease his overtures however unwilling to lower his baton now that hed begun please rory she said i dont want this why not what did i do nothing she said pretending some interest in the television youre fine oh is that right he said youre fine im fine everybodys fucking fine she stared at the flickering screen the late evening news had just begun the usual cup of sorrows full to brimming rory talked on drowning out the newscasters voice with his diatribe she didnt much mind what did the world have to tell her little enough whereas she she had news for the world that it would reel to hear about the condition of the damned about love lost and then found about what despair and desire have in common please juliarory was sayingjust speak to me the pleas demanded her attention he looked she thought like the boy in the photographshis body hirsute and bloated his clothes those of an adultbut still in essence a boy with his bewildered gaze and sulky mouth she remembered franks question how could you ever have married such a dullard thinking of it a sour smile creased her lips he looked at her his puzzlement deepening whats so funny damn you nothing he shook his head dull anger replacing the sulk a peal of thunder followed the lightning with barely a beat intervening as it came there was a noise from the floor above she turned her attention back to the television to divert rorys interest but it was a vain attempt hed heard the sound what the fuck was that thunder he stood up no he said something else he was already at the door a dozen options raced through her head none of them practical he wrestled drunkenly with the door handle maybe i left a window open she said and got up ill go and see i can do it he replied im not totally inept nobody said she began but he wasnt listening as he stepped out into the hallway the lightning came with the thunder loud and bright as she went in pursuit of him another flash came fast upon the first accompanied by a bowelrocking crash rory was already halfway up the stairs it was nothing she shouted after him he made no reply but climbed on to the top of the stairs she followed dont she said to him in a lull between one peal and the next he heard her this time or rather chose to listen when she reached the top of the stairs he was waiting something wrong he said she hid her trepidation behind a shrug youre being silly she replied softly am i it was just the thunder his face lit from the hall below suddenly softened why do you treat me like shit he asked her youre just tired she told him why though he persisted childlike what have i ever done to you its all right she said really rory everythings all right the same hypnotic banalities over and over again the thunder and beneath the din another sound she cursed franks indiscretion rory turned and looked along the darkened landing hear that he said no his limbs dogged by drink he moved away from her she watched him recede into shadow lightning spilling through the open bedroom door flashlit him then darkness again he was walking toward the damp room toward frank wait she said and went after him he didnt halt but covered the few yards to the door as she reached him his hand was closing on the handle inspired by panic she reached out and touched his cheek im afraid she said he looked round at her woozily what of he asked her she moved her hand to his lips letting him taste the fear on her fingers the storm she said she could see the wetness of his eyes in the gloom little more was he swallowing the hook or spitting it out then poor baby he said swallowed she elated and reaching down she put her hand over his and drew it from the door if frank so much as breathed now all was lost poor baby he said again and wrapped an embrace around her his balance was not too good he was a lead weight in her arms come on she said coaxing him away from the door he went with her for a couple of stumbling paces and then lost his equilibrium she let go of him and reached out to the wall for support the lightning came again and by it she saw that his eyes had found her and glittered i love you he said stepping across the hallway to where she stood he pressed against her so heavily there was no resisting his head went to the crook of her neck muttering sweet talk into her skin now he was kissing her she wanted to throw him off more she wanted to take him by his clammy hand and show him the deathdefying monster he had been so close to stumbling across but frank wasnt ready for that confrontation not yet all she could do was endure rorys caresses and hope that exhaustion claimed him quickly why dont we go downstairs she suggested he muttered something into her neck and didnt move his left hand was on her breast the other clasped around her waist she let him work his fingers beneath her blouse to resist at this juncture would only inflame him afresh i need you he said raising his mouth to her ear once half a lifetime ago her heart had seemed to skip at such a profession now she knew better her heart was no acrobat there was no tingle in the coils of her abdomen only the steady workings of her body breath drawn blood circulated food pulped and purged thinking of her anatomy thus untainted by romanticismas a collection of natural imperatives housed in muscle and boneshe found it easier to let him strip her blouse and put his face to her breasts her nerve endings dutifully responded to his tongue but again it was merely an anatomy lesson she stood back in the dome of her skull and was unmoved he was unbuttoning himself now she caught sight of the boastful plum as he stroked it against her thigh now he opened her legs and pulled her underwear down just far enough to give him access she made no objection nor even a sound as he made his entrance his own din began almost immediately feeble claims to love and lust hopelessly tangled together she half listened and let him work at his play his face buried in her hair closing her eyes she tried to picture better times but the lightning spoiled her dreaming as sound followed light she opened her eyes again to see that the door of the damp room had been opened two or three inches in the narrow gap between door and frame she could just make out a glistening figure watching them she could not see franks eyes but she felt them sharpened beyond pricking by envy and rage nor did she look away but stared on at the shadow while rorys moans increased and at the end one moment became another and she was lying on the bed with her wedding dress crushed beneath her while a black and scarlet beast crept up between her legs to give her a sample of its love poor baby was the last thing rory said as sleep overcame him he lay on the bed still dressed she made no attempt to strip him when his snores were even she left him to it and went back to the room frank was standing beside the window watching the storm move to the southeast he had torn the blind away lamplight washed the walls he heard you she said i had to see the storm he replied simply i needed it he almost found you damn it frank shook his head theres no such thing as almost he said still staring out of the window then after a pause i want to be out there i want to have it all again i know no you dont he told her youve no conception of the hunger ive got on me tomorrow then she said ill get another body tomorrow yes you do that and i want some other stuff a radio for one i want to know whats going on out there and food proper food fresh bread whatever you need and ginger the preserved kind you know in syrup i know he glanced round at her briefly but he wasnt seeing her there was too much world to be reacquainted with tonight i didnt realize it was autumn he said and went back to watching the storm nine the first thing kirsty noticed when she came round the corner of lodovico street the following day was that the blind had gone from the upper front window sheets of newspaper had been taped against the glass in its place she found herself a vantage point in the shelter of a holly hedge from which she hoped she could watch the house but remain unseen then she settled down for her vigil it was not quickly rewarded two hours and more went by before she saw julia leave the house another hour and a quarter before she returned by which time kirstys feet were numb with cold julia had not returned alone the man she was with was not known to kirsty nor indeed did he look to be a likely member of julias circle from a distance he appeared to be in middle age stocky balding when he followed julia into the house he gave a nervous backward glance as if fearful of voyeurs she waited in her hiding place for a further quarter of an hour not certain of what to do next did she linger here until the man emerged and challenge him or did she go to the house and try to talk her way inside neither option was particularly attractive she decided not to decide instead she would get closer to the house and see what inspiration the moment brought the answer was very little as she made her way up the path her feet itched to turn and carry her away indeed she was within an ace of doing just that when she heard a shout from within the mans name was sykes stanley sykes nor was that all hed told julia on the way back from the bar she knew his wifes name and occupation shed had pictures of the children provided for her to coo over the man seemed to be defying her to continue the seduction she merely smiled and told him he was a lucky man but once in the house things had begun to go awry halfway up the stairs friend sykes had suddenly announced that what they were doing was wrongthat god saw them and knew their hearts and found them wanting she had done her best to calm him but he was not to be won back from the lord instead he lost his temper and flailed out at her he might have done worse in his righteous wrath but for the voice that had called him from the landing hed stopped hitting her instantly and become so pale it was as if he believed god himself was doing the calling then frank had appeared at the top of the stairs in all his glory sykes had loosed a cry and tried to run but julia was quick she had her hand on him long enough for frank to descend the few stairs and make a permanent arrest she had not realized until she heard the creak and snap of bone as frank took hold of his prey how strong he had become of late stronger surely than a natural man at franks touch sykes had shouted again to silence him frank wrenched off his jaw the second shout that kirsty had heard had ended abruptly but she read enough panic in the din to have her at the door and on the verge of knocking only then did she think better of it instead she slipped down the side of the house doubting with every step the wisdom of this but equally certain that a frontal assault would get her nowhere the gate that offered access to the back garden was lacking a bolt she slipped through her ears alive to every sound especially that of her own feet from the house nothing not so much as a moan leaving the gate open in case she should need a quick retreat she hurried to the back door it was unlocked this time she let doubt slow her step maybe she should go and call rory bring him to the house but by that time whatever was happening inside would be over and she knew damn well that unless julia was caught redhanded she would slide from under any accusation no this was the only way she stepped inside the house remained completely quiet there was not even a footfall to help her locate the actors shed come to view she moved to the kitchen door and from there through to the dining room her stomach twitched her throat was suddenly so dry she could barely swallow from dining room to lounge and thence into the hallway still nothing no whisper or sigh julia and her companion could only be upstairs which suggested that she had been wrong thinking she heard fear in the shouts perhaps it was pleasure that shed heard an orgasmic whoop instead of the terror shed taken it for it was an easy mistake to make the front door was on her right mere yards away she could still slip out and away the coward in her tempted and no one be any the wiser but a fierce curiosity had seized her a desire to know the mysteries the house held and be done with them as she climbed the stairs the curiosity mounted to a kind of exhilaration she reached the top and began to make her way along the landing the thought occurred now that the birds had flown that while she had been creeping through from the back of the house they had left via the front the first door on the left was the bedroom if they were mating anywhere julia and her paramour it would surely be here but no the door stood ajar she peered in the bedspread was uncreased then a misshapen cry so near so loud her heart missed its rhythm she ducked out of the bedroom to see a figure lurch from one of the rooms farther along the landing it took her a moment to recognize the fretful man who had arrived with juliaand only then by his clothes the rest was changed horribly changed a wasting disease had seized him in the minutes since shed seen him on the step shriveling his flesh on the bone seeing kirsty he threw himself toward her seeking what fragile protection she could offer he had got no more than a pace from the door however when a form spilled into sight behind him it too seemed diseased its body bandaged from head to footthe bindings stained by issues of blood and pus there was nothing in its speed however or the ferocity of its subsequent attack that suggested sickness quite the reverse it reached for the fleeing man and took hold of him by the neck kirsty let out a cry as the captor drew its prey back into its embrace the victim made what little complaint his dislocated face was capable of then the antagonist tightened its embrace the body trembled and twitched its legs buckled blood spurted from eyes and nose and mouth spots of it filled the air like hot hail breaking against her brow the sensation snapped her from her inertia this was no time to wait and watch she ran the monster made no pursuit she reached the top of the stairs without being overtaken but as her foot descended it addressed her its voice wasfamiliar there you are it said it spoke with melting tones as if it knew her she stopped kirsty it said wait a while her head told her to run her gut defied the wisdom however it wanted to remember whose voice this was speaking from the binding she could still make good her escape she reasoned she had an eightyard start she looked round at the figure the body in its arms had curled up fetally legs against chest the beast dropped it you killed him she said the thing nodded it had no apologies to make apparently to either victim or witness well mourn him later it told her and took a step toward her wheres julia kirsty demanded dont you fret alls well the voice said she was so close to remembering who it was as she puzzled it took another step one hand upon the wall as if its balance was still uncertain i saw you it went on and i think you saw me at the window her mystification increased had this thing been in the house that long if so surely rory must and then she knew the voice yes you do remember i can see you remember it was rorys voice or rather a close approximation of it more guttural more selfregarding but the resemblance was uncanny enough to keep her rooted to the spot while the beast shambled within snatching distance of her at the last she recanted her fascination and turned to flee but the cause was already lost she heard its step a pace behind her then felt its fingers at her neck a cry came to her lips but it was barely mounted before the thing had its corrugated palm across her face canceling both the shout and the breath it came upon it plucked her up and took her back the way shed come in vain she struggled against its hold the small wounds her fingers made upon its bodytearing at the bandages and digging into the rawness beneathleft it entirely unmoved it seemed for a horrid moment her heels snagged the corpse on the floor then she was being hauled into the room from which the living and the dead had emerged it smelled of soured milk and fresh meat when she was flung down the boards beneath her were wet and warm her belly wanted to turn inside out she didnt fight the instinct but retched up all that her stomach held in the confusion of present discomfort and anticipated terror she was not certain of what happened next did she glimpse somebody else on the landing as the door was slammed or was it shadow one way or another it was too late for appeals she was alone with the nightmare wiping the bile from her mouth she got to her feet daylight pierced the newspaper at the window here and there dappling the room like sunlight through branches and through this pastoral the thing came sniffing her come to daddy it said in her twentysix years she had never heard an easier invitation to refuse dont touch me she told it it cocked its head a little as if charmed by this show of propriety then it closed in on her all pus and laughter andgod help herdesire she backed a few desperate inches into the corner until there was nowhere else for her to go dont you remember me it said she shook her head frank came the reply this is brother frank she had met frank only once at alexandra road hed come visiting one afternoon just before the wedding more she couldnt recall except that shed hated him on sight leave me alone she said as it reached for her there was a vile finesse in the way his stained fingers touched her breast dont she shrieked or so help me what said rorys voice what will you do nothing was the answer of course she was helpless as only she had ever been in dreams those dreams of pursuit and assault that her psyche had always staged on a ghetto street in some eternal night nevernot even in her most witless fantasieshad she anticipated that the arena would be a room she had walked past a dozen times in a house where she had been happy while outside the day went on as ever gray on gray in a futile gesture of disgust she pushed the investigating hand away dont be cruel the thing said and his fingers found her skin again as unshooable as october wasps whats to be frightened of outside she began thinking of the horror on the landing a man has to eat frank replied surely you can forgive me that why did she even feel his touch she wondered why didnt her nerves share her disgust and die beneath his caress this isnt happening she told herself aloud but the beast only laughed i used to tell myself that he said day in day out used to try and dream the agonies away but you cant take it from me you cant they have to be endured she knew he was telling the truth the kind of unsavory truth that only monsters were at liberty to tell he had no need to flatter or cajole he had no philosophy to debate or sermon to deliver his awful nakedness was a kind of sophistication past the lies of faith and into purer realms she knew too that she would not endure that when her pleadings faltered and frank claimed her for whatever vileness he had in mind she would loose such a scream that she would shatter her very sanity was at stake here she had no choice but to fight back and quickly before frank had a chance to press his suit any harder her hands went up to his face fingers gouging at his eye holes and mouth the flesh beneath the bandage had the consistency of jelly it came away in globs and with it a wet heat the beast shouted out his grip on her relaxing seizing the moment she threw herself out from under him the momentum carrying her against the wall with enough force to badly wind her again frank roared she didnt waste time enjoying his discomfort but slid along the wallnot trusting her legs sufficiently to move into open territorytoward the door as she advanced her feet sent an unlidded jar of preserved ginger rolling across the room spilling syrup and fruit alike frank turned toward her the bandaging about his face hanging in scarlet loops where shed torn it away in several places the bone was exposed even now he ran his hands over the wounds roars of horror coming as he sought to measure the degree of his maiming had she blinded him she wasnt sure even if she had it was only a matter of time before he located her in this small room and when he did his rage would know no bounds she had to reach the door before he reoriented himself faint hope she hadnt a moment to take a step before he dropped his hands from his face and scanned the room he saw her no doubt of that a beat later he was bearing down upon her with renewed violence at her feet lay a litter of domestic items the heaviest item amongst them was a plain box she reached down and picked it up as she stood upright he was upon her she loosed a cry of defiance and swung the boxbearing fist at his head it connected heavily bone splintered the beast tottered backward and she launched herself toward the door but before she reached it the shadow swamped her once more and she was flung backward across the room it came in a raging pursuit this time he had no intention beyond the murderous his lashes were intended to kill that they did not was testament less to her speed than to the imprecision of his fury nevertheless one out of every three blows caught her gashes opened in her face and upper chest it was all she could do to prevent herself from fainting as she sank beneath his assault again she remembered the weapon shed found the box was still in her hand she raised it to deliver another blow but as franks eyes came to rest on the box his assault abruptly ceased there was a panting respite in which kirsty had a chance to wonder if death might not be easier than further flight then frank raised his arm toward her unfurled his fist and said give it to me he wanted his keepsake it seemed but she had no intention of relinquishing her only weapon no she said he made the demand a second time and there was a distinct anxiety in his tone it seemed the box was too precious for him to risk taking it by force one last time he said to her then ill kill you give me the box she weighed the chances what had she left to lose say please she said he regarded her quizzically a soft growl in his throat then polite as a calculating child he said please the word was her cue she threw the box at the window with all the strength her trembling arm possessed it sailed past franks head shattering the glass and disappeared from sight no he shrieked and was at the window in a heartbeat no no no she raced to the door her legs threatening to fail her with every step then she was out onto the landing the stairs almost defeated her but she clung to the bannister like a geriatric and made it to the hallway without falling above there was further din he was calling after her again but this time she would not be caught she fled along the hallway to the front door and flung it open the day had brightened since shed first entered the housea defiant burst of sunlight before evening fell squinting against the glare she started down the pathway there was glass underfoot and amongst the shards her weapon she picked it up a souvenir of her defiance and ran as she reached the street proper words began to comea hopeless babble fragments of things seen and felt but lodovico street was deserted so she began to run and kept running until she had put a good distance between her and the bandaged beast eventually wandering on some street she didnt recognize somebody asked her if she needed help the little kindness defeated her for the effort of making some coherent reply to the inquiry was too much and her exhausted mind lost its hold on the light ten she woke in a blizzard or such was her first impression above her a perfect whiteness snow on snow she was tucked up in snow pillowed in snow the blankness was sickening it seemed to fill up her throat and eyes she raised her hands in front of her face they smelled of an unfamiliar soap whose perfume was harsh now she began to focus the walls the pristine sheets the medication beside the bed a hospital she called out for help hours or minutes later she wasnt sure which it came in the form of a nurse who simply said youre awake and went to fetch her superiors she told them nothing when they came she had decided in the time between the nurses disappearance and reappearance with the doctors that this was not a story she was ready to tell tomorrow she might find the words to convince them of what shed seen but today if she tried to explain they would stroke her brow and tell her to hush her nonsense condescend to her and try to persuade her she was hallucinating if she pressed the point theyd probably sedate her which would make matters worse what she needed was time to think all of this shed worked out before they arrived so that when they asked her what had happened she had her lies ready it was all a fog she told them she could barely remember her own name it will come back in time they reassured her and she replied meekly that she supposed it would sleep now they said and she told them shed be happy to do just that and yawned they withdrew then oh yes said one of them as he was about to go i forgot he brought franks box from his pocket you were holding on to this he said when you were found we had the devils own job getting it out of your hand does it mean anything to you she said it didnt the police have looked at it there was blood on it you see maybe yours maybe not he approached the bed do you want it he asked her then added it has been cleaned yes she replied yes please it may jog your memory he told her and put it down on the bedside table what are we going to do julia demanded for the hundredth time the man in the corner said nothing nor was there any interpretable sign on his ruin of a face what did you want with her anyway she asked him youve spoiled everything spoiled said the monster you dont know the meaning of spoiled she swallowed her anger his brooding unnerved her we have to leave frank she said softening her tone he threw a look across at her whitehot theyll come looking she said shell tell them everything maybe dont you care she demanded the bandaged lump shrugged yes he said of course but we cant leave sweetheart sweetheart the word mocked them both a breath of sentiment in a room that had known only pain i cant face the world like this he gestured to his face can i he said staring up at her look at me she looked can i no no he went back to perusing the floor i need a skin julia a skin then maybemaybe we can go dancing together isnt that what you want he spoke of both dancing and death with equal nonchalance as though one carried as little significance as the other it calmed her hearing him talk that way how she said at last meaning how can a skin be stolen but also how will our sanity survive there are ways said the flayed face and blew her a kiss had it not been for the white walls she might never have picked up the box had there been a picture to look ata vase of sunflowers or a view of pyramidsanything to break the monotony of the room she would have been content to stare at it and think but the blankness was too much it gave her no handhold on sanity so she reached across to the table beside the bed and picked up the box it was heavier than she remembered she had to sit up in bed to examine it there was little enough to see no lid that she could find no keyhole no hinges if she turned it over once she turned it half a hundred times finding no clue to how it might be opened it was not solid she was certain of that so logic demanded that there be a way into it but where she tapped it shook it pulled and pressed it all without result it was not until she rolled over in bed and examined it in the full glare of the lamp that she discovered some clue as to how the box was constructed there were infinitesimal cracks in the sides of the box where one piece of the puzzle abutted the next they would have been invisible but that a residue of blood remained in them tracing the complex relation of the parts systematically she began to feel her way over the sides testing her hypothesis by pushing and pulling once more the cracks offered her a general geography of the toy without them she might have wandered the six sides forever but the options were significantly reduced by the clues shed found there were only so many ways the box could be made to come apart after a time her patience was rewarded a click and suddenly one of the compartments was sliding out from beside its lacquered neighbors within there was beauty polished surfaces which scintillated like the finest motherofpearl colored shadows seeming to move in the gloss and there was music too a simple tune emerged from the box played on a mechanism that she could not yet see enchanted she delved further though one piece had been removed the rest did not come readily each segment presented a fresh challenge to fingers and mind the victories rewarded with a further filigree added to the tune she was coaxing the fourth section out by an elaborate series of turns and counter turns when she heard the bell she stopped working and looked up something was wrong either her weary eyes were playing tricks or the blizzardwhite walls had moved subtly out of true she put down the box and slipped out of bed to go to the window the bell still rang a solemn tolling she drew back the curtain a few inches it was night and windy leaves migrated across the hospital lawn moths congregated in the lamplight unlikely as it seemed the sound of the bell wasnt coming from outside it was behind her she let the curtain drop and turned back into the room as she did so the bulb in the bedside light guttered like a living flame instinctively she reached for the pieces of the box they and these strange events were intertwined somehow as her hand found the fragments the light blew out she was not left in darkness however nor was she alone there was a soft phosphorescence at the end of the bed and in its folds a figure the condition of its flesh beggared her imaginationthe hooks the scars yet its voice when it spoke was not that of a creature in pain its called the lemarchand configuration it said pointing at the box she looked down the pieces were no longer in her hand but floating inches above her palm miraculously the box was reassembling itself without visible aid the pieces sliding back together as the whole construction turned over and over as it did so she caught fresh glimpses of the polished interior and seemed to see ghosts facestwisted as if by grief or bad glasshowling back at her then all but one of the segments was sealed up and the visitor was claiming her attention afresh the box is a means to break the surface of the real it said a kind of invocation by which we cenobites can be notified who she said you did it in ignorance the visitor said am i right yes its happened before came the reply but theres no help for it no way to seal the schism until we take whats ours this is a mistake she said dont try to fight its quite beyond your control you have to accompany me she shook her head shed had enough of bullying nightmares to last her a lifetime i wont go with you she said damn you i wont as she spoke the door opened a nurse she didnt recognizea member of the night shift presumablywas standing there did you call out she asked kirsty looked at the cenobite then back at the nurse they stood no more than a yard apart she doesnt see me it told her nor hear me i belong to you kirsty and you to me no she said are you sure said the nurse i thought i heard kirsty shook her head it was lunacy all lunacy you should be in bed the nurse chided youll catch your death the cenobite tittered ill be back in five minutes said the nurse please go back to sleep and she was gone again wed better go it said leave them to their patchwork eh such depressing places you cant do this she insisted it moved toward her nevertheless a row of tiny bells depending from the scraggy flesh of its neck tinkled as it approached the stink it gave off made her want to heave wait she said no tears please its a waste of good suffering the box she said in desperation dont you want to know where i got the box not particularly frank cotton she said does the name mean anything to you frank cotton the cenobite smiled oh yes we know frank he solved the box too am i right he wanted pleasure until we gave it to him then he squirmed if i took you to him hes alive then very much alive and youre proposing what that i take him back instead of you yes yes why not yes the cenobite moved away from her the room sighed im tempted it said then but perhaps youre cheating me perhaps this is a lie to buy you time i know where he is for gods sake she said he did this to me she presented her slashed arms for its perusal if youre lyingit saidif youre trying to squirm your way out of this im not deliver him alive to us then she wanted to weep with relief make him confess himself and maybe we wont tear your soul apart eleven rory stood in the hallway and stared at julia his julia the woman he had once sworn to have and to hold till death did them part it had not seemed such a difficult promise to keep at the time he had idolized her for as long as he could remember dreaming of her by night and spending the days composing love poems of wild ineptitude to her but things had changed and he had learned as he watched them change that the greatest torments were often the subtlest there had been times of late when he would have preferred a death by wild horses to the itch of suspicion that had so degraded his joy now as he looked at her standing at the bottom of the stairs it was impossible for him to even remember how good things had once been all was doubt and dirt one thing he was glad of she looked troubled maybe that meant there was a confession in the air indiscretions that she would pour out and that he would forgive her for in a welter of tears and understanding you look sad he said she hesitated then said its difficult rory what is she seemed to want to give up before she began what is he pressed ive so much to tell you her hand he saw was grasping the banister so tightly the knuckles burned white im listening he said he would love her again if shed just be honest with him tell me he said i think maybemaybe it would be easier if i showed you she told him and so saying led him upstairs the wind that harried the streets was not warm to judge by the way the pedestrians drew their collars up and their faces down but kirsty didnt feel the chill was it her invisible companion who kept the cold from her cloaking her with that fire the ancients had conjured to burn sinners in either that or she was too frightened to feel anything but then that wasnt how she felt she wasnt frightened the feeling in her gut was far more ambiguous she had opened a doorthe same door rorys brother had openedand now she was walking with demons and at the end of her travels she would have her revenge she would find the thing that had torn her and tormented her and make him feel the powerlessness that she had suffered she would watch him squirm more she would enjoy it pain had made a sadist of her as she made her way along lodovico street she looked round for a sign of the cenobite but he was nowhere to be seen undaunted she approached the house she had no plan in mind there were too many variables to be juggled for one would julia be there and if so how involved in all of this was she impossible to believe that she could be an innocent bystander but perhaps she had acted out of terror of frank the next few minutes might furnish the answers she rang the bell and waited the door was answered by julia in her hand a length of white lace kirsty she said apparently unfazed by her appearance its late wheres rory were kirstys first words they hadnt been quite what shed intended but they came out unbidden hes here julia replied calmly as if seeking to soothe a manic child is there something wrong id like to see him kirsty answered rory yes she stepped over the threshold without waiting for an invitation julia made no objection but closed the door behind her only now did kirsty feel the chill she stood in the hallway and shivered you look terrible said julia plainly i was here this afternoon she blurted i saw what happened julia i saw what was there to see came the reply her poise was unassailed you know truly i dont i want to speak to rory of course came the reply but take care with him will you hes not feeling very well she led kirsty through to the dining room rory was sitting at the table there was a glass of spirits at his hand a bottle beside it laid across an adjacent chair was julias wedding dress the sight of it prompted recognition of the lace swath in her hand it was the brides veil rory looked much the worse for wear there was dried blood on his face and at his hairline the smile he offered was warm but fatigued what happened she asked him its all right now kirsty he said his voice barely aspired to a whisper julia told me everythingand its all right no she said knowing that he couldnt possibly have the whole story you came here this afternoon thats right that was unfortunate youyou asked me she glanced at julia who was standing at the door then back at rory i did what i thought you wanted yes i know i know im only sorry you were dragged into this terrible business you know what your brothers done she said you know what he summoned i know enough rory replied the point is its over now what do you mean whatever he did to you ill make amends what do you mean over hes dead kirsty dead we destroyed him julia and i it wasnt so difficult he thought he could trust me you see thought that blood was thicker than water well it isnt i wouldnt suffer a man like that to live she felt something twitch in her belly had the cenobites got their hooks in her already snagging the carpet of her bowels youve been so kind kirsty risking so much coming back here ill go to the authorities when i feel a little stronger try and find a way to make them understand you killed him she said yes i dont believe it she muttered take her upstairs rory said to julia show her do you want to see julia inquired kirsty nodded and followed it was warmer on the landing than below and the air greasy and gray like filthy dishwater the door to franks room was ajar the thing that lay on the bare boards in a tangle of torn bandaging still steamed his neck was clearly broken head set askew on his shoulders he was devoid of skin from head to foot kirsty looked away nauseated satisfied julia asked kirsty didnt reply but left the room and stepped onto the landing at her shoulder the air was restless you lost something said close by her i know she murmured the bell had begun to ring tolling for her surely and a turmoil of wings nearby a carnival of carrion birds she hurried down the stairs praying that she wouldnt be overtaken before she reached the door if they tore her heart out let rory be spared the sight let him remember her strong with laughter on her lips not pleas behind her julia said where are you going when there was no reply forthcoming she went on talking dont say anything to anybody kirsty she insisted we can deal with this rory and me her voice had stirred rory from his drink he appeared in the hallway the wounds frank had inflicted looked more severe than kirsty had first thought his face was bruised in a dozen places and the skin at his neck plowed up as she came abreast of him he reached out and took her arm julias right he said leave it to us to report will you there were so many things she wanted to tell him at that moment but time left room for none the bell was getting louder in her head someone had looped their entrails around her neck and was pulling the knot tight its too late she murmured to rory and pressed his hand away what do you mean he said to her as she covered the yards to the door dont go kirsty not yet tell me what you mean she couldnt help but offer him a backward glance hoping that he would find in her face all the regrets she felt its all right he said sweetly still hoping to heal her really it is he opened his arms come to daddy he said the phrase didnt sound right out of rorys mouth some boys never grew to be daddies however many children they sired kirsty put out a hand to the wall to steady herself it wasnt rory who was speaking to her it was frank somehow it was frank she held on to the thought through the mounting din of bells so loud now that her skull seemed ready to crack open rory was still smiling at her arms extended he was talking too but she could no longer hear what he said the tender flesh of his face shaped the words but the bells drowned them out she was thankful for the fact it made it easier to defy the evidence of her eyes i know who you are she said suddenly not certain of whether her words were audible or not but unquenchably sure that they were true rorys corpse was upstairs left to lie in franks shunned bandaging the usurped skin was now wed to his brothers body the marriage sealed with the letting of blood yes that was it the coils around her throat were tightening it could only be moments before they dragged her off in desperation she started back along the hallway toward the thing in rorys face its you she said the face smiled at her undismayed she reached out and snatched at him startled he took a step backward to avoid her touch moving with graceful sloth but somehow still managing to avoid her touch the bells were intolerable they were pulping her thoughts tolling her brain tissue to dust at the rim of her sanity she reached again for him and this time he did not quite avoid her her nails raked the flesh of his cheek and the skin so recently grafted slid away like silk the bloodbuttered meat beneath came into horrid view behind her julia screamed and suddenly the bells werent in kirstys head any longer they were in the house in the world the hallway lights burned dazzlingly bright and thentheir filaments overloadingwent out there was a short period of total darkness during which time she heard a whimpering that may or may not have come from her own lips then it was as if fireworks were spluttering into life in the walls and floor the hallway danced one moment an abattoir the next a boudoir the moment following that a ghosttrain tunnelall speed and sudden fire by one flaring light she saw frank moving toward her rorys discarded face hanging from his jaw she avoided his outstretched arm and ducked through into the front room the hold on her throat had relaxed she realized the cenobites had apparently seen the error of their ways soon they would intervene surely and bring an end to this farce of mistaken identities she would not wait to see frank claimed as shed thought of doing shed had enough instead shed flee the house by the back door and leave them to it her optimism was shortlived the fireworks in the hall threw some light ahead of her into the dining room enough to see that it was already bewitched there was something moving over the floor like ash before wind and chains cavorting in the air innocent she might be but the forces loose here were indifferent to such trivialities she sensed that to take another step would invite atrocities her hesitation put her back within franks reach but as he snatched at her the fireworks in the hallway faltered and she slipped away from him under cover of darkness the respite was all too brief new lights were already blooming in the halland he was after her afresh blocking her route to the front door why didnt they claim him for gods sake hadnt she brought them here as shed promised and unmasked him frank opened his jacket in his belt was a bloodied knifedoubtless the flaying edge he pulled it out and pointed it at kirsty from now on he said as he stalked her im rory she had no choice but to back away from him the door receding with every step understand me im rory now and nobodys ever going to know any better her heel hit the bottom of the stair and suddenly there were other hands on her reaching through the banisters and seizing fistfuls of her hair she twisted her head round and looked up it was julia of course face slack all passion consumed she wrenched kirstys head back exposing her throat as franks knife gleamed toward it at the last moment kirsty reached up above her head and snatched hold of julias arm wrenching her from her perch on the third or fourth stair losing both her balance and her grip on her victim julia let out a shout and fell her body coming between kirsty and franks thrust the blade was too close to be averted it entered julias side to the hilt she moaned then she reeled away down the hall the knife buried in her frank scarcely seemed to notice his eyes were on kirsty once again and they shone with horrendous appetite she had nowhere to go but uў the fireworks still exploding the bells still ringing she started to mount the stairs her tormentor was not coming in immediate pursuit she saw julias appeals for help had diverted him to where she lay halfway between stairs and front door he drew the knife from her side she cried out in pain and as if to assist her he went down on his haunches beside her body she raised her arm to him looking for tenderness in response he cupped his hand beneath her head and drew her up toward him as their faces came within inches of each other julia seemed to realize that franks intentions were far from honorable she opened her mouth to scream but he sealed her lips with his and began to feed she kicked and scratched the air all in vain tearing her eyes from the sight of this depravity kirsty crawled up to the head of the stairs the second floor offered no real hiding place of course nor was there any escape route except to leap from one of the windows but having seen the cold comfort frank had just offered his mistress jumping was clearly the preferable option the fall might break every bone in her body but it would at least deprive the monster of further sustenance the fireworks were fizzling out it seemed the landing was in smoky darkness she stumbled along it rather than walked her fingertips moving along the wall downstairs she heard frank on the move again he was finished with julia now he spoke as he began up the stairs the same incestuous invitation come to daddy it occurred to her that the cenobites were probably viewing this chase with no little amusement and would not act until there was only one player left frank she was forfeit to their pleasure bastards she breathed and hoped they heard she had almost reached the end of the landing ahead lay the junk room did it have a window sizable enough for her to climb through if so she would jump and curse them as she fellcurse them all god and the devil and whatever lay between curse them and as she dropped hope for nothing but that the concrete be quick with her frank was calling her again and almost at the top of the stairs she turned the key in the lock opened the junk room door and slipped through yes there was a window it was uncurtained and moonlight fell through it in shafts of indecent beauty illuminating a chaos of furniture and boxes she made her way through the confusion to the window it was wedged open an inch or two to air the room she put her fingers under the frame and tried to heave it up far enough for her to climb out but the sash in the window had rotted and her arms were not the equal of the task she quickly hunted for a makeshift lever a part of her mind coolly calculating the number of steps it would take her pursuer to cover the length of the landing less than twenty she concluded as she pulled a sheet off one of the tea chests only to find a dead man staring up at her from the chest eyes wild he was broken in a dozen places arms smashed and bent back upon themselves legs tucked up to his chin as she went to cry out she heard frank at the door where are you he inquired she clamped her hand over her face to stop the cry of revulsion from coming as she did so the door handle turned she ducked out of sight behind a felled armchair swallowing her scream the door opened she heard franks breath slightly labored heard the hollow pad of his feet on the boards then the sound of the door being pulled to again it clicked silence she waited for a count of thirteen then peeped out of hiding half expecting him to still be in the room with her waiting for her to break cover but no hed gone swallowing the breath her cry had been mounting upon had brought an unwelcome side effect hiccups the first of them so unexpected she had no time to subdue it sounded guncrack loud but there was no returning step from the landing frank it seemed was already out of earshot as she returned to the window skirting the teachest coffin a second hiccup startled her she silently reprimanded her belly but in vain a third and fourth came unbidden while she wrestled once more to lift the window that too was a fruitless effort it had no intention of compliance briefly she contemplated breaking the glass and yelling for help but rapidly discarded the idea frank would be eating out her eyes before the neighbors had even shaken off sleep instead she retraced her steps to the door and opened it a creaking fraction there was no sign of frank so far as her eyes were able to interpret the shadows cautiously she opened the door a little wider and stepped onto the landing once again the gloom was like a living thing it smothered her with murky kisses she advanced three paces without incident then a fourth on the fifth her body took a turn for the suicidal she hiccuped her hand too tardy to reach her mouth before the din was out this time it did not go unheard there you are said a shadow and frank slipped from the bedroom to block her path he was faster for his mealhe seemed as wide as the landingand he stank of meat with nothing to lose she screamed blue murder as he came at her he was unashamed by her terror with inches between her flesh and his knife she threw herself sideways and found that the fifth step had brought her abreast of franks room she stumbled through the open door he was after her in a flash crowing his delight there was a window in this room she knew shed broken it herself mere hours before but the darkness was so profound she might have been blindfolded not even a glimmer of moonlight to feed her sight frank was equally lost it seemed he called after her in this pitch the whine of his knife accompanying his call as he slit the air back and forth back and forth stepping away from the sound her foot caught in the tangle of the bandaging on the floor next moment she was toppling it wasnt the boards she fell heavily upon however but the greasy bulk of rorys corpse it won a howl of horror from her there you are said frank the knife slices were suddenly closer inches from her head but she was deaf to them she had her arms about the body beneath her and approaching death was nothing beside the pain she felt now touching him rory she moaned content that his name be on her lips when the cut came thats right said frank rory somehow the theft of rorys name was as unforgivable as stealing his skin or so her grief told her a skin was nothing pigs had skins snakes had skins they were knitted of dead cells shed and grown and shed again but a name that was a spell which summoned memories she would not let frank usurp it rorys dead she said the words stung her and with the sting the ghost of a thought hush baby he told her suppose the cenobites were waiting for frank to name himself hadnt the visitor in the hospital said something about frank confessing youre not rory she said we know that came the reply but nobody else does who are you then poor baby losing your mind are you good thing too who though its safer that way who hush baby he said he was stooping to her in the darkness his face within inches of hers everythings going to be as right as rain yes yes franks here baby frank thats right im frank so saying he delivered the killing blow but she heard it coming in the darkness and dodged its benediction a second later the bell began again and the bare bulb in the middle of the room flickered into life by it she saw frank beside his brother the knife buried in the dead mans buttock as he worked it out of the wound he set his eyes on her afresh another chime and he was up and would have been at herbut for the voice it said his name lightly as if calling a child out to play frank his face dropped for the second time that night a look of puzzlement flitted across it and on its heels horror slowly he turned his head round to look at the speaker it was the cenobite its hooks sparkling behind it kirsty saw three other figures their anatomies catalogues of disfigurement frank threw a glance back at kirsty you did this he said she nodded get out of here said one of the newcomers this isnt your business now whore frank screeched at her bitch cheating fucking bitch the hail of rage followed her across the room to the door as her palm closed around the door handle she heard him coming after her and turned to find that he was standing less than a foot from her the knife a hairs breadth from her body but there he was fixed unable to advance another millimeter they had their hooks in him the flesh of his arms and legs and curled through the meat of his face attached to the hooks chains which they held taut there was a soft sound as his resistance drew the barbs through his muscle his mouth was dragged wide his neck and chest plowed open the knife dropped from his fingers he expelled a last incoherent curse at her his body shuddering now as he lost his battle with their claim upon him inch by inch he was drawn back toward the middle of the room go said the voice of the cenobite she could see them no longer they were already lost behind the bloodflecked air accepting their invitation she opened the door while behind her frank began to scream as she stepped onto the landing plaster dust cascaded from the ceiling the house was growling from basement to eaves she had to go quickly she knew before whatever demons were loose here shook the place apart but though time was short she could not prevent herself from snatching one look at frank to be certain that he would come after her no longer he was in extremis hooked through in a dozen or more places fresh wounds gouged in him even as she watched spreadeagled beneath the solitary bulb body hauled to the limits of its endurance and beyond he gave vent to shrieks that would have won pity from her had she not learned better suddenly his cries stopped there was a pause and then in one last act of defiance he cranked up his heavy head and stared at her meeting her gaze with eyes from which all bafflement and all malice had fled they glittered as they rested on her pearls in offal in response the chains were drawn an inch tighter but the cenobites gained no further cry from him instead he put his tongue out at kirsty and flicked it back and forth across his teeth in a gesture of unrepentant lewdness then he came unsewn his limbs separated from his torso and his head from his shoulders in a welter of bone shards and heat she threw the door closed as something thudded against it from the other side his head she guessed then she was staggering downstairs with wolves howling in the walls and the bells in turmoil and everywherethickening the air like smokethe ghosts of wounded birds sewn wing tip to wing tip and lost to flight she reached the bottom of the stairs and began along the hallway to the front door but as she came within spitting distance of freedom she heard somebody call her name it was julia there was blood on the hall floor marking a trail from the spot where frank had abandoned her through into the dining room kirsty she called again it was a pitiable sound and despite the wingchoked air she could not help but go in pursuit of it stepping through into the dining room the furniture was smoldering charcoal the ash that shed glimpsed was a foulsmelling carpet and there in the middle of this domestic wasteland sat a bride by some extraordinary act of will julia had managed to put her wedding dress on and secure her veil upon her head now she sat in the dirt the dress besmirched but she looked radiant nevertheless more beautiful indeed for the fact of the ruin that surrounded her help me she said and only now did kirsty realize that the voice she heard was not coming from beneath the lush veil but from the brides lap and now the copious folds of the dress were parting and there was julias headset on a pillow of scarlet silk and framed with a fall of auburn hair bereft of lungs how could it speak it spoke nevertheless kirsty it said it beggedand sighed and rolled back and forth in the brides lap as if it hoped to unlodge its reason kirsty might have aided itmight have snatched the head up and dashed out its brainsbut that the brides veil had started to twitch and was rising now as if plucked at by invisible fingers beneath it a light flickered and grew brighter and brighter yet and with the light a voice i am the engineer it sighed no more than that then the fluted folds rose higher and the head beneath gained the brilliance of a minor sun she did not wait for the blaze to blind her instead she backed out into the hallwaythe birds almost solid now the wolves insaneand flung herself at the front door even as the hallway ceiling began to give way the night came to meet hera clean darkness she breathed it in greedy gulps as she departed the house at a run it was her second such departure god help her her sanity that there ever be a third at the corner of lodovico street she looked back the house had not capitulated to the forces unleashed within it stood now as quiet as a grave no quieter as she turned away somebody collided with her she yelped with surprise but the huddled pedestrian was already hurrying away into the anxious murk that preceded morning as the figure hovered on the outskirts of solidity it glanced back and its head flared in the gloom a cone of white fire it was the engineer she had no time to look away it was gone again in one instant leaving its glamour in her eye only then did she realize the purpose of the collision lemarchands box had been passed back to her and sat in her hand its surfaces had been immaculately resealed and polished to a high gloss though she did not examine it she was certain there would be no clue to its solution left the next discoverer would voyage its faces without a chart and until such time was she elected its keeper apparently so she turned it over in her hand for the frailest of moments she seemed to see ghosts in the lacquer julias face and that of frank she turned it over again looking to see if rory was held here but no wherever he was it wasnt here there were other puzzles perhaps that if solved gave access to the place where he lodged a crossword maybe whose solution would lift the latch of the paradise garden or a jigsaw in the completion of which lay access to wonderland she would wait and watch as she had always watched and waited hoping that such a puzzle would one day come to her but if
