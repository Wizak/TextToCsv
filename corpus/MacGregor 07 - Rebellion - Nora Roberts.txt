 prologue glenroe forest scotland they came at dusk when the villagers were at their evening meal and the peat fires sent smoke curling from the chimneys into the chill november air there had been snow the week before and the sun had beaten down and then retreated until the frost had set hard as rock under the bare trees the sound of approaching horses rang like thunder through the forest sending small animals racing and scrambling for cover serena macgregor shifted her baby brother on her hip and went to the window her father and the men were returning early from their hunting trip she thought but there were no shouts of greeting from the outlying cottages no bursts of laughter she waited her nose all but pressed against the window glazing straining for the first signs of their return and fighting back her resentment that she a girl was not permitted to join hunting parties coll had gone though he was barely fourteen and not as skilled with a bow as she herself and coll had been allowed to go since he was seven serenas mouth became a pout as she gazed out through the lowering light her older brother would talk of nothing but the hunt for days while she would have to be content to sit and spin little malcolm began to fuss and she jiggled him automatically as she stared down the rough path between the crofts and cottages hush now papa doesnt want to hear you squalling the minute he walks in the door but something made her hold him closer and look nervously over her shoulder for her mother the lamps were lighted and there was the scent of good rich stew simmering over the kitchen fire the house was neat as a pin she and her mother and her little sister gwen had worked all day to make it so the floors were scrubbed the tables polished there wasnt a cobweb to be found in any corner serenas arms ached just thinking of it the wash had been done and the little lavender sachets her mother loved so much were tucked in the chests because her father was laird they had the best house for miles around built of fine blue slate her mother wasnt one to let dust settle on it everything looked normal but something had set her heart to racing grabbing a shawl serena wrapped it around malcolm and opened the door to look for her father there was no wind no sound but the horses hooves beating against the hard frost on the path they would ride over the rise any moment she thought and for a reason she couldnt name she shuddered when she heard the first scream she stumbled backward she had already righted herself and started forward when her mother called out to her serena come back in hurry fiona macgregor her usually lovely face pinched and pale rushed down the stairs her hair the same redgold shade as serenas was pinned back and caught in a snood she didnt pat it into place as was her habit before welcoming her husband home but mama hurry girl for gods sake fiona grabbed her daughters arm and dragged her inside take the bairn upstairs to your sister stay there but papa its not your father serena saw then as the horses crested the hill not the hunting plaid of the macgregor but the red coats of english dragoons she was only eight but she had heard the tales of pillage and oppression eight was old enough to be outraged what do they want weve done nothing its not necessary to do only to be fiona closed the door then bolted it more out of defiance than of any hope it would keep out intruders serena a small slender woman she gripped her daughters shoulders she had been the favored daughter of an indulgent father then the adored wife of a loving husband but fiona was no weakling perhaps that was why the men in her life had given her their respect as well as their affection go upstairs into the nursery keep malcolm and gwen with you dont come out until i tell you the valley echoed with another scream and with wild weeping through the window they saw the thatched roof of a cottage rise in flames fiona could only thank god her husband and son hadnt returned i want to stay with you serenas wide green eyes overwhelmed her face damp now with the beginnings of tears but her mouth the one her father called stubborn firmed papa wouldnt want me to leave you alone he would want you to do as youre told fiona heard the horses stop at the door there was a jingle of spurs and the sound of men shouting go now she turned her daughter and pushed her toward the stairs keep the babies safe as malcolm began to wail serena fled up the steps she was on the landing when she heard the door burst in she stopped and turned to see her mother face a halfdozen dragoons one stepped forward and bowed even from a distance serena could see that the gesture was an insult serena little gwen called from the stairs above take the baby serena pushed malcolm into gwens pudgy fiveyearold arms go into the nursery and shut the door she lowered her voice to a whisper hurry keep him quiet if you can from her apron pocket she dug a sugarplum shed been saving take this and go before they see us crouching at the top of the stairs she watched fiona macgregor said the dragoon with the fancy stripes i am lady macgregor fiona kept her shoulders back and her eyes level her only thought now was to protect her children and her home since fighting was impossible she used the only weapon at hand her dignity by what right do you break into my home by the right of an officer of the king and your name captain standish at your service he drew off his gloves waiting hoping to see fear where is your husband lady macgregor the laird and his men are hunting standish signaled sending three of his men on a search of the house one overturned a table as he passed though her mouth was dry as dust fiona held her ground she knew he could order her home torched as easily as he had her tenants cottages there was little hope that her rank or her husbands would protect them her only choice was to meet insult with insult and calmly as youve seen we are mostly women and children here your visit is illtimed if you wish to have words with the macgregor or his men or perhaps that is why you and your soldiers come so bravely into glenroe he slapped her then sending her staggering backward from the force of the blow my father will kill you for that serena flew down the stairs like a bullet and launched herself at the officer he swore as she dug her teeth into his hand then swept her aside damn devils brat drew blood he lifted his fist but fiona flung herself between him and her daughter do king georges men beat small children is that how the english rule standish was breathing fast it was a matter of pride now he could hardly let his men see him bested by a woman and child especially when they were scottish scum his orders were only to search and question it was a pity the sniveling argyll had convinced the queen in her role as regent not to enforce the bill of pains and penalties scotland would indeed have been a hunting ground if she had still queen caroline was furious with her scottish subjects and in any case she was hardly likely to hear of an isolated incident in the highlands he signaled to one of the dragoons take that brat upstairs and lock her up without a word the soldier scooped serena up doing his best to avoid her feet and teeth and pummeling fists as she fought she screamed for her mother and cursed the soldiers you raise wildcats in the highlands milady the officer wrapped a fresh handkerchief around his hand she is unused to seeing her mother or any woman struck by a man his hand was throbbing he would not regain his mens esteem by thrashing a puny child but the mother he smiled as he let his gaze wander over her the mother was a different matter your husband is suspected of involvement with the murder of captain porteous the captain porteous who was sentenced to death by the courts for firing into a crowd he was reprieved madam standish laid a hand lightly on the hilt of his sword even among his own kind he was considered cruel fear and intimidation kept his men in line the same would work with one scottish whore captain porteous fired on a group of rioters at a public execution then he was taken from prison and hanged by persons unknown i find it difficult to sympathize with his fate but neither i nor anyone in my family know of such matters if its found differently your husband would be a murderer and a traitor and you lady macgregor would have no protection i have nothing to tell you a pity he smiled and moved a step closer shall i show you what happens to unprotected women upstairs serena beat on the door until her hands were raw behind her gwen huddled with malcolm and wept there was no light in the nursery but for the moon and the flames from the fired cottages outside she could hear people shouting women wailing but her thoughts were all for her mother left below alone and unprotected with the english when the door opened serena stumbled back she saw the red coat heard the jangle of spurs then she saw her mother naked bruised her beautiful hair a wild mass around her face and shoulders fiona fell to her knees at serenas feet mama serena knelt beside her touched a tentative hand to her shoulder shed seen her mother weep before but not like this not these silent hopeless tears because fionas skin was cold to the touch serena dragged a blanket from the chest and wrapped it around her while she listened to the dragoons ride off serena held her mother with one arm and cuddled gwen and malcolm with the other she had only the vaguest understanding of what had happened but it was enough to make her hate and to make her vow revenge chapter one contents prev next london brigham langston the fourth earl of ashburn sat at breakfast in his elegant town house and frowned over the letter it was certainly one hed been expecting one hed been waiting and watching for now that it was here he read each word carefully his gray eyes serious and his full mouth firm it wasnt often a man received a letter that could change his life damn it brig how long are you going to keep me waiting coll macgregor the quicktempered redheaded scot who had been brighams companion on certain journeys through italy and france seemed unable to sit quietly while brigham read in answer brigham merely lifted one narrow hand whiteskinned and foaming with lace at the wrist he was accustomed to coils outbursts and for the most part enjoyed them but this time this very important time he would hold his friend off until hed read the letter through again its from him is it not damn you to hell and back it is from him from the prince coll pushed away from the table to pace only the manners hammered into him by his mother kept him from tearing the letter from brighams hand although the knowledge that despite the difference in size and girth brigham could hold his own in a fight might also have played a certain role in his decision ive as much right as you brigham looked up at that letting his gaze pass over the man who was now striding around the small salon with enough force to make the china rattle though his muscles were tense and his mind was shooting off in a dozen directions brighams voice was mild of course you do but the letter is nonetheless addressed to me only because its easier to smuggle a letter to the highandmighty english earl of ashburn than it is to a macgregor were all under suspicion of being rebels in scotland coils sharp green eyes were alight with challenge when brigham merely returned to the letter coll swore again and dropped into his chair youre enough to try a mans soul thank you setting the letter beside his plate brigham poured more coffee his hand was as steady as it was when he gripped the hilt of a sword or the butt of a pistol and indeed this letter was a weapon of war you are quite right on all counts my dear the letter is from prince charles brigham sipped his coffee well what does he say when brigham indicated the letter with a wave of his hand coll pounced on it the missive was written in french and though his command of the language was not as good as brighams he struggled through it as he did brigham studied the room around him the wallpaper had been chosen by his grandmother a woman he remembered as much for her soft scottish burr as for her stubbornness it was a deep glassy blue that shed said reminded her of the lochs of her homeland the furnishings were elegant almost delicate with their sweeping curves and gilt edges the graceful meissen porcelain figurines she had prized still stood on the little round table by the window as a boy hed been allowed to look but not to touch and his fingers had always itched to hold the statue of the shepherdess with the long porcelain hair and the fragile face there was a portrait of mary macdonald the strongwilled woman who had become lady ashburn it stood over the crackling fire and showed her at an age very close to what her grandson claimed now shed been tall for a woman and reedslim with a glorious mane of ebony hair around a narrow fineboned face there was a look in the way she tilted her head that said she could be persuaded but not forced asked but not commanded the same features the same coloring had been passed down to her grandson they were no less elegant in their masculine form the high forehead the hollowed cheeks and full mouth but brigham had inherited more than his height and his gray eyes from mary hed also inherited her passions and her sense of justice he thought of the letter of the decisions to be made and toasted the portrait youd have me go he thought all the stories you told me that belief in the lightness of the stuart cause you planted in my head during the years you raised and cared for me if you were still alive youd go yourself so how can i not so its time coll folded the letter in his voice in his eyes were both excitement and tension he was twentyfour only six months younger than brigham but this was a moment he had been awaiting for most of his life you have to learn to read between the lines coll this time brigham rose charles is still holding out hope of support from the french though hes beginning to realize king louis would rather talk than act frowning he twitched back the curtain and looked out at his dormant gardens they would explode with color and scent in the spring but it was unlikely he would be there to see them in the spring when we were at court louis was more than interested in our cause he has no more liking for the hanoverian puppet on the throne than we coll said no but that doesnt mean hell open his coffers to the bonnie prince and the stuart cause charless notion of fitting out a frigate and sailing for scotland seems more realistic but these things take time which is where we come in brigham let the drapes fall back into place you know the mood of scotland better than i how much support will he get enough with the confidence of pride and youth coll grinned the clans will rise for the true king and fight to the man behind him he rose then knowing what his friend was asking brigham would be risking more than his life in scotland his title his home and his reputation could be lost brig i could take the letter go to my family and from there spread word throughout the highland clans it isnt necessary for you to go as well one black brow rose and brigham nearly smiled im of so little use to hell with that colls voice was bluff his gestures wide both were as much a part of him as the rumbling cadences of his homeland and his fierce pride in it a man like you one who knows how to talk how to fight an english aristocrat willing to join the rebellion no one knows better than i just what you can do after all you saved my life more than once in italy and aye in france as well dont be boring coll brigham flicked at the lace at his wrist its unlike you colls wide face folded into a grin aye and theres something to be said for the way you can turn into the earl of ashburn in the blink of an eye my dear i am the earl of ashburn humor kindled in colls eyes when they stood together like this the contrasts between the men were marked brigham with his trim build coll with his brawny one brigham with his elegant even languid manners coll roughandready but no one knew better than the scot just what lay beneath the wellcut coats and the lace it wasnt the earl of ashburn who fought backtoback with me when our coach was attacked outside of calais it wasnt the earl of ashburn who damned near drank me a macgregor under the table in that grimy little gaming hell in rome i assure you it was as i remember both incidents very well coll knew better than to banter words with brigham brigham be serious as the earl of ashburn you deserve to stay in england go to your balls and card parties you could still do the cause good here with your ear to the ground but if im going to fight id like to have you beside me will you come brigham studied his friend then shifted his gaze up and beyond to the portrait of his grandmother of course the weather in london was cold and dank it remained so three days later when the two men began their journey north they would travel to the border in the relative comfort of brighams coach then take the rest on horseback for anyone who remained in london during the miserable january weather and chose to inquire lord ashburn was making a casual journey to scotland to visit the family of his friend there were a few who knew better a handful of staunch tories and english jacobites whom brigham trusted to them he left in trust his family home ashburn manor as well as his house in london and the disposition of his servants what could be taken without undue notice he took what could not he left behind with the full knowledge that it probably would be months perhaps even years before he could return to claim them the portrait of his grandmother still stood above the mantel but on a sentimental whim hed had the statue of the shepherdess wrapped for the journey there was gold a good deal more than was needed for a visit to the family of a friend in a locked chest beneath the floor of the coach they were forced to move slowly more slowly than brigham cared for but the roads were slick and occasional flurries of snow had the driver walking the team brigham would have preferred a good horse beneath him and the freedom of a gallop a look out the window showed him that the weather to the north could only be worse with what patience hed learned to cultivate brigham sat back rested his booted feet on the opposite seat where coll sat dozing and let his thoughts drift back to paris where he had spent a few glittering months the year before that was the france of louis xv opulent glamorous all light and music there had been lovely women there with their powdered hair and scandalous gowns it had been easy to flirt and more a young english lord with a fat purse and a talent for raillery had little trouble making a place in society he had enjoyed it the lushness and laziness of it but it was also true that hed begun to feel restless fretting for action and purpose the langstons had always enjoyed the intrigue of politics as much as the sparkle of balls and routs just as for three generations they had silently sworn their loyalty to the stuarts the rightful kings of england so when prince charles edward had come to france a magnetic man of courage and energy brigham had offered his aid and his oath many would have called him traitor no doubt the fusty whigs who supported the german who now sat upon the english throne would have wished brigham hanged as one if they had known but brighams loyalty was to the stuart cause to which his family had always held true not to the fat german usurper george hed not forgotten the stories his grandmother had told him of the disastrous rebellion of and of the proscriptions and executions before and after it as the landscape grew wilder and the city of london seemed so far away he thought once again that the house of hanover had done little had not even tried to endear itself to scotland there had always been the threat of war from the north or from across the channel if england was to be made strong it would need its rightful king it had been more than the princes clear eyes and fair looks that had decided brigham to stand with him it had been his drive and ambition and perhaps his youthful confidence that he could and would claim what was his they stopped for the night at a small inn where the lowland plains started to rise into the true highlands brighams gold and his title earned them dry sheets and a private parlor fed warmed by the leaping fire they diced and drank too much ale while the wind swept down from the mountains and hammered at the walls for a few hours they were simply two welltodo young men who shared a friendship and an adventure damn your bones brig youre a lucky bastard tonight so it would seem brigham scooped up the dice and the coins his eyes bright with humor met colls shall we find a new game roll coll grinned and shoved more coins to the center of the table your lucks bound to change when the dice fell he snickered if i cant beat that when his roll fell short he shook his head seems you cant lose like the night in paris you played the duke for the affections of that sweet mademoiselle brigham poured more ale with or without the dice id already won the mademoiselles affections laughing thunderously coll slapped more coins on the table your luck cant hang sunny all the time though i for one hope it holds for the months to come brigham swept his gaze upward and assured himself that the door to the parlor was closed its more a matter of charless luck than mine aye hes what weve needed his father has always been lacking in ambition and too sure of his own defeat he lifted his tankard of ale to the bonnie prince hell need more than his looks and a clever tongue colls red brows rose do you doubt the macgregors youre the only macgregor i know before coll could begin an oration on his clan brigham asked quickly what of your family coll youll be pleased to see them again its been a long year not that i havent enjoyed the sights of rome and paris but when a mans born in the highlands he prefers to die there coll drank deeply thinking of purple moors and deep blue locks i know the family is well from the last letter my mother sent me but ill feel better seeing for myself malcolm will be nigh on ten now and a hellion im told he grinned full of pride then so are we all you told me your sister was an angel gwen the tenderness invaded his voice little gwen so she is sweettempered patient pretty as new cream im looking forward to meeting her and still in the schoolroom coll told him ill be around to see you dont forget it a little hazy with ale brigham tilted back in his chair youve another sister serena coll jiggled the dice box in his palm god knows the lass was misnamed a wildcat she is and ive the scars to prove it serena macgregor has the devils own temper and a quick fist but is she pretty shes not hard to look at said her brother my mother tells me the boys have started courting this past year and serena sends them off with boxed ears scrambling for cover perhaps they have yet to find the ah proper way to court her hah i crossed her once and she grabbed my grandfathers claymore from the wall and chased me into the forest the pride came through if not the tenderness i pity the man who sets his sights on her an amazon brigham pictured a strapping ruddycheeked girl with colls broad features and wild red hair healthy as a milkmaid he imagined and just as sassy i prefer the milder sort isnt a mild bone in her body but shes true the ale was swimming in colls head but that didnt stop him from lifting the tankard again i told you about the night the dragoons came to glenroe yes colls eyes darkened with the memory after theyd finished shaming my mother and firing roofs serena nursed her she was hardly more than a bairn herself but she got my mother into bed and tended her and the children until we returned there was a braise on her face where that black bastard had knocked her aside but she didnt cry she sat dryeyed and told us the whole brigham laid a hand over his friends the times past for revenge coll but not for justice ill take both coll murmured and tossed the dice again they started out early the next morning brighams head ached but the cold blustery air soon cleared it they went on horseback allowing the coach to follow at a sedate pace now they were truly in the land hed been told of as a child it was wild and rough with crags rising high and moors spread out and desolate prominent peaks pierced the milky gray of the sky sometimes cut through with tumbling waterfalls and icy rivers thick with fish in other places rocks were tumbled as though they had been dice rolled by a careless hand it seemed an ancient place one for gods and fairies yet he saw an occasional cottage smoke belching from the central opening in the thatch the ground was heaped with snow and the wind blew it in sheets across the road at times they were nearly blinded by it as coll led the way up the rising rutfilled hills caves opened out of rock here and there were signs that shelter had been taken in them lakes their waters a dark dangerous blue were crusted at the edges with ice the effects of the ale were whisked away by a damp cold that stung the air and penetrated even the layers of a greatcoat they rode hard when the land permitted then picked their way through snowdrifts as high as a mans waist cautious they bypassed the forts the english had built and avoided the hospitality that would have been given unhesitatingly at any cottage hospitality coll had warned brigham would include questions about every aspect of their journey their families and their destination strangers were rare in the highlands and prized for their news as much as their company rather than risk the details of their journey being passed from village to village they kept to the rougher roads and hills before stopping at a tavern to rest the horses and take their midday meal the floors were dirt the chimney no more than a hole in the roof that kept as much smoke in as it let out the single cramped room smelled of its occupants and of yesterdays fish it was hardly a spot the fourth earl of ashburn would be likely to frequent but the fire was hot and the meat almost fresh beneath the greatcoat which now hung drying in front of the fire brigham wore duncolored riding breeches and a shirt of fine lawn with his plainest riding coat but though it might be plain it fit without a wrinkle over his broad shoulders and its buttons were silver his boots had been dulled a bit by the weather but were unmistakably of good leather his thick mane of hair was tied back with a riband and on his narrow hands he wore his family seal and an emerald he was hardly dressed in his best court attire but nonetheless he drew stares and curious whispers they dont see the likes of you in this hole coll said comfortable in his kilt and bonnet with the pine sprig of his clan tucked into the band he dug hungrily into his meat pie apparently brigham ate lazily but his eyes behind halfclosed lids remained alert such admiration would delight my tailor oh its only partly the clothes coll raised his bicker of ale to drain it and thought pleasantly of the whiskey he would share with his father that night you would look like an earl if you wore rags anxious to be off he tossed coins on the table the horses should be rested lets be off were skirting campbell country colls manners were too polished to allow him to spit but he would have liked to id prefer not to dally three men left the tavern before them letting in a blast of cold and beautifully fresh air it had become difficult for coll to contain his impatience now that he was back in the highlands he wanted nothing so much as to see his own home his own family the road twisted and climbed occasionally winding by a huddle of cottages and cattle grazing on the rough uneven ground men living here would have to keep an eye out for wildcat and badgers though they had hours to ride he could almost scent home the forest with its red deer and tawny owls there would be a feast that night and cups raised in toasts london with its crowded streets and fussy manners was behind him trees were scarce only the little junipers pushing through on the leeside of boulders in scotland even the brush had a difficult time surviving now and then they rode by a rumbling river or stream to be challenged by the eerie consuming silence that followed the skies had cleared to a hard brilliant blue above majestic and glorious a golden eagle circled brig beside coll brigham had suddenly gone rigid colls horse reared as brigham pulled out his sword guard your flank he shouted then wheeled to face two riders who had burst out from behind a tumble of rock they rode sturdy garrons shaggy scottish ponies and though their tartans were dulled with age and dirt the blades of their fighting swords shone in the midafternoon sun brigham had only time enough to note that the men who charged had been in the tavern before there was the crash of steel against steel beside him coll wielded his sword against two more the high hills rang with the sounds of battle the thunder of hooves against hardpacked ground gliding overhead the eagle circled and waited the attackers had misjudged their quarry in brigham his hands were narrow his body slender as a dancers but his wrists were both wiry and supple using his knees to guide his mount he fought with a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other there might have been jewels on the hilts but the blades were fashioned to kill he heard coll shout and swear for himself he fought in deadly silence steel scraped as he defended himself crashed when he took the offensive driving at one foe and outmaneuvering the other his eyes usually a calm clear gray had darkened and narrowed like those of a wolf that scents blood he gave his opponents sword one final vicious parry and ran his own blade home the scot screamed but the sound lasted no more than a heartbeat blood splattered the snow as the man fell his pony frightened by the smell of death ran clattering up the rocks the other man wildeyed renewed his attack with more ferocity and fear than finesse the violence of the advance nearly cut through brighams guard and he felt the sting of the sword on his shoulder and the warm flow of blood where the point had ripped layers of clothing and found flesh brigham countered with swift steady strokes driving his quarry back and back toward the rocks his eyes stayed on his opponents face never flickering never wavering with coolheaded precision he parried and thrust and pierced the heart before the man had nit the ground he was swinging back toward coll it was one on one now for another of the attackers lay dead behind coll and brigham took time to draw a deep breath then he saw colls horse slip nearly stumble he saw the blade flash and was racing toward his friend the last man of the band of attackers looked up to see the horse and rider bearing down on him with his three comrades dead he wheeled the pony and scrambled up the rocks coll are you hurt aye by god bloody campbell he struggled not to slump in the saddle his side where the sword had pierced it was on fire brigham sheathed his sword let me see to it no time that jackal may come back with more coll took out a handkerchief and pressed it to the wound then brought his gloved hand back it was sticky but steady im not done yet his eyes still bright from battle met brighams well be home by dusk with that he sent his horse into a gallop they rode hard with brigham keeping one eye out for another ambush and the other on coll the big scot was pale but his pace never faltered only once at brighams insistence did they stop so that the wound could be bound more satisfactorily brigham didnt like what he saw the wound was deep and coll had lost far too much blood still his friend was in a fever to reach glenroe and his family and brigham would not have known where else to find help coll accepted the flask brigham put to his lips and drank deeply when the color seeped back into his face brigham helped him into the saddle they dropped down out of the hills into the forest at dusk when the shadows were long and wavering it smelled of pine and snow with a faint wisp of smoke from a cottage farther on a hare dashed across the path then crashed through the brush behind it like a flash came a merlin winter berries as big as thumbs clung to thorny limbs brigham knew colls strength was flagging and he paused long enough to make him drink again i ran through this forest as a child coll rasped his breathing came quickly but the brandy eased the pain hed be damned if he would die before the true fighting began hunted in it stole my first kiss in it for the life of me i cant think why i ever left it to come back a hero brigham said as he corked the flask coll gave a laugh that turned into a cough aye theres been a macgregor in the highlands since god put us here and here we stay he turned to brigham with a hint of the old arrogance you may be an earl but my race is royal and youre shedding your royal blood all over the forest to home coll they rode at an easy canter when they passed the first cottages cries went out out of houses some fashioned from wood and stone others built out of no more than mud and grass people came though the pain was streaking up his side coll saluted they crested a hill and both men saw macgregor house there was smoke winding out of the chimneys behind the glazed windows lamps just lighted were glowing the sky to the west was ablaze with the last lights of the sun and the blue slate glowed and seemed to turn to silver it rose four stories graced with turrets and towers a house fashioned as much for war as for comfort the roofs were of varying height strung together in a confused yet somehow charming style there was a barn in the clearing along with other outbuildings and grazing cattle from somewhere came the hollow barking of a dog behind them more people had come out of their homes out of one ran a woman her basket empty brigham heard her shout and turned and stared she was wrapped in a plaid like a mantle in one hand she held a basket that swung wildly as she ran the other hand held the hem of her skirt and he could see the flash of petticoats and long legs she was laughing as she ran and her scarf fell down around her shoulders leaving hair the color of the sunset flying behind her her skin was like alabaster though flushed now from delight and cold her features had been carved with a delicate hand but the mouth was full and rich brigham could only stare and think of the shepherdess he had loved and admired as a child coll her voice was low filled with the music of laughter rich with the burr of scotland ignoring the horses dancing impatience she gripped the bridle and turned up a face that made brighams mouth turn dry ive had the fidgets all day and should have known you were the cause we had no word you were coming did you forget how to write or were you too lazy a fine way to greet your brother coll would have bent down to kiss her but her face was swimming in front of his eyes the least you can do is show some manners to my friend brigham langston lord ashburn my sister serena not hard to look at for once brigham thought coll hadnt exaggerated far from it miss macgregor but serena didnt spare him a glance coll what is it youre hurt even as she reached for him he slid from the saddle to her feet oh god whats this she pushed aside his coat and found the hastily bound wound its opened again brigham knelt beside her we should get him inside serenas head shot up as she raked brigham with rapiersharp green eyes it wasnt fear in them but fury take your hands off him english swine she shoved him aside and cradled her brother against her breast with her own plaid she pressed against the wound to slow the bleeding how is it my brother comes home near death and you ride in with your fine sword sheathed and nary a scratch coll might have underplayed her beauty brigham decided as his mouth set but not her temperament i think thats best explained after colls seen to take your explanations back to london when he gathered coll up to carry him she all but pounced on him leave him be damn you i wont have you touching whats mine he let his gaze run up and down her until her cheeks glowed believe me madam he said stiffly polite ive no desire to if youll see to the horses miss macgregor ill take your brother in she started to speak again but one look at colls white face had her biting back the words with his greatcoat flapping around him and coll in his arms brigham started toward the house serena remembered the last time an englishman had walked into her home snatching the reins of both horses she hurried after brigham cursing him chapter two contents prev next there was little time for introductions brigham was greeted at the door by a gangly blackhaired serving girl who ran off wringing her hands and shouting for lady macgregor fiona came in her cheeks flushed from the kitchen fire at the sight of her son unconscious in the arms of a stranger she went pale coll is he no my lady but the wounds severe with one very slender hand she touched her sons face please if youd bring him upstairs she went ahead calling out orders for water and bandages in here after pushing open a door she looked over brighams shoulder gwen thank god colls been wounded gwen smaller and more delicately built than her mother and sister hurried into the room light the lamps molly she told the serving girl ill need plenty of light she was already pressing a hand to her brothers brow hes feverish his blood stained his plaid and ran red on the linen can you help me off with his clothes with a nod brigham began to work with her she coolly sent for medicines and bowls of water stacks of linen were rushed in the young girl didnt swoon at the sword wound as brigham had feared but competently began to clean and treat it even under her gentle hands coll began to mutter and thrash hold this if you please gwen gestured for brigham to hold the pad shed made against the wound while she poured syrup of poppies into a wooden cup fiona supported her sons head while gwen eased the potion past his lips she murmured to him as she sat again and stitched up the wound without flinching hes lost a lot of blood she told her mother as she worked well have to mind the fever already fiona was bathing her sons head with a cool cloth hes strong we wont lose him now fiona straightened and brushed at the hair that had fallen around her face im grateful to you for bringing him she told brigham will you tell me what happened we were attacked a few miles south of here coll believes it was campbells i see her lips tightened but her voice remained calm i must apologize for not even offering you a chair or a hot drink im colls mother fiona macgregor im colls friend brigham langston fiona managed a smile but kept her sons limp hand in hers the earl of ashburn of course coll wrote of you please let me have molly take your coat and fetch you some refreshment hes english serena stood in the doorway shed taken off her plaid all she wore now was a simple homespun dress of dark blue wool im aware of that serena fiona turned her strained smile back to brigham your coat lord ashburn youve had a long journey im sure youll want a hot meal and some rest when he drew off his coat fionas gaze went to his shoulder oh youre wounded not badly a scratch serena said as she flicked her gaze over it she would have moved past him to her brother but a look from fiona stopped her take our guest down to the kitchen and tend to his hurts id sooner bandage a rat youll do as i say and youll show the proper courtesy to a guest in our home the steel came into her voice once his wounds are tended see that he has a proper meal lady macgregor it isnt necessary forgive me my lord its quite necessary youll forgive me for not tending to you myself she picked up the cloth for colls head again serena very well mother for you serena turned giving a very small and deliberately insulting curtsy if you please lord ashburn he followed her down through a house far smaller than ashburn manor and neat as a pin they wound around a hallway and down two narrow flights because she chose to take him down the back stairs still he paid little notice as he watched serenas stiff back there were rich smells in the kitchen spices meat from the kettle hung by a chain over the fire the aroma of pies just baked serena indicated a small spindlelegged chair please be seated my lord he did and only by the slightest flicker of his eyes did he express his feelings when she ripped the sleeve from his shirt i hope you dont faint at the sight of blood miss macgregor its more likely you will at the sight of your mutilated shirt lord ashburn she tossed the ruined sleeve aside and brought back a bowl of hot water and some clean cloths it was more than a scratch english though he might be she felt a bit ashamed of herself hed obviously opened the wound when hed carried coll inside as she stanched the blood that had begun to run freely she saw that the cut measured six inches or more along a wellmuscled forearm his flesh was warm and smooth in her hands he smelled not of perfumes and powders as she imagined all englishmen did but of horses and sweat and blood oddly enough it stirred something in her and made her fingers gentler than shed intended she had the face of an angel he thought as she bent over him and the soul of a witch an interesting combination brigham decided as he caught a whiff of lavender the kind of mouth made for kissing paired with hostile eyes designed to tear holes in a man how would her hair feel bunched in a mans hands he had an urge to stroke it just to see her reaction but one wound he told himself was enough for one day she worked competently and in silence cleaning the wound and dabbing on one of gwens herbal mixtures the scent was pleasant and made her think of the forest and flowers serena hardly noticed that his english blood was on her fingers she reached for the bandages he shifted all at once they were facetoface as close as a man and woman can come without embracing she felt his breath feather across her lips and was surprised by the quick flutter of her heart she noticed his eyes were gray darker than they had been when hed coolly assessed her on the road his mouth was beautiful curved now with the beginnings of a smile that changed his sharpfeatured aristocratic face into something approachable she thought she felt his fingers on her hair but was certain she was mistaken for a moment perhaps two her mind went blank and she could only look at him and wonder will i live he murmured there it was that english voice mocking smug she needed nothing else to drag her out of whatever spell his eyes had cast she smiled at him and yanked the bandage tight enough to make him jerk oh pardon my lord she said with a flutter of lashes have i hurt you he gave her a mild look and thought it would be satisfying to throttle her pray dont regard it i will not she rose to remove the bowl of bloodstained water odd isnt it that english blood runs so thin i hadnt noticed the scottish blood i shed today looked pale to me she whirled back if it was campbell blood you rid the world of another badger but i wont be grateful to you for that or anything you cut me to the quick my lady when your gratitude is what i live for she snatched up a wooden bowl though her mother would have meant for her to use the delft or the china and scooped out stew and slapped it down so that more than a little slopped over the sides she poured him ale and tossed a couple of oatcakes on a platter a pity they werent stale your supper my lord have a care not to choke on it he rose then and for the first time she noticed that he was nearly as tall as her brother though he carried less muscle and brawn your brother warned me you were illtempered she set her fist on her hip eyeing him from under lashes shades darker than her tumbled hair thats fortunate for you my lord so youll know better than to cross me he stepped toward her it couldnt be helped given his temper and his penchant for fighting facetoface she tilted her chin as if braced even anxious for the bout if youve a mind to chase me into the wood with your grandsires claymore think again her lips twitched even as she fought back the smile humor made her eyes almost as appealing as anger why are you fast on your feet sassenach she asked using the gaelic term for the hated english invader fast enough to knock you off yours if you were fortunate enough to catch me he took her hand effectively wiping the smile from her eyes though her hand curled into a fist he brought it to his lips my thanks miss macgregor for your so gentle touch and hospitality while he stood where he was she stormed out furiously wiping her knuckles against her skirts it was full dark when ian macgregor returned with his youngest son after his quick meal brigham kept to the room hed been given leaving the family to themselves and giving himself time to think coll had described the macgregors well enough fiona was lovely with enough strength in her face and bearing to add grit to beauty young gwen was sweet and quiet with shy eyes and a steady hand when she sewed rent flesh together as to serena coll hadnt mentioned that his sister was a shewolf with a face to rival helens but brigham was content to make his own judgments there it might be true that she had no cause to love the english but for himself brigham preferred to weigh a man as a man not by his nationality he would do as well to judge a woman as a woman and not by her looks he thought when she had come racing down the road toward her brother her face alive with pleasure her hair flying hed felt as though he had been struck by lightning fortunately he wasnt a man who tarried long under the spell of a beautiful pair of eyes and a pretty ankle he had come to scotland to fight for a cause he believed in not to worry because some slip of a girl detested him because of his birth he thought as he paced to the window and back hed never had any cause to be other than proud of his lineage his grandfather had been a man respected and feared as his father had been before death had taken him so early from the time he was old enough to understand brigham had been taught that being a langston was both a privilege and a responsibility he took neither lightly if he had he would have stayed in paris enjoying the whims and caprices of elegant society rather than traveling to the mountains of scotland to risk all for the young prince damn the woman for looking at him as though he were scum to be scrubbed from the bottom of a pot at a knock on the door he turned scowling from the window yes the serving girl opened the door with her heart already in her throat one peep at brighams black looks had her lowering her eyes and bobbing nervous curtsies begging your pardon lord ashburn and that was all she could manage he waited then sighed might i know what you beg it for she darted him a quick look then stared at the floor again my lord the macgregor wishes to see you downstairs if its convenient certainly ill come right away but the girl had already dashed off she would have a story to tell her mother that night about how serena macgregor had insulted the english lord to his face a face shed add that was handsome as the devils brigham fluffed out the lace at his wrists he had traveled with only one change of clothes and he hoped the coach with the rest of his belongings would find its ponderous way to glenroe next day he descended the stairs slender and elegant in black and silver lace foamed subtly at his throat and his rings gleamed in the lamplight in paris and london hed followed fashion and powdered his hair here he was glad to dispense with the bother so it was brushed raven black away from his high forehead the macgregor waited in the dining hall drinking port a fire roaring at his back his hair was a dark red and fell to his shoulders a beard of the same color and luster covered his face he had dressed as was proper when receiving company of rank in truth the great kilt suited him for he was as tall and broad as his son with it he wore a doublet of calfskin and a jeweled clasp at his shoulder on which was carved the head of a lion lord ashburn you are welcome to glenroe and the house of ian macgregor thank you brigham accepted the offered port and chair id like to inquire about coll hes resting easier though my daughter gwen tells me it will be a long night ian paused a moment looking down at the pewter cup held in his wide thickfingered hand coll has written of you as a friend if he had not you would now be one for bringing him back to us he is my friend and has been this was accepted with a nod then i drink to your health my lord he did with gusto im told your grandmother was a macdonald she was from the isle of skye ians face well lined and reddened by wind and weather relaxed into a smile then welcome twice ian lifted his cup and kept his eye keen on his guest to the true king brigham lifted his port in turn to the king across the water he said meeting ians fierce blue gaze and the rebellion to come aye that ill drink to and he did downing the port in one giant gulp now tell me how it happened that my boy was hurt brigham described the ambush detailing the men whod attacked them and their dress as he spoke ian listened leaning forward on the big table as though afraid he might miss a word bloody murdering campbells he exploded pounding a fist on the table so that cups and crockery jumped so coll thought himself brigham said equably i know a bit about the clans and the feud between yours and the campbells lord macgregor it could have been a simple matter of robbery or it could be that word is out that the jacobites are stirring and so they are ian thought a moment drumming his fingers well four on two was it not such bad odds when it comes to campbells you were wounded as well a trifle brigham shrugged it was a gesture hed acquired in france if colls mount hadnt slipped he would never have dropped his guard hes a devil of a swordsman so he says of you ians teeth flashed there was nothing he admired so much as a good fighter something about a skirmish on the road to calais brigham grinned at that a diversion id like to hear more about it but first tell me what you can about the bonnie prince and his plans they talked for hours draining the bottle of port dry and cracking another while the candles guttered formalities faded and disappeared until they were only two men one past his prime the other only approaching it they were both warriors by birth and by temperament they might fight for different reasons one in a desperate attempt to preserve a way of life and land the other for simple justice but they would fight when they parted ian to look in on his son brigham to take the air and check the horses they knew each other as well as they needed it was late when he returned the house was quiet fires were banked outside the wind whistled bringing home to him the isolation the distance from london and all he held familiar near the door a candle had been lighted to show him the way he took it and started up the stairs though he knew he was still far too restless for sleep the macgregors interested him they had since the first time he and coll had shared a bottle and their life stories he knew they were bound together not just through family obligation but through affection and a common love of their land tonight he had seen them pull together with unquestioning faith and loyalty there had been no hysterics when he had carried coll inside no weeping and fainting women instead each had done what had needed to be done it was that kind of strength and commitment charles would need over the next months with the candlelight sending shadows leaping brigham walked past his room to push open the door to colls the bedcurtains were pushed back and he could see his friend sleeping yet covered with blankets and he saw serena sitting in a chair beside the bed reading a book by the light of another taper it was the first time hed seen her look as her name described her face was calm and extraordinarily lovely in the soft light her hair glowed as it fell down her back she had changed her dress for a night robe of deep green that rose high at the throat to frame her face as brigham watched she looked up at her brothers murmur and placed a hand on the pulse at his wrist how is he she started at the sound of brighams voice but collected herself quickly her face expressionless she sat back again to close the book she had in her lap his fevers still up gwen thinks it should break by morning brigham moved to the foot of the bed behind him the fire burned high the scent of medicine mixed with poppies vied with the smoke coll told me she could do magic with herbs ive seen doctors with less of a sure hand sewing up a wound torn between annoyance and pride in her sister serena smoothed down the skirts of her robe she has a gift and a good heart she would have stayed with him all night if i hadnt bullied her off to bed so you bully everyone not just strangers he smiled and held up a hand before she could speak you can hardly tear into me now my dear or you will wake up your brother and the rest of your family im not your dear for which i shall go to my grave thankful merely a form of address coll stirred and brigham moved to the side of the bed to place a cool hand on his brow has he waked at all a time or two but not in his right head because her conscience demanded it she relented he asked for you she rose and wrung out a cloth to bathe her brothers face with you should retire and see him in the morning and what of you her hands were gentle on her brother soothing cooling despite himself brigham imagined how they might feel stroking his brow what of me have you no one to bully you to bed she glanced up fully aware of his meaning i go when and where i choose taking her seat again she folded her hands youre wasting your candle lord ashburn without a word he snuffed it out the light of the single taper by the bed plunged them into intimacy quite right he murmured one candle is sufficient i hope you can find your way to your room in the dark i have excellent night vision as it happens but i dont retire yet idly he plucked the book from her lap macbeth dont the fine ladies of your acquaintance read his lips twitched a few he opened the book and scanned the pages a grisly little tale murder and power she made a little gesture with her hands life my lord can be grisly as the english so often prove macbeth was a scot he reminded her a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing is that how you see life i see it as what can be made of it brigham leaned against a table holding the book loosely he believed she meant just what she said and that interested him most of the women he knew could philosophize about no more than fashion you dont see macbeth as a villain why she hadnt meant to speak to him much less hold a conversation but she couldnt resist he took what he felt was his and his methods ruthless perhaps kings need be charles wont claim his throne by asking for it no with a frown brigham closed the book but treachery differs from warfare a sword is a sword thrust in the back or in the heart she looked at him her green eyes glowing in the light if i were a man i would fight to win and the devil take the method and honor there is much honor in victory she soaked the cloth and wrung it out again for all her talk she had a womans way with illness gentle patient thorough there was a time when the macgregors were hunted like vermin with the campbells paid in good british gold for each death if you are hunted like something wild you learn to fight like something wild women were raped and murdered bairns not yet weaned slaughtered we dont forget lord ashburn nor forgive this is a new time serena still my brothers blood was shed today on impulse he placed a hand over hers in a few months more will be shed but for justice not revenge you can afford justice my lord not i coll moaned and began to thrash serena turned her full attention to him again automatically brigham held him down hell break open his wound again keep him still serena poured more medicine into a wooden cup and held it to colls lips drink now darling she poured what she could down his throat murmuring threatening coaxing all the while he was shivering though his skin was like fire to the touch she no longer questioned brighams presence and she said nothing when he stripped off his coat and tucked back the lace at his wrists together they bathed coll with cool water forced more of gwens mixture past his dry lips and kept watch during colls delirium serena spoke to him mainly in gaelic as calm and steady as a seasoned soldier brigham found it strange to see her so unruffled when from almost the first moment of their acquaintance she had been animated by excitement or fury now in the deepest part of the night her hands were gentle her voice quiet her movements competent they worked together as though theyd spent their lives doing so she no longer resented his assistance english or not he obviously cared for her brother without his aid she would have been forced to summon her sister or her mother for a few hours serena forced herself to forget that lord ashburn represented all she despised now and then over the cloth or the cup their hands brushed both of them strove to ignore even this minor intimacy he might have been concerned for coll but he was still an english nobleman she might have had more spine than any other women hed known but she was still a scots terror the truce lasted while colls fever raged by the time the light turned gray with approaching dawn the crisis had passed hes cool serena blinked back tears as she stroked her brothers brow silly to weep now she thought when the worst was over i think hell do but gwen will have a look at him he should sleep well enough brigham pressed a hand to the small of his back where a dull ache lodged the fire they had taken turns feeding during the night still roared at his back shooting light and heat he had loosened his shut for comfort and a smoothly muscled chest could be seen in the deep v serena wiped her own brow and tried not to notice its almost morning she felt weak and weepy and tired to the bone yes brighams mind had shifted suddenly completely from the man in the bed to the woman by the window the first hints of dawn were behind her and she stood in shadow and in light her night robe cloaked her as if she were royalty her face pale with fatigue was dominated by eyes that seemed only larger darker more mysterious for the faint bruises beneath her blood began to tingle below her skin as he continued to stare at her she wished he would stop it made her feel powerless somehow suddenly afraid she tore her gaze from his and looked at her brother theres no need for you to stay now no she turned her back brigham took it as a dismissal he gave her an ironic bow she couldnt see but stopped when he heard the sniffle he paused at the door then dragging a hand through his hair and swearing he moved toward her no need for tears now serena hurriedly she wiped at her cheek with her knuckles i thought he would die i didnt realize how afraid i was of it until it was past she swiped a hand over her face again ive lost my handkerchief she said miserably brigham pressed his own into her hand thank you youre welcome he managed when she handed it back to him crumpled and damp better now aye she let out a long steadying breath i wish you would go where though he knew it was unwise he turned her to face him he only wanted to see her eyes again to my bed or to the devil her lips curved surprising them both as you choose my lord he wanted those lips the knowledge stunned him as much as her smile did he wanted them warm and open and completely willing under his own light broke through the sky and tumbled like gold dust through the window before either of them were prepared he reached out so that his fingers dug through her hair and cupped her neck no she managed amazed that the denial was unsteady when she lifted a hand in protest he met it palm to palm so they stood as the new day began you tremble he murmured lightly he ran his fingers up her neck kindling small fires i wondered if you would ive not given you leave to touch me ive not asked for leave he drew her closer nor will i he brought their joined hands to his lips dropping a soft kiss on her fingers nor need i she felt the room tilt and her will drain as he lowered his head toward her she saw only his face then only his eyes as if in a dream she let her own eyes close and her lips part serena she jerked back color flaming into her face at the sound of her sisters voice shaken serena gripped her hands together as gwen stepped into the room you should be resting yet youve only slept a few hours it was enough coll she asked staring toward the bed his fevers broken ah thank god her hair more gold than red curtained her face as she bent over him in her pale blue night robe she looked very much like the angel coll had described he sleeps well and should for a few hours yet she glanced up to smile at her sister and saw brigham by the window lord ashburn have you not slept he was about to retire serena moved briskly to her sisters side you need rest gwens face puckered into a frown as she thought of his shoulder youll do your wound no good else he does well enough serena said impatiently for your concern i thank you brigham bowed pointedly to gwen as it appears i can be of no further use i will seek my bed his gaze swept down serena and up again beside her sister she too looked like an angel an avenging one your servant madam gwen smiled after him as he strode out her young heart fluttering a bit at the sight of his bare chest and arms so handsome she sighed with a sniff serena brushed at the bodice of her robe for an englishman it was kind of him to stay with coll serena could still feel the determined press of his fingers on the back of her neck hes not kind she murmured i dont believe hes kind at all chapter three contents prev next brigham slept until the sun was high his shoulder was stiff but there was no pain he supposed he owed serena for that his lips curved into a grim smile as he dressed he intended to pay her back after he had pulled on his breeches he glanced at his torn riding coat it would have to do as he could hardly wear evening dress until his trunks arrived he would be roughing it he ran a hand over his chin after shrugging into the coat his stubble was rough and his lace far from fresh how his valet would have cringed dear dour parkins had been furious at being left in london while his lord traveled to the barbarous scottish highlands parkins knew as few did the true purpose of the trip but that had only made him more insistent about accompanying his master brigham tilted the shaving mirror parkins was loyal he thought but hardly competent to do battle there was no finer or more proper gentlemans gentleman in london but brigham hardly needed or wanted a valet during his stay in glenroe with a sigh he began to strop his razor he might not be able to do anything about the torn jacket or the drooping lace but he could manage to shave himself once he was presentable he made his way downstairs fiona was there to greet him an apron over her simple wool gown lord ashburn i trust you rested well very well lady macgregor if youre a man such as i know youll be wanting to break your fast with a smile she laid a hand on his arm and began to walk would you care to sit in the parlor its warmer than the dining hall and when i have a solitary meal i find it less lonely thank you molly tell the cook that lord ashburn is awake and hungry she led him into a parlor where a table had already been set for him shall i leave you now or would you prefer company i always prefer the company of a beautiful woman my lady with a smile she accepted the chair he held out for her coll said you were a charmer apron or not she sat as gracefully as any drawing room miss brigham had known i wasnt able to thank you properly last night id like to make up for that now and give you all my gratitude for delivering coll home would that i had delivered him under better circumstances you brought him she offered her hand i owe you a great deal hes my friend aye she squeezed his hand briefly so hes told me that doesnt lessen the debt but i wont embarrass you molly brought in coffee and fiona poured pleased by the opportunity to make use of her china coll asked for you this morning perhaps after youve eaten you would go up and speak with him of course how does he well enough to complain fionas smile was maternal hes like his father impatient impulsive and very very dear they spoke idly while his breakfast was served there was porridge and thick slabs of ham portions of fresh fish with eggs and oatcakes and numerous jams and jellies though he chose coffee over the breakfast whiskey it occurred to him that while remote this highland table could easily rival one in london the lady sipped her coffee and encouraged brigham to eat his fill he found her burr charming and her conversation direct while he ate he waited for her to ask him what he and her husband had discussed the night before but the questions didnt come if youll give me your jacket this evening my lord i would mend it for you he glanced at the ruined sleeve i fear it will never be the same her eyes were sober when they met his we do what we can with what we have she rose bringing brigham to his feet her skirts swished quietly into place if youll excuse me lord ashburn i have much to see to before my husband returns the macgregor has gone he should be home by evening we all have much to do before prince charles makes his move brighams brow lifted as she left hed never known a woman to take the threat of war quite so complacently when he returned upstairs he found coll a bit pale and shadowed around the eyes but sitting up and arguing i wont touch that slop you will eat every drop serena said threateningly gwen made it especially for you i dont care if the blessed virgin dipped her finger in it i wont have it blaspheme again and youll wear it good morning children brigham strolled into the room brig thank god coll said feelingly send this wench on her way and get me some meat meat he repeated and whiskey after crossing to the bed brigham raised a brow at the thin gruel serena held in a bowl it certainly looks revolting aye thats just what i said myself coll fell back against the pillows relieved to have a man on his side no one but a thickskulled woman would expect anyone to eat it had a rather nice slab of ham myself ham done to a turn my compliments to your cook miss macgregor gruels what he needs she said between her teeth and gruels what hell have after a shrug brigham sat on the edge of the bed ive done my bit coll its up to you toss her out brigham fluffed his lace i hate to disoblige you my dear but the woman terrifies me hah coll set his chin and eyed his sister go to the devil serena and take that slop with you fine then if you want to hurt little gwens feelings after she nursed you and took the time and trouble to make you something fit to eat ill just take it down and tell her you said it was slop and youd rather have nothing than touch it she turned bowl in hand before shed taken two steps coll relented hell and damnation give it to me then brigham caught her smirk as she swept aside her skirts and sat well done he murmured ignoring him she dipped the spoon in the bowl open your big mouth coll i wont be fed he said just before she shoved in the first bit of gruel curse it serena i said ill feed myself and spill gruel all over your clean nightshirt ill not be changing you again today my lad so open your mouth and be quiet he would have sworn at her again but he was too busy swallowing gruel ill leave you to your breakfast coll for mercys sake he grabbed brighams wrist dont desert me now shell yap at me nag and bluster and set me mad i he glared as serena pushed more gruel into his mouth shes the devil of a female brig a mans not safe with her is that so smiling brigham studied serenas face and was rewarded by the faintest rising of color i havent thanked you for getting me home im told you were wounded coll said a scratch your sister tended it gwens an angel young gwen had her hands full with you serena bound me up coll looked at his sister and grinned hamfisted youll be swallowing the spoon in a moment coll macgregor it takes more than a hole in my side to devil me lassie i can still put you over my knee she wiped his mouth delicately with a napkin the last time you tried you walked with a limp for a week he grinned at the memory aye right you are brig the lass is a trojan kicked me square in the he caught serenas furious look pride so to speak ill remember that if i ever have occasion to wrestle with miss macgregor beaned me with a pot once too coll said reminiscently damn me if i didnt see stars he was drowsy again and his eyelids drooped fireeater he muttered youll never catch a husband that way if it was a husband i wanted to catch so i would the prettiest girl in glenroe colls voice wavered as his eyes shut but the tempers foul brig not like that pretty frenchie with the gold hair what pretty frenchie serena wondered sending brigham a sidelong look but he was only grinning and fiddling with the button of his jacket ive had the pleasure of discovering that for myself brigham murmured rest now ill be back forced that gruel on me nasty stuff aye and theres more where that came from ungrateful oaf i love you rena she brushed the hair from his brow i know hush now and sleep serena tucked him up while brigham stood back hell be quiet for a few hours now mother will feed him next and he wont argue with her id say the arguing did him as much good as the gruel that was the idea she lifted the tray with the empty bowl and started past him brigham had only to shift to block her way did you rest well enough pardon me lord ashburn i have things to do instead of moving aside he smiled at her when i spend the night with a woman she usually calls me by my name the lights of war came into her eyes just as hed hoped im not some goldenhaired frenchie or one of your loose london women so keep your name lord ashburn ive no use for it i believe i have use for yours serena she delighted him by snarling you have the most beautiful eyes ive ever seen that flustered her she knew how to handle flattery how to accept it evade it discount it somehow it wasnt as easy with him let me pass she muttered would you have kissed me he put two fingers under her chin as he asked serena held the tray like a shield would you have this morning when the need for sleep was all over your face and the light just going gold move aside because her voice was husky she shoved the tray at him brigham caught it instinctively to keep it from falling unencumbered serena headed for the door with him two steps behind the sound of running feet stopped them both malcolm must you sound like a great elephant colls sleeping oh a boy of about ten skidded to a halt his hair was a deep red that would probably darken to mahogany with age unlike the other men in his family he had fine almost delicate features he had brigham noticed immediately the deep green eyes of his sister i wanted to see him you can watch him if youre quiet with a sigh serena shook his shoulder wash first you look like a stableboy he grinned showing a missing tooth ive been with the mare shell foal in a day or two you smell like her she noticed from the mud in the hall that he hadnt done a thorough job of cleaning his boots she would sweep it up before their mother saw it she started to speak to him about it then noticed he was no longer attending brigham found himself being studied and assessed quite mantoman the boy was lean as a whippet and smudged with dirt and there was sharp curiosity in his eyes are you the english pig malcolm both ignored her as brigham stepped forward calmly he handed the tray back to serena im english at any rate though my grandmother was a macdonald mortified serena stared straight ahead i will apologize for my brother my lord he shot her a look ripe with irony both of them knew where malcolm had come by the description no need you would perhaps introduce us serenas fingers dug into the tray lord ashburn my brother malcolm your servant master macgregor malcolm grinned at that and at brighams formal bow my father likes you he confided so does my mother and gwen i think but shes too shy to say brighams lips twitched im honored coll wrote that you had the best stables in london so ill like you too because it was irresistible brigham ruffled the boys hair and grinned wickedly at serena another conquest she lifted her chin go wash malcolm she ordered before she flounced away they always want you to wash malcolm said with a sigh im glad therell be more men in the house nearly two hours later brighams coach arrived causing no little stir in the village lord ashburn believed in owning the best and his traveling equipment was no exception the coach was well sprung a regal black picked out with silver the driver wore black as well the groom who rode on the box with him was enjoying the fact that people were peeking out their doors and windows at the arrival though hed complained for the last day and a half about the miserable weather the miserable roads and the miserable pace he felt better knowing that the journey was at an end and that hed be left to tend to his horses here boy the driver pulled up the steaming horses and gestured to a boy who stood beside the road ogling the coach and sucking his finger where will i find macgregor house straight down this road and over the rise you be looking for the english lord that be his carriage you got that right pleased with himself the boy gestured hes there the driver sent the horses into a trot brigham was there to meet them himself braced against the cold he stepped out as the coach pulled up you took your sweet time beg pardon my lord weather held us up brigham waved a hand at the trunks bring those in the stables are around the back jem settle the horses have you eaten jem whose family had been with the langstons for three generations jumped down nimbly hardly a bite milord wiggins here sets a mad pace appreciating the truth of it brigham grinned up at the driver im sure there will be something hot in the kitchen if you would he stopped as the coach door swung open and a personage more dignified than any duke stepped out parkins parkins bowed my lord then he studied brighams attire and his dour face changed his voice filled with mortification quivered oh my lord brigham cast a rueful glance at his torn sleeve undoubtedly parkins would be more concerned with the material than with the wound beneath as you see i have need of my trunks now what in blazes are you doing here you have a need for me as well my lord parkins drew himself up i knew i was right to come and there can be no doubt of it see that the trunks are put in lord ashburns room immediately though the cold was seeping through his riding coat brigham planted himself how did you come i met the coach yesterday sir after you and mr macgregor had taken to horse a foot shorter than brigham and woefully thin parkins pushed his shoulders back i will not be sent back to london my lord when my duty is here i dont need a valet man im not attending any balls i served my lords father for fifteen years and my lord for five i will not be sent back brigham opened his mouth then shut it loyalty was impossible to argue with oh come in damn you its freezing cloaked in dignity parkins ascended the stairs i will see to my lords unpacking immediately he gave a shudder as he studied his masters attire once more immediately if i could persuade my lord to accompany me i could have you suitably clad in a trice later brigham swung on his greatcoat i want to check on the horses he strode down the steps checked then turned parkins welcome to scotland the faintest ghost of a smile touched the thin lips thank you my lord jem the groom seemed well on the way to making himself and the horses at home brigham heard his cackling laughter as he pushed aside the wooden door youre a right one aint you master macgregor sure and lord ashburn has the best stable in london england itself for that matter and its me whos in charge of them then ill have you look at my mare jem wholl be foaling soon pleased to have a look at her ill be after ive seen to my loves here jem eh he turned and saw brigham standing in a beam of thin winter light yes sir lord ashburn ill have everything set to rights in a twinkle brigham knew that jem couldnt be faulted with horses but he also had a free hand with the bottle and language the macgregors might not deem proper for their youngest so he lingered supervising the settling of his team fine horses they are lord ashburn malcolm had taken a hand in the grooming i can drive very well you know i wouldnt doubt it brigham had stripped off his greatcoat and since his jacket was ruined in any case he added his weight to the work perhaps well find an afternoon so you can show me truly there was no quicker way to the boys heart i dont think i could handle your coach but we have a curricle he gave a manly sneer though my mother wont let me drive anything but the pony cart by myself youll be with me wont you brigham swatted one of the horses flanks they seem to be in good shape jem go have a look at master macgregors mare please sir would you look in on her too shes a beauty brigham laid a hand on malcolms shoulder id be delighted to meet her satisfied hed found a kindred spirit malcolm took brighams hand and led him through the stables shes betsy at the sound of her name the mare poked her head over the stall door and waited to be rubbed a lovely lady she was a roan not beautifully distinguished but dignified and trim enough as brigham lifted a hand to stroke her head she pricked up her ears and fixed him with a calm questioning eye she likes you the fact pleased malcolm as if he often trusted the opinions of animals over those of people inside the stall jem went about his business in a calm capable way that impressed the young malcolm betsy stood tolerantly sighing occasionally so that her heavy belly shook and switching her tail shell be foaling soon jem pronounced another day or two by my guess i want to sleep in the stables but serena always comes and drags me back dont fret about it jems here now with that jem stepped out of the stall but you will send word when its time jem looked at brigham for affirmation got it and grinned ill send up a shout for you never fear could i impose on you to show jem to the kitchen brigham asked he hasnt eaten i beg your pardon abruptly proper malcolm straightened his shoulders ill see that the cook fixes you something right away good afternoon my lord brig malcolm grinned at the man and at the hand he was offered he shook it formally then skipped out calling for jem to follow a taking little scamp if i may say so milord you may jem try to remember hes young and impressionable at jems blank expression brigham sighed if he begins to swear like my english groom the ax will fall on me he has a sister who would love to wield it yes milord ill be the soul of propriety i will breaking into a grin jem followed malcolm out brigham didnt know why he lingered perhaps it was because it was quiet and the horses good company it was true that hed spent a good part of his youth in the same way as malcolm in the stables hed learned more than a few interesting phrases he could if necessary have harnessed a team himself in only half again as much time as his groom he could drive to an inch or doctor a strained tendon and he had overseen his share of foalings once it had been his dream to breed horses that had changed when the responsibilities of his title had come to him at an early age but it wasnt horses or lost dreams he thought of now it was serena perhaps because his thoughts were on her he wasnt surprised to see her enter the stables shed been thinking of him as well though not entirely kindly throughout the day she hadnt been able to concentrate on ordinary things instead she concentrated unwillingly on that moment she had stood with him by her brothers window shed been tired serena assured herself as she wrapped the plaid securely around her almost asleep on her feet if it came to that why else would she have only stood there while he touched her in that way looked at her in that way and how hed looked even now something stirred in her at the memory his eyes had gotten so dark theyd been so close she knew what it was to have a man look at her with interest even to have one try to steer her into the shadows to steal a kiss with one or two shed permitted it just to see if she might care for it in truth she found kissing pleasant enough if unexciting but nothing before had come close to this her legs had gone weak as if someone had taken out the blood and replaced it with water her head had spun the way it had when shed been twelve and sampled her fathers port and it had felt lord as though her skin were on fire where his fingers had touched it like a sickness she thought what else could it be she shook the feeling off and straightened her shoulders it had been fatigue plain and simple that and concern for her brother and a lack of food she was feeling a great deal better now and if she chanced to come across the highandmighty earl of ashburn she would handle him well enough she shook off her thoughts and peered around the dim stable malcolm you little heathen she called ill have you out of those stables and into the house its your job to fill the woodbox hang you and ive done it myself for the last time i regret youll have to hang malcolm later brigham stepped out of the shadows and was pleased to startle her he isnt here ive just sent him along to the kitchen with my groom she tossed up her chin sent him along hes no servant of yours my dear miss macgregor brigham stepped closer deciding that the dull colors in the plaid were the perfect foil for the richness of her hair malcolm has formed an attachment for jem who is like your brother a great horse lover because her heart was softest when it came to malcolm she subsided hes forever in here twice this week ive had to bundle him up and drag him into the house past his bedtime she caught herself and frowned again if he pesters you id appreciate it if youd let me know ill see that he doesnt intrude no need we deal together easily enough she was frowning over that as he stepped closer she smelled of the lavender that always seemed to waft around her you need more rest serena your eyes are shadowed she had nearly stepped back before she was able to resist the unusual urge to retreat im as strong as one of your horses thank you and youre very free with my name ive taken a liking to it what was it coll called you before he fell asleep rena it has a pretty sound it sounded different when he said it she turned to study his horses youve impressed malcolm with these im sure hes more easily impressed than his sister she glanced over her shoulder you have nothing that could impress me my lord dont you find it wearing to despise all things english no i find it fulfilling because she was feeling weakkneed again and needful she turned on him letting anger replace longings she did not yet understand what are you to me but one more english nobleman who wants things his way do you care for the land for the people for the name you know nothing of what we are she spat out nothing of the persecutions the miseries the degradations more than you think he said softly guarding his own temper you sit in your fine house in london or your manor in the country and dream by the fire of values and great social change we live the fight every day just to hold on to our own what do you know of the terror of waiting in the dark for your men to return or the frustration of not being able to do more than wait do you blame me too for your being born a female he caught her arm before she could spin away her shawl fell away from her hair and onto her shoulders so that the evening light straggling through the doorway and the chinks in the wood glowed over it i might curse myself for preferring you that way he resented bitterly his automatic response to her tell me the truth serena do you despise me aye she said it with passion wanting it to be true because im english its reason enough to hate its not but i think ill give you one to please himself he thought as he dragged her against him to undo the knots in his stomach calm the thunder in his loins she jerked back and might have landed a blow but he was prepared for her and very quick the moment his mouth came down on hers she went still he heard her breath suck in then only the buzzing in his own head she had a mouth like rose petals soft fragrant crushable with an oath he wrapped an arm around her waist and locked her to him he could feel her breasts yield and her body tremble his own was rigid with the shock of the sensation that poured through him behind them the horses blew and shifted weight dust motes danced in an errant sunbeam she couldnt move she thought she might never move again because all the bones in her body had dissolved behind her eyes was a rash of color so vivid so brilliant that they would certainly blind her if this was a kiss then she had never experienced one before for this was all heat all light all movement in one meeting of lips she heard a moan such a soft such a sweet moan and never recognized it as her own her hand was on his arm fingers tangled in the tear of his sleeve she might have swayed but he held her so close was she breathing she had to be for she lived still she could smell him and the scent was much the same as it had been on their first meeting sweat horses man and he tasted her lips patted she thirsted for more he tasted like honey warmed in whiskey wasnt she already drunk from him her heart began to thunder drumming in pulses she hadnt known existed if there was more she wanted to find it if this was all it was enough for a lifetime slowly she slid her hands up his arms over his shoulders and into his hair her kiss changed from one of shock and surrender to one of demand he felt her teeth nip at his lip and a fire centered in his loins suddenly desperate be pressed her back against a post and savaged her mouth even as it opened and invited him in in that instant he was more her prisoner than she his he surfaced like a man drowning gulping in air and shaking his head to clear it good god where did you learn to do that right here right now but shame and confusion stained her cheeks however it had happened she had let him kiss her and lord help her she had enjoyed it let me go i dont know if i can he lifted a hand to her cheek but she jerked her head away struggling for patience brigham stood where he was and tried to catch his breath a moment ago she had kissed him in a manner to rival the finest french courtesans but now right now it was painfully clear she was innocent he could kill himself if coll didnt beat him to it brigham set his jaw seducing the sister of his friend the daughter of his host in the stable as though she were a tavern wench he cleared his throat and stepped back when he spoke his voice was stiff i offer my deepest apologies miss macgregor that was unforgivable her lashes swept up beneath them her eyes were not sheened with tears but bright with anger if i were a man id kill you if you were a man he said just as rigidly my apologies would hardly be necessary he bowed and went out hoping the cold air would clear his head chapter four contents prev next she would have enjoyed killing him serena thought with a sword no a sword was much too clean much too civilized for english vermin unless of course she used it to sever small pieces from him one at a time rather than end his worthless life with one thrust through the heart she smiled to herself as she imagined it a quick hack there a slow torturous slice here her thoughts might have been gruesome but no one would have guessed by looking at her she was the picture of quiet feminine occupation as she sat in the warm kitchen and churned butter it was true that when her thoughts darkened she brought the plunger down with unwarranted force but the energy whatever its source only made the job go faster hed had no right to kiss her that way to force himself on her and less right than that to make her like it with her hands wrapped around the wooden staff serena sent the plunger dancing miserable english cur and she had patched up his hurts with her own hands served him a meal in her own house not willingly perhaps not graciously but she had done it nonetheless if she told her father what brigham had dared to do she paused for a moment as she dreamed of that possibility her father would rage and bellow and very likely whip the english dog within an inch of his miserable life that made her smile again the picture of the highandmighty earl of ashburn groveling in the dirt his arrogant gray eyes clouded with terror she began to churn faster as her smile turned into a snarl the picture was right enough but shed prefer to hold the whip herself she would make him whimper as he sprawled at her feet it was true and perhaps sad serena thought that she had such a love of violence it concerned her mother no doubt it was a pity she hadnt inherited her mothers temperament rather than her fathers but there it was it was rare for a day to go by when serena didnt lose her macgregor temper and then suffer pangs of guilt and remorse because of it she wanted to be more like her mother calm steady patient the good lord knew she tried but it just wasnt in her at times she thought god had made the tiniest mistake with her forgetting the sugar and adding just a dab too much vinegar but if god was entitled to a mistake wasnt she then entitled to her temper with a sigh she continued the monotonous chore of working the plunger up and down it was true enough that her mother would have known exactly the proper way to handle lord ashburn and his unwanted advances she would have become frigidly polite when hed gotten that look in his eyes that look serena thought that told a woman instinctively that he meant mischief by the time fiona macgregor had been done with him lord ashburn would have been putty in her hands for herself she had no way with men when they annoyed her she let them know it with a box on the ear or a sharptongued diatribe and why not she thought scowling why the devil not just because she was a woman did she have to act coy and pretend to be flattered when a man tried to slobber all over her youll be turning that butter rancid with those looks lassie with a sniff serena began to work in earnest i was thinking of men mrs drummond the cook a formidably built woman with graying black hair and sparkling blue eyes cackled she had been a widow these past ten years and had the hands of a farmer thick fingered wide palmed and rough as tree bark still no one in the district had a better way with a joint of meat or a dainty fruit tart a woman should have a smile on her face when she thinks of men scowls send them off but a smile brings them around quick enough i dont want them around serena bared her teeth and ignored her aching shoulders i hate them mrs drummond stirred the batter for her apple cake has that young rob macgregor come sniffing around again not if he values his life now she did smile as she remembered how she had dispatched the amorous rob a likely enough lad mrs drummond mused but not good enough for one of my lassies when i see you courted wedded and bedded itll be to quality serena began to tap her foot in time with her churning i dont think i want to be courted wedded or bedded whist now of course you do in time she gave a quick grin as her spoon beat a steady tattoo against the bowl the muscles in her arms were as solid as mountain rock it has its merits especially the last i dont want to find myself bound to a man just because of what happens in a marriage bed mrs drummond shot a quick look at the doorway to be certain fiona wasnt nearby the mistress was kindness itself but she would get that pinched look on her face if she heard her cook and her daughter discussing delicate matters over the butter churn a better reason is hard to find with the right man my duncan now there was a man who knew how to do his duty and there were nights i went to sleep grateful for it rest his soul did he ever make you feel serena paused a moment groping for the right words well like youd been riding fast over the rocks and couldnt get your breath mrs drummond narrowed her eyes are you sure that rob hasnt been around serena shook her head being with robs like riding a lame pony uphill you think itll never be done with her own eyes were bright with laughter as she looked up at the cook that was the way brigham saw her when he walked in her long fingers were wrapped around the plunger her skirts were kilted up and her face was alive with laughter damn the woman he couldnt keep himself from staring at her damn her for making him want just by looking he made little sound but serena turned her head their eyes locked briefly almost violently before serena lifted her chin away and went back to her churning the look had lasted only an instant but that had been long enough to show mrs drummond what had put serena into a temper or rather who so thats the way of it she mused and couldnt prevent a small smile locked horns without a doubt it was as good a way to begin courting as she knew shed have to think on it she decided but the earl of ashburn was certainly quality as well as having a face and form that made even a widows heart flutter can i serve you my lord what brigham turned to stare through mrs drummond before his eyes slowly focused i beg your pardon ive just come from colls room hes complaining for food miss gwen says a bit of your broth would do him mrs drummond cackled and went to the pot by the fire i have my doubts hed think so but ill spoon it up and have it sent would you mind me asking my lord how the lad does he had made the mistake of looking at serena again as she lazily stroked with the plunger if anyone had told him that watching a woman chum butter could dry a mans mouth to dust he would have laughed now he couldnt see the humor in it he tore his eyes away cursing himself it would pay to remember that he had already spent one sleepless night because of her two if he counted the one they had spent together nursing coll he seems to fare better today miss gwen claims his colors good enough though shell have him stay in bed a while yet she could do it the good lord knows no one else could deal as well with the lad mrs drummond tutted over the man she considered the oldest of her charges she slanted a look at serena and saw that she was watching brigham from under her lashes would you care for some broth yourself my lord or a bit of meat pie no thank you i was on my way to the stables that had the color lifting into serenas cheeks as she banged wood against wood he lifted a brow though she set her chin and moved her bottom lip into a pout that had his stomach muscles clenching she didnt speak nor did he as he gave a brisk nod and strode out now thats a man mrs drummond exclaimed hes english serena countered as if that explained everything well thats true but a mans a man kilt or breeches and his fit him mighty true despite herself serena giggled a womans not supposed to notice a blind womans not supposed to notice mrs drummond set the bowl of broth on a tray and then because her heart was soft added a gooseberry tart molly molly you lazy wench come fetch this tray to the young master she set the tray aside and went back to her stirring the man lord ashburn brought with him from london lassie the properlooking gentleman parkins serena flexed her cramped hands and sneered she found it odd that her heart rate had leveled almost to normal as soon as brigham had swept out his english valet imagine bringing a valet here to fuss with the cut of his coat and the shine on his boots qualitys used to having things done a certain way mrs drummond said wisely i hear mr parkins is an unmarried gentlemen serena moved her shoulders probably too busy starching lord ashburns lace to have his own life or he hasnt met a woman with life enough for two mrs drummond mused seems to me mr parkins could use a bit of fattening up she grinned then set the bowl aside to shout for molly again quality serena thought with a sniff a few hours later just because a man had a trace of blue blood in his veins didnt mean he was quality it didnt make him a gentleman either all it made him was an aristocrat in any case she wasnt going to waste her time thinking about the earl of ashburn for nearly two days she had been tied to the house to the daytoday chores which were increased by colls needs now she had some time free perhaps she was stealing it but she could make it all up later the truth was if she didnt get out and off by herself for just a little while she might burst her mother probably wouldnt approve of her taking a ride in the forest so close to mealtime serena shrugged that off as she saddled her mare her mother would approve even less of the old work breeches she wore hanged if she had the patience to ride sidesaddle she thought as she led the mare out of the stables she would take care that her mother wouldnt see her so that her mother wouldnt have to be disappointed in her behavior with luck no one would see her swinging astride she led her mount to the rear of the stables then over a low hill dotted with spindly briers and lichen surefooted the mare picked her way over the uneven ground until they were almost out of sight of the house serena veered south sending up a brief prayer that no one in her family be looking out the window the moment the forest swallowed her she kicked the mare into a gallop oh god she had needed this more than food more than drink one wild ride through the naked trees with the wind on her face and a horse straining for speed beneath her it might not be the proper thing but she knew as well as she knew her name that it was the right thing for her she didnt have to be a lady here a daughter here a sister here she had only to be serena with a laugh she spurred the horse on she startled small game and sent birds whining upward her breath puffed out white then vanished the plaid she had wrapped around her shoulders held off the bite of the wind and the exercise the freedom were enough to warm her in fact she welcomed the tingle on her skin from the cold winter air and the sharp clean taste of it she had a fleeting wish almost instantly blotted out by guilt that she might continue to ride and ride and ride with never another cow to be milked never another shirt to be washed never another pot to be scrubbed it was probably an evil thought she decided there were those in the village who worked from dawn to dusk who never had an hour they could set aside for dreaming she as daughter to the macgregor had a fine house to live in a good table to eat from a feather bed to sleep on she was ungrateful and would no doubt have to confess to the priest as she had when she had secretly then not so secretly hated the convent school in inverness six months out of her life serena remembered six months wasted before her father had seen that her mind was made up and she would have none of it six months away from the home she loved to live with those simpering giggling girls whose families had wanted them to learn about being ladies bah she could learn everything there was about running a household from her own mother as to being a lady there wasnt a finer one than fiona macgregor she was a lairds daughter herself after all and had spent time in paris and yes even in england long ago there were still times when the chores were done and the fires burning low when fiona played the spinet hadnt she taught gwen whose fingers were more clever and whose mind was more patient that her sisters how to ply a fancy needle fiona could speak french and engage any visitor in polite conversation to serenas mind if she needed to be polished she would be polished in her own home where the talk was of more than hooped skirts and the latest coiffures those giggling wheyfaced girls were the kind of ladies lord ashburn preferred she imagined the kind who covered their faces with fans and fluttered their lashes over them they drank fruit punch and carried vials of smelling salts and lace handkerchiefs in their reticules emptyheaded twits those were the kind of women whose hands brigham would kiss at fancy london balls as she neared the river she slowed the horse to a walk it would be pleasant to sit by the water for a little while if she had had time she would have ridden all the way to the loch that was her special place when she was troubled or needed time by herself today she wasnt troubled serena reminded herself as she slid from the saddle she had only wanted to take a breath of air that was hers alone she laid the reins loosely over a branch then rested her cheek against the mares fancy london balls she thought again and sighed without any idea that the sound was wistful her mother had told her and gwen what they were like the mirrors the polished floors the hundreds and hundreds of candles beautiful gowns sparkling men in curling white wigs and music she closed her eyes and tried to see it shed always had a weakness for music over the sounds of the rushing river she imagined the strains of a minuet there would be reels later serena thought but to start it would be a slow lovely minuet she began to move to the music in her head her eyes still closed her hand held out to an invisible partner lord ashburn would give balls she thought all the beautiful women would come hoping for just one dance with him smiling a little serena executed a neat turn and imagined she heard the sound of petticoats rustling if she were there she would wear a dress of rich green satin with her hair piled high and powdered white so that the diamonds in it glittered like ice on snow all the men with their foaming lace and buckled shoes would be dazzled she would dance with them one by one as long as the music played she would dance twirling stepping dipping into low graceful curtsies then he would be there he would be dressed in black it suited him aye he would wear black black and silver just what he had worn that night hed come into colls room when there had been only candle and firelight it had made him look so tall and trim now the light would be blinding flashing in the mirrors shimmering on silver buttons and braid as the music swelled they would look at each other he would smile in the way he did that softened his eyes and made her heart melt just a little he would hold out his hand she would lay hers on it palm to palm a bow from him then her curtsy then giddy serena opened her eyes her hand was caught in an easy grip her eyes were still clouded with the dream as she looked up at brigham the light was behind him and as she stared up dazed it seemed to form a halo around his face he was wearing black as she had imagined but it was a simple riding coat without the fancy silver work or the sparkle of jewels slowly he raised her to her feet because she would have sworn she still heard music she shook her head madam smiling he lifted her hand to his lips before she could recover you seem to be without a partner i was dumbly she stared at their joined hands light glittered on his signet ring and reminded her of time and place and differences serena snatched her hand away and clasped it with the other behind her back what are you doing here i was fishing he turned and pointed to the pole hed propped against a tree beyond it his horse grazed lazily on the turf of the bank with malcolm until a short time ago he wanted to get back and look at betsy she could already feel the color sting her cheeks as she thought how ridiculous she must have looked in her partnerless minuet he should have been about his lessons im assured he did his duty by them this morning because he couldnt resist brigham stepped back to take a long thorough study may i ask if you always dance alone in the wood in breeches her eyes kindled as she chose anger over embarrassment you had no right spying on me you quite took me by surprise i promise you he sat on a rock crossed his ankles and smiled at her here i was contemplating how many more trout i might catch when a rider comes barreling through the forest with enough noise to frighten every fish for miles he didnt add that her wild approach had had him drawing his sword instead he buffed his nails on his coat if i had known you would be here she said stiffly i would have ridden another way no doubt then i would have missed the delightful sight of you in breeches with a sound of disgust she whirled toward her horse such a fast retreat serena one might think you were afraid she spun toward him again eyes flashing and planted her feet im not afraid of you magnificent there was no other way to describe her as she stood her body braced as though she held a sword in her hand her eyes molten her hair tumbling like firelight down her back she had ridden through the forest with a speed too great for safety and with a skill few men could have matched however much she aggravated him brigham could not deny her courage or her style neither could he deny that the way she looked in breeches made him uncomfortable however illfitting they showed the enticing length of slim legs and the slender curve of waist and hip with the homespun shirt tucked and cinched he could see the gentle sweep of breasts that even now rose and fell in agitation perhaps you should be afraid he murmured as much to himself as to her as i find myself plagued with all manner of dishonorable intentions her stomach quivered at that but she held her ground you dont worry me lord ashburn ive dispatched better men than you so i imagine he rose and saw what he had wanted to see the quick and just as quickly controlled flash of unease in her eyes however you have yet to deal with me serena i doubt youll manage to box my ears she would have backed up a step if pride hadnt rooted her where she stood ill do worse if you touch me again will you why was it that the more the woman spit at him the more he wanted her ive already apologized for what happened in the stables the stables she lifted a brow determined not to give an inch i fear whatever that might have been my lord was so unimportant as to be already forgotten cat he said mildly though not without admiration if you continue to sharpen your claws on me youre bound to break them ill risk it then let me refresh your memory he stepped closer you were as hot as i as pleasured as i it wasnt a swooning girl i held in my arms but a woman ripe for loving damned anxious for it how dare you the words came out in a sputter no gentleman would speak to me so perhaps not but no lady wears breeches that stung it was true she was not a lady would never be one though she wished constantly to find the way within her to please her mother whatever i choose to wear i wont have you insult me wont you by god thats rich youve done nothing but insult me since you first clapped eyes on me goaded past caution he grabbed her arm do you think because youre female i should tolerate your sneering comments about myself my lineage my nationality damn me if you can have it both ways serena you dress like a man talk like a man then choose to hide behind your petticoats when it suits you i hide behind nothing she tossed back her head and glared at him through the bare branches of the ash trees the sunlight poured turning her hair to molten gold if i insult you its no more than you deserve you may have charmed my family but not me charming you he said between his teeth is the least of my concerns aye your concern lies with the fall of your lace and the shine of your boots you ride into my home with your talk of war and justice but you do nothing what i do what i mean to do is no business of yours you sleep under my roof eat at my table where were you when the english came to build their forts to take our men off to their prisons and their gallows i cant change history serena you can change nothing nothing that has gone before nothing that is yet to come his fingers tightened on her arm i wont discuss my plans with you but i will tell you this when the time comes a change will be made to benefit whom he yanked her toward him which means what does the fate of scotland mean to you or any english nobleman you came from england on a whim and can return as easily depending on the way the wind blows his face paled with rage this time my dear you go too far ill say what i choose she tried to wrench away but found her arm caught in viselike fingers you give me no reason why you align yourself with our cause why you choose to raise your sword therefore i am free to think what i like you may think as you choose but words require payment she hadnt seen him truly angry before she hadnt known his eyes could blaze or that his mouth could harden until it seemed as though his face were carved from granite she nearly yelped when his fingers dug still more deeply into the tender flesh of her arm what will you do she managed coolly enough run me through as youre unarmed that pleasure is denied me but i have a mind to throttle you whether the gesture was made in earnest or merely to frighten serena couldnt be sure he lifted his free hand and circled her throat his fingers pressed not gently but not quite hard enough to cut off her air and his eyes stayed on hers dark and hard you have a very slender neck serena he said silkily very white very easily snapped for a moment she froze as a hare does when a hawk makes its killing dive her hand fluttered helplessly at her side and her eyes widened her breath when she managed to draw it in was shallow because her reaction was no more or less than what he had looked for brigham smiled the wench needed to be taught her manners and it pleased him very much to be her instructor then it was he who sucked in his breath as her boot caught him hard on the shin his grip relaxed as he stumbled back swearing deciding against assessing the damage serena spun on her heels and dashed for her horse still swearing he caught her in three strides he lifted her off the ground his arms locked firmly around her waist while she kicked and cursed she didnt fight like a woman with shrieks and scratches but with hands knotted into fits and muttered oaths he discovered she weighed next to nothing and could wriggle like a snake hold still damn you youll pay for that let go of me she struggled and tossed her weight backward hoping to unbalance him ill kill you if i get the chance well i believe it he said bitterly her struggles broke his grip and his hand moved up and over her breast the contact shocked both of them and the combat took on a new desperation be still damn it out of breath and patience he tried to find a purchase that was less arousing seeing her chance serena sank her teeth into the back of his hand bloody viper he managed before her heel connected with his stilltender shin and sent them both tumbling to the ground he told himself it was instinct certainly not any concern for her welfare that had him cushioning her fall the impact knocked the breath from both of them and left them tangled together like lovers the moment she had recovered serena brought her knee up barely missing her mark they rolled over a bed of pine needles and dried leaves while she fought like a wildcat pounding him with fists and spitting gaelic curses blinded by her hair he made a grab for her and found himself gripping her bare flesh where her shirt had loosened name of god he muttered as the blood stirred in his loins she twisted and her breast filled his hand it was soft as water hot as fire bloody hell though it cost him he drew his hand back and made a frantic grab for her arms her breathing was shallow a pulse had begun to thud in her throat when he had touched her her breast still tingled from his fingers more than his threats more than his anger the unfamiliar reaction of her body frightened her she was furious she hated him but oh if he touched her like that again she would melt like butter in high summer he scissored his legs until hers were trapped between them intimately without the cushion of petticoats they pressed center to center so that she felt for the first time the shock of a mans desire against her vulnerable womanhood heat flickered then spread in her stomach the muscles of her thighs went lax for an instant her vision blurred giving him the advantage he braceleted her wrists in one hand and held them over her head it was a movement meant as much to give him a moment for clear thinking as to allow him to protect himself her skin was glowing as the blood pounded hot beneath it tangled with leaves her hair spread out like tongues of flame and melted gold his mouth dry brigham swallowed and tried to speak but she was arching beneath him her continued struggles for freedom kindled fires in both of them that threatened to rage out of control rena for gods sake im only flesh and blood be still her own movements were making her ears buzz and her limbs weak there was an excitement that had somehow become tangled with panic making her all the more desperate to get away in defense she twisted from side to side and pulled a moan from brigham you dont know what youre doing he managed but if you continue youll find out soon enough let me go her voice was steady and arousingly husky as she watched him her breasts rose and fell with each agitated movement not quite yet i think youll still rip into me if i had had a dirk spare me the details i can imagine he had nearly caught his breath and he let it out now slowly cautiously my god youre beautiful it tempts me to keep you on the edge of fury with his free hand he traced a fingertip over her lips it simply tempts me when he started to lower his head her lips warmed and parted stunned by her own reaction she turned her head quickly to avoid the kiss brigham contented himself with the tender flesh just below her ear and the slender line of her throat this was different from a kiss she thought hazily as a moan escaped her less and more it felt as though her skin were alive and yearning for him as he nuzzled and dampened and nibbled instinctively she lifted her hips and sent shock waves of pleasure and frustration through him he felt her hands stiffen beneath his grip then go limp with her shudder her hair smelled of the forest he discovered when he buried his face in it earthy seductive her body was as taut as a bowstring one moment pliant as warm tallow the next hungry he bit lightly at her ear along her jaw then slowly almost triumphantly at her waiting lips he tasted the breath that shuddered through them as he teased the tip of her tongue into movement with his own there was so much he could teach her already he knew she would be a student eager for knowledge and skillful at applying it once she learned her lips softened when they merged with his then parted with the gentlest of pressures in the ageold rhythm her body moved shamelessly beneath his she hadnt known there was so much to feel not just wind and cold and heat not simply hunger for food and fatigue there were hundreds thousands of sensations to be discovered by the merging of lips the locking of bodies there was the scent of a mans skin and she discovered as she traced her tongue along the column of his throat the taste of it there was the sound of her own name being murmured thickly against her own mouth there was the feel of strong fingers on her face tensing stroking the frantic beat of heart against heart then the feel of those same fingers caressing her breast covering that heart and turning her muscles to jelly brigham she thought she might float away weightlessly painlessly if only he would continue to touch her her breast swelled in his hand unable to resist he brushed his thumb over the nipple and felt it go taut he yearned to draw the peak into his mouth to experience the heat and the flavor instead he crushed his mouth to hers desperately almost brutally as for the moment just a moment he let the wildness take him sharp points of passion replaced the languor and she ached with it all but wept with it her hands were still trapped by his though she pressed for freedom she was unsure whether if she gained it she would use her hands to drag him closer or to thrust him aside it hurt this grinding overwhelming need clawed through her pounding in her center raging through her head until she feared she would be burned alive it pleasured the sensations he brought to her the promises he gave her glimpses of if there was a border between heaven and hell he had led her to it and now he had her teetering on the edge when the trembling began she fought against it against him against herself at her muffled whimper he lifted his head it was there in her eyes the fear the confusion and the desire the combination nearly undid him he saw that his hand still locked her wrists where undoubtedly bruises would form cursing himself he dragged himself from her and turned away until he could find some measure of control i have no excuses he managed after a moment except that i want you he turned back to see her scramble to her feet god knows why she wanted to weep suddenly desperately she wanted to weep wanted him to hold her again to kiss her as he had at first in that gentle that patient way she dragged a leaf from her hair and after crumbling it in her fingers tossed it aside she might not have had any dignity left but she had pride cows and goats mate my lord her voice was cold as were her eyes as she was determined to make her heart they do not have to like each other well said he murmured knowing precisely how she felt about him he only wished he could be as certain at that moment of how he felt about her let us hope we are a bit above the cattle theres something about you serena that tugs on my more primitive emotions but i assure you i can restrain them under most circumstances his stiff manner only made her want to fly at him again with what she felt was admirable control she inclined her head ive yet to see it turning she strode toward her horse as she took the reins she stiffened at the touch of brighams hand in her hair you have leaves in your hair he murmured and fought back an urge to gather her close again to just hold her in his arms theyll comb out when he put a hand on her arm she braced herself to face him did i hurt you that was almost her undoing the regret in his eyes the kindness in his voice she was forced to swallow so that her answer could be steady and flat im not easily broken my lord she shook off his offer of help and launched herself into the saddle he stood back while she wheeled the horse and set off at a gallop chapter five contents prev next if you think im keeping to my bed like an old man while you and my father ride out to do the princes work youre a madman as brigham watched coll pushed himself out of bed and uncertainly gained his feet his head swam more man a little but he braced himself against one of the bedposts and tugged off his nightshirt where in hells name are my clothes my dear coll brigham said dryly how should i know you must have seen what was done with them i regret i cant help you there brigham flicked a speck of lint from his sleeve and continued in the mildest of tones nor will i carry you back to your bed after you faint and fall from your horse the day a macgregor falls from his horse i hasten to remind you youve already done so once when coll merely swore and staggered to a chest to look for his clothing brigham clasped his hands behind his back coll he began picking his way over tender ground i sympathize believe me im sure its miserable to be tied to a sickbed day and night but the simple fact is youre not well enough for the journey i say i am gwen says not frustrated at finding no more than linen and blankets coll slammed the chest shut again since when does that slip of a girl run my life since saving it that silenced coll who stood naked as a newborn in the earlymorning sunlight he had allowed his beard to grow since leaving london and the roughness it gave his face suited him i have no doubt she did brigham added and i wouldnt care to see all of her hard work go for nothing because you were too proud to rest until you were able to be of use its a black day when a campbell stops me from riding with my father to gather the support of the clans for the stuarts oh there will be time yet its just beginning brigham smiled then knowing that colls temper was easing allowing him to see sense he was much like his sister in the way that temper kindled as fast as dry wood the pity was serenas didnt cool as quickly and ill have you remember were riding out today for nothing more than an innocent hunting party it wouldnt do for it to be rumored otherwise i trust i can speak my mind in my own house coll muttered but subsided it was a bitter pill but he knew he was far from ready for the journey west worse if he insisted on going he would slow the rest of the party down youll meet with the macdonalds and the camerons so im led to believe the drummonds and fergusons should be represented youll need to speak with the cameron of lochiel hes always been a strong supporter of the stuarts and his voice is listened to coll dragged a hand through his mane of red hair hell and damnation i should be there standing with my father showing i stand for the prince no one will doubt it brigham began then stopped when gwen entered with a breakfast tray she took one look at her brother standing naked and furious and clucked her tongue i hope you havent pulled any stitches out damn it gwen coll grabbed up a blanket and covered himself have some respect with a gentle smile she set down the tray and curtsied to brigham good morning brig he touched a handkerchief to his lips in a futile effort to hide a grin good morning brig is it coll sputtered he knew that if he tried to stand five minutes more hed embarrass himself youve become damn familiar with my sister ashburn brigham nearly winced thinking just how familiar hed become with colls other sister we dispensed with formality shortly after we mopped up your blood he picked up his greatcoat i fear youll have trouble with your patient today gwen hes in a foul temper gwen smiled again and moved over to tidy colls bed linen coll never gives me any trouble she fluffed his pillows you may feel better after your breakfast coll if youre up to taking a short walk ill go along with you but i think you might dress first stifling a chuckle brigham sketched a bow she might not have the bite of her sister but colls little angel knew how to get her way now that i see youre in good hands ill take my leave brig brigham merely laid a hand on colls shoulder well be back within a week too weak to argue coll let himself be led back to bed god go with you brigham left them with gwen tugging a fresh nightshirt over colls shoulders he started for the staircase then stopped short when he saw parkins waiting for him stiff backed thin lipped and carrying a valise decided to return to england parkins on the contrary my lord i mean to accompany you on your hunting trip brigham gave him one brief incredulous look im damned if you do parkinss pointed chin came up the only sign of his agitation i will accompany your lordship dont be daft man if i wanted to take someone along id take jem at least hed be of some use with the horses though he gave an inward shudder at being compared to a lowly groom parkins remained resolute im convinced lord ashburn will have need of me im convinced i wont brigham responded and started past nonetheless i will accompany you my lord slowly almost certain he had misunderstood brigham turned to see parkins standing a figure of righteousness at the top of the stairs you are ordered to remain he said in a very quiet very dangerous voice parkinss stomach lining turned to ice but he remained unbroken i regret that your orders fail to persuade me that my duties are not best carried out in your company my lord i will accompany you with his eyes narrowed brigham ascended a step im of a mind to dismiss you parkins the pointed chin quivered that is your lordships prerogative that being the case i will accompany you still damn your eyes parkins exasperated brigham stormed down the steps have it your own way then but you wont care for the pace or the accommodations yes my lord fully satisfied parkins smiled at brighams back surly brigham strode out of the house and toward the stables to have a word with his groom barely dawn he thought and already hed been engaged in two arguments he flung on his greatcoat as he went his long purposeful strides eating up the frosty ground god it would be good to get in the saddle and ride away from here he thought glancing back and homing in unerringly on serenas window away from her he corrected almost savagely she had managed to avoid him all through the evening or when she could not brigham remembered with some fury she had spoken to him in a voice as frigid as the ground he was treading on he could hardly blame her after his treatment of her he did blame her completely it was she who had raged and ranted at him until his temper had snapped it was she who had fought him like some kind of hellcat until his passions had torn loose never never in his life had he treated a woman with any form of physical violence in lovemaking he was known to be passionate but never harsh thorough but never forceful with serena he had barely restrained himself from ripping the clothes from her back and plunging into her like a man gone mad she was the cause if he had managed to make it to midway through his third decade without illtreating any woman save one surely that woman was at fault she goaded him he thought viciously she taunted him she fascinated him damn her he kicked a pebble out of his way the mark on his lordships gleaming boot would distress parkins severely and wished serena could be dispatched as easily as the stone he would have the better part of a week away from her when he returned this madness that had taken hold of him would have passed he would then treat her with cordial respect and disinterest as befitted the sister of his closest friend he would not under any circumstances think of the way her body had felt melting beneath his he would certainly not pause to reflect on the way her lips had tasted warmed and swollen with his kisses and he would be damned if he would allow himself to remember the way his name had sounded when she had spoken it just once in the depths of passion no he would do none of those things but he might murder her if she got in his way again his mood filthy his temper uncertain he came to the stables before he could pull open the door it was pushed outward serena all but swaying on her feet stepped out her face was pale her eyes were exhausted and the bodice of her dress was smeared with blood rena my god he gripped her by the shoulders hard enough to make her cry out then he was gathering her tight against him what happened where are you hurt who did this to you what what she found her face pressed into the folds of his greatcoat and the hand that stroked her hair was trembling brig lord ashburn but it was difficult to think when she was being held as though he would never let her go when she was being held serena realized dimly as though she was someone to be protected and cherished she fought back an urge to snuggle into him my lord where is he he demanded dragging her away again one hand supporting her waist as he drew out his sword by god he wont live longer than it takes me to kill him how badly are you hurt my love her mouth simply hung open he was holding her gently as though she might break even as murder kindled in his eyes are you mad she managed who do you want to kill why why why youre covered with blood and you ask me why confused serena looked down at her dress of course theres blood theres always blood at a foaling jem and i have been working half the night with betsy she had twins and the second didnt come as easily as the first malcolm is nearly beside himself with delight foaling he said blankly while she stared at him serena moistened her lips and wondered if he needed one of gwens potions are you feverish im quite well his voice was stiff as he stepped back and sheathed his sword i beg your pardon i mistook the blood for your own oh she looked foolishly down at her dress again both warmed and confused by his explanation so far as she knew no one had ever raised a sword in her name before she could think of nothing to say he had leaped to her defense as though he would have fought an army for her and he had called her his love serena pressed her lips together to moisten them perhaps he was feverish i should wash he cleared his throat and felt ten times the fool do the mare and the foals do well very well though everyone but malcolm is exhausted she tucked her hands into the folds of her skirts not knowing what to do next oddly enough she wanted to laugh it was laughable after all brigham drawing his sword like an avenging angel or devil and herself smeared with dirt and sweat and birthing blood i beg your pardon my lord she managed as a giggle escaped her she might enjoy fighting him but not for the world would she embarrass him deliberately this amuses you madam his voice was cold cracking like ice on a pond no yes with a sigh she wiped at her eyes im terribly sorry for laughing im tired then i will leave you to find your bed she couldnt let him go that way she thought as he put his hand on the door if their parting words had been a shout it would have contented her but to have made him cringe when he had tried to protect her would keep her awake at night my lord he turned back his eyes were calm again and very cool yes her tongue tied itself into knots this wasnt the kind of man you could thank with a smile and a quick word the other man would have understood the one who had held her so gently but not this one you ah ride with my father and his men today yes the reply was curt as he drummed his fingers on the hilt of his sword i will wish you luck with your hunting he lifted a brow so she knew he thought then that she would of course know and being a macgregor would go to the grave with the knowledge if need be thank you madam i shant keep you longer she started to leave then turned the passion in her eyes again i would give so much to go with you today gathering up her skirts she raced toward the house brigham stood where he was in the chill air of early morning the light breeze ruffling his hair it had to be madness it had to be the gravest error of judgment the sharpest of ironies he was in love with her letting out a long breath he watched her until she had scrambled over the rise he was in love with her he thought again and she would sooner plunge a dagger into his heart than give hers to him it was a long rough ride over land wilder than that he and coll had traveled through on their way north there were echoing hills and naked rock thrust like deeply gouged teeth from the bare ground gray peaks and crags glittered with snow and ice for miles they would see hardly a hovel then they would come across a village where peat smoke rose thick and people clamored out for greetings and news it was very much the scotland his grandmother had spoken of hard often barren but always fanatically hospitable they stopped at midday and were pressed into a meal by a shepherd and his family there was soup the makings of which brigham didnt care to know and bannock and black pudding he might have preferred the supplies they had brought with them but he ate what was offered knowing it was as gracious a feast as could be afforded in the lonely hills it was washed down with ians own ale there were a halfdozen children all but naked though happy enough and the shepherds wife who sat near the fire working a spindle the turf house smelled of the compost heap that lay just outside the door and of the cattle that were housed in the room beyond if the family considered their fate bitter they didnt show it the shepherd drank with gusto and pledged his loyalty to the stuart king all the men were welcomed and food was pressed on each though the portions were meager brigham couldnt resist a grin at the sight of the proper parkins struggling to swallow the mysterious soup while removing a pair of small grimy hands from his spotless sleeve dozens of excuses had to be made before the travelers could convince their hosts that business prevented them from remaining overnight when they set out again the wind was rising bringing with it the taste and the scent of snow i feel as though weve caused them to starve for the next week brigham commented as they continued west theyll do well enough their laird will see them provided for thats the way of the clans ian rode like a man half his age straight in the saddle light wristed tireless its men like him darlin charlie will need to make scotland thrive and the camerons good fighters and true men ian settled into an easy ground eating lope when we meet at glenfinnan youll judge for yourself the jacobites will need good fighters and good generals as well the rebellion will only be as successful as the princes advisers ian shot him a glittering look so youve thought of that yes brigham looked around him as they rode the rocky tumbled ground was a perfect field of war for the highlanders the men who rode behind them the men who lived in it would know its advantages and hardships well if we bring the battle here well win britain will be united its my wish to see a stuart on the throne ian mused but ill tell you ive seen wars before in in ive seen hopes raised and hopes dashed im not so old that my blood doesnt warm at the thought of battle at the hope of putting old wrongs right but this will be the last youll live to see others ian this will be the last he said again not just for me lad for all of us brigham thought of those words as they neared glenfinnan the waters of lochnan uamh were a dark violent blue as they arrived at the great stone fortress the snow was just beginning overhead the sky had turned to a thick steel gray and the wind whipped the waters of the lake into fury their coming had been heralded by the playing of pipes and the high eerie music lifted into the thin air such music was used to celebrate to mourn and to lead soldiers to battle as he stood with the snow swirling about his feet brigham understood how a man could weep or fight to the sound of such notes inside servants were dispatched with what luggage had been carried on the journey west fires blazed high and whiskey was pressed into every waiting hand welcome to glenfinnan donald macdonald held up his cup of whiskey your health ian macgregor ian drank and his eyes approved the caliber of macdonalds whiskey and to yours lord ashburn macdonald signaled for more whiskey to be poured i trust my old friend has made you comfortable very thank you to your successful stay at glenfinnan macdonald toasted and drank again not for the first time brigham was grateful for his head for whiskey when he noted how easily it was downed by his companions he decided that he had inherited it from his grandmother so youre kin to mary macdonald of sleat in skye her grandson macdonald was then compelled to offer a toast to her i remember her she was a bonny lass though i was hardly whelped when i visited her family she reared you from the time my parents died i would have been nearly ten since youre here i cant doubt but she did a good job of it youll be wanting food gentlemen we have a late supper for you and the others ian asked expected tomorrow macdonald glanced at the doorway and his rather doughy face creased into a smile ah my daughter ian you remember my margaret brigham turned and saw a small darkhaired woman of about eighteen she was dressed in a wide hooped gown of midnight blue that matched her eyes she dropped into a curtsy then came forward hands extended to ian with a smile that brought out dimples in her cheeks why heres a lass with a great laugh he kissed both of her cheeks youve grown up maggie it has been two years her voice was soft with a lilt shes the image of her mother donald thank the lord she didnt take her looks from you have a care when you insult me in my own home but there was a ring of pride in macdonalds warning lord ashburn may i present my daughter margaret maggie dropped another curtsy and extended her fingertips to brigham my lord miss macdonald its a pleasure to see a flower on such a bitter night she giggled spoiling the elegant curtsy thank you my lord its not often i hear flattery you are a great friend of colls are you not yes i am i had thought she glanced from brigham to ian he did not accompany you lord macgregor not for lack of wanting maggie and not so many years ago it was uncle ian she dimpled and kissed his bearded cheek its still uncle ian he patted her hand as he turned to macdonald coll and brigham ran into a bit of trouble on the road from london campbells coll maggie spoke quickly revealing more than she had intended was he hurt ians brows rose as her fingers curled into his hes on the mend now lassie but gwen put her foot down and said be wasnt to travel please ten me what happened how badly was he wounded was he maggie with a little laugh macdonald cut off his daughters rapid questions im sue ian and lord ashburn will ten us the whole of it now i imagine theyd like to refresh themselves before dinner though obviously impatient she pulled herself back of course forgive me ill show you to your rooms gracefully she swept her skirts aside and led her fathers guests out of the drawing room and up the staircase youve only to ask if theres anything you need we dine in an hour if it suits you nothing would suit me better ian told her and pinched her cheek youve grown up nicely maggie your mother would be proud of you uncle ian was coll badly hurt hes mending well lass i promise you forced to be content with that she left the men alone they dined leisurely and with elegance in the great dining hall there were oysters bigger than any brigham could recall seeing anywhere before and salmon in a delicate sauce removed with roast duck there were wild fowls and gooseberry sauce and joints of roast mutton the claret was tine and plentiful their host pressed sweets upon them mince pie tarts stewed pears and sweetmeats throughout maggie handled her duties as hostess with an ease and liveliness that became her well by the time she had risen to leave the men to their port she had charmed the entire table from ian down to his humblest retainer the talk turned to politics louiss intentions toward england and his support of charles and the jacobites were discussed debated and argued over while servants brought fresh candles and stoked the roaring fire here in this dining hall in the wild western highlands there was unanimous support for the fairfaced prince brigham saw that these men would not only fight behind him but had come to love him for the symbol of hope he had been almost from his birth he went late to bed but found sleep difficult the fire burned red and the plaid bedcurtains kept out any drafts though he could hear the wind whistling against the window glazing his thoughts no matter how he struggled to discipline them returned again and again to serena would she be in bed now fast asleep her mind at rest her body relaxed or would she like him lie awake and restless mind in turmoil body tensed with needs that had been stoked like the flames of the night fire what kind of madness drew a man to a woman who detested him and everything he was there had been prettier women in his life and certainly there had been sweeter there had been women who would laugh and frolic in bed or out without a care as to whether he was an english lord or a french peasant there had been women dignified and elegant who had been delighted to receive him for tea or to accompany him on a leisurely ride through the park why had none of them caused him to lie in bed and sweat with visions of slender white hands and tumbled redgold hair none of them had ever made him burn with just the thought of a name a face a pair of eyes they had nothing in common but an allegiance to a deposed royal house he could find no logic here no reason for a man to lose his heart to a woman who would have delighted in crushing it beneath her heel but he did love her it occurred to brigham that he might pay more dearly for those feelings than he ever would for following his conscience and the jacobite cause when he slept he slept poorly and he was awakened shortly after dawn by the arrival of the camerons by midday the house was swarming with men macdonalds from the western isles camerons drummonds more macgregors from the outlying districts it became a celebration with pipes playing and whiskey to be drunk rough manners were overlooked and laughter rang off stone gifts had been brought deer rabbits and whatever game had been killed on the journey they were served at dinner and this time the great dining hall was packed with men the company at this meal was varied from the chiefs and lairds to their eldest sons and men of rank to the retainers they were all served at the same table and served well but with subtle distinctions at the head of the table was venison done to a turn and fine claret at the middle there was ale and port with substantial dishes of mutton and rabbit at the bottom below the salt beef and cabbage and table beer were offered but at all levels the food was plentiful no man seemed insulted by the arrangements and all ate ferociously servants stood behind the chairs many of them local villagers pressed into duty for the event toasts were drunk to the true king to the bonnie prince to each clan to the wives and daughters of the chiefs one after another until bottles were drained and more opened as a man they lifted cups to the king across the water there was no doubt that hearts were with him but brigham found as talk turned to the stuarts and the possibility of war that the table was not of one mind there were some whose blood ran hot enough to make them yearn to make the march on edinburgh immediately swords raised and pipes playing old grudges festered and like reopened wounds their poison poured out proscriptions executions homes burned kin sent to plantations and indentured estates forfeited as serena had once told him it was not to be forgiven it was not to be forgotten but others were less inclined to put their lives and their lands into the hands of the untried prince they had gone to war before and had seen their men and their dreams cut down cameron of lochiel his clans acting chief while his father remained in exile pledged the prince his heart but with reservations if we fight without the support of french troops the english will swarm over our land and drive us to the hills and the caves clan cameron is loyal to the true king but can the clans alone stand against the trained might of england and a loss now will break the back of scotland so we do what james macgregor heir of rob roy slapped his palm on the table do we sit with our swords sheathed do we sit by our fires growing old waiting for retribution i for one am sick of the elector and his german queen if a sword is sheathed it cant be broken lochiel returned quietly aye a macleod chieftain nodded as he hunched over his port though it goes against the grain to do nothing its madness to fight if there will be no victory we have lost before and paid a bitter price for it the macgregors stand behind the prince to the man james said with a dangerous light of battle in his eyes as well stand behind him when he takes his throne aye lad keeping his voice soothing ian broke in he knew james had inherited his fathers loyalty and a good deal of his guile and love of intrigue but not his control we stand behind the bonnie prince but there is more to be thought of than thrones and injustices lochiel is right this is not a war to be waged rashly do we fight as women then james demanded with talk only there had been whiskey enough drunk to bring tempers boiling jamess words had already stirred angry mutters before more could be said ian spoke again drawing the mens attention to him we fight as clansmen as our fathers and their fathers i fought beside your sire james he said quietly and at your side when we were both young he added to lochiel i am proud to pledge my sword and my sons to the stuarts when we fight we should fight with cool heads and shrewdness as well as sword and ax but do we know the prince means to fight someone at the table demanded weve gathered before behind his father and it came to nothing ian signaled for his cup to be filled again brigham you spent time with the prince in france tell us his mind the table quieted so brigham kept his voice moderate he means to fight for his rights and those of his house of that there can be little doubt he paused to take stock of the faces around him all listened but not all seemed cheered by his words he looks to the jacobites here and in england to fight with him and hopes to convince king louis to support his cause with the french behind him i think there is no doubt he could divide his enemies and cut through he lifted his cup taking his time without them it will take bold action and a united front the lowlanders will fight with the government army lochiel mused he thought sadly of the death and destruction that would surely follow in their wake and the prince is young untried in battle yes brigham agreed he will need experienced men advisers as well as fighting men dont doubt his ambition or his resolve he shall come to scotland and raise his standard he will need the clans behind him heart and sword he has both of mine james stated lifting his cup like a challenge if the princes mind cannot be swayed lochiel said slowly the camerons will fight behind him the talk continued into the night and over the next day and the next some were convinced their swords and their men at the ready others were far from encouraging when they took their leave of the macdonalds the sky was as gloomy as brighams thoughts charless glittering ambition could all too easily be dulled chapter six contents prev next serena sat before the crackling bedroom fire wrapped in her night robe while her mother brushed and dried her hair for fiona it brought back memories both sweet and sad of her eldest daughters childhood so many times she had stood like this with her daughter bundled before the fire her skin glowing from her bath it had been simple then to ease a hurt or solve a problem now the child was a woman with fiona thought a womans needs and a womans fears there would come a time when her little girl would sit in front of a fire of her own usually when they had this time together serena was full of talk questions stories laughter now she was strangely subdued her eyes on the fire her hands quiet in her lap through the open door they could hear gwen and malcolm entertaining coll with some game the laughter and crows of triumph came muffled into the room of all her children it was serena who concerned fiona most coll was headstrong certainly but enough like his father to content fiona that he would find his way well enough gwen was mild and sweetnatured fiona had no doubt that her giving heart and fragile looks would bring her a kind man and malcolm she smiled as she drew the brush through serenas long damp hair he was full of charm and mischief bright as a button according to the good father but it was serena who had inherited the uncertain macgregor temper along with a heart easily bruised it was serena who hated as passionately as she loved who asked questions that couldnt be answered who remembered too well what should be forgotten it was that that concerned fiona most of all that one hideous incident had scarred her daughter as much as it had scarred her fiona still bore the marks of the english officers use of her not on her body but on her heart and she was afraid that the marks would never fade from serenas heart any more than they would fade from her own but while fiona carried her shame secretly serenas hate too often burned from her eyes and fell unheedingly off her tongue fiona would never forget the way her young daughter had washed her comforted her eased both her body and heart through the misery of that night nor could she forget that a wildness had been born in serena as a result of it a recklessness that caused her to ride off unattended into the forest to flare up at any real or imagined slight to the family as a mother she worried at serenas obvious disdain of the men who came courting now it was serenas uncharacteristic silence that troubled her fiona wondered not for the first time how to mother a grown child youre so quiet my love do you see dreams in the fire serena smiled a little you always said we could if we looked hard enough but she had looked tonight and had seen only flaming wood youve kept to yourself so much the last few days are you feeling poorly no im just she let her words trail off not certain she could explain to herself much less her mother restless i suppose wanting spring she fell silent again staring into the fire when do you think papa will be back tomorrow perhaps the day after fiona stroked the brush tirelessly through serenas hair her daughters pensive mood had come on the day the hunting party had left do you worry about him no she sighed and her hands moved nervously in her lap sometimes i worry where it will all end but i dont worry for papa abruptly she linked her fingers together to still them i wish i were a man the statement brought fiona some measure of relief as it was typical with a little laugh she kissed the top of serenas head what foolishness is this i do if i were a man i wouldnt forever be forced to sit and wait and want she thought want something so nebulous she could never describe it if you were a man you would rob me of one of the greatest pleasures of my life with another sigh serena quieted i wish i were more like you more like gwen you are what you were born to be love and nothing pleases me more i wish i did please you i wish i could what more nonsense there are times i know you are disappointed with me no not disappointed never that for a moment fiona wrapped her arms around serena and pressed cheek to cheek when you were born i thanked god for giving you to me whole and safe my heart was nearly broken from losing the two bairns between coll and you i feared id have no more children then there you were small as a minute strong as a horse what a time you gave me with the birthing the midwife said you clawed your way into the world women dont go to war serena but i tell you this there would be no children in the world if men had to bring them into it that made serena laugh she tucked her legs up and settled more comfortably i remember when malcolm came papa went to the stables and got drunk so it was with all of you fiona said smiling hes a man who would sooner face a hundred dragoons with only a dirk than set foot in a birthing room how did you know when you met him how did you know you loved him im not sure i did dreaming herself fiona studied the fire the first time was at a ball alice macdonald mary macleod and i were the best of friends alice macdonalds parents were having a ball for her birthday the macdonalds of glenfinnan your fathers good friend donald as you know is alices brother alice wore green mary blue and i wore white with my grandmothers pearls we had our hair powdered and thought we were very fashionable and beautiful i know you were with a little sigh fiona stopped brushing to rest her hands on her daughters shoulders the music was very gay and the men so handsome your father had donald introduce him and he asked me to dance i did of course but i was thinking what do i want with this great beast of a man hell probably tread on my toes and ruin my new slippers oh mama never say you thought papa couldnt dance i did and was shown contrary as youve witnessed time and time again no one danced with more grace and lightness of foot than ian macgregor it pleased serena the mental picture she conjured up of her parents young and sharing their first dance so you fell in love with him for the way he danced no indeed i flirted with him i confess alice and mary and myself had made a pact to flirt with all the men at the ball until we had a score of suitors we had decided we would choose only the most handsome the most elegant and the wealthiest for husbands with some astonishment serena looked over her shoulder you mama aye i was quite vain and full of myself fiona laughed and patted hair that was just beginning to show the first signs of graying my father had spoiled me miserably you see the next day your father called on the macdonalds where i was staying to ride out with donald he said but he made certain i saw him striding around the house as if he owned it over the next weeks he put himself in my way more times than i could count he wasnt the most handsome the most elegant or the wealthiest of the men who called on me but in the end it was he i wanted but how did you know serena insisted how could you be sure when my heart spoke louder than my head fiona murmured studying her daughter so this was the problem she realized and wondered how she could have missed the signs her little one was falling in love rapidly fiona ran through the names and faces of the young men who had come calling she could not recall serena sparing even one of them a second glance in fact fiona thought with a frown serena had sent most of them off with their tails between their legs there has to be more than that as confused as she was unsatisfied serena plucked at the folds of her skirts there has to be a rightness to it a sense to it if papa had been different if you hadnt had the same beliefs the same backgrounds your heart would never have spoken at all love doesnt account for differences rena fiona said slowly a sudden thought had intruded one that made her uncertain whether to laugh or weep had her daughter her fiery headstrong daughter fallen in love with the english lord my sweet fiona touched a hand to serenas cheek when love happens its most often right but it rarely makes sense id rather be alone serena said passionately her eyes glowed in the firelight showing as much confusion as determination id rather play aunt to colls and gwens and malcolms children than find myself pining after a man i know would make me unhappy thats your head talking and your temper fionas hand was as gentle as her voice falling in love is frightening especially for a woman who tries to fight it i dont know she turned her cheek into her mothers hand oh mama why dont i know what i want when the times right you will and you the most courageous of my children will take it her fingers tightened suddenly on serenas cheek they both heard the rumble of horses approaching for a moment in the light of the fire both remembered another time another night papas back early serena rose to take her mothers hand aye degree by degree fiona forced herself to relax hell be wanting something hot the men had ridden hard in their desire to sleep in their own beds they had indeed hunted and came home laden with freshkilled deer and rabbit and wild duck the house which had been so quiet erupted with ians shouts and commands clad in her night robe serena had decided to remain upstairs until she heard her father bellowing for her she began smoothing her hair and skirts then stopped herself in disgust it hardly mattered what she looked like she came down to see her father his face still reddened by the bite of wind giving gwen a hearty kiss coll sat near the fire a lap robe covering his knees and malcolm perched laughing on the arm of his chair with a full cup already in his hand his other dug into his breeches pocket brigham stood in front of the hearth his hair was ruffled by the ride his boots splashed with mud despite her resolve not to she found her eyes drawn to his for the space of three heartbeats there was nothing and no one else nor was there for him he watched her enter her dark green robe flowing down her her hair glowing like firelight brighams fingers tightened so quickly so violently on the pewter cup that he thought they might leave dents deliberately relaxing them he sketched her a bow her chin shot up making him want more than anything else to stride across the room and crush her against him there she is my little highland wildcat ian threw open his arms have you got a kiss for your papa she gave him a saucy smile i might crossing to him she gave him a very demure peck on the cheek then with a laugh she threw her arms around his neck and gave him a loud smacking one he responded by lifting her off her feet and twirling her twice now heres a likely lass he told the room in general if a man can survive the claws hell have a prize worth keeping ill not be a prize for any man she gave his beard a hard disrespectful tug that earned her a slap on the bottom and a grin you see i speak the truth brig shes a lively one ive a good mind to give you to duncan mackinnon as he asks me nigh on every week and so you may father she said mildly hell be less of a nuisance once i slice him in two he laughed again though all his children delighted him serena held the tightest grip on his heart fill my cup brat and the rest besides young duncans not the match for you she did as he bade passing the cup to him before walking over to add to brighams it was impossible to resist raising her gaze to his or allowing the challenge to glow in her eyes nor perhaps is any man she responded when a gauntlet was thrown down brigham was honor bound to pick it up it may be my lady that none has yet taught you to sheathe your claws in truth my lord none who tried have survived it would seem youre in need of a man made of tougher stuff she lifted a brow as if assessing him believe me im not in need of a man at all his eyes warned her he could prove her wrong but he only smiled forgive me madam but a highstrung mare rarely understands the need for a rider oh please coll choked on his own laughter and held up a hand dont encourage him rena the man can go on like that for hours and youll never win have pity and bring that jug here my cups empty as your head is she muttered and poured whiskey into the cup her brother held out easy lass dont flay me im still a sick man are you now with a smile she snatched the cup from him then youll be wanting one of gwens brews and not whiskey she tossed it off herself before he could grab it wench grinning he pulled her down in his lap pour me some more and ill keep your secrets hah what secrets he put his mouth to her ear and whispered only one word breeches serena swore under her breath and filled the cup again so you havent been so sick you couldnt spy out your window she muttered to him a man takes what weapons he can if you children would stop your bickering ian waited until all eyes were on him we found the macdonalds well donalds brother daniel is a grandfather again his third which shames me he sent a look at his two oldest children who forgot their annoyance with each other long enough to give their father identical smiles well you should grin like a couple of simpletons while neglecting your duties to the clan a better father would have had you both married off and breeding willing or not there is no better father than our own serena said and watched him soften well pass over that ive invited maggie macdonald to visit oh good lord coll moaned talk of nuisances the comment earned him a cuff on the ear from his sister shes a great friend of mine ill remind you when does she come next week ian sent coll a stern look and ill remind you my lad that no guest in my home is a nuisance they are when theyre forever underfoot so that you cant walk but trip over them then he relented knowing that hospitality was a matter of honor and tradition no doubt shell have outgrown that by now and be happy in renas and gwens company the next days passed in a flurry of activity in preparation for the expected company as was fionas wont wood and silver were polished foods prepared floors scrubbed serena welcomed the diversion and was too used to work to resent the extra labor she looked forward to the company of a girl her own age who had been her friend since childhood now that coll had mended he and brigham rode out often sometimes in the company of ian and other men sometimes alone there were discussions nightly debating the jacobite cause and the princes next move rumors flew from hill to glen from burn to forest the prince was on his way the prince was in paris the prince was never coming at all once a messenger had been hustled into the drawing room with a dispatch for brigham the doors had remained shut on the men for hours and the rider had left again after dark whatever news he had brought had not been passed on to the women a fact serena bitterly resented in the kitchen with the fire blazing serena dealt with the washing her share and gwens she had exchanged her polishing duties for gwens help with the laundry it suited her she preferred stamping on linen in the big tub to cramping her hands with beeswax with her skirts kilted up she waded in water up to her calves she enjoyed the energy it took just as now she enjoyed the solitude of the kitchen mrs drummond was visiting a neighbor for an exchange of recipes and gossip malcolm was about his lessons and their mother was supervising the preparation of a guest room serena highstepped like a pony in the cooling water humming to herself to make the chore less monotonous and to keep the rhythm steady she wondered if brigham had found maggie macdonald pretty and if he had kissed her hand the way he had once kissed her own why should it matter she asked herself and began to stamp on the wash with more vigor the man had barely spared her a glance since he had returned and that was precisely the way she preferred it he meant nothing to her at least no more than any prickly thorn in her side she wished he would go away serena began to stamp harder until water rose to the lip of the tub she wished he would take his cool voice and hot eyes back to london or to hell for that matter she wished he would fall in the river and catch a chill then waste slowly painfully away better yet she wished he would come in fall on his knees and beg her for one smile of course she would sneer she wished she stopped wishing stopped washing stopped thinking when he strode into the room brigham was brought up short just as she was he had thought she was busy upstairs with her mother or in the dining hall with her sister for days he had made a science out of avoiding her and the discomfort and pleasure being in her company brought him now she was here alone in the overheated kitchen her face flushed with exercise her hair escaping from its pins and her skirts dear god her legs were pale and wet and as shapely as any man could dream of before he controlled himself he watched a drop of water slide down from her knee along one smooth calf and into the tub his breath hissed out softly between his teeth well this is an unexpected and charming domestic scene youve no business in the kitchen lord ashburn your father persuaded me to make myself at home as everyone is occupied i thought it would be less trouble for me to come in and charm mrs drummond out of some soup its there in the pot she indicated the steaming kettle help yourself to it and take it away ive got too much to do to wait on you so i see he recovered enough to walk closer she smelled of soap and made his stomach quiver madam i assure you i will never sleep quite the same again knowing how my bed linen was washed she swallowed a chuckle and began to stamp in the water again it does the job sassenach and does it well now if youll be about your business ill be about mine before the water goes cold inspired perhaps by the devil she brought her foot down hard and sent water splashing over his breeches oh i beg your pardon my lord unable to prevent it she snickered brigham looked down at his breeches and gave a wry shake of his head perhaps you think these need washing as well toss them in she invited recklessly ive had a mind to plant my foot on your breeches before have you he reached down toward the fastening and had the satisfaction of watching her eyes widen flushing to the roots of her hair she stepped back and nearly tumbled down in the water brigham he caught her before she could send herself and the washwater all over the kitchen there i knew i would have it out of you again he had an arm around her waist another on her hair the remaining pins plopped into the water and sunk serena stood flustered with her arms trapped between their bodies what my name he murmured say it again ive no need to she moistened her lips unwittingly stirring his blood all the more and youve no need to hold me i have my balance now but i do have a need rena ive told myself three days running that i cannot i should not i shall not touch you as he spoke he ran his hand up her back down her hair as if he could take as he chose but i have a need the same one i see now in your eyes she hated herself for lowering them you see nothing everything he corrected pressing a kiss to her hair oh god i havent been able to get the scent of you out of my mind the taste of you off my palate stop if she could have freed her hands she would have covered her ears with them i wont listen why the hand on her hair tightened so that she was forced to lift her head because im english no yes i dont know her voice rose roughened by the beat of her pulse i only know i dont want this i dont want to feel the way you make me feel he felt a moment of triumph as he dragged her closer how do i make you feel rena weak afraid angry no dont she whispered as his lips hovered above hers dont kiss me then kiss me he brushed his lips lightly over hers i wont his lips curved as hers met them you already are with a shuddering moan she clutched at him taking what her heart wanted and blocking out the warning in her head he wasnt for her could never be for her and yet when he held her it seemed as though he had always been for her his lips teased and retreated seduced and tormented until she was driven to take possession had she told him he made her feel weak that was a lie she thought dimly she felt strong incredibly strong with energy coursing through her and pumping through her blood until it ran hot a woman could fear weakness but not power she wrapped her arms around him let her head fall back and her lips part as she all but dared him to try to sap her strength it was like holding a lightning bolt he thought full of fire and flash and dangerous power one moment he was coaxing the next he was bombarded with the heat that seemed to radiate from her murmuring her name he lifted her from the water he held her aloft for a moment then slowly let her slide down his body until her feet hit the floor then her lips were racing over his face she slipped her hands beneath his coat to run them impatiently over the linen of his shut her body was arched against his begging to be touched her breasts yielded temptingly against his chest knowing his only choices were to pull her to the floor and pleasure them both or stop brigham dragged himself away serena he took born of her hands and brought them to his lips we must talk talk thoughts couldnt surface in a head that swam so thickly yes and soon before i abuse the trust of your father and my friend more than i already have she stared at him a moment and then her mind began to clear pulling her hands away she pressed them to her cheeks how could she have thrown herself at him in that way i dont want to talk i want you to go away want or not we will talk he grabbed her hands again before she could turn away serena we cant pretend that something doesnt happen between us every time were together i may not want this any more than you but im not fool enough to say it doesnt exist it will pass she said desperate to believe it desires come and they go he lifted a brow such cool and worldly talk from a woman in bare feet oh leave me be will you she shoved at him i was fine and happy before you came here ill be fine and happy when you leave the hell you will he pulled her against him again if i were to leave now youd weep pride stiffened her spine ill never shed a tear over you why should i youre not the first man ive kissed and you wont be the last his eyes narrowed to slits darkened like onyx you live dangerously serena i live as i please now let me go so im not the first youve kissed he murmured he had a desperate and vivid desire to know the names and faces of each one so he could murder them tell me did the others make you tremble he kissed her again hard enough to make her gasp did they make your skin go hot and soft his mouth came to hers again and this time she could do nothing but sigh against his lips and let him have his way did you look at them the way you look at me now he demanded with your eyes dark and clouded she clutched at his shoulders almost afraid she would dissolve and slide through his hands brigham did you he demanded his eyes dark and bright her head was reeling and she shook it no serena ive finished in gwen pushed open the door then stood her mouth forming a surprised o as she stared at her sister caught in a close embrace with their guest serena stood on the toes of her bare feet gripping brighams beautiful coat and he gwens young imagination caused her blush to deepen i beg your pardon she managed and continued to stand looking from one to the other without the least idea what to do gwen with more force than dignity serena pulled out of brighams arms lord ashburn was just kissing your sister he finished coolly oh gwen watched serena send brigham a furious glance i do beg your pardon she repeated wondering if it would be best to go or stay amused brigham watched gwen wrestle with propriety while serena whirled to the cupboard and rattled crockery theres no need to beg anyones pardon she said testily lord ashburn wanted soup so i did but as it happens ive had all my appetite can handle at the moment if you ladies will excuse me he strolled out wincing only slightly as a bowl hit the floor chapter seven contents prev next king louis will not intervene brigham stood in front of the fire his hands clasped behind his back though his eyes were calm and his stance relaxed his voice was grim it becomes less and less likely as time passes that he will support the prince with gold or with men coll tossed the letter that had come earlier by messenger onto a table and rose to pace unlike brighams his impatience needed room and movement a year ago louis was more than ready to lend support ready damn be was eager to lend it a year ago brigham pointed out louis thought charles might be of use to him since the french invasion was abandoned last march the prince is largely ignored by the french court then well do without the french coll turned to glare first at brigham then at his father the highlanders will fight for the stuarts aye ian agreed but how many he held up a hand to prevent his son from launching into a passionate speech my mind and my heart remain unchanged when the time comes the macgregors fight for the rightful king but its unity we need as well as numbers to win the clans must fight as one as we have fought before coll said with a slap of his fist and will again would that were true ians voice was quiet one of reason and regret and of age he thought with an inward sigh growing old was the damnedest thing we cant pretend that every chief in scotland stands behind the true king or will rally his clan for the prince how many brig will stand against us in the government army brigham picked up the letter from the table and after glancing at it once more tossed it into the fire i expect word from my contacts in london any day how much longer do we wait coll took his seat again to stare into the fire how many more months how many more years do we only sit and talk while the elector grows fat on the throne i think the time of rebellion comes sooner than you might think brigham murmured sooner than we might be prepared for the prince is impatient the highland chiefs will meet again ian drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair like any wise general he preferred to plan his war before raising his sword care must be taken to keep such meetings from raising the suspicions of the black watch coll swore roundly at the mention of the highlanders recruited by the english to maintain order in scotland another hunting party brigham asked i had in mind something a bit different at the sound of approaching carriage wheels ian smiled and tapped out his pipe a ball my lads its time we did a spot of entertaining and the lass who comes visiting is i believe a very pretty reason for dusting away cobwebs brigham twitched the curtains aside in time to see serena dash down the steps toward the waiting carriage a darkhaired girl descended and launched herself into serenas arms maggie macdonald aye shes of marriageable age as is my own first daughter he set his gaze on brighams back a moment a man would have to be blind he thought not to see that there was a tune playing between his young guest and his daughter nothing more reasonable than to hold a ball to introduce them to a few suitable young bucks fighting back annoyance brigham let the curtain fall into place he didnt want to look at serena now with the sun falling on her face and her eyes dark with laughter it will do well enough i suppose coll only scowled at the toe of his boot i dont care for it bringing another giggling female into the house now damned if im going to find myself cornered into taking her for sedate rides and listening to talk of the latest bonnets when we should be polishing our swords ian merely rose to open the salon doors ive no doubt that rena and gwen will entertain her well enough without you the moment the doors were opened womens voices and laughter poured through coll grumbled and stayed stubbornly in his seat theres the lass ians voice rumbled to the ceiling come here and give your uncle ian a kiss smiling maggie danced across the hall she laughed when he lifted her off her feet but fiona scolded him the girls already been bumped enough on the journey go in and warm yourself by the fire maggie with her arm still tucked in ians maggie stepped into the room manners prevented coll from scowling and he began to rise reluctantly then manners or not his mouth fell open she still looked hardly bigger than a doll beside his broadshouldered father but the skinny smudgefaced pest he remembered had miraculously been replaced by a slender vision in dark blue velvet her hair dark as midnight fell in curls beneath a hat that framed her face had her eyes always been that beautiful like the loch at twilight he wondered as he managed to close his mouth had her skin always looked like fresh cream maggie smiled at him then because she had planned her moves carefully during the journey she turned to curtsy to brigham lord ashburn its a pleasure to see you again miss macdonald he took her offered hand and brushed his lips over her fingers behind ian serenas breath came out in a quiet hiss i trust your journey wasnt too taxing not at all because maggies hand was still in brighams serena couldnt prevent herself from stepping forward you remember coll dont you maggie with a little more force than was necessary she pulled maggie away from brigham and toward her brother of course i do maggie had practiced a friendly almost impersonal smile in front of her mirror night after night in preparation for this first meeting though her heart was pounding she put her practiced smile to use now he was even more handsome than she remembered taller broader even more exciting growing up had taken so long but now at this moment it seemed worth it im happy to see you again coll i hope your wound is healed wound he took her hand feeling unbearably clumsy your father explained that you were wounded on the way from london her voice was mild as a spring morning she wondered he couldnt hear the furious thundering of her heart i trust youve recovered it was nothing im persuaded it was a great deal more than nothing but its good to see you up and about again because she was afraid that if her hand stayed in his another moment she would faint with delight maggie drew herself away and twirled around there was a blush in her cheeks now that she prayed everyone would take for excitement from the journey its wonderful to be here again i cant thank you enough uncle ian aunt fiona for asking me to come refreshments were brought in seats were taken rather than making the excuses he had prepared coll found himself jockeying for the chair nearest maggie brigham took advantage of the situation and leaned close to serena as he passed a plate of cakes will you try one of these miss macgregor he asked then in a quiet voice that was covered by the conversation youve been avoiding me rena thats ridiculous she took a cake and wondered how she had been maneuvered to the fringes of the party with him i agree completely avoiding me is ridiculous her cup rattled in its saucer you flatter yourself sassenach its gratifying to see i make you nervous he said quietly then turned and continued in a normal tone gwen i must tell you how charming you look in pink he never tells me i look charming serena thought as she bit almost viciously into her cake he never gives me gallant bows and pretty compliments as he did with maggie with me its barbs and snarls and kisses she remembered with an inward shiver deep dark kisses she wouldnt think of it or of him when a man treated a woman that boldly he wanted only one thing she might have been raised in the highlands but she was no fool when it came to the ways of the english aristocracy she would be no mans mistress certainly she would be no englishmans mistress no matter what magic he could make her feel no matter what wonders he could make her dream of she would never shame herself or her family if she avoided him it wasnt that she was afraid it was that she was being sensible daydreams my love brigham murmured making her jump i hope they are of me they are of cows to be milked she said between her teeth when he chuckled she put up her chin and prepared to speak to maggie her friend at that moment was bubbling with laughter and smiling beautifully at coll her brother serena noted was flushed and glassyeyed apparently coll doesnt find miss macdonald a nuisance after all brigham commented he looks as though hes been hit on the head with a rock or struck through the heart with cupids arrow her eyes widened at that then narrowed consideringly in a moment she had to smother a chuckle of her own who would have thought it too amused to do otherwise she leaned closer to brigham do you suppose hell start spouting poetry he caught a whiff of her hair and imagined burying his face in it the woman was made to drive him mad snapping one moment smiling the next men have been known to do worse when so afflicted but coll coll and maggie a few years ago he couldnt wait to dust maggie off his boots and now she is a beautiful woman a little pang of jealousy warred with friendship aye serena murmured and wondered fleetingly what it would be like to be tiny and fragile you certainly seem to think so his brow lifted at that and then a smile ghosted around his lips for myself ive come to prefer green eyes and a sharp tongue she looked at him then and blushed despite herself i have no way my lord with drawing room flirtations then that is perhaps one more thing i shall teach you choosing to retreat rather than fight with a dull sword serena rose let me take you up maggie and show you your room maggies company was precisely the distraction serena needed it had been nearly two years since they had been together but time and distance were swept away they talked late into the night rode out together into the forest walked for miles in the hills as always maggie spoke whatever was in her heart while serena kept her innermost thoughts close the fact that her friend was still in love with coll didnt surprise her the fact that coll seemed equally besotted with maggie did it pleased her though serena had never believed as maggie always had that coll would fall in love with her friend she couldnt deny what was happening in front of her eyes he made dozens of excuses to be in their company when just two years before he had made twice as many to be out of it he listened to maggies cheerful ramblings as though she were the most fascinating person on earth and with the sharp and always critical eye of a sister serena noted that coll was taking great pains with his appearance she even had it from mrs drummond that coll was asking parkinss advice on his wardrobe she would have laughed about it if she had not felt constant prickings of jealousy more than once she had caught herself sulking when she thought of how rosy and dreamy being in love had made her friend and how nervous and unhappy falling in love was making her the weakness infuriated her and made her only more determined to see that coll and maggie had their hearts desire coll accompanied them on some of their rides which meant they more often than not rode as a foursome including brigham the new situation gave serena as much pleasure as it did discomfort the weather was brisk but the bite of winter was easing in another month serena thought the trees would be greening and the first hardy wildflowers would brave their way out to the sun for now there was the slap of a march wind on her face as she rode the spring thaws had not yet come and the ground still rang hard under the horses hooves but there were birdcalls and occasional bright flashes of wings as the horses disturbed the midmorning quiet ice and frost had melted from the trees leaving them wet and glistening they kept to a sedate canter that caused serena to rein in her impatience as well as her horse she knew maggie could ride as well as anyone but her friend seemed to prefer picking her way daintily along the path you would prefer a run brigham asked as he came up beside her i would she said feelingly he shot a look over his shoulder while his own mount danced beneath him let them catch up though she was tempted she shook her head her mother would never approve of their going in pairs rather than in a group it wouldnt be right afraid you cant keep up with me he was rewarded by a flash in her eyes there isnt an englishman alive a macgregor cant beat on horseback easy talk rena he said mildly the lakes less than a mile she hesitated knowing proper manners dictated she remain with her guest but a challenge was a challenge before she could stop herself she pressed in her heels and sent her mount leaping forward she knew the way as well as she knew the corridors of her own home with a light hand she guided the horse through the curves and twists whipping under lowhanging branches leaping over or skirting fallen limbs the path was barely wide enough for two but neither gave way so they rode all but shouldertoshoulder she glanced over to see brighams face alive with laughter as he spurred his mount forward the forest rang with her own as she leaned forward to coax more speed out of her mare there was a pleasure here that came as much from the company as the race there was a freedom she experienced only with him but one that for now she didnt question brighams part in she only wished that the lake were ten miles away rather than one so that they could continue to ride fast and reckless with the sun shooting beams through bare trees she rode like a goddess he thought brilliantly with a careless disregard for life and limb with another woman he would have held back slowed the pace out of concern for her safety and perhaps her pride with serena he only pushed harder out of the sheer pleasure of seeing her fly along the path her plaid streaming over her dovegray riding habit with a grin he watched her gallop half a length ahead regretting only that she had chosen the habit over breeches not so easy he murmured to himself as he spotted the sun striking the lakes surface in the distance with a kick of his heels they were neck and neck again thundering down the rise toward the water they reached the bank together and his heart stopped as serena waited until the last possible instant to rein in with a ringing whinny her mare reared she was laughing in the moment she hung suspended between sky and earth her eyes dark and reckless her body fluid if brigham hadnt already been in love he would have fallen then as quickly and as dangerously as a man hurled from a cliff i won sassenach the devil you did breathless he patted his horses neck and grinned at her i had you by a head head be damned she said forgetting herself i won and youre not man enough to admit it she took a deep greedy breath of air that tasted of pine and water if i hadnt been hampered by riding sidesaddle id have left you in my dust then she was laughing at him her eyes greener than any of the lush lawns he knew in england her flirty little hat tilted askew from the race youve nothing to be ashamed of she said with her tongue in her cheek youre as good a horseman as any englishman might be and nearly as good as a lame scot with a blind eye your compliments put me to the blush my lady regardless the race was mine but youre too vain or too mulish to concede she tossed her head so that the hat fell off to hang by its ribbons the hair that maggie had labored over that morning tumbled down in a mass of sunset curls i won a gentleman would have the grace to admit it i won reaching over he loosened her ribbons and snatched the hat away a lady would never have raced in the first place oh if it had been possible she would have stamped her foot instead she swung her horse around until they were facetoface she didnt mind being called vain and mulish but to have her lack of ladylike graces tossed in her face was too much isnt that just like a man the race was your idea if i had refused i would have been a coward but i accept and win so im not a lady accepted and lost brigham corrected enjoying the way temper flushed her cheeks youve no need to be a lady for me rena i prefer you as you are her eyes kindled which is a delightful wildcat who wears breeches and fights like a man she hissed at him and on impulse gave his mount a slap that had it leaping forward if brigham hadnt reacted quickly enough or had his skill been less sharp he would have landed headfirst in the icy waters of the lake vixen he murmured half in amazement half in admiration have you a mind to drown me now it would hardly be my fault if you sank to the bottom you have a head like a stone but she was biting her lip to keep from laughing tossing her head again she looked up at the sky it was a glorious day perhaps the most beautiful she would ever see annoyance with him faded easily when she remembered that he had given her the chance for a run ill call a truce she decided coll and maggie will be here soon if im angry with you ill have no one to talk to while they make moon eyes at each other so i have my uses brigham slipped from his horse you warm my heart madam the race and winning it put me in a pleasant mood she unhooked her knee from the saddle and laid her hands on his shoulders as he stood to assist her to the ground im delighted to hear it before she had an inkling of his purpose he had tossed her over his shoulder but ill remind you i won are you mad she thudded a fist against his back not certain if she wanted to laugh or swear set me down you oaf ive a mind to do just that he took a few easy strides to the verge of the lake serenas eyes widened rather than beat against him she dug her fingers into his jacket you wouldnt dare my dear have i told you that a langston never absolutely never refuses a dare she kicked and gave a passing thought to biting as his hand slid up her calf can you swim better than you sassenach ill swear if you dont let me her threat was cut off by her squeal as he feinted a toss brigham dont its freezing she began to laugh even as she kicked and struggled i swear ill murder you the moment im free thats hardly incentive for me to release you now if youll concede that i won the race i will not well then he had started to step closer to the water when serena landed a blow with the toe of her boot close enough to a sensitive area to make him wince in defense brigham stepped back and tripped over a root they went down in a flurry of petticoats and curses for proprietys sake and his own sake of mind he removed his hand from the taut curve of her bottom weve been here before i believe he managed as they both struggled to catch their breath serena shoved herself off him and remembered belatedly to cover her legs damn you youve stained my skirts my lady you came a great deal too close to ummanning me she grinned and pushed the hair out of her eyes it was a glorious day and she felt too alive to remember to be a lady did i ill do better at the next opportunity after a glance at the dirt on his breeches she snickered parkins will undoubtedly scold you for ruining those my valet does not scold but brigham rubbed at the streak of dirt he simply looks mortally offended which causes me to feel as though i were a schoolboy again serena plucked at the turf what is he like your parkins steady as a rock infuriatingly proper stubborn why mrs drummond has decided he would make a likely husband mrs drummond brigham turned his head to stare your mrs drummond and parkins family honor brought the light of battle to serenas eyes and why not mrs drummond is a fine woman youll get no argument from me but parkins brigham leaned back on his elbows and laughed he could do nothing else when he thought of the scarecrowframed parkins and the prodigiously built cook does he know shell get around to letting him because she had found the pairing funny herself serena lay back on the grassy bank and smiled at the sky shell charm him with her tarts and sauces just as maggie is charming coll with her pretty eyes and shy smiles does that bother you maggie and coll serena cushioned her head with her arm and thought it through no shes been in love with him for as long as i can remember id be more than happy for them if they make a match and since shes already my friend i wouldnt have to worry about hating the woman coll chose for a wife but but seeing them together has made me think things are changing and theres nothing to be done to stop it she closed her eyes content to have the chilly breeze dance over her face when spring comes love comes so they say if her voice was wistful she blamed it on the air when this spring comes war comes there will be nothing to stop that either no he reached over to toy with the ends of her hair would you have it stopped serena she sighed opening her eyes to watch the wispy clouds chased by the wind part of me hates not being able to take a sword and fight myself yet another part a part that seems to have just begun wishes there was no need to fight at all that part of me wishes we could go on living as we have been watching the flowers come up in the spring he took her hand it was too fragile to hold a sword he thought however strong her heart there will still be flowers and there will be other springs she turned her head to look at him it hadnt occurred to her that she was relaxed with him content even happy to be alone with him on the banks of the lake it was her favorite place one she came to when she was deeply troubled or very happy now she was there with him and it seemed so right somehow the gentle call of birds the smell of the water and damp earth the almost harsh light of the sun her fingers curled into his in a move so instinctive that she didnt know she had done it until it was too late until the change had come into his eyes the subtle darkening the sharpening of intensity it was as if in one instant the rest of the world had slipped out of its orbit and only they were left hands linked eyes only for each other no quickly she pushed herself up so that she was sitting rather than lying on the bank it had seemed a move of selfpreservation but it was a poor one as it only put them closer together brigham reached out to trace the line of her jaw i could let you go rena it wouldnt change whats between us there can be nothing between us stubborn he nipped her lower lip willful then he traced the ache with his tongue beautiful im none of those things she lifted a hand thinking to push him away but somehow she was clutching his jacket youre all of them he bit gently at her jaw making her eyes widen in confused desire his lips curved at her reaction she would be a joy in bed slowly almost leisurely he shifted to nibble her earlobe dont ive waited for days to have five minutes alone with you and do just this he dipped his tongue into her ear so that both pleasure and heat rippled through her there is nothing more i want than to make love with you serena every inch of you i cant you cant you can he murmured we will he teased her lips apart with his for a moment she luxuriated in it the feel of his lips on hers the rightness of it but it couldnt be right it would never be right please stop its wrong for you to speak that way to me its wrong to i cant think dont think suddenly he gripped her by the shoulders so that they were again facetoface feel just feel and show me her head was spinning with longings with warnings with a moan she dragged his mouth to hers it was wrong it was madness but she couldnt resist when he touched her she wanted only for him to go on touching her when he kissed her she felt she might die from the pleasure of it to be wanted like this was its own kind of torment she could feel his desire for her in the way his fingers gripped in the way his mouth devoured with each passing second she could feel her will drain until she knew there would come a time when she would give everything to him he covered her heart with his hand aroused to desperation by its pounding for him unable to resist he traced his fingers over her curves trailing his lips down her throat then up again to find her lips warmed and waiting for his my god serena how i want you his breath ragged he pushed her away to stare at her flushed face can you understand aye her hand was shaking as she lifted it to her throat i need time to think we need time to talk very carefully he released her only just realizing how hard his fingers had dug into her arms he heard the sound of approaching horses and swore every time im alone with you i end up kissing you we wont get any talking done this way i need you to understand how i feel and what i want for us she thought she did and to her shame and her excitement she knew she was close to agreeing he wanted her and she would be his lover it would be the most precious moment of her life and then he would offer to make an arrangement as his mistress she would be well provided for well housed well clothed well attended and miserable if she found the strength to refuse him she would retain her pride and she would be even more miserable theres no need to talk i understand she rose to brush off her skirts i simply need time to think about it he took her hand knowing they had only moments to be alone do you love me she closed her eyes wishing she could hate him for asking what he must already know that isnt the only question to be answered brigham he dropped her hand and stepped back his eyes cold again were back to that are we im english and no matter what you may feel for me no matter what we can bring to each other you wont forget it cant she corrected and wanted to weep no i cant forget who you are what you are any more than i can forget who and what i am i need time to see if i can live with what you want from me very well he inclined his head youll have time but remember this serena i wont beg you chapter eight contents prev next its going to be a beautiful ball maggie balanced on the rang of a ladder and polished the topmost corner of a mirror the servants under fionas eagle eye were turning the house inside out family was expected to do no less everything will be perfect rena youll see the music the lights and coll serena added rubbing her cloth over the arm of a chair especially coll smiling maggie looked down over her shoulder hes already asked me for the first dance that comes as no surprise he was so sweet when he asked maggie murmured peering closer to the mirror to give her face a careful study she was terrified that the long sunny rides she had indulged in would bring out freckles that coll would despise i wanted to tell him there was no one else i wanted to dance with at all but i knew that would make him go red and stutter i dont remember ever hearing coll stutter until you came to visit i know maggie bit her lip in delight isnt it wonderful a sarcastic response faded from her mind when serena looked up at maggies beaming face aye hes fallen in love with you and ive no doubt its the finest thing that has ever happened to him not just because youre my friend maggie asked anxiously no because he looks happier whenever youre in the room maggie felt tears sting her eyes then blinked them away she didnt want them red and puffy if coll happened in she was still floating in the fantasy that her love should see her as nothing less than perfect remember years ago when we promised each other wed be sisters one day of course you would marry coll and i would marry whichever of your cousins i with the cloth dangling from her fingers serena looked up oh maggie never say coll has made an offer not yet maggie tucked a loose curl back in her cap for a moment she got the stubborn line between her brows her father would have recognized very well but he will rena it cant just be wishful thinking i love him so much are you certain rising serena crossed over to lay a hand on maggies skirt we were only children when we talked that way i know you had your heart set on him but youre not a child anymore and colls a man it is different with a sigh maggie rubbed at a spot on the mirror when we were children i would think of him as a prince coll serena couldnt prevent a sisterly snort he was so tall and bonny i imagined him fighting duels over me sweeping me up on his horse and carrying me off laughing a little she stepped down a rung but now these past few weeks being around him has made me see him in a whole new way hes a steady man dependable gentle even shy in his way oh i know he has a temper and can be reckless but thats the part that makes him exciting as well as steady hes not a prince rena and i love him more than i ever knew i could has he kissed you serena asked thinking that brigham was more like maggies childhood vision of coll the earl of ashburn was a man for duels and carrying off no maggie pouted for a moment over it knowing it was wrong to wish he had just once taken command of her i think he was about to once but malcolm came in maggie fluttered her hands do you think its wrong for me to want him to no serenas answer was flat and honest but maggie was dreaming and didnt notice the tone i miss my mother more now than when she died maggie mused not being able to talk to her about all of this to ask her if being with my father ever made her feel as though her heart had turned upside down tell me the truth serena do you really think he loves me ive never seen him act so stupid around anyone else stammering going around dreamy eyed and slack mouthed whenever he looks at you he either goes pale or colors up truly maggie clapped her hands in delight oh but the mans slow ill go mad soon if he doesnt stop looking and take maggie though her laughter was scandalized serena gave her friend a careful study you wouldnt well agree to more than a kiss i dont know her color was high as she stepped down another rung the only thing im sure of is if he doesnt declare himself soon ill take matters into my own hands fascinated serena tilted her head how i maggie stopped at the sound of approaching footsteps her heart fluttered once making her certain it was coll even before he swung into the room on impulse she let her foot slip off the rung and gasped in alarm as she tumbled the last few feet toward the polished floor serena reached out but coll took the distance in a leap and caught maggie around the waist he had only a fleeting sensation of how tiny she was before he was swamped with concern there now lassie have you hurt yourself how clumsy of me she managed over the lump in her throat as she stared up into his wide rugged face if serena had asked her now if she would agree to more than a kiss her answer would have been yes a hundred times yes nonsense overwhelmed by tenderness he held her gently a little slip of a girl like you shouldnt be climbing ladders suddenly afraid he might bruise her with his big clumsy hands he started to set her down drastic desires called for drastic measures maggie thought and she let out a muffled cry as her foot touched the ground instantly she was gathered in colls arms again she nearly swooned in earnest when she felt the rapid beat of his heart against hers you have hurt yourself shall i call gwen oh no if i could just sit for a moment she fluttered her lashes and was rewarded when coll swept her up and carried her to a chair it took him only six steps but he had never felt more of a man youre a bit pale maggie a little water should help he was up and striding out before she could think of an excuse to keep him how badly does it hurt serena had already knelt by her feet oh maggie it would be so unfair if you couldnt dance tomorrow ill dance and ill dance with coll but if youve sprained your ankle theres not a thing wrong with my ankle dont be silly to prove it she sprang up and did a quick laughing dance step why margaret macdonald you lied to him no such thing she sat again careful to arrange her skirts in their most flattering folds he assumed id hurt myself i never said so oh rena how is my hair it must be a mess you fell on purpose aye maggies face glowed with triumph and it worked disgusted serena sat back on her heels thats nothing but a trick and a demeaning one at that its not a trick or only a small one and theres nothing demeaning about it she touched a hand to her cheek where colls beard had tickled her it was simply a way to make him feel as though i needed tending a man doesnt fall in love with a woman whos a packhorse you know if it makes him feel good to think of me as a bit helpless and fragile whats the harm serena chewed over that one remembering the time brigham had raised his sword for her when hed thought she had been attacked if she had acted a little more fragile with a shake of her head she told herself that was for maggie not for her none i suppose when a mans shy he needs a bit of a push there hes coming back she gripped serenas hands and squeezed if you could leave us alone for just a little while i will but it almost seems as though he hasnt a chance her smile spread i hope not here now coll knelt beside her and offered a cup drink a little perhaps ill go fetch gwen serena said as she rose neither maggie nor coll spared her a glance and perhaps i wont she murmured and left them alone coll took maggies hand in his it seemed so soft so tiny he felt like a bear hulking over a dove are you in much pain maggie no its nothing she looked at him from under her lashes amazed to find herself as stricken with shyness as he you dont need to fuss coll looking at her he was reminded of one of the beautiful porcelain dolls he had seen in italy his need to touch ha was as great as his fear that he would bruise her i was afraid i wouldnt be quick enough to catch you so was i daringly she laid her hand on his do you remember years ago i fell in the forest and tore my dress aye he had to swallow i laughed at you you must have hated me no i could never hate you her fingers curled into his i must have been a dreadful nuisance she drew together her courage and looked up am i still no his throat was dry as dust youre the most beautiful woman in scotland and i now his throat was not only dry but seemed to have swollen to twice its size and his collar threatened to strangle him and you maggie prompted i should find gwen she nearly screamed with frustration i dont need gwen coll cant you dont you see he did the moment he braced himself to look into those dark blue eyes he was thunderstruck for a moment then terrified and then he was lifting her out of the chair and into his arms youll marry me maggie ive waited all my life for you to ask she tilted her face up for his kiss coll fiona stepped into the room her voice was ripe with warning and disapproval is this how you treat a young female guest in our home aye he laughed and carried maggie forward when shes agreed to be my wife i see she looked from one to the other i wont pretend im surprised but i think youd best refrain from carrying maggie around until after the wedding mother set the lass down stiff with annoyance he complied maggie gripped her hands together then relaxed when fiona opened her arms welcome to the family maggie i can only be grateful my son is finally showing good sense she still couldnt believe it as she finished up the morning milking serena thought over maggies breathless announcement coll was getting married what do you think of that she asked the placid cow as milk squirted into the pail no one was supposed to know yet of course fiona had insisted that coll approach macdonald with an offer first as was proper but maggie hadnt been able to hold the news inside in fact serenas eyes were gritty this morning because maggie hadnt let her sleep until it had been nearly time to rise again there was little doubt that when macdonald arrived later that day with many of the other guests he would agree to the betrothal maggie was nearly delirious at the thought of announcing the engagement at the ball that night ready to dance out of her shoes serena thought as she squeezed and pulled the last of the milk from the bored cow then there was coll strutting around eke a rooster with two tails with a shake of her head serena set the milking stool aside and lifted her two pails of course she was happy for them as long as she could remember maggie had dreamed of marrying coll she would be a good and loving wife to him calming his more radical impulses indulging the harmless ones she would be content to spin ply her needle and raise a brood of raucous children and coll like their father would be devoted to his family for herself she had reaffirmed her decision never to marry she would make a poor wife it wasnt that she minded the work or that she wouldnt dearly love to have children of her own but she hadnt the patience or the biddable nature to sit and wait to nod and obey in any case how often did anyone find a mate to both love and respect she supposed shed been spoiled by being a part of her parents marriage settling for less would make her feel like a failure how could she marry anyone she asked herself as she came out of the cow shed when she had fallen in love with brigham how could she give herself to a man when she would always wonder what it would have been like with another knowing she could never be a part of brighams life or he a part of hers didnt change what was in her heart until she could convince herself that the love she had for him was dead she would remain alone it would be harder now watching coll and maggie serena balanced herself with the pails as she started down the rise the sun was struggling to brighten the sky and melt the last of the winters snow the path was slick but manageable for one who had made the trip day after day all her life she moved without hurry not for cautions sake but because her mind was elsewhere no she wouldnt begrudge them their happiness because she could never have the same that would be meanhearted and she loved them both too much for that but she had to wonder at the way maggie had claimed her hearts desire simply by tumbling off a ladder the way coll had looked at maggie as if she were a piece of precious glass that might shatter at a touch serena remembered with a quick shake of her head how would it be to have a man look at you that way of course it wasnt what she wanted serena reminded herself still just once it might be nice she heard the sound of boots ringing on rock and glanced up to see brigham striding toward the stables without giving herself time to think she changed directions so that they would pass each other offering a silent apology for the spilled milk serena let out what she hoped was a convincing gasp of alarm and slid to the ground brigham was beside her instantly his hands on his hips his face already darkened by his black mood have you hurt yourself it was more an accusation than a question serena bristled then forced herself to play the part she wasnt precisely sure how it was done but maggie had used her lashes im not sure i may have twisted my ankle what the devil are you doing hauling milk disgusted he bent down to examine her ankle the communication that had been brought to him late the previous night was weighing on his mind but for that he might have seen the thunder come into her eyes wheres malcolm or that scatterbrained molly or one of the others the milkings not malcolms job and molly and everyone else are busy preparing for the guests all thoughts of being fragile and feminine were whisked away theres no shame in hauling milk lord ashburn perhaps your dainty english ladies wouldnt know a cows teat from a bulls this has nothing to do with my english ladies as you call them the paths are slippery and the pails are heavy so it has to do with you doing more than youre able more than im able she knocked his hand away from her ankle im strong enough to do as much as you and more and ive never in my life slipped on this path he sat back on his heels and let his gaze sweep over her sturdy as a mule arent you rena that was it a woman could take only so much serena sprang up and emptied the contents of one bucket over his head it was done before either of them could prevent it she stood swinging an empty bucket while he swallowed a mouthful of very fresh milk theres a warm milk bath for your soft english skin my lord she grabbed the other bucket but before she could toss it in his face his hands closed over hers on the handles his grip was very firm very steady but there was smoke from a volatile fire in his eyes i should thrash you for that she tossed her head back and watched with growing satisfaction as milk dripped down his cheeks you can try sassenach serena the challenging gleam in her eyes turned to one of distress when she heard her father call her name she braced herself as she waited for him to rash the last few feet toward her father there was nothing to do but hang her head before his glowering eyes and wait for the worst have you lost your mind she signed because she was looking at the ground she didnt notice that brigham shifted just enough to put himself between serena and her fathers wrath my temper father there was a slight accident ian brigham began taking out his handkerchief he wiped milk from his face serena lost her footing while she was carrying the milk it wasnt an accident it would not have occurred to serena to claim it as one and save herself i poured the pail of milk on lord ashburn deliberately i had eyes to see that for myself ian planted his feet at that moment with the sun rising behind his back his plaid tossed over one shoulder and his face hard as granite he looked fierce and invincible ill apologize for the miserable behavior of this brat brigham and promise you shell be dealt with into the house girl yes father please brigham put a hand on her shoulder before serena could make her humiliated retreat i cant in good conscience allow serena to take the full blame i provoked her also deliberately i called you a mule i believe did i not serena her eyes kindled as she lifted her head she was careful to lower it again quickly lest her father see she was unrepentant aye i thought that was it brigham wrung out his sodden handkerchief what parkins would say to this brigham couldnt even surmise the incident was as unfortunate as the insult and as regrettable ian i would take it as a favor if you would let the matter drop ian said nothing for a moment then made an impatient gesture toward serena take whats left of that milk into the house and be quick about it yes father she sent a quick look at brigham that was a mixture of gratitude and frustration then ran milk slopping at the lip of the pail she deserved a whipping for that ian commented though he knew he would laugh later at the memory of his little girl dumping milk all over the young english buck that was my first thought brigham glanced idly at the ruined sleeve of his coat unfortunately on further consideration im forced to admit i quite deserved it your daughter and i seem unable to maintain a polite demeanor with each other so i see she is stubborn sharptongued and has a temper that flares faster than a torch ian rubbed a hand over his beard to hide a smile shes a curse to me brigham to any man brigham murmured she makes me wonder if she was put here to complicate my life or to brighten it what do you intend to do about it it was only then brigham realized he had spoken his last thoughts aloud he glanced back to see serena disappear into the kitchen i intend to marry her with your permission ian let out a long breath and without it brigham gave him a level look i shall marry her anyway it was the answer ian wanted but still he hedged he would know his daughters mind first ill think on it brigham when do you leave for london the end of the week his mind returned to the letter and his duty lord george murray believes my presence will help gain more support from the english jacobites youll have my answer when you return i wont deny that youre a man i would be content to give my daughter to but she must be willing and that lad i cant promise you a shadow came over brighams eyes as he dug his hands into his pockets because im english ian saw that this ground had been crossed before aye some wounds run deep because he had a generous heart he clapped a hand on brighams damp shoulder called her a mule did you i did brigham flicked his sodden lace and should have moved more quickly with a rumbling laugh ian gave brighams shoulder another slap if youve a mind to marry her youd best be a fast learner she wished she were dead she wished brigham were dead she wished fervently that he had never been born setting her teeth serena scowled at her reflection as maggie fussed with the curling irons your hair is so thick and soft youll never have to sleep in papers all night as if i would serena mumbled i dont see why any woman goes to so much fuss and bother just for a man maggie smiled the wise smile of a woman in love and engaged what other reason is there i wish i could wear mine up gwen scooted around to the mirror to study her own hair you did make it look so pretty maggie she said afraid of seeming ungrateful but mother said i couldnt pin it up until next year it looks like sunbeams serena told her then went immediately back to frowning yours looks more like candlelight gwen sighed and tried a few dance steps this would be her first ball and her first gown she could hardly wait to put it on and feel grownup do you think anyone will ask me to dance everyone will maggie tested the iron perhaps someone will try to kiss me if they do serena said grimly youre to tell me ill deal with them you sound like mother with a light laugh gwen twirled in her petticoats its not as though i would let anyone kiss me but it would be so nice to have someone try keep talking like that my lass and father will lock you up for another year shes just excited expertly maggie threaded a green riband edged in gold through serenas hair so am i it feels like my very first ball there she patted serenas hair before she stepped back to study her handiwork you look beautiful or would if youd smile in answer serena bared her teeth in a grimace that should send the men scurrying to the hills maggie commented let them run serena almost smiled at the thought id as soon see the back of them brigham wont run away gwen said wisely earning a glare from her sister its of no concern to me what lord ashburn does serena flounced away to snatch her gown from the bed behind her back gwen and maggie exchanged delighted grins well he is rather stuffy isnt he maggie put her tongue in her cheek then moved over to check her own gown for creases handsome certainly if one likes dark brooding looks and cool eyes he isnt stuffy at all serena turned on her hes she caught herself warned by gwens giggle rude is what he is rude and annoying and english dutifully gwen began hooking maggies gown he was kissing rena in the kitchen maggies eyes went as round as saucers what gwen oh its just maggie gwen said with a move of her bare shoulder we always tell her everything he was kissing her right in the kitchen gwen continued turning dreamy circles as she remembered it it was so romantic he looked as though he might swallow her right up like a sugarplum thats enough hot and flushed serena struggled to step into her gown it wasnt romantic at all it was infuriating and and she wanted to say unpleasant but couldnt get her tongue around the lie i wish he would go to the devil maggie lifted a brow if you wished him to the devil why didnt you tell me he had kissed you because id forgotten all about it gwen started to speak but was hushed by a quick gesture from maggie well i daresay there wasnt anything special about it then calmly she began to hook serenas gown my cousin jamie is coming tonight rena perhaps youll find him more to your taste serena only groaned by the time brigham escaped from parkinss perfecting hands he was frazzled and impatient with the rumors and the unrest in both scotland and england he felt little like partnering a bunch of simpering girls and plump matrons at a country ball his summons back to london weighed on him the support the prince expected from his english followers wasnt as immediately forthcoming as he had hoped there was a chance that adding his own voice would sway those who were straddling the political fence but it would be a dangerous mission he had no way of knowing how long he would be gone how successful he might be or if he were found out what would be the fate of his lands and title there would be dozens of highland chiefs under the same roof that night loyalties would be tested oaths would be sworn what he learned here he would take with him to london in hopes of stirring fighting blood among those english loyal to the stuarts it was a war that still dealt more in talk than in the sword like coll he was growing weary of it as he descended the steps toward the ballroom he was the picture of the fashionable aristocrat his lace was snowy foaming from his throat falling over his wrists his buckles gleamed as did the emerald on his finger a matching one winked out of the lace at his throat his black waistcoat was threaded with silver topped by a silverbuttoned coat that fitted without a wrinkle over his shoulders at a glance it would have appeared that he was a young wealthy man used to the finer things and unhampered by any care but his thoughts were as bright and as dangerous as his dress sword lord ashburn fiona curtsied as he entered since that morning she had been fretting over what her husband had told her of brighams feelings for her oldest daughter more than ian could she understood the warring emotions serena must be experiencing lady macgregor you look stunning she smiled noting that his gaze was already sweeping the room and she thought as she softened that the love in it was unmistakable thank you my lord i hope you will enjoy the evening i shall if you promise me a dance it would be a pleasure but all the young ladies will be angry if i monopolize your time please let me introduce you she laid her hand on his arm and led him into the room it was already scattered with people dressed in their best satin gowns glimmered and silk shimmered in the light of the hundreds of candles that floated in the chandeliers overhead or rose from high stands jewels gleamed and winked men were wrapped in dress kilts plaids of bright reds and greens and blues contrasting with doublets of calfskin buckled brogues and silver buttons caught the light vying for brilliance with the shine of womens jewels for the ladies part it was apparent that in the highlands french fashions were watched closely the more opulent styles were preferred with an abundance of tinsel and silver lace in evidence hoops swished and swayed like bells heavy brocades in vivid shades were worn by both men and women with thick gold ornamentation worked into dress coats and huge cuffs that covered the elbows stockings were white or clocked and worn with dressy garters glenroe might have been remote with the nearest shop half a days ride away but the scots love of fashion was no less than that of the frenchman or the englishman brigham was introduced to the pretty and the plain by his hostess when the music began he would do his duty for now he curbed his impatience as he continued to scan the room for the one face he wanted to see willing or not he was determined to lead her out in the first dance and for as many others as he could manage the little macintosh lass has the grace of a bullock coll confided in his ear if you find yourself shackled with her best to offer to fetch her a drink and sit out the dance i appreciate the warning brigham turned to examine his friend you look quite selfsatisfied shall i take it that your interview with macdonald went as you wished colls chest puffed out you may take it that maggie and i will be wed by may day my felicitations brigham said with a bow then he grinned i shall have to find someone else to drink under the table coll snorted and fought off a blush not likely i wish i could ride with you to london your place is here now ill be back in a matter of weeks with cheering news well continue to work here but not tonight tonights for celebrating he clapped a hand on brighams shoulder theres my maggie now if you want a turn with someone light on her feet ask serena to stand up with you a foul temper she might have but the lass can dance brigham could only nod as coll strode away to claim his betrothed beside the demure maggie macdonald serena stood like a flame her hair dressed high the rich green silk of the dress trimmed in gold and cut square at the neck to reveal the smooth swell of her breasts there were pearls around her throat gleaming dully no whiter no creamier than her skin her skirts flared out making her slender waist seem impossibly small other women were dressed more opulently some with their hair powdered others with jewels glistening they might have been hags dressed in burlap serena looked up at coll and laughed brigham felt as though hed taken a stroke of the broadsword across his knees as the strains of the first dance began several young ladies cast a hopeful look in his direction brigham found his feet and moved across the room to serena miss macgregor he made her an elegant bow might i have the honor of this dance she had made up her mind to refuse him should he ask now she found herself wordlessly offering her hand the strains of a minuet floated through the room skirts rustled as ladies were led to their places by their partners suddenly she was certain she would never remember even the most basic steps then he smiled at her and bowed again it seemed her feet never touched the floor and her eyes refused to leave his she had dreamed of this once standing in the chill air of the forest there had been lights there too and music but it hadnt been like this this was like floating like feeling beautiful like believing in dreams his hand held hers lightly fingertips to fingertips it made her feel weak as though she were caught up in his arms they stepped together sedately moved apart her heart thundered as though they were wrapped together tumbling into an intimate embrace his lips curved as she sank into her final curtsy hers warmed as if they had been kissed thank you he didnt release her hand as they both knew was proper but brought her fingers to his lips ive wanted that dance since i found you alone by the river now when i think of it the only difficulty will be deciding whether you look more lovely in your green gown or in your breeches its mothers the gown she said quickly and cursed herself for stammering when he led her off the floor she felt like a queen i want to apologize for this morning no you dont boldly he kissed her hand again more wear a dress that made her look so delectable couldnt her father see that that young rake was all but drooling on his daughters neck her bare neck her soft white naked skin just at the point where the fragile line of her collarbone swelled into her breast he swore under his breath and earned a wideeyed stare from gwen i beg your pardon brig what he dragged his eyes away from serena long enough to focus on her sister he had no notion that his stormy looks had prevented half a dozen young swains from approaching gwen for a dance nothing gwen it was nothing he drew a deep breath and struggled for a casual tone are you enjoying yourself very much she smiled up at him and secretly wished he would ask her to dance again i suppose you go to many balls and parties in london in the season you can barely turn around without one i would love to see london and paris she looked very young at that moment and he was reminded of how devotedly she had nursed her brother back to health some man one day he thought and delighted her by kissing her fingers you my dear would be all the rage she was young enough to giggle without simpering do you think so really without a doubt offering his arm he led her onto the floor again and told her as many stories as he could recall about balls and assemblies and routs even as he spoke his eyes were locked on serena as she danced with her skinny partner when the dance was over gwen had enough to dream on for years brigham had worked himself into a fine shining jealous rage he led her off the floor watching as serena was led in than one murmur arose because of it you only think you should aye she shot him a quick amused look its the least i can do after you saved me from the threat of a beating only the threat father only has the heart to threaten hes never taken a strap to me in my life which is probably why im unmanageable tonight my dear youre only beautiful she flushed and lowered her eyes i dont know what to say when you speak like that good rena miss macgregor both brigham and serena looked impatiently at the intruder a young son of one of the neighboring highland lairds would you honor me with this dance she would have preferred honoring him with a kick in the shins but she knew her duty too well she laid a hand on his arm wondering how soon it would be proper to dance with brigham again the music played on reels country dances elegant minuets serena danced with elderly gentlemen sons cousins the portly and the dashing her love of dancing and her skill kept her in constant demand she had one other set with brigham then was forced to watch him lead out one after another of the pretty guests he couldnt keep his eyes off her damn it it wasnt like him to resent watching a woman dance with another man did she have to smile at them no by god she didnt and she had no business flirting with that skinny young scot in the ugly coat he fingered the hilt of his dress sword and fought back temptation what had her mother been thinking of to allow her to a different direction by her partner one who was wearing in brighams opinion a particularly hideous yellow brocade while the coat might have offended him the possessive manner in which the man clutched serenas hand did a great deal more who is that serenas talking with gwen followed the direction brigham was scowling into oh thats only rob one of serenas suitors suitors he said between his teeth suitors is it before gwen could elaborate he was striding across the room miss macgregor a word with you her brow lifted at his tone lord ashburn may i present rob macgregor my kinsman your servant he said stiffly then taking serenas elbow he dragged her off toward the first convenient alcove what do you think youre doing have you lost your senses youll have everyone staring to hell with them he stared down at her mutinous face why was that popinjay holding your hand though she privately agreed that rob macgregor was a popinjay at his best she refused to accept any slur on a kinsman rob macgregor happens to be a fine man of good family the devil take his family he had barely enough control left to keep his voice low why was he holding your hand because he wanted to give it to me i will not i said give it to me he snatched it up hes no right to it do you understand no i understand that im free to give my hand to whomever i choose the cool light of battle came into his eyes he preferred it much preferred it to the grinding heat of jealousy if you want your fine young man of good family to live i wouldnt choose him again is that so she tugged at her hand and got nowhere let me go this instant so you can return to him she wondered for a moment if brigham was drunk but decided against it his eyes were too sharp and clear if i choose if you choose i promise you you will regret it this dance is mine moments before she had longed to dance with him now she held her ground equally determined not to i dont want to dance with you what you want and what youll do may be different matters my dear i will remind you lord ashburn only my father can command me that will change his fingers tightened on hers when i return from london youre going to london her anger was immediately eclipsed by distress when why in two days i have business there i see her hand went limp in his perhaps you had planned to tell me when you saddled your horse i only just received word that i was needed his eyes lost their fire his voice its roughness would you care that i go no she turned her head away to stare toward the music why should i but you do with his free hand he touched her cheek go or stay she said in a desperate whisper it matters nothing to me i go on behalf of the prince then godspeed she managed rena i will come back will you my lord she pulled her hand away from his i wonder before he could stop her she rushed back into the ballroom and threw herself into the dancing chapter nine contents prev next perhaps she had been more unhappy in her life but she couldnt remember when tears had seemed so miserably and inescapably close perhaps she had been angrier but she could think of no time in her life when fury had raged quite so high or burned so hot and the fury and misery were all with herself serena thought as she kicked the mare into a gallop with herself for dreaming even for a moment that there could be something real something lovely between herself and brigham he was going back to london aye and london was where he belonged in london he was a man of wealth and means and lineage he was a man with parties to attend ladies to call on a line to continue swearing she pushed the horse harder he might stand behind the prince she was coming to believe he was dedicated to the cause and would fight for it but he would fight in england for england why should he not why should a man like the earl of ashburn waste a thought on her once he was back in his own world just as she would waste no thought on him she promised herself once he was gone she knew he had met with her father and many of the other chiefs early that morning oh women werent supposed to know or bother themselves with plans of war and rebellions but they knew france would move on england and when she did charles hoped to sway the french king to his cause the previous winter louis had planned to invade england with charles in attendance as his fathers representative if the fleet had not been wrecked in a storm and the invasion abandoned well that was another matter it was clear that louis had supported charles because he wanted a monarch on the english throne who would be dependent on france just as it was clear charles would use france or any means to gain his rightful place but the invasion had been abandoned and the french king was now biding his time just because a body had to busy herself with sewing and cleaning didnt mean she had no head for politics so brigham would go to london and beat the drum for the young prince it had become more important than ever to rally the jacobites for the stuarts english and scottish the time for rebellion was ripe charles was not his father and would not be content as james had been to while away his youth in foreign courts when the time came brigham would fight but come back to the highlands come back to her no she couldnt see it a man didnt leave his home and country for a mistress desire her he might but she already knew a mans desire was easily fanned and easily cooled for her it was love her first her only without ever having taken her innocence he had ruined her there would never be another man for her the only one she wanted was preparing even now to ride out of her life if he stayed what difference would it make she asked herself there would always be too much between them had he loved her no even that would have changed nothing her beloved books had shown her time and time again that love did not necessarily conquer all romeo and juliet tristan and isolde lancelot and guinevere serena macgregor was no weakmoraled guinevere nor was she a starryeyed juliet she was a scot hotblooded perhaps but toughminded she knew the difference between fantasy and fact there was one fact that could not be ignored now or ever brigham would always be tied to england and she to scotland so it was best that he was going she wished him well she wished him to the devil serena she whipped her head around to see brigham racing up behind her it was then she realized there were tears in her eyes the shame of them the need to keep them hers alone had her wheeling back to drive her mount yet faster cursing the cumbersome sidesaddle she made for the lake in a mad dash she hoped would leave brigham behind she planned to pass the water and ride up into the hills into the rougher land where he would never be able to track her then she was swearing at him as he thundered to her side and snatched the reins from her hands hold up woman what devils in you leave me be she kicked her horse nearly unseating brigham as he struggled to hold both mounts oh damn you to hell i hate you well you may after i take a whip to you he said grimly are you trying to kill both of us just you she sniffled and despised herself for it why are you crying he drew her mount in closer to his as he studied her face has someone hurt you no her hysterical laugh shocked her enough to make her swallow another no she repeated im not crying its the wind in my eyes go away i rode here to be alone then youll have to be disappointed she was crying however much she denied it he wanted to gather her close and comfort her but he knew her well enough by now to know her response would be to sink her teeth into his hand instead realizing it might be just as foolish he tried reason i leave at first light tomorrow serena there are things i wish to say to you first say them then she began searching her pockets for a handkerchief and go away to london or to hell for all i care after casting his eyes to the heavens brigham offered her his handkerchief i would prefer dismounting she snatched the cloth to dry the hated tears do what you want it doesnt matter to me she blew her nose heartily he did taking care to keep her reins in his hand after he had secured the horses he reached up to help her down after a last defiant sniff she stuffed the handkerchief into her pocket i dont want your help youll have more than that before im done with you so saying he plucked her with more speed than style from the saddle hed finished with reason sit i will not sit he repeated in a tone dangerous enough to have her chin jerking up or before god you will wish you had very well because his eyes warned her it was no idle threat she chose a rock deliberately taking her time smoothing her skirts folding her hands primly in her lap perversely now that he was growling she was determined to be proper you wished to converse with me my lord i wish to throttle you my lady but i trust i have enough control left to resist she gave a mock shudder how terrifying may i say lord ashburn that your visit to my home has broadened my perception of english manners ive had enough of that he moved so quickly she had only time to stare grasping the front of her riding jacket he dragged her to her feet i am english and not ashamed of it the langstons are an old and respected family the way he held her she was forced to stand on tiptoe eyetoeye with him and his eyes were dark as onyx with a heated fury in them only a few had seen and lived there is nothing in my lineage to make me blush and much to make me proud to bear the name ive had my fill of your slurs and insults do you understand aye she thought she had understood what it was to be truly frightened until this moment she hadnt known at all still frightened didnt mean cowed its not your family i mean to insult my lord only me then or perhaps the whole of england damn it rena i know what your clan has suffered i know that even now your name is so proscribed that many of you are forced to take others its a cruelty thats already gone on too long but it wasnt i who brought the persecution nor was it all of england insult me if you will scratch or bite but im damned if ill take either for something that wasnt of my doing please she said very quietly youre hurting me he let her go and curled his hands into fists at his sides it was rare very rare for him to come that close to losing control of both thoughts and actions as a result his voice was ice my apologies no she reached out tentatively to touch his arm i apologize youre right it is wrong of me to lash out at you for many things that were done before either of us were born she was no longer afraid she realized but shamed deeply shamed she would have done more than shout if anyone had slashed so at her family its wrong to blame you because english dragoons raped my mother or because they put my father in prison for over a year so that even that dishonor went unavenged and its wrong she continued after a long cleansing breath to want to blame you because im afraid not to why rena why are you afraid she started to shake her head and turn away but he took her arms to hold her still his grip wasnt fierce this time but it was just as unbreakable i hope you will forgive me my lord and now i would prefer to be alone i shall have your answer serena his voice was nearly calm again but there was a thread of hot steel through it why are you afraid raising her head she sent him a damp desperate look because if i dont blame you i might forget who you are what you are does it have to matter he demanded shaking her a little aye she discovered she was frightened again but in a wholly different way something in his eyes told her that no matter what she said no matter what she did her fate was already sealed aye it has to for both of us does it matter he dragged her against him does it matter when were like this before she could answer he closed his mouth over hers she didnt fight him the moment his lips covered hers she knew she was through fighting him and herself if he was to be her first her only she needed to take whatever could be given now his mouth was hot and desperate on hers his body taut as wire and straining against hers part was still temper yes she knew it but there was more it was the more she was ready to answer if she had ever had a choice she made it now and caution flew to the winds does it matter he said again as he rained kisses over her face no no it doesnt matter now not today she threw her arms around him and clung oh brig i dont want you to go i dont want you to leave me with his face buried in her hair he memorized her scent ill come back three weeks four at the most ill come back when he received no response he drew her away her eyes were dry now but solemn i will be back serena cant you trust even that i trust you more than i thought i would ever trust any man she smiled a little and lifted a hand to his face oh god if this was love why should it hurt so why couldnt it bring her the joy she saw in maggies eyes no i dont trust youll come back to me but well not speak of that she moved her hand to cover his lips when he would have spoken well not think of it only of today then well talk of other things no she kissed both of his hands then stepped back we wont talk at all slowly she began to unfasten the buttons of her riding habit what are you doing he reached out to stop her but she slipped the snug jacket from her shoulders revealing a simple chemise and small high breasts taking what both of us want rena he managed her name though the pulse beating at his throat made the word low and rough not like this this isnt right for you how could it be more right but her fingers trembled slightly as she unhooked her skirt here with you there are things that need to be said he began i want you she murmured halting his words and his thoughts i want you to touch me the way you touched me before i want i want you to touch me the way youve made me dream of she stepped closer do you not want me any longer not want you he closed his eyes and dragged an unsteady hand through his hair there is no one and nothing ive ever wanted more than i want you at this moment god help me there may never be again then take me here she reached for her laces watching in a kind of dazed wonder as his gaze dipped down and give me something of yourself before you leave me taking his hand she pressed her lips to his palm show me what it is to be loved brigham rena youre leaving tomorrow she said suddenly desperate will you leave me with nothing then he let his fingers trail along her cheek i would not leave at all if the choice were mine but you will go i want to belong to you before you do her shoulders were cool to his touch are you certain aye with a smile she laid his hand on her heart feel how fast it beats always when im close to you youre cold he said unsteadily and pulled her closer theres a plaid on the mare with her eyes closed she drew in his scent as he had with her hair she committed it to memory if we spread it in the sun well be warm enough i wont hurt you he lifted her face and she saw that the intensity was back in his eyes i swear it she trusted him for that trusted him to be gentle it was in his eyes as they spread the plaid on the bank of the lake and knelt upon it it was in his lips as he lowered them to her bare white shoulder it was in his hands as they clasped hers communicating care as much as need she knew what she was about to do what she was about to give him the innocence a woman could give to only one man and only once in her life as they knelt facetoface with the sun warm overhead and the waters cool beside them she knew she hadnt offered the gift on impulse or in the madness of passion but almost quietly with a confidence that it would be accepted with tenderness and remembered she had never looked more beautiful he thought her eyes were brilliant steady her hands didnt tremble as they locked with his but he thought he could almost feel the nervous beating of her heart through his fingertips her cheeks were pale as smooth and white as porcelain he thought of the shepherdess of how he had wanted to touch it as a child but had been afraid lest his hands grow clumsy he brought her hands to his lips he would not be clumsy with serena he kissed her and filled himself with the flavor alone though their time together now would be short he treated the moment as if it could last for hours with slow tortuous nibbles he had her breath quickening his tongue moistened and traced then lured hers into a lazy duel that made her heart swell and thunder in her breast tentatively at first she ran her hands along his coat as if making certain his body was warm and real beneath murmuring something against her mouth he began to shrug out of it her own shyness surprised her she fought it back as she helped him strip it off and as she fumbled with the buttons of his waistcoat he found it almost unbearably arousing to have her inexperienced hands undress him with his eyes closed he traced kisses over her brow her temples her jaw while his body tensed and hardened from the hesitant movements of her fingers it was torture of the most exquisite kind he realized that he was moving slowly not only for serena and her innocence but for himself every instant every heartbeat they shared here would be remembered she tugged off his shirt her gaze skimming down over his bare flesh as delicately as her fingertips did slowly almost afraid her hand might pass through him she reached out to touch they were still kneeling their bodies swaying closer their breath mingling as mouth was drawn to mouth her mind began to whirl as she stroked her hands over him his skin was smooth while the muscles beneath were hard she felt awe as well as excitement wonder as well as nerves who would have thought a man could feel beautiful the sun warmed his skin as it poured over the little patch of ground they had chosen birds trilled in the wood beyond on the far side of the lake deer came quietly to drink as he nuzzled her neck she felt herself go weak she thought she knew what was to follow but the pleasure was more than she had ever dreamed it could be his hands were very sure as they cupped her breasts dragging a moan out of her as the rough material shifted and rubbed over her skin in submission in acceptance in demand her back arched and her head fell back leaving him free to plunder she felt his mouth cover her nipping and sucking through the material the tingling started deep within her stomach and spread until her body seemed alive with nerves then what had gone before vanished from her mind as he peeled the chemise aside and found her flesh she cried out in surprise and pleasure her hands reaching for his shoulders and gripping for balance yet she felt as though she were falling still she shuddered against him strained against him confused delighted desperate for more what she had offered she had offered of her own free will what she gave now she gave without thought without reason when she tumbled back on the blanket she was stripped of defenses and open to whatever commands he might give he had to fight back the first sharpedged need to take it was like a knife turning slowly in his gut her arms were wrapped around him her breasts small and white shivering at each touch he saw that her eyes were clouded not with fear no longer with confusion but with newly awakened passions if he were to take her now as his body begged to she would open for him but the need in his heart beat as strong as the need in his loins he would give her more than she had asked perhaps more than either of them could understand ive dreamed of this serena his voice was low as he bent his head for the next kiss ive dreamed of undressing you like this he slipped the chemise from her now only the breeze and brigham caressed her of touching what no man has touched he skimmed a fingertip up her thigh and watched her mouth tremble open in speechless pleasure brigham i want you and you shall have me my love he circled the rigid point of her breast with his tongue then drew it slowly almost painfully into his mouth before you do there is much much more if she could have spoken again she would have said it was impossible her body seemed sated already sensation rolling over sensation shudder wracked by shudder then he began the eyes that had begun to close flew open in stunned awakening her hips arched up meeting his questing lips just before the first flood of terrifying pleasure poured through her gasping she groped for him only to find her damp palms sliding off his skin as he moved over her lighting fires where he willed the roaring in her ears prevented her from hearing herself call his name again and again but he heard nothing he had heard before or would hear again would ever sound quite so sweet she moved under him bucking twisting trembling as he found and exploited new secrets the dark taste of passion filled his mouth driving him to find more to give more her skin was hot and damp wherever he touched making him mad with thoughts of how she would be when he filled her could she know how weak she made him how completely she satisfied him his mind teemed with thoughts of her memories he knew would follow him until he died each time he took a breath he drew in the scent of her skin sheened now with her passion and his no other woman would ever tempt him again because no other woman would be serena she wanted to beg him to stop she wanted to beg him never to stop each breath she dragged into her lungs seemed to clog there until she feared she would die from lack of air or the surplus of it her eyes filled with tears not from sorrow or regret but from the ache of a beauty so great she knew she could never describe it her strength ebbed and flowed rushing into her like wildfire then pouring out like a waterfall but weak or strong she had never known pleasure so huge in some corner of her brain she wanted to know if he felt the same but each time she began to ask he would touch her again and send her thoughts spinning into a void of sensation when his lips came back to hers she tasted desperation on them wanting to soothe she answered with her heart pulling him close he slipped into her fighting with every fiber of his being to take her gently struggling against every urge to plunge in to his own satisfaction sweat pooled at the base of his spine the muscles in his arms quivered as he braced over her and watched as he had dreamed of watching her face as he made her his she cried out but not in pain perhaps there was pain but it was so smothered in pleasure that she couldnt feel it only him she could feel only him as he moved into her became part of her with her eyes open and focused on his she matched his rhythm slow beautifully gloriously slow the moment when they joined would be savored like the finest of old wines the purest of promises he bent to take her lips again and swallowed her sigh he could feel her pulse around him as clearly as he could feel her hands stroke down his back when he thrust deep inside her she arched and the sigh became a moan now it was she who changed the rhythm and he who followed it no longer mattered who was rider who was ridden as they raced together his last thought as his pleasure burst into her was that he had found home she wasnt certain she would ever move again or that she would ever wish to her skin was cooling now that the heat of passion had faded into a softer glow of contentment they lay tangled in the blanket with the shadows growing long around them his face was buried in her hair his hand cupped loosely at her breast how much time had passed she couldnt be sure she knew the sun was no longer high overhead but there was a timelessness she needed to cling to for just a little longer it was almost possible if she kept her eyes closed and refused to think to believe it would always be like this with the afternoon shimmering around them the woods quiet but for the call of birds it was difficult to believe that politics and war could pull them apart she loved as she had never thought to love in a way she hadnt known was possible if only it could all be as simple as a blanket spread beside the water i love you rena she opened her eyes to see that he was watching her aye i know you do and i love you she traced her fingers along his face as if to memorize it i wish we could stay like this well be like this again soon she shifted away from him to reach for her chemise can you doubt that now it was more important than ever to keep her voice steady she loved him too much much too much to beg him to stay she began to lace up her bodice i know that you love me and that you wish it could be so i know that what we shared here will never be shared with anyone else you dont think ill come back he dragged his shirt on and wondered how any one woman could pull so many emotions from his heart she touched his hand she had no regrets and she needed him to understand that i think if you come back youll come for the sake of the prince its right that you should i see he began to dress methodically so you believe what happened here between us will be forgotten when i reach london no she stopped struggling with her own buttons and leached for him no i believe what happened here will be remembered always when im very old and i feel the first hint of spring ill think of today and of you the anger came quickly making him dig his fingers into her arms do you mink mats enough for me if you do youre either very stupid or mad its all there can be she began but her words slipped down her throat as he shook her when i come back to scotland i come for you make no mistake serena and when this war is over ill take you with me if i had only myself to think of i would go she clutched at his coat willing him to understand cant you see that i would die slowly with the shame to my family no by god i cant see that being my wife would bring your family shame your wife she could barely whisper the words then jerked back as if he had slapped her marriage of course marriage what did you think then he saw and saw clearly just what it was she believed he was asking her his anger turned inward until it was a dull heat in the pit of his stomach is this what you thought i meant the last time we were here he demanded is this what you needed to think through his laugh was quick and humorless you think highly of me serena i because her legs were weak she sank limply onto a rock i thought i understood that men took mistresses and and so they do he said curtly and so i have but only a dimwitted fool would have thought i was offering you anything but my heart and my name how was i supposed to know you meant marriage she sprang up to face him again you never said so ive already spoken with your father his voice was stiff as he snatched up the plaid youve spoken with my father she repeated measuring each word you spoke with my father without ever speaking to me its proper to ask your fathers permission the devil with proper she grabbed the blanket from him you had no right going behind my back to him without ever saying a word to me he took a long look at her tumbled hair at her lips still swollen from his i believe i did more than say a word to you serena she flushed then marched over to toss the blanket over her horse im not so green that i think what has passed here always leads to marriage she might have struggled into the saddle if brigham hadnt whirled her around do you think im in the habit of seducing virgins and then making them my mistresses i dont know your habits then know this he began as the horse danced skittishly aside i intend you for my wife you intend you intend she shoved him away perhaps in england you can bully my lord but here i have some say in my life and i say i wont marry you and you must be mad to think it did you lie when you said you love me he demanded no no but the words were lost as his lips crushed down on hers then you lie when you say you wont be my wife i cant be she said desperately how can i leave here and go with you to england his fingers tensed on her arms so it comes down to that once more you must see you must how it would be she began to speak very fast taking his arms as well willing him to understand i would live there because i loved you because you asked it of me and end by bringing shame on both of us you would hate me before a year had passed im not meant to be an earls wife brigham an english earl he corrected she took the time to draw a deep breath im a lairds daughter its true but im not fool enough to believe thats enough i would hate being trapped in london when i want to ride through the hills you yourself have told me more than once that im not a lady ill never be one i would make a poor wife for the earl of ashburn then you will make a poor one but you will be my wife no she dried her cheeks with her knuckles i will not youll have no choice rena when i go to your father and tell him ive compromised you the tears stopped to be replaced by shock then fury you wouldnt dare i would he said grimly he would kill you brigham only raised a brow beneath them his eyes were dark and growing cold men he had faced in battle would have recognized the look i believe the father is not quite so bloodthirsty as the daughter before she could speak again he lifted her into the saddle if you refuse to marry me because you love me then you will marry me because you are commanded i would rather marry a twoheaded toad he launched himself into his saddle beside her but you will marry me my dear smiling or weeping my journey to london should give you time to think sensibly i will speak with your father and make arrangements when i return after sending him a furious look serena kicked her heels she hoped he broke his neck on the ride to london and when he left the following morning she wept her own broken heart into her pillow chapter ten contents prev next he had missed london the pace of it the look of it the smell of it most of his life had been spent there or at the graceful old manor home of his ancestors in the country he was wellknown in polite society and had no trouble finding company for a game of cards at one of the fashionable clubs or interesting conversation over dinner mothers of marriageable daughters made certain to include the wealthy earl of ashburn on their guest lists he had been six weeks in town and spring was at its best his own garden one of the finest in the city boasted vistas of lush lawns and colorful blossoms the rain that had drummed almost incessantly as april had begun had worked its magic and was now replaced by balmy golden days that lured pretty women in their silk dresses and feathered hats into the parks and shops there were balls and assemblies card parties and levees a man with his title his reputation and his purse could have a comfortable life here with little inconvenience and much pleasure he had indeed missed london it was his home it had taken him much less than six weeks to discover that it was no longer his heart that was in scotland now not a day passed that he didnt think of the hard highland winter or of how serena had warmed it as he looked out at the crowded streets and the strollers in their walking coats and hats of the latest fashion he wondered what spring was like in glenroe and whether serena ever sat by the lake and thought of him he would have gone back weeks earlier but his work for the prince was taking longer than had been thought and the results were less satisfactory than anyone had foreseen the jacobites in england were great in number but the number among them who showed eagerness to raise their sword for the untried prince was much less on lord georges advice brigham had spoken to many groups giving them an outline of the mood of the highland clans and conveying what communications he had received from the prince himself he had ridden as far as manchester and had held a council as close as his own drawing room each was as risky as the other the government was uneasy and the rumor of war with france louder than ever stuart sympathizers would not be suffered gladly and active supporters would be imprisoned at best memories of public executions and deportations were still fresh after six weeks he had the hope but only the hope that if charles could act quickly and begin his campaign his english followers would join him they had so much to lose brigham thought how well he knew it homes lands titles it was a difficult thing to fight for something as distant as a cause when you gambled your name and your fortune as well as your life turning he studied the portrait of his grandmother his decision had already been made perhaps it had been made when he had still been a schoolboy his head on her knee as she wove tales of exiled kings and a fight for justice it was dangerous to tarry much longer in london the government had a way of uncovering rebels and dealing with them with nasty efficiency thus far brighams name had kept him above suspicion but he knew rumors were flying now that war with france was once more inevitable so was talk of a new jacobite uprising brigham had never hidden his travels to france to italy to scotland if anyone decided to shift the blocks of his last few years around they would come up with a very interesting pattern so he must leave brigham thought kicking a smoldering log in the dying fire this time he would go alone and under the cover of night when he returned to london next it would be with serena and they would stand where he stood now and toast the true king and his regent he returned to scotland for the prince as serena had said but he also returned to claim what was his rebellion aside there was one battle he was determined to win hours later as brigham was preparing to leave for a quiet evening at his club his soberfaced butler intercepted him yes beeton your pardon my lord beeton was so old one could almost hear the creak of his bones as he bowed the earl of whitesmouth requests a word with you it seems to be a matter of some urgency then show him up brigham grimaced as parkins fussed over his coat looking for any sign of lint leave off man youll drive me to a fit i only desire my lord to show himself to his best advantage some of the female persuasion would argue that to do that i must strip when parkins remained stonefaced brigham merely sighed youre a singularly humorless fellow parkins god knows why i keep you brig the earl of whitesmouth a small smoothfaced man only a few years brighams senior strode into the room then pulled up short at the sight of the valet it only took a glance to see that whitesmouth was highly agitated that will be all for this evening parkins as if he had all the time in the world brigham crossed to the table by the bedroom fire and poured wine into two glasses he waited until he heard the adjoining door click quietly shut what is it johnny we have trouble brig he accepted the glass and downed the contents in one swallow i surmised as much of what nature steadier for the drink whitesmouth continued that peabrained miltway drank himself into a stupor with his mistress this afternoon and opened his mouth too wide for any of us to be comfortable after taking a long breath brigham sipped and gestured to a chair did he name names we cant be sure but it seems likely he spilled at least a few yours being the most obvious and his mistress shes the redheaded dancer the hair on her heads red whitesmouth stated crudely shes a knowing little package brigham a bit too old and too experienced for a stripling like miltway trouble is the young idiot has more money than brains miltways romantic liaisons were the last of brighams concerns will she keep quiet for a bribe its too late for that thats why ive come shes already passed on some of the information enough that miltways been arrested brigham swore viciously young fool the odds are keen that youll be questioned brigham if you have anything incriminating i am not that young brigham interrupted as he began to think ahead nor such a fool he paused a moment wanting to be certain his decision was made logically and not on impulse and you johnny will you be able to cover yourself i have urgent business on my estate the earl of whitesmouth grinned in fact i have been en route several hours already the prince will do well with men like you whitesmouth poured a second drink and toasted his friend and you im for scotland tonight flight now will show your hand brig are you ready for that im weary of pretense i stand for the prince then ill wish you a safe journey and wait for word from you god willing i shall send it soon he picked up his gloves again i know youve run a risk by coming to tell me when you could have been on your way i shant forget it the prince has my pledge as well whitesmouth reminded him i pray you wont tarry too long only long enough have you told anyone else about miltways indiscretion thats a cool way of putting it whitesmouth muttered i thought it best to come to you directly brigham nodded ill spend a few hours at the club as i had planned and make certain word is passed youd best get out of london before someone notes that you are not indeed en route to your estate on my way whitesmouth picked up his hat one warning brig the electors son cumberland dont take him lightly its true hes young but his eyes are cold and his ambition hot the club held many faces familiar to brigham games were being played bottles already draining he was greeted cheerfully enough and invited to join groups at cards or dice making easy excuses he strolled over to the fire to share a bottle of burgundy with viscount leighton no urge to try your luck tonight ashburn not at cards behind them someone complained bitterly about the fall of the dice its a fair night brigham said mildly one well suited for traveling leighton sipped and though his eyes met brighams they gave away nothing indeed there is always talk of storms to the north i have a feeling there will be a storm here sooner the dice game grew noisier brigham took advantage of the noise to lean forward and pour more wine in the glasses miltway confided his political leanings to his mistress and has been arrested leighton said something unflattering about miltway under his breath then settled back how loose a tongue has he i cant be sure but there are some who should be put on guard leighton toyed with the diamond pinned to the lace at his throat he was fond of such trinkets and was often taken for a man who preferred a soft life like brigham he had made his decision to back the prince coolly and without reservation consider it done my dear do you wish for company on your journey brigham was tempted viscount leighton with his pink waistcoats and perfumed hands might have looked like a selfindulgent fop but there was no one brigham would have chosen over him in a fight not at the moment then shall we drink to fair weather leighton lifted his glass then gave a mildly annoyed glance over brighams shoulder i believe we should patronize another club my dear ashburn this establishment has begun to open its doors to anyone brigham glanced around idly to the game he recognized the man holding the bank and most of the others but there was a thin man leaning on the table a sulky look in his eyes a halffilled glass by his elbow he was not taking his losses in a manner acceptable to polite society dont know him brigham sipped again thinking that he might never again sit cozily by the fire in this club and drink with a friend ive had the dubious pleasure leighton took out a snuffbox an officer i believe hes off to cross swords with the french quite soon which should make the ladies sigh however i am told that he is not in favor with our ladies any longer despite the romantic figure he attempts to cut with a laugh brigham prepared to take his leave perhaps it has something to do with his lack of manners perhaps it has something to do with his treatment of alice beesley when she was unfortunate enough to be his mistress brigham raised a brow but was still only vaguely curious the game was growing louder yet the hour later and he still needed parkins to pack his bag the lovely mrs beesley is a dimwitted piece but from what im told quite amiable standish apparently thought she wasnt amiable enough and took a riding crop to her brighams eyes registered distaste as he glanced over again there is something particularly foul about a man who he trailed off and his fingers tightened on his glass did you say standish i did a colonel i believe he earned a particularly nasty reputation in the porteous scandal in leighton flicked a flake of snuff from his sleeve it seems he quite enjoyed sacking and burning and looting i believe thats why he was promoted he would have been a captain in possibly interest flickered in leightons eyes do you know him after all yes brigham remembered well colls story of captain standish and the rape of his mother the houses burned the defenseless crofters routed and serena he rose and though his eyes were cold there was nothing of his temper in his voice i believe we should become better acquainted i fancy a game after all leighton it grows late ashburn brigham smiled indeed it does nothing was easier than joining the game within twenty minutes he had bought the bank his luck held and as fate or justice would have it so did standishs the colonel continued to lose and egged on by brighams mild disdain he bet heavily by midnight there were only three left in the game brigham signaled for more wine as he sprawled easily in his chair he had deliberately matched drink for drink with standish brigham had no intention of killing a man whose faculties were less sharp than his own the dice appear to dislike you this evening colonel or they like others too well standishs words were blurred by drink and bitterness he was a man who required greater sums of money than his soldiers pay to back his lust for gambling and his equal lust for a place in society tonight his bitterness stemmed from a failure to achieve either his offer for a wellendowed both physically and financially young lady had been turned down only that afternoon standish was certain the bitch beesley had gone whining to whomever would listen shed been a whore he thought as he swilled down more wine a man had a right to treat a whore however he chose get on with it he ordered then counted the fall of brighams dice snatching up the dice box he threw and fell short pity brigham smiled and drank i dont care to have the bank switched so late in the game it spoils the luck yours seemed poor all evening colonel brigham continued to smile but the look in his eyes had driven more than one man away from the game perhaps you consider it unpatriotic that im fleecing a royal dragoon but here we are only men after all did we come to play or to talk standish demanded signaling impatiently for more wine in a gentlemens club brigham replied coloring his words with contempt we do both but then colonel perhaps you dont often find yourself in the company of gentlemen the third player decided the game was a bit too uneasy for his taste several of the other patrons had stopped what they were doing to look and to listen other games were abandoned as men began to loiter around the table standishs face reddened he wasnt certain but he thought he had been insulted i spend most of my time fighting for the king not lounging in clubs of course brigham tossed again and again topped the colonels roll which explains why you are inept at polite games of chance you seem a bit too skilled my lord the dice have fallen for you since you took your seat have they brigham glanced up to raise a brow at leighton who was idly swirling a drink of his own have they indeed you know damn well they have it seems more than luck to me brigham fingered the lace at his throat behind them the club fell into uncomfortable silence does it perhaps youll enlighten me by telling me what it seems to you standish had lost more than he could afford to drunk more than was wise he looked across at brigham and hated him for being what and who he was aristocrats he thought and wanted to spit it was for wastrels like this that soldiers fought and died enlighten everyone break the dice the silence roared into murmurs someone leaned over to tug on brighams sleeve hes drunk ashburn and not worth it are you still smiling brigham leaned forward are you drunk standish i am not he was beyond drunk now as he sat he felt every eye on him staring at him he thought popinjays and fops with their titles and smooth manners they thought him beneath them because he had taken a whip to a whore hed like to take a whip to all of them he thought tossing back the rest of his wine im sober enough to know the dice dont fall for only one man unless theyre meant to brigham waved a hand toward the dice but his eyes were sharp as steel break them by all means there was a rush of protests a flurry of movements brigham ignored both and kept his eyes on standish it pleased him a great deal to see the sweat begin to pearl on the colonels forehead my lord i pray you wont act rashly this isnt necessary the proprietor had brought the hammer as requested but stood casting worried glances from brigham to standish i assure you its quite necessary when the proprietor hesitated brigham whipped his rapier gaze up break them with an unsteady hand the proprietor did as he was bid there was silence again as the hammer smashed down showing the dice to be clean standish only stared at the pieces that lay on the green baize tricked he thought somehow the bastards had tricked him he wished them dead all of them every one of the palefaced softvoiced bastards you seem to be out of wine colonel and brigham tossed the contents of his glass in standishs face standish leaped up wine dripping down his cheeks like blood drink and humiliation had done its work well he would have drawn his sword if others hadnt stepped in to hold his arms brigham never moved from where he sat sprawled in his chair you will meet me sir brigham examined his cuff to be certain none of the wine had spattered it naturally leighton my dear you will stand for me leighton took a pinch of snuff of course just before dawn they stood in a meadow a few minutes ride from the city there was a mist nearly ankle high and the sky was purple and starless as it was caught between night and day leighton let out a weary sigh as he watched brigham turn back his lace you have your reasons i suppose dear boy i have them leighton frowned at the rising sun i trust they are good enough to delay your trip he thought of serena of the look on her face when she had spoken of her mothers rape he thought of fiona with her small slender hands they are the man is a pig of course leighton frowned again this time down at the moisture the dew had transferred to his gleaming boot still it hardly seems reason enough to stand about in a damp field at this hour but if you must you must do you intend to kill him brigham flexed his fingers i do be quick about it ashburn this business has postponed my breakfast so saying he strolled off to confer with standishs second a young officer who was pale with both fear and excitement at the idea of a duel the swords were judged acceptable brigham took one letting his hand mold to the hilt weighing it as though he had a mind to purchase it rather than draw blood standish stood ready even eager the sword was his weapon ashburn wouldnt be the first he had killed with it nor would he be the last though he might standish thought as he remembered the stares and murmurs of the night be the most pleasurable he had no doubt that he would cut down the young prig quickly and ride home in triumph they made their bows eyes locked sword touched sword in salute then the quiet meadow rang with the crash of steel against steel brigham measured his opponent from the first thrust standish was no fool with a sword had obviously been welltrained and had kept himself in fighting trim but his style was a bit too aggressive brigham parried putting serena out of his mind he preferred to fight emotionlessly using that as a weapon as well as his blade the ground was rich with dew and the mist silenced the slide and fall of boots there was only the song of metal slicing over metal as the birds quieted their swords slid from tip to hilt as they came in close their breath mingled like that of lovers through the deadly cross of blades you are handy with a sword colonel brigham said as they drew apart to circle my compliments handy enough to slice your heart ashburn we shall see the blades kissed again once twice three times but i dont suppose you required a sword when you raped lady macgregor puzzlement broke standishs concentration but he managed to block brighams thrust before the sword could run home his brow darkened as he realized he had been led to this duel like a mongrel on a leash one doesnt rape a whore he attacked fueled by a drumming rage what is the scots bitch to you brighams wrist whipped the sword up you shall die wondering they fought in silence now brigham cold as highland ice standish hot with rage and confusion blades hissed and rang competing now with the sound of labored breathing in a daring move standish feinted kissed his sword off brighams sliced in centre ecart a red stain bloomed on brighams shoulder a cooler head might have used the wound to his advantage standish saw only the blood and with the smell of it scented victory he came in hard judging himself moments away from triumph brigham countered thrust after thrust biding his time as the blood dripped down his arm and into the thinning mist he pulled back a fraction an instant laying his chest bare the light of victory came into standishs eyes as he leaped forward to open brighams heart with a bright flash of metal brigham knocked the sword aside moments before it pierced him with a speed leighton would claim later made the blade a blur he twisted and plunged the point into the colonels chest standish was dead before brigham had pulled the point free beside the palefaced soldier leighton examined the body well youve killed him ashburn best be on your way while i deal with the mess my thanks brigham handed leighton the sword hilt first shall i bind up your hurts as well with faint amusement brigham glanced over to his horse beside it the estimable parkins sat on another my valet will see to it serena awoke just before dawn she hadnt slept well for the past week ever since a dream from which she had woken with her heart hammering she had been sure then somehow that brigham was in danger even now the moment of fear haunted her adding to the ache she had lived with since hed left but that was foolish she told herself he was in london safe with a sigh she sat up knowing sleep was impossible he was in london she repeated he might as well have been worlds away for a little while she had allowed herself to believe he would come back as hed said he would then the weeks had passed and she had stopped looking down the path at the sound of horses coll and maggie had been married more than a week it had been at their wedding that serena had finally allowed hope to die if he hadnt come back for colls wedding he wasnt coming back she had known it serena reminded herself as she washed and dressed when she had given herself to him on the banks of the loch she had known it and had sworn there would be no regrets she had known she told herself now as she bound back her hair she had known and she had been given everything she could have wanted except that the afternoon she had spent in brighams arms hadnt made her quicken she had hoped though she had known it mad that she would find herself with brighams child that wasnt to be all she had left were her memories still she had her family her home it helped fill the gaps she was strong enough to live her life without him she might never be truly happy again but she would live and she would be content the morning chores eased her mind and kept it from drifting she worked alone or with the women of her family for them and for the sake of her own pride she kept her spirits up there would be no moping no pining for serena macgregor whenever she was tempted to fall into depression she reminded herself that she had had one golden afternoon it was early evening when she slipped away her mother and maggie were sorting thread and gwen was visiting one of the sick in the village dressed in her breeches she avoided everyone but malcolm whom she bribed with a piece of hard candy she rode for the loch it was an indulgence right or wrong that occasionally she allowed herself whenever time allowed she went there to sit on the bank and dream a little and remember it brought brigham closer to her as close serena knew as he would ever be he was gone back to london where he belonged now spring was here in all its glory flowers waved in the gentle breeze trees were ripe with green green leaves the sunlight dappled through making pretty patterns on the soft path young deer walked through the forest by the loch the ground was springy and warm though the water would be frigid for weeks yet and would carry a chill all through the summer content from the ride she lay on the grassy knoll to read a little and dream it was solitude she had wanted and it was serenity she found from somewhere to the west like mourning came the haunting call of a greenshank dog violets grew pale blue and delicate beside her she plucked a few threading them idly through her hair while she studied the glassy calm of the lake on the rocks above heather grew like purple stars its fragile scent drifted to her farther up the crags had been worn sheer by rain and time there was little that could grow there and to serena their very starkness made them beautiful they were like fortresses guarding the eastern verge of the loch she wished brigham could see this spot this very special spot now when the wind was kind and the water so blue it made your eyes sting pillowing her head on her arm she closed her eyes and dreamed of him it felt as though a butterfly had landed on her cheek dozing serena brushed it lazily away she didnt want to wake not just yet and find herself alone soon enough she would have to go back and give up the hours she had stolen for herself not yet she thought as she curled into her self for just a little while longer she would lie here and dream of what might have been she sighed groggy with sleep as she felt something the butterfly brush over her lips she smiled a little thinking how sweet that was how it warmed her her body stretched against the gentle fingers of the breeze like a lovers hands she thought like brighams her sigh was quiet and drowsily aroused her breasts tingled under it and seemed to fill all along her body her blood seemed to rush to the surface in response her lips parted look at me serena look at me when i kiss you she obeyed automatically her mind still trapped in the dream her body heating from it dazed she saw brighams eyes looking into hers as her mouth was captured in a kiss that was much too urgent much too powerful for any dream my god how ive missed you he dragged her closer every day i swear it every hour could this be real her mind swam as fiercely as her blood as she wrapped her arms tight around him brigham she held on terrified to let go and find him vanished is it really you kiss me again she demanded before he could speak and again and again he did as she asked his hands dragging through her hair streaming down her body until they were both shuddering he wanted to tell her how he had felt when he had stopped his horse and had seen her sleeping sleeping where they had first come together no one had ever looked more beautiful than his serena lying in her mens breeches with her bead pillowed on her arm and flowers scattered in her hair but he couldnt find the words and if he had she would never have let them be spoken her mouth was hungry as it fused to his when he had loved her before she had been fragile a little afraid now she was all passion all demand her fingers pulled and dragged at his clothes as if she couldnt bear to have anything between them though he murmured to her wanting to show some gentleness on this their first meeting in so many long weeks she burned like a fire in his arms unable to resist he tugged the mens clothes aside and found his woman it was as it had been before she thought and more so much more his hands and mouth were everywhere torturing delighting her skin was covered with a moist sheen and nothing else as he pleasured both of them whatever shyness she had felt when she had first given herself to him was eclipsed now by a need so sharp so desperate that she touched and tasted in places that made him gasp in amazement and passion she drew him down to her reveling in the scent of him in some way the same as it had been on their very first meeting sweat horse blood it spun in her head touching off primitive urges the darkest desires name of god rena he could barely speak she was taking him places he had never been places he had never known existed no other woman had mastered him in this way not the most experienced french courtesan not the most worldly british flower he was learning from the scots wildcat more of love and lust than he had thought possible the blood was hammering in his brain there was pain exquisite terrifying pain the control with which he lived his life with which he raised a sword or fired a pistol was gone as if it had never existed he dragged her against him his fingers raking through her hair bruising her soft flesh now for pitys sake he plunged into her going deep her nails dug into his back as she cried out but she was moving with him driving her hips up to meet each thrust with her head thrown back she gasped for air in some part of her brain she knew this was something like dying then there was no thought at all though her eyes flew open she saw nothing nothing but a white flash as her body went rigid the aftershocks of pleasure wracked her body even as her hands fell limply to the ground her vision was misted it seemed only more of the dream but brigham lay warm and solid over her and he was he was trembling she realized with a kind of wonder it was not only she who was left weak and vulnerable but he as well you came back she murmured and found the strength to lift her hand to his hair i said i would he shifted to kiss her again but softly now i love you serena nothing could have stopped me from coming back to you she framed his face with her hands to study it he meant it she realized seeing the truth only made her more uncertain of what to do you were gone so long no word sending word would have put too many at risk the storms coming rena aye and youll she broke off as she noted blood on her fingers brig youre hurt she scrambled up to her knees to fret over the soaked bandage on his shoulder what happened you were attacked campbells no he had to laugh at the way she snarled the rival clans name a little business in london before i left its nothing serena but she was already ripping the cuff from his shirt to make a fresh bandage brigham sighed knowing parkins would make him pay but he sat meekly and let her tend his wound a sword she said a scratch we wont talk of it now the suns going down oh she blinked noting for the first time how much time had passed i have to go back how did you find me here i could say i followed my heart which i would have but malcolm told me youd ridden out a few flowers clung yet to her hair and her hair was all that covered her breasts she looked like a witch or a queen or a goddess he could only be certain that she was all he needed he grabbed her hands the intensity was back in his eyes dark demanding tell me rena i love you brigham she brought his hand to her cheek more man i can say and youll many me when her eyes dropped from his he erupted damn it woman you say you love me you all but kill me with passion then you go skittish when i speak of making you my wife i have told you i cannot i have told you you will he picked up his ruined shirt and slipped it gingerly over his shoulder which was just beginning to ache i shall speak with your father no her head shot up quickly trying to think she pushed the hair back from her face how could they have come so far and be back where they had begun i beg you not to what choice do you leave me he pulled her shirt down over her head struggling for patience when she jerked away from him to dress herself i love you rena and i have no intention of living my life without you then ill ask for time she looked at him then and knew she had to resolve what was in her heart and what was in her head there is so much to be done brigham so much that will be happening around us to us when the war begins youll go and i shall only wait give me time give us both time to deal with what has to be only so much serena and only because in the end ill leave you no choice chapter eleven contents prev next serena was right things were happening around them that would shape the destiny not only of two lovers but of the whole of scotland within days of brighams arrival at glenroe the french dealt the english a crushing defeat at fontenoy though charless and many of the jacobites hopes rose with it louis of france still withheld his support from the rebellion charles had hoped to ride on the glory that surrounded the french victory to gain muchneeded impetus for his cause once again however he was left to his own devices but this time he moved brigham was both confidant and informer he knew to the day when charles with money raised by the pawning of his mothers rubies fitted out the frigate doutelle and a ship of the line the elizabeth while the push in the highlands and in england went on for support charles edward the bonnie prince set sail from nantes for scotland and his destiny it was high summer when word came that the prince was on his way the elizabeth with its store of men and weapons was chased back to port by british pursuers but the doutelle with charles aboard sailed on towards the scottish coast where preparations were being made to greet him my father says i cannot go malcolm sulking in the stables frowned up at brigham hes says im too young but im not the boy had just passed his eleventh birthday brigham thought but prudently held back from mentioning it coll goes as do i i know malcolm glared at the toe of his grubby boot and thought it the height of injustice because im the youngest im treated like a bairn would your father trust his home and his family to a bairn brigham asked gently when your father leaves with his men there will be no macgregor in macgregor house but for you who will protect the women if you ride with us serena he said easily and he spoke no less than the truth would you leave your sister alone to protect the family name and honor the boy moved a shoulder but began to think on it she is a better shot with a pistol than i or coll really though he wouldnt like to say so this news brought brighams brow up but im better with a bow she will need you he dropped a hand on malcolms tousled hair we will all need you with you here we neednt worry that the women are safe because he was still young enough to know what it was to be a boy he sat on the mound of hay beside malcolm i can tell you this malcolm a man never goes easily to war but he goes with a lighter heart if he knows his women are protected i wont let harm come to them idly malcolm fingered the dagger at his belt for a moment brigham thought he looked too much a man i know as your father knows if the time comes when glenroe is no longer safe you will take them up into the hills aye the idea made malcolm brighten a bit ill see that they have food and shelter especially maggie why especially maggie because of the bairn his fingers slid away from his dagger shes to have one you know for a moment brigham only stared then with a laugh he shook his head no i didnt how do you i heard mrs drummond say so she said maggies not sure shes increasing yet but mrs drummond was sure and thered be a new wee bairn by next spring keep your ear to the ground do you my lad aye this time malcolm grinned i know gwen and maggie are always talking about how youll be marrying serena will you be marrying her brig i will he ruffled the boys hair but she doesnt know it yet then youll be a macgregor to an extent serena will be a langston a langston will she like it brighams eyes lost their amusement shell grow used to it now if youve a mind to take that ride wed best be off always cheered by the idea of his horses malcolm jumped up did you know that parkins is courting mrs drummond good god brigham stopped in the act of leading out his horse and turned to the boy someone should plug those ears of yours malcolm only laughed and brigham unable to do otherwise put a hand on the boys shoulder again is he really brought her flowers yesterday sweet jesus from the window of the parlor she was supposed to be dusting serena watched them ride off how wonderful he looked so tall so straight she leaned out the window so that she could watch him until he was out of sight he wouldnt wait much longer those had been his words the hut time they had stolen an hour together by the loch he wanted her wedded and properly bedded he wanted to make her lady ashburn of ashburn manor lady ashburn of london society the idea was nothing less than terrifying she looked down at herself now at her dress of pale blue homespun and at the dusty apron that covered it her feet were bare something fiona would have sighed over lady ashburn would never run over the moors or through the forest in bare feet lady ashburn would probably never run her hands serena turned them this way and that examining the backs and the palms critically they were smooth enough she supposed because her mother insisted she rub lotion into them every night but they werent ladys hands any more than hers was a ladys heart but god she loved him she understood now that the heart could indeed speak louder than the head english or not she would be his she had even come to know that she would leave her beloved scotland behind for his england rather than live without him and yet how could she marry a man who deserved the finest of ladies even her mother had thrown up her hands at serenas attempts to learn the spinet she couldnt do fancy work with her needle only the most basic stitches she could run a home to be sure but she knew from coll that brighams house in london and his manor in the country were a far cry from what she was used to she would make a mess of it but even that she could almost bear it was knowing how poorly she had dealt with her one brush with society the brief months she had spent in the convent school she had nothing to say to the kind of women who spent their days shopping for the right shade of ribbon and making social calls a few weeks of that life and she would go notsoquietly mad and once she had brigham would hate her we cant change what we are she thought brigham could no more stay here in the highlands and live her life than she could go with him to england and live his and yet she had begun to see that living without him would be no life at all serena she turned quickly to see her mother in the doorway im nearly done she said flourishing her dusting cloth again i was daydreaming fiona shut the doors at her back sit down serena fiona used that quiet but concerned tone of voice rarely usually it meant that she was worried or annoyed as serena moved to comply she searched her mind for any infraction true shed been wearing the breeches a bit too freely on her rides but her mother usually overlooked that she had torn the skirt of the new gray dress but gwen had mended it so that it hardly showed at all serena sat pulling the cloth between her fingers have i done something to upset you youre troubled fiona began i had thought it was because brigham had gone and you were missing him but hes been back for several weeks now and youre troubled still serena tucked her bare feet under the hem of her skirt as her fingers knotted and unknotted the cloth im not troubled really its only that im thinking about what will happen after the prince comes that was true fiona thought but not all the truth there was a time you would talk to me serena i dont know what to say gently fiona laid a hand on hers whats in your heart i love him serena slid to the floor to lay her head in her mothers lap mama i love him and it hurts so terribly i know it does my darling she stroked serenas hair and felt the pang in her own heart that only a mother understands to love a man is great misery and great joy why there was passion in serenas eyes and voice as she lifted her face why must it bring misery fiona gave a little sigh and wished there could be a simple answer because once the heart opens it feels everything i didnt want to love him serena murmured now i can do nothing else and he loves you aye she closed her eyes comforted by the familiar scent of lavender in the folds of her mothers skirts i dont think he wanted to either you know he has asked your father for your hand aye and that your father after long thought and consideration has given his consent this she hadnt known serena lifted her head and her cheeks were pale but i cant many him dont you see i cant with a frown in her eyes fiona caught serenas face in her hands from what source did this fear written so plainly on her daughters face spring no i dont see rena you know well your father would never force you to marry a man you didnt want but did you not just tell me you loved brigham and that your love is returned i do love him too much to marry him too much not to oh mama how much i would give him frightens me fiona saw a bit clearer now and she smiled poor wee lamb youre not the first to have these fears nor will you be the last i understand when you say you love him too much not to marry him but how can you love him too much to marry him i dont want to be lady ashburn fiona blinked surprised by the vehemence in her daughters words because hes english aye no no because i dont want to be a countess its a good family an honorable one its the title mama even the sound of it frightens me lady ashburn would live in england grandly she would know how to dress fashionably how to behave with dignity how to serve beautiful dinners and laugh at the cleverest wits well i never thought to see the day that ian macgregors wildcat cowered in a corner and whined the color rose sharply in serenas cheeks i am afraid ill admit it she rose locking her fingers tightly together but im not only afraid for my own sake i would go i would try i would be determined to be the kind of wife brigham needs to be the best lady ashburn ever to rule in ashburn manor and i would hate it never to be free never to have a moment with the space to breathe but theres more she paused a moment wanting to choose her words so that she would be understood if brigham loves me he loves me as i am would he love the woman i would have to become to be his wife fiona was silent for a long moment the girl had surely become a woman with a womans mind a womans heart and a womans fears youve given this a great deal of thought ive hardly thought of anything else for weeks he will have his way of that im sure but ive come to wonder if we might not both be sorry for it think of this if he loves you for yourself then he would not want you to pretend to be what you are not nor would he ask you to i would rather lose him than shame him i could tell you you will do neither fiona said wearily as she rose but you must learn it for yourself but i want to tell you one more thing now it was fiona who linked her hands together theres been gossip in the kitchen her mouth twitched lightly at serenas expression aye parkins and mrs drummond i chanced to overhear while working in the kitchen garden aye mother serena managed barely able to smother a giggle the idea of her mother eavesdropping on the valet and the cook was almost too ludicrous it seems on the morning he left london brigham fought a duel with an officer of the government army an officer called standish at this all humor drained from serenas face along with all her color brigham she remembered the wound on his shoulder the one he had steadfastly refused to discuss standish she said in a whisper as the name came home she saw him as she had seen him almost ten years before bringing his hand against her mothers face dear god how did it happen why did it happen i know only that the duel was fought and standish is dead god help me im glad of it the man you love avenged my honor and i will never forget it nor will i serena murmured she went to him that night the hour was late the house quiet after pushing open his door she saw him with the moonlight and the candlelight tangled around him while he sat at the desk by the window penning a letter the air coming through the open window was hot and still so he had stripped to his breeches leaving his shirt hung casually over the back of the chair it was only an instant before he glanced up and saw her only an instant that she could look at him unobserved but the instant flashed into her mind and was seated there to make a memory as precious as a kiss the light fell over his skin making her think of the marble statues coll had described from his trip to italy statues of gods and warriors his hair thick and dark was tied back from his face and mussed a bit as though he had worried it with his hand his eyes were dark as well holding a combination she recognized as concentration and concern her heart began to dance in her breast as she stood in the doorway this was the man she loved a man of action and loyalty a man both reckless and deliberate a man of arrogance and of compassion a man of honor he looked up and saw her in the woods beyond an owl hooted the sound rising on the air and fading like a ghost he set the quill down and rose even as she shut the door at her back the movement stirred the air and sent the flame and its shadow wavering serena i needed to see you alone he released a difficult knot of bream it took great care and great restraint not to cross to her and gather her up she wore only a thin white linen nightdress and had left her hair unbound to fall in a wild mass over her shoulders and down her back you should not have come here like this i know she moistened her lips i tried to sleep but couldnt you are leaving tomorrow yes the intensity in his eyes softened as did his voice my love do i have to tell you again that ill come back tears threatened but she willed them away she would not leave him with the image of a weak weeping woman no but i have a need to tell you that i will wait and i would be proud to be your wife when you come back to me for a moment he said nothing only stared as if trying to read her face and be certain he had not misheard her she stood her hands folded but she wasnt meek her eyes held fire her chin was up now he crossed to her to take one of her hands in his has your father commanded you no the decision is mine only mine it was the answer he wanted the one he had hoped for gently he brushed his lips over her knuckles i will make you happy rena on my honor i will be the wife you need somehow she thought within her heart i swear it he bent to kiss her brow you are the wife i need my love and the woman stepping back he drew the emerald from his finger this ring has been worn by a langston for more than a hundred years i ask you to keep it for me until i return and give you another he slipped it onto her finger serena curled her hand automatically to keep it there i shall give you another ring as soon as god allows and my name as well oh brigham be safe she threw herself into his arms it was harder much harder to fight these tears than any others she had known if i lost you now i couldnt bear to live know that if you bleed i bleed and take care whats this with a light laugh he caressed her hair but it was difficult to ignore the press of her thinly clad body against his never say you worry about me rena i will say it she murmured against his shoulder if you allow yourself to be killed i shall hate you forever then i will take great care to stay alive go now before you make me feel too much alive she gave a weak laugh i fear i have done that already my lord she shifted wantonly to prove there were no secrets between them she had only to rise to her toes to fit herself unerringly against him desire to desire does being near me do that to you all too often his own laugh was strained as he fought off the drugging power of her scent of her shape im glad she lifted her head to look up at him and her smile was wicked very glad she made him laugh again youve flowered in front of my eyes rena under my hands he kissed her gently though her lips tempted him i wonder if there is a more precious gift a woman can give a man i would give you another tonight she drew his head down to hers her kiss was not so gentle with it she felt his body tense i would share your bed brig your love and your sleep no she murmured against his lips before he could speak dont tell me why it should not be only show me why it must she dragged her hands up his back to tangle her fingers in his hair while her lips moved restlessly on his love me brigham love me so that i can live on it in all the empty days to come he couldnt deny her he could no longer deny himself her body trembled against his no longer from fear no longer from doubt but only from need with a muffled oath he swept her into his arms he would be leaving at dawn between then and now he could give her give them a few perfect hours her body was fluid in his arms cool soft languid her eyes were as rich as hot as the flash of emerald that had passed from his finger to hers she kept her arms around his neck as he lowered her to the bed so that he came down with her then with his hands braced on either side of her head he began to make love to her face with his mouth alone she thought she could float away on this kind of sweetness it was like a cloud delicate and dreamy her body felt light and free as her lips met his again and again in a slow luxurious dance another minuet she thought elegant harmonious and beautiful with a sigh she felt him slip the nightdress from her then heard his quick intake of breath as he discovered for himself that she wore nothing beneath it you are so lovely he touched his lips to the pulse of her throat here he murmured as his fingertips brushed her breasts here and again as his light clever hands moved over her here giddiness speared through the languor giddiness and delight is that why you fell in love with me sassenach for my body he drew himself up far enough for a long lazy study it was a great influence flushed she laughed and pinched him then her laughter turned into a moan as he dipped his head and streaked his tongue over a hardening nipple i love all of you serena your temper your mind your heart and oh yes his teeth closed teasingly over the peak your body show me she demanded breathlessly he showed her with tenderness with ardor with restraint and with desperation every emotion they had shared became part of that endless night of loving there were new ways he guided her delighted by the eagerness with which she learned the passion with which she gave and received there was no shyness in her she came to him with a trust so complete that that alone nearly dragged him over the edge skin grew slick in the airless night not a breeze stirred through the window high above the bills thunder rumbled closer in the forest the owl hunted its scream of triumph melded with the scream of its prey the candle flickered and guttered out they were aware of nothing but each other nothing but the world they made on the soft mattress she made him weak and then she made him strong she made him laugh and then she made him groan he was breathless sated then as eager to devour her as a man starving in the deepest part of the night they slept briefly only to wake with the need spiraling high once more there was no part of her he couldnt make ache or tremble she could only hear her skin sing as he touched her body grew heavy with pleasure as it built and built to roll through her like the thunder in the distant bills then she was light weightless agilely skimming over him like a fantasy energy poured through her molten she rose over him her hair silvered with dying moontight her skin sheened with damp her face pate with an exhaustion she had yet to feel she took him into her arching her back as pleasure raced through her like delirium the fever of it boiled under her skin until her hips moved like lightning his name sobbed through her lips as she drove them both higher lost she dragged her hands up her body over her trembling stomach up to her breasts then down again until they met his at last she slid bonelessly down her breath shuddering out to lie in his arms i wonder she said when she could speak again if it is always like this it makes me see how one might kill for love for love he shifted so that he could hold her yet closer it is not always like this for me it has only been like this with you she turned her head so that she could see his face the light was nearly gone in that hour before day begins to break through truly he brought their joined hands to his lips truly she smiled a little pleased if you take a mistress after we wed i will kill her then you but i will kill you more horribly he laughed then took a quick bite at her lower lip well i believe it even if i were tempted you leave me too exhausted for a mistress if i believed you were too tempted i would leave you inadequate for a mistress she slid a hand up his thigh meaningfully he started to laugh again but her bland expression had him lifting a brow by god i think you would should i remind you that your pleasure would be ah cut off as well the sacrifice would be great she trailed her fingers over him delighted when he shuddered the satisfaction is greater perhaps i should think twice about taking a jealous hellcat to wife the humor fled from her eyes you should but i have come to know you will not no there is only one woman for me he kissed her again before shifting her comfortably into the crook of his arm one day i will take you to ashburn manor and show you what is mine what is ours what shall be our childrens its beautiful rena graceful timeless already i can picture you in the bed where i was born she started to protest but her fingers grazed over the pucker of skin on his shoulder where his wound was still healing then our first child will be born there she turned her face into his throat oh brigham i want your child inside me soon stunned and deeply moved he lifted her face to his again my god you humble me we shall have a dozen children if you like be they all as badtempered as their mother that made her smile again or as arrogant as their father she relaxed against him again their time was nearly at an end already she could sense a faint lessening of the darkness there had been a time for loving now was the time for truths brigham there is something i need to ask you at this moment you could ask me anything why did you fight the english soldier the one called standish the surprise came first then the quick realization that parkins and mrs drummond gossiped as well as courted it was a matter of honor he accused me of using weighted dice she said nothing for a moment then braced herself on her elbow to watch his face why do you lie to me i dont lie he lost lost more then decided there must have been a reason for it other than his lack of luck are you telling me you didnt know who he was what he was to me i knew who he was he had hoped to keep the matter to himself since that was not to be he decided to make his explanations quickly and be done with it one might say i encouraged him to make an accusation so that a duel would be fought her eyes were very intense why it was also a matter of honor serena closed her eyes then lifting his sword hand she kissed it almost reverently thank you thanks are not necessary for killing a vicious dog but he tensed even as she held his hand against her cheek you knew of this is that why you came to me tonight why you agreed to be my wife aye when he started to pull away she held him only tighter dont let me say it all it wasnt for gratitude that i came though i am grateful it wasnt for obligation though i owe you a debt that can never be paid you owe me nothing everything she said passionately when i dream now of that night when i see my mothers eyes after he had done with her when i hear in my mind the way she wept i will know that he is dead and that he died by your hand knowing that there is nothing i would deny you i didnt kill him for your gratitude or to put you under obligation his voice was stiff i want you as my wife serena intend to have you but not because you feel you owe a debt i know that she knelt beside him and putting her arms around him buried her face in his neck did i not tell you already that i come to you willingly can you doubt it after what weve shared she pressed her lips against his skin then skimmed them up to his when i was told of the duel of his death i was glad afraid confused tonight i lay in bed and it all came so clear it was not your fight my love not your family not your mother but you made it so he might have killed you you have a poor opinion of my skill with a sword shaking her head she drew back a little he could see by her face that she would not be put off lightly i bound your wound your blood was on my hand as my mothers was that night so many years ago she held it palm out you bled for my family i will remember that until the day i die i loved you before brigham i had already accepted i would love no other but tonight i came to see that you had honored my family as a man honors his own i shall honor yours if youll let me he took the hand she held out to him and turned it over so that the emerald lay dark upon her finger i leave you with my heart serena when i return ill give you my name as well she opened her arms to him for tonight give me your love once more chapter twelve contents prev next prince charles set his royal feet on the thin soil of scotland in high summer but not as he and many others had hoped in triumph he was advised by macdonald of boisdale as he landed on the island of eriskay to go home his reply was terse and telling i am come home from eriskay he and the seven men who had sailed with him traveled to the mainland there too the jacobites were filled more with concern than enthusiasm support was slow in coming but charles sent out letters to the highland chiefs cameron of lochiel was among them and though his support was given reluctantly and perhaps with a heavy heart it was given so it passed that on august in the year before some nine hundred loyal men the standard was raised at glenfinnan charless father was proclaimed james viii of scotland and james iii of england with the young prince as regent the small force moved eastward gathering strength the clans rallied words were pledged and men bade goodbye to their women and joined the march brighams journeys through scotland with ian and with coll had given him a knowledge of the land they were able to make good time ironically enough on one of the roads built to discourage highland rebellion using this and the rugged hills for cover they avoided the government garrisons at fort william and fort augustus spirits were high the men as rough and ready as their land it had only taken as brigham had always imagined the energy and force of the young prince to bind them together when men thought of the battles ahead they thought not of their mortality but of victory and of a justice that had been denied them too long some were young brigham saw the future in their eager faces in the way they laughed and looked at the prince who wore the dress of the highlands and had fastened a white cockade the symbol of his house on his blue bonnet some were old and there the past could be seen the ageless pride the battles already lost and won they looked to the prince with his fresh stuart blood as the glue that would hold the clans together but old or young eager or heavyhearted charles swept them along by the force of his personality alone this was his time and his place he meant to make his mark the weather held fine the breezes warm it was said by some that god himself had blessed the rebellion for a time it seemed so the men and weapons that had been lost to the jacobites when the elizabeth had turned back were forgotten peat was plentiful for fires and the water was fresh from icy mountain streams the pipes were played whiskey was drunk and by night the men slept the good sleep men do when they begin an adventure it was to brigham that word came that a government army had been dispatched north headed by general sir john cope brigham took the news directly to the prince as the men broke camp and prepared for the days march brigham watched the full almost girlish mouth curve up into a smile that was very much a mans so we shall fight at last it appears so your highness the morning was warm with the soft watery light of scotland gaming strength the camp carried the scent of horses and soldiers and smoke the rugged hills were softened now by a springy spread of heather a golden eagle early to the hunt crested overhead it seems a good day to fight charles murmured as he studied brighams face you would prefer we had lord george with us lord george is an excellent field commander your highness indeed but we have osullivan charles gestured toward the irish soldier of fortune who was organizing the men for the days journey brigham already had doubts in that quarter he didnt question the irishmans loyalty to the prince but he felt there was more flash than caution if we are engaged we shall fight i look forward to it charles fingered the hilt of his sword as he gazed around him he felt something for this land something deep and true when he was king he would see that scotland and her people were rewarded its been a long journey brigham a far distance from louiss court and all those pretty faces a long journey your highness brigham agreed but one well worth the making i should tell you that there were tears on some of those pretty faces when you left have you taken time to break hearts in scotland as well there is only one face for me now sire and one heart i will take great care not to break the princes dark eyes were alight with amusement well well it appears the dashing lord ashburn has fallen for a highland lassie tell me mon ami is she as pretty as the luscious annemarie brigham managed a wry grin i would beg your highness to make no comparisons particularly in front of the highland lassie she has a rare temper does she with a delighted laugh charles signaled for his mount i am most anxious to meet her and see what manner of woman snared the most soughtafter man at the french court the pipes sounded along the road but copes troops were never seen word came that he had detoured to inverness the road to edinburgh lay open to the rebels three thousand strong they captured perth after a short vicious battle victorious they continued their drive south engaging and routing two regiments of dragoons the fighting seemed to fuel the rebels here at last was action instead of talk deeds instead of plans with sword and pipe shield and ax they were like a fury survivors would spread tales of their maniacal skill and daring that themselves would serve as a weapon joined by lord george murray at perth they entered edinburgh and took it for their own the city was in a panic news of the invasion had preceded the highland forces and rumors flew about barbarians cannibals and butchers the city guard had fled and while edinburgh slept a party of camerons rushed the sentries and control was gained under the princes command there was no looting no pillaging the people of edinburgh were given justice and compassion as was due the subjects of the true king it was only a month after the standard had been raised at glenfinnan and james had been proclaimed king and his son and regent was preparing to open a royal court at holyrood house coll was beside brigham when the prince rode his gray gelding into holyrood park a crowd had gathered to watch him shouts and cheers followed them for the people saw their hearts delight in the young man in his tartan shortcoat and blue bonnet perhaps he was not yet englands prince but he was theirs listen to them coll leaned forward in the saddle and grinned here is our first real victory brigham and by god it has a good feel brigham steadied his mount as he maneuvered through the narrow crowded streets ill swear he could drive them to london now with only a word i can only hope the supplies and men we need will arrive before it comes time we could be outnumbered ten to one today and never taste defeat it would be as it was at perth and aye at coltbridge the earlyautumn breeze drifted making coll grimace but in gods name this place is filthy give me the open highlands and the hills how does a man breathe he wondered without the room to draw air edinburgh was packed with houses and shops some still fashioned of mud and wood the stone buildings rose high like aeries with the fronts four or five stories high and the backs often stretching nine or ten stories down the perilously steep hills worse than paris brigham agreed the stench drifted out from crowded lanes and waste and garbage clogged the alleys but the people cheering the prince seemed oblivious to it all above the slums the filth of the alleys and the dirt of the streets was the royal mile edinburgh castle majestic already glamorous with age and history guarded one end of that great street where its slope ended was holyrood house where palace and abbey stood together elegantly poised before the rough crags it had already been the scene time after time of turbulence and passion mary queen of scots had been its most famous and doomed inhabitant she had lived there marrying her cousin henry stewart of darnley in holyrood abbey and seeing her lover rizzio murdered by him in the little supper room of her apartments her son james had been born in the castle and had survived a troubled and turbulent boyhood to become king of england as well as scotland it was here at this site of pomp and intrigue that jamess greatgreat grandson charles would hold his court bringing holyrood house to life once more he rode toward the palace that had once housed his ancestors dismounting he walked slowly under the archway to appear moments later in the window of his new apartments waving to the shouts of the crowd edinburgh held the prince and he held edinburgh he was to prove this only days later when cope moved his troops south primed even eager the jacobites met the government army east of the city at prestonpans redcoated dragoons faced the highlanders who were dressed for battle in kilts or closefitting trews brigham with a leather shield in one hand and his sword in the other joined the macgregors for a moment the field was eerily silent with only the hollow sound of the pipes rising into the misty air like the heartbeats of men brigham thought men who were willing to die opposing standards waved caught by the early breeze the first charge sent birds wheeling and screaming up the sky men on foot met with a thunderous crash of sword and ax here as they had on the route south the scots fought like demons hacking with blades pressing on even when bloody as had happened before the english infantry couldnt withstand the violence of the highland charge the red line wavered and broke the cavalry surged forward vicious hooves striking claymores glinting brigham ignored the cries and curses around him as he met his man a shot rang whistling past his ear but his eyes never lost their icy determination the campbell on the road from london would have recognized it brigham was a man who was willing to die but confident he would not smoke from cannon and mortar grew thick so that men on both sides fought in a fog the heat of battle set sweat pouring as freely as blood so that the stench of both stung the air already carrion birds circled overhead lured by the battle sounds as brigham maneuvered his mount through what was left of the english lines he could see the white cockades of the jacobites and the plaids of macgregors macdonalds camerons some fell around him victims of bayonets or swords again and again the ground exploded where mortars struck flinging out rock and dirt and deadly metal men screamed as they were struck down others died in silence within ten minutes the battle was over dragoons sought safety in flight and raced to the concealing hills on horse or on foot blood streaked the thin grass and stained the gray rock the bodies of the dead and wounded lay sprawled on the ground that day the pipes played in victory and the standard of the house of stuart was held high why do we stay snug in edinburgh when we should be marching toward london coll demanded as he strode out into the courtyard at holyrood a plaid wrapped around his shoulders to ward off the chilly dusk for once brigham could only agree with colls impatience to be doing they had been nearly three weeks at charless newly established court the court itself was very glamorous with levees and councils in the palace but the prince had not forgotten his men and so divided his time between holyrood and the camp at duddingston morale was good though there was more than one man among them who would have agreed with colls sentiments balls and receptions could wait victory at prestonpans earned us more support brigham flicked his cloak back welcoming the damp evening air i doubt we tarry here much longer councils coll grumbled every blessed day we have another council if theres a problem here my lad its between lord george and osullivan ill swear if one says black the other before god will vow it to be white i know it was a matter that caused brigham no little concern ill tell you true coll osullivan worries me i prefer a commander a bit steadier one who is less interested in routs than in overall victory we can have neither if we dally here in court brigham smiled but he was looking out into the lowering night you miss your highlands coll and your wife aye its been barely two months since we left glenroe but we had little time together with the bairn coming i worry a mans entitled to worry about the ones he loves theres many a man with us who knows once the march south begins it could be a year before we see our homes and families again because he had no wish to fall into a black mood coll slapped brigham on the shoulder at least theres plenty here for you to enjoy the women are bonny i wonder that you dont pick out a wench to charm id swear youve broken a dozen hearts with your indifference these past few weeks you could say ive something on my mind someone brigham thought the only one what do you say we crack a bottle and find a game he turned at colls nod of assent and together they started back across the courtyard brigham noticed the woman step through the shadowy archway but his gaze skimmed over her and passed without interest he had taken only three steps when he stopped turning slowly deliberately to stare the light was fading quickly and he could see only that she was tall and very slender a plaid was draped over her head and shoulders she might have been a servant or one of the ladies of the court taking the air he wondered why a stranger should remind him so achingly of his porcelain shepherdess and though he couldnt see her face he was certain she was staring at him as intently as he stared at her the leap of attraction was unexpected annoyed with himself brigham turned again and continued on inexplicably he was compelled to stop to turn yet again she was still there standing in the fading light her hands folded her head held high what the devils wrong with you coll stopped and turned himself spotting the figure in the archway he grinned well if thats all i dont suppose youll want to dice with me now no i brigham let his words trail off as the woman lifted her hands to slip the plaid from her head the last of the light fell over her hair like sunset it gleamed serena he could only stare she took a step toward him and he saw her face and that she was smiling his boots rang against stone as he strode across the courtyard before she could say his name he swept her up into his arms then around and around in dizzying circles so thats the way of it coll murmured as he watched his friend drag his sister close for a long bruising kiss why are you here how did you come then brigham kissed her again and swallowed her answer give way man coll plucked serena from brighams arms kissed her hard then set her on her feet what are you doing in edinburgh and wheres maggie shes here breathless serena found herself swung back against brighams side and mother and gwen and malcolm as well she reached out to give colls beard a sisterly tug the prince invited us to court we arrived almost an hour ago but didnt know where to find you maggies here is she well where is she with his usual impatience coll turned on his heel and strode off to see for himself brigham say nothing he combed his hands through her hair delighted with the feel of it the scent of it say nothing he repeated and lowered his head he held her like that mouth to mouth body to body while the shadows deepened the weeks of separation melted away restless his hands moved down her back over her hips up to her face while his lips heated with desire had her moaning and straining against him beautiful always more beautiful serena a man could die from missing you i thought of you every day and prayed when we heard of the battles i nearly went mad waiting for your letters telling me you were safe at last she drew away to look at him because he and coll had ridden in from camp he had yet to change to his court dress with some relief serena noted that he was the same man who had ridden away from glenroe nearly three months before i was afraid youd change somehow being here she moistened her lips as she looked back toward the buildings nothing she had ever seen was more magnificent than the palace with its towers and steeples with lights flickering behind its tall windows everything here is so splendid the palace the abbey wherever i am nothing changes between us rena she moved back into his arms to rest her head on his shoulder i was afraid it would i prayed every day for you to be safe and i prayed every day that you wouldnt seek comfort in the arms of another woman he laughed and kissed her hair i shant ask which you prayed for with more fervor my love there is no one else can be no one else tonight i shall find more than comfort in your arms she smiled as she turned her lips to his cheek would that we could in truth next to finding you safe my dearest desire was to spend a night loving you then i shall see to it that you have both your desires she kissed him again and chuckled im to share a chamber with gwen it would be as unseemly my lord for you to come to my bed as it would for me to search the corridors for yours tonight you share my chamber as my wife her mouth opened in surprise as she stepped out of his arms thats impossible it is very possible he corrected and it shall be without giving her a chance to speak he pulled her through the archway the prince was in his apartments preparing for that evenings entertainment though brighams request for an audience at that hour surprised him he granted it your highness brigham bowed as he entered charless sitting room good evening brigham madam he said as serena sank into a curtsy she would kill brigham she thought for dragging her before the prince without even a chance to wash off the travel dirt or take a comb to her hair you would be miss macgregor charles drew serena to her feet and kissed her hand it is easy to see why lord ashburn no longer notices the ladies at court your highness it was good of you to allow me and my family to come i owe the macgregors a great deal they have stood behind my father and behind me such loyalty is priceless will you sit he led her to a chair himself she had never seen a room like this one the high ceiling was festooned with swirls and clusters of fruits and flowers and from its center hung a dripping chandelier murals ran along the walls depicting stuart victories in battle a fire crackled in me hearth beside her chair music lay open on a harpsichord in the center of the room sire i have a favor i would ask charles sat then gestured brigham to a chair i am sure i owe you more than one there is no debt for loyalty your highness charless eyes softened serena saw then why he was called the bonnie prince it wasnt just his face and form it was his heart no but there can be gratitude what would you ask of me i would wed miss macgregor charless smile spread as he tapped his fingertips on his knee i had already surmised as much shall i tell you miss macgregor that in paris lord ashburn was very generous with the ladies at court at holyrood house he has proved most selfish serena kept her hands folded primly in her lap i believe lord ashburn is a wise warrior sir he has some knowledge of the fierce and terrible temper of clan macgregor highly entertained charles laughed so i shall wish you well perhaps you would care to be married here at court yes sir and tonight brigham said now charless pale brows rose tonight brigham such haste is he let his words trail off as he glanced at serena again the firelight played seductively over her hair understandable he decided do you have the macgregors permission yes sir well then you are both catholic receiving nods he thought it through the abbey is convenient there is a matter of the banns and so forth but i believe if a man cannot deal with such matters he can hardly hope to win a throne he rose bringing both serena and brigham to their feet i will see you wed tonight pale not at all certain she wasnt dreaming serena found her parents in their chamber serena fiona sighed over the fact that her daughter still wore her traveling suit you must change the princes court is no place for muddy boots and soiled skirts mama i am to be wed devil lass ian kissed her tumbled hair were aware of that tonight tonight fiona rose from her chair but how brigham went to the prince he took me like this serena spread her muddy skirts knowing her mother would understand her feelings on the matter i see fiona murmured and he they she looked from her mother to her father then back again mama is it your wish to marry him she hesitated feeling the old doubts well up instinctively she lifted a hand to her breast on a heavy chain under her bodice was the emerald brigham had given her aye she managed but it has all happened so fast he would be leaving again she thought leaving to fight aye she said her voice stronger there is nothing i want more than to belong to him fiona slipped an arm around serenas shoulders then we have much to do leave us please ian and send a servant for maggie and gwen tossing me out are you my lady fiona held out a hand to him even as serena reached for his other i fear you would have a strong dislike for the womans work that must be done in the next few hours aye ill go willingly he paused a moment to draw serena close you have always made me proud tonight i give you to another man and you will take his name but you will always be a macgregor he kissed her royal is our race serena and rightly there was no time to think and certainly no time to dwell on the enormity of what she would do before the night was over servants rushed in and out of the chambers with jugs of hot water that fiona scented delicately for her daughters bath gwen and maggie chattered as they took out seams and sewed new ones on the dress serena would wear to be married its romantic gwen said as she scanned her stitches with a critical eye its madness maggie glanced over knowing serena was soaking behind the screen rena must have woven strong magic to make brigham hurry so he must not be so stuffy as i once thought imagine gwen shifted the ivory satin delicately going to the prince we never had a chance to unpack from the journey before were changing mothers ball gown into serenas wedding gown maggie sat back touching a hand to the mound of her belly the baby she carried always became more active at night the unpacking would have to wait she thought just as she and coll would have to wait to have a proper reunion she stifled a giggle as she remembered how he had roared when they had been interrupted just as they had started to become reacquainted she looked over as serena emerged wrapped in towels her skin and hair dripping the dress will be beautiful maggie told her blinking back tears at the thought of the wedding and so will you by the fire fiona ordered armed with a brush knowing the trembles had nothing to do with a chill fiona began to soothe her daughter as she dried her hair a womans wedding is one of her most precious memories years from now when you look back what seems now like a dream will be very clear should i be so afraid fiona reached over serenas shoulder to take her hand i almost think the more you love the sharper the fear serena gave a weak laugh then i must love him more man i knew i could not wish a better man for you rena when the fighting is done you will have a good life together in england serena managed fiona began to stroke with the brush as she had so many times before her hands were gentle as she thought of this small pleasure that would soon be denied her when i married your father i left my family and my home i had grown up with the sound of the sea the smell of it as a girl i would climb the cliffs and watch the waves break on the rocks below the forest of glenroe was foreign to me and frightening i wasnt sure i could bear being so far away from everything i had known and loved how did you by loving your father more they left her hair loose so that it streamed like candlelight down her back the bodice of the gown was snug skimming her breasts leaving them to rise softly above as a resting place for a rope of pearls the sleeves belled out sheening down to her wrists there was a glimmer of pearls on the skirt where it flared over hoops and petticoats at the waist was a sash gathered up with a clutch of the palest pink wild roses with her heart hammering serena stepped into the abbey it was a place of legends of joy and despair and of miracles there she would be wed he was waiting for her in the wavering light of lamps and candles she walked to him she had always thought he was at his most elegant in black but she had never seen him look more handsome silver buttons glinted adding richness to the severe cut of his coat for the first time since she had known him he wore a wig the soft white added romance to his face contrasting royally with the dark gray of his eyes she didnt see the prince or the pews filled with the lords and ladies who had come to watch the ceremony she only saw brigham when her hand touched his it stopped trembling together they faced the priest and pledged the clock struck midnight the prince had decided that a wedding however hurried deserved a celebration within minutes after becoming lady ashburn serena found herself being led to the picture gallery of the palace where charles had given his first grand ball on the night he had taken the city the long wide room was already filled with music serena was kissed and congratulated by strangers envied by the ladies studied by the men her head was reeling by the time she was handed her first glass of champagne she sipped and felt the bubbles burst on her tongue exercising his privilege charles claimed her for a dance you make a lovely bride lady ashburn lady ashburn thank you your highness how can i thank you for making this possible your husband is of great value to me my lady as a soldier and as a friend her husband you have his loyalty sir and mine both as a langston and as a macgregor brigham claimed her when the dance had ended fending off complaints by others who would have partnered the new bride you are enjoying yourself my love aye ridiculous to be shy she thought but she felt herself color as she smiled at him he looked different in the wig with the flash of jewels she thought not at all like a man who would toss her over his shoulder and threaten to dump her in a loch he looked as glamorous as the prince himself and nearly as much a stranger its a beautiful room you see the portraits he asked leading her gently by the elbow for a closer look there are eightynine scottish monarchs all im told they were commissioned by charles ii though he never once entered holyrood house in fact never returned to scotland after the restoration she knew her history she thought irritably but tried to show an interest aye this is robert the bruce a fierce soldier and wellloved king i should have known a woman as wellread as you would know her history and her politics he leaned close to her ear what do you know about military strategy military strategy ah so there is something yet i might teach you before she could answer he pulled her roughly through a doorway she had only time for a muffled squeal before he swept her into his arms and began to race along a corridor what are you doing youve gone mad again im escaping as the music faded behind them he slowed his pace and i went mad from the moment you walked into the abbey let them dance and drink im taking my wife to bed he mounted a staircase not even bothering to nod at a servant who wideeyed bowed himself out of the way with serena still in his arms he kicked the door to his chamber open then kicked it closed again behind them without ceremony he dropped serena on the bed she tried to look indignant is that a way to treat your new bride my lord i havent even begun turning he shot the bolt on the door i might have wanted another dance or two she said smoothing her palm over the bed oh i intend to dance with you be sure of it from now till dawn and after she gave him a cheeky grin theres dancing sassenach and theres dancing aye he said mocking her its not the minuet i have in mind she smoothed the rumpled skirt of her gown what is it you have in mind then she lifted her brow as she assessed him and wondered that he didnt hear how fast and loud her heart was beating gwen dunks youre romantic i doubt shell continue to think so when i tell her how you dropped me on the bed like a sack of meal romance he lighted the candles that stood beside the bed is that what you want rena she moved a nearly bare shoulder its what gwen dreams of but not you with a little laugh he shrugged out of his coat and tossed it over a chair in a manner that would have made parkins shudder a womans entitled to romance on her wedding night he surprised her by kneeling on the bed and slipping off her shoes i had no chance to tell you how magnificent you looked standing beside me in the lamplight of the abbey or of how when i saw you there every dream i have ever had came true i thought you looked like a prince she murmured then shivered when he ran his fingertips along the arch of her foot tonight im only a man in love with his wife he brushed his lips over her ankle the scent of her bath clung to it and spun seductively in his head bewitched by her slowly he skimmed his mouth along her calf to trace the pulse at the back of her knee enslaved by her i was afraid she reached for him gathering him close from the moment i stepped inside the nave i was afraid then she sighed as he ran kisses along the edge of her bodice moistening and heating her skin are you still with sure fingers he unfastened her gown then watched as it dropped silently to her waist no i stopped being afraid when you picked me up and ran with me through the corridors she smiled and her hands were as confident as his as she pushed the waistcoat from his shoulders that was when i knew you were my brigham again i am always yours rena he lowered her gently to the bed and showed her how true his words were chapter thirteen contents prev next they were three more weeks at court nothing could have been more splendid than prince charless holyrood the food was sumptuous as was the music the entertainment the people it was a gold and gleaming time when the great halls echoed with laughter and dancing when frivolous games and affairs of the heart were played with equal abandon from all over the country came elegantly dressed men in their powdered wigs and glamorously gowned women to flirt with them holyrood was gay and glittering and in it charles lived those weeks a true prince it was a place and a time that would never be forgotten serena watched brigham meld into this world he had been born for while she fueled by determination more than by confidence adjusted to the life of beauty and glamour there were new rules to learn a new pattern to the days and the nights here at the first court to grace scotland in many years serena discovered what it was to be lady ashburn there were servants to attend her whether she wanted them or not because of brighams position they were given a gracious chamber hung with tapestries and appointed with elegant furnishings she met more people in a matter of weeks than she had in the whole of her life many of whom had come out of curiosity but more still who had come out of loyalty court life continued to make her uneasy and often impatient but the people who comprised it made her proud of her heritage and her husband serena had the first true inkling of brighams wealth when he presented her with the langston emeralds with the help of his contacts in london he had them transported from ashburn manor and gave them to serena less than a week after they had exchanged vows the necklace was as stately as its name and glimmered with stones as green as the lawns of his estate it was matched with a bracelet and ear bobs that made maggies jaw drop to accent them brigham commissioned a dressmaker serena found herself gowned in silks and satins in soft lawns and wispy lace she discovered what it was like to wear diamonds in her hair and scent her skin with the finest of french perfumes she would have given it all for a week alone with brigham in a highland croft it was impossible not to enjoy the splendor impossible not to revel a little in the envious glances of other ladies as she was escorted into a room by brigham she wore the gowns and the jewels dressed her hair and felt beautiful but as the days passed she couldnt shake the sensation that it was all like a dream the lights the glamour the tinkling laughter of women the sweeping bows of men her own easy relationship with the prince but the nights were real serena clung to them as tightly as she clung to brigham in the privacy of their marriage bed she knew it was temporary and that its continuation was in gods hands it was only a matter of time before brigham would leave they did not speak of it there was no need to speak of what they both understood if force of will alone could bring him back safely to her she could be content at night she could be his wife freely in heart mind and body by day she often felt like an impostor masquerading in fashionable gowns as a lady while in her heart she remained a product of the highlands longing to kilt up her skirts and race through the autumn trees surrounding the park as the wind tore the leaves from the branches for a dizzying dance instead she walked sedately with the other women while the men held council or rode to the camp because she loved she put her heart and soul into being the kind of wife she thought brigham should have she sat desperately struggling to be attentive through musical evenings though she found it absurd she never complained about the necessity to change from a morning dress to an afternoon dress then again for evening only once when she was sure she wouldnt be noticed did she accompany malcolm to the stables to admire the horses she envied her young brother the freedom to take wild rides but set her teeth and determined to enjoy her own demure ones do this do that she muttered as she paced alone in her bedchamber dont do this dont do that swearing she kicked a chair with the toe of the pretty slipper that matched her violet morning dress a body could go mad trying to remember the rules then madder still trying to live by them with a hiss of breath she dropped down into the chair skirts billowing she wanted the loch the peace of it she didnt just want to look out at the hills and crags she wanted to climb them she wanted her breeches she thought and her boots she wanted sighing she braced her elbows on her knees and cupped her face in her hands not an attitude suitable for lady ashburn but serena didnt feel like lady ashburn at the moment she was being selfish and ungrateful she told herself brigham was giving her things many another women would have swooned over he was promising her the kind of life only a fool would toss aside and she was a fool serena decided because she would have done just that if it wouldnt have meant losing brigham as well living with dignity and propriety was a small price to pay for love but oh she had nearly botched it a dozen times already and they had only been married three weeks she heard the door open and popped up like a spring smoothing her skirts a breath of relief escaped when she saw that it was brigham she would have hated for a servant to gossip below stairs about how lady ashburn sulked in her room with her elbows on her knees brigham lifted a brow when he saw her he would have sworn she grew more beautiful each day though he did wish from time to time that she could wear her hair loose and free so that he could bury his hands in it at will i thought you were going for a walk with your sister and maggie i was just getting ready automatically she reached up to pat her hair afraid her pacing had loosened the careful arrangement i didnt expect you back until much later is the council over yes you look exquisite rena like a wild violet with a laugh that was half sob she raced into his arms oh brig i love you i love you so much whats this he murmured as she pressed her face against his neck are you crying no aye a little its only that whenever i see you i love you more than the last time then ill take care to leave and come back several times each day dont laugh at me and risk fatal injury he tilted her head back so that he could kiss her properly no my dear i shant laugh at you she saw it in his eyes and knew then that she had seen it the moment he had come into the room the courage she had promised herself she would show wavered but she willed it back its time isnt it he brought her hand to his lips come sit there is no need she said steadily just tell me we march in a matter of days tomorrow you must leave for glenroe her cheeks paled but her voice remained strong i would stay until you go i would go with an easier mind if i knew you were safe at glenroe the journey will take longer because of maggie she knew he was right knew it was necessary and tried to live with it you march to london god willing with a nod she stepped back but she kept his hand in hers the fight is mine as well as yours doubly so now that i am your wife i would go with you if you would let me no do you think i see my wife as a camp follower the look the very familiar look in her eyes warned him to change tactics your family needs you serena what of my needs the words sprang to her tongue and were bitten back she would do him no good by following him into battle she looked at her hand and cursed the fact that it was too weak to wield a sword to protect him as he would protect her youre right i know i will wait for you i take you with me here he brought their joined hands to his heart there is something i would ask of you if things go wrong she shook her head but a look from him stopped her urgent protest there is a chest in my chamber and a strongbox in the box is gold and enough jewels to buy your safety and that of your family in the chest is something more precious that i would have you keep what is it he traced a fingertip along her cheekbone remembering you will know when you see it i wont forget but there will be no need you will come back she smiled remember you have promised to show me ashburn manor i remember lifting her hands she began to undo the tiny buttons at her bodice what are you doing smiling still she let the dress open what i am not doing is going for a walk with my sister she undid the satin sash at her waist is it improper to seduce ones husband at this hour probably he grinned as she tugged the coat from his shoulders but we shall keep it our secret they made love on the elegantly skirted bed under the high canopy with the sun coming strong through the windows the proper morning dress lay discarded in billows of violet she knelt beside him slender with the light playing over her skin as she drew the pins from her hair heavily in a glory of flametipped gold it fell over her naked shoulders and breasts brigham reached for it wrapped it once twice around his wrists as if to imprison himself then drew her slowly down to him their bodies fit they both remembered the loch and another sundrenched morning filled with love and passions the memory of it and thoughts of the cloudy uncertain future brought them gently together selflessly they gave to each other beautifully they received with a sigh he slipped into her with a murmur their lips met and clung together they showed one another a new level of pleasure one that could be reached only through the purity and the passions of unconditional love it was the first of november when the march finally began many brigham among them had urged the prince to begin the campaign earlier moving on the advantage they had gained by taking edinburgh instead charles had continued to hope for active support from france money had indeed come and supplies but no men charles put his own strength at eight thousand with three hundred horses he knew that he must make one decisive stroke bringing victory or defeat in a short time as before he decided the best strategy was a bold one charles had a high opinion of his troops as did the english a few months before the young princes ambitions and his ragtag troops of rugged highlanders had been laughed at then he had swept down on edinburgh his early victories and the flair with which he had brought defeat to the english had the uneasy government recalling more and more troops from flanders sending them to field marshal wade in newcastle still as the stuart army marched into lancaster under the leadership of lord george murray they met with little resistance but the celebration there might have been was offset by the disappointing number of english jacobites who had rallied near a hot fire on a cold night brigham sat with whitesmouth who had ridden from manchester to join the cause men warmed themselves with whiskey and wrapped themselves in plaids against the keening wind we should have attacked wades forces whitesmouth tipped his flask now theyve called the electors fat son cumberland in haste and hes advancing through the midlands how many are we brig four five thousand at best brigham accepted the flask but only stared into the fire the prince is pushed two ways by murray and osullivan each decision comes only after agonizing debate if you want the truth johnny we lost our momentum in edinburgh we may never get it back but you stay he has my oath they sat another moment in silence listening to the wind crying over the hills you know that some of the scots are drifting off going quietly back to their glens and hills i know it only that day ian and other chiefs had spoken together they meant to hold their men brigham wondered if they or anyone fully understood that the brilliant victories of their outnumbered and illequipped army had been won because the men hadnt simply been ordered to fight but had fought with their hearts once the heart was lost so would be the cause with a shake of his head he shifted his thoughts to practical matters we reach derby tomorrow if we hit london quickly thoroughly we could still see the king on the throne he sipped then as someone began to play a mournful tune on the pipes weve yet to be beaten from what news you bring there is panic in the city and the elector prepares to leave for hanover there may he stay whitesmouth mumbled my god its cold in the north the wind has an edge as sharp and as sweet as a blade if luck is with us youll be back to your wife and her highlands by the new year brigham drank again but in his heart he knew it would take more than luck in derby with london only miles away charles held his council of war snow fell fitfully outside as the men rounded the table a gloom was in the room both from the leaden light and on the faces of men there was a good fire but over its crackle and hiss the sound of the icy wind could still be heard gentlemen charles spread his fine hands in front of him i seek advice from you who have pledged to my father it is boldness we need and unity his dark eyes scanned the room lighting briefly on each man murray was there and the man whom murray considered a thorn in his side osullivan brigham watched holding his silence as the prince continued to speak we know that three government troops threaten to converge on us and morale among the men is suffering a thrust rapiersharp at the capital now while we still remember our victories is surely our move your highness murray waited then was given permission to speak the advice i must offer is caution we are poorly equipped and greatly outnumbered if we withdraw to the highlands take the winter to plan a new campaign that would launch in spring we might rally those men we have already lost and draw fresh supplies from france such counsel is the counsel of despair charles said i can see nothing but ruin and destruction coming to us if we should retreat withdraw murray corrected and was joined by the assent of other advisers our rebellion is young but it must not be impulsive charles listened shutting his eyes a moment as one after another of the men who stood with him echoed murrays sentiments prudence patience caution only osullivan preached attack using flattery and reckless promises in his attempt to sway the prince all at once charles sprang up from his chair scattering the maps and documents spread out in front of him what say you he demanded of brigham brigham knew that militarily murrays advice was sound but he remembered his own thoughts as he had sat with whitesmouth by the fire if they withdrew now the heart of the rebellion would be lost for once perhaps for the only time his thoughts marched in step with osullivans with respect your highness if the choice was mine i would march to london at daybreak and seize the moment the heart says to fight your highness one of the advisers put in closely echoing brighams thoughts but in war one must heed the head as well if we ride to london as we are our losses could be immeasurable or our triumph great charles interrupted passionately are we women who cover our heads at the first sign of snow or who think of only warming our tired feet by the fire withdraw retreat he swung back toward murray eyes furious it is one and the same i wonder if you have a mind to betray me i have only a mind to see you and our cause succeed murray said quietly you are a prince sue i am but a soldier and must speak as one who knows his troops and the way of war the argument continued but long before it was finished brigham saw how it would be the prince never strong of purpose when faced with dissension among his advisers was being forced to heed murrays words of caution on december the decision to retreat was taken the road back to scotland was long and the men dispirited it was as brigham had feared when a halt was called to the exuberant aggressive advance that had given the clans such power since the previous summer the heart went out of the rebellion men might still talk of another invasion in the following year but all believed in their secret hearts that they would never march south again they fell back behind the scottish border and took glasgow though the city was openly hostile the men frustrated and disillusioned might have taken that christmas day to loot and sack had not cameron of lochiels cool head and compassion dissuaded them stirling surrendered just as reinforcements men stores and ammunition arrived from france it started to seem as if the right decision had been made but if charles now believed lord george had been correct he never spoke of it the princes numbers were again on the increase as more clans came to him pledging heart and sword and men but there were mackenzies and macleods mackays and munroes who followed the electors colors they fought again south of stirling in the purple winters dusk scot fighting scot as well as english again they tasted victory but with it came grief as ian macgregor fell to an enemy blade he lingered through the night men who ride in battle need not be told when wounds are mortal brigham knew it as he sat beside the old man with the night wind flapping at the tent he thought of serena and how she had laughed when the big bear of a macgregor had swung her around and around in her night robe he thought of riding with ian through the winter wind and of sharing a bottle of port near a great fire now approaching death seemed to have stolen both size and strength so that he was only an old fragile man still his hair glowed rich and red in the pale glow of the lamp your mother ian began reaching for colls hand ill care for her they were men who loved each other too well to pretend there would be a tomorrow aye ians breath hissed in and out like wind through an empty husk of wheat the bairn my only regret is i wont see the bairn he shall carry your name coll vowed he shall know the man who was his grandsire there was a faint smile on ians mouth though his lips were the color of ashes brigham im here sir because his vision was fading ian concentrated on the voice dont tame my wildcat she would die from it you and coll will tend to little gwen and malcolm keep them safe my word on it my sword ian struggled for another breath my sword to malcolm coll you have your own he shall have it coll bent over ians hand papa we were right to fight it will not be for naught he opened his eyes for the last time royal is our race lad he managed a final fierce grin we are macgregors despite them there were men dispatched to bear the body back to glenroe but coll refused to go with them he would have me stay with the prince coll told brigham as they stood out in the bitter sleet that he died here with our backs turned to london its not finished coll coll turned his head there was grief in his eyes and also a bright anger no by god its not the men of the clans grew dispirited as it seemed ever clearer that the invasion of england was fast petering out into a holding action desertions had become frequent and the decision was made to consolidate forces in the north of scotland but the leaders continue to bicker even after the rebels forded the icy waters of the forth and marched north up the great glen for seven weeks that winter charles made his base in inverness inactivity again took its toll dwindling the numbers of the so recently replenished troops there were short sporadic often bitter little battles during those weeks the jacobites were again victorious in the taking of fort augustus that hated english stronghold at the heart of the highlands but the men longed for a decisive victory and for home meanwhile cumberland massed his forces it seemed the winter would never end it was snowing when serena stood by her fathers grave he had come back to them nearly a month before and all glenroe had wept her own tears fell freely as she longed for him for the thunderous sound of his voice for the crushing strength of his arms and the laughter in his eyes she wanted to cry out serena much preferred fury to tears but the anger had drained out of her there was only a sorrow a deep abiding grief that stirred in her heart even as the child she now carried stirred in her womb it was the helplessness she thought that made a body weak and the heart brittle no amount of work or temper or love could bring her father back or take the dull pain out of her mothers eyes men fought and women grieved she closed her eyes and let the snow fall stinging to her cheeks there must be more she thought more than waiting and mourning she had already lost one man she loved how would she go on if she lost another the rebellion she thought with the first flash of fire she had felt in weeks the damned rebellion was was right she realized pushing the heels of her hands over her face to dry them it was right and it was just if people believed strongly they should be willing to fight and to die her father had said so and had stood unwaveringly by his words how could she do less i miss you so she murmured and im afraid theres the child now you see your grandchild she smoothed a hand over the slight slope of her belly there was nothing i could do to save you just as theres nothing i can do to protect brigham or coll i wish oh papa im with child and part of me still wishes i could be a man so i could pick up a sword for you she searched in her pockets until her fingers closed over the handkerchief brigham had given her so many months before she laid it on her cheek using it as a talisman to bring him clearly to mind is he safe he doesnt even know we made a child between us i would go to him she felt the baby quicken but i cant i cant protect and fight for him but i can protect and fight for the child rena she turned to see malcolm standing a little way off snow fell in sheets between them but she could see the quiver of his lips and the sheen of tears in his eyes wordlessly she opened her arms to him while he wept she held him finding comfort somehow in comforting another he had been so brave she remembered standing so straight holding their mothers arm while the priest had said the last words over their fathers grave hed been a man then now he was a little boy i hate the english his voice was muffled against her shawl i know mother would say hate is not christian but sometimes i think there is a time for hate just as there is a time for love and there is a time my love to let go of it he was a fierce warrior aye she was able to smile now as she drew him back to study his tearstreaked face do you not think malcolm that a fierce warrior might prefer to die fighting for what he believes they had retreated malcolm said bitterly and serena saw a glimpse of coll in his eyes aye the letter she had received from brigham had explained the maneuver his dissatisfaction with it and the growing dissent in the ranks i dont understand the strategy of generals malcolm but i do know that whether the prince is victor or vanquished nothing will ever be the same i want to go to inverness and join malcolm i have fathers sword he interrupted passion darkening his eyes i can use it i will use it to avenge him and support the prince i am not a child she looked at him then the little boy who had run weeping into her arms was a man again he stood as high as her shoulder his jaw firm his hand clenched on the hilt of his dagger he could go serena realized with a flutter of fear no you are not a child and i believe you could raise fathers sword like a man i will not stop you if your heart tells you to go but i would ask that you think of mother of gwen and maggie you can care for them aye i would try but every day the child within me grows she took his hand in hers it was stiff and cold and surprisingly strong and im afraid i cant tell mother or the others but im afraid when i grow as big as maggie how will i be able to keep them safe if the english come i dont ask you not to fight malcolm nor do i tell you youre a child but i will ask you to be a man and fight here torn he turned back to stare down at her fathers grave the snow lay over it in a soft white blanket father would have wanted me to stay relief coursed through her but she only touched his shoulder aye there is no disgrace in staying behind not when its the right thing its hard i know now she slipped her arm around him believe me malcolm i know there are things we can do she murmured thinking aloud when the snow stops if the princes troops are as close as inverness the english will not be far behind we cannot fight in glenroe there are too few of us and almost all women and children you think the english will come here he demanded half eager half terrified i begin to believe it did word not come to us that there was a battle at moy hall and the english were routed malcolm reminded her but it is too close if we cannot defend then we protect you and i will find a place in the hills and prepare it food supplies blankets weapons she thought of the strongbox we will plan malcolm as warriors plan i know a place a cave you will take me there tomorrow brigham rode hard though it was nearly april the weather remained cold with snow often whipped up by the hateful wind he commanded a handful of weary hungry men this foraging party like others that had been sent out from inverness went in search of muchneeded food and supplies one of their greatest hopes a captured government sloop renamed prince charles had been retaken by the enemy off the kyle of tongue and her desperately lookedfor funds were now in the hands of the enemy brighams party had found more than oats and venison they had discovered news the duke of cumberland the electors second son lay in aberdeen with a wellarmed wellfed army of twice their strength he had received a powerful reinforcement of five thousand german soldiers who remained in dornoch blocking the route south the word came that cumberland was beginning his advance on inverness hooves thudded on the layer of snow still covering the road the men rode mostly in silence edgy with hunger and fatigue they wanted a meal and the cold comfort of sleep redcoats were spotted to the west with a quick signal brigham halted his troops and scanned the distance they were outnumbered nearly two to one and the dragoons looked fresh he had a choice they could run or they could fight turning his horse he took a hard look at his men we can make the hills and lose them or we can meet them here on the road with the rocks to their backs we fight one man fingered his sword then another and another added his voice the dragoons had already spurred into a gallop brigham flashed a grin it was the answer hed wanted then lets show them the faces of kings men wheeling his horse he led the charge there was something fierce and chilling about a highland charge they rode as if they rode into hell screaming in gaelic and brandishing blades wall met wall and the lonely hills echoed with the fury around brigham men fought like demons and fell dying from the slice and hack of steel snow ran red it was unlike him to allow his emotions to surface in battle here after weeks of frustration and anger he let himself go cutting through the line of oncoming dragoons like a man gone mad he saw no faces only that nameless entity known as the enemy his sword whipped out severing flesh as he dragged his horse right then left then right again they drove the dragoons onto the rocks pursuing them mercilessly weeks of waiting had worked like a cancer that came rising to the surface to eat away at the civilized veneer when they were done five jacobites lay dead or dying alongside a dozen dragoons the rest of the government troop had fled over the rocks like rabbits after them lads one of the highlanders shouted brigham swung his horse to block the next charge for what purpose he dismounted to clean his blade in the snow weve done what weve done now we tend to our own a foot away a man moaned sheathing his weapon brigham went to him the english dead will be buried our own dead and wounded will be taken back to inverness leave the english for the kites brighams head whipped around his eyes had lost their fever and were cold again as they studied the bloodspattered face of the hefty scot who had spoken we are not animals we bury the dead friend or enemy in the end the english dead were given cairns the ground was too hard for graves the men were still weary still hungry when they turned their mounts toward inverness they rode slowly burdened by their wounded with each long mile brigham thought of how close the dragoons had been to glenroe chapter fourteen contents prev next in the chill of april the drums sounded and the pipes were played in inverness the army readied for battle only twelve miles away cumberland had pitched camp i do not like the ground once more murray stood as charless adviser but the rift between them that the retreat had caused had never fully healed drumossie moor is well suited to the tactics of the english army but not to ours your highness perhaps because he knew charles had yet to forgive him for the retreat north murray chose his words with care this wide bare moor might as well have been designed for the maneuvers of cumberlands infantry and i tell you there could never be a more improper ground for highlanders do we withdraw again osullivan put in he was as loyal as murray as brave a soldier but he lacked the hardheaded military sense of the englishman your highness have not the highlanders proved themselves fierce and fearsome warriors as you have proven a canny general again and again you have beaten back the english here we are not simply outnumbered murray turned his back on osullivan and appealed to the prince the ground itself is the most terrible weapon if we withdraw north again across nairn water we shall stand to meet cumberland charles his eyes cool his hands neatly folded watched his most trusted men we shall not run again through the winter we have waited and the wait he knew had disillusioned and disgruntled his men it might have been that more than osullivans flattery or his own impatience that swayed him we wait no longer quartermastergeneral osullivan has chosen the ground and we shall fight murrays eyes met brighams briefly they had already discussed the princes decision your highness if your mind is made up may i propose a maneuver that may strengthen our advantage if it does not include a retreat my lord color stained murrays cheeks but he continued today is the dukes birthday and his men will celebrate it they will be drunk as beggars a surprise night attack could turn the tide the prince considered i find this interesting continue two columns of men murray began using candlesticks to illustrate they would close in in a pincer movement coming into camp from both sides and cutting down the size of cumberlands army while they sleep off the effects of the birthday brandy a good plan the prince murmured excitement once more kindling his eyes the duke should celebrate well for the celebration will be shortlived they marched men with no more than a single biscuit in their bellies set out to cover the twelve miles in the dark and the unrelieved cold the plan was a good one but the men sent to accomplish it were tired and hungry once twice then yet again they lost direction and heart until they were no more than a group wandering on horseback the sun newly up brigham and coll watched them return to camp my god the scot muttered weve come to this with his own fatigue weighing on him brigham shifted in the saddle men exhausted from the march and grinding hunger dropped to the ground many nodding off to sleep in the park of culloden house or near the road others grumbled even as the prince rode among them turning his head brigham looked out on drumossie moor it was wide and bare skimmed now with early frost and a thin shifting mist to brigham it might have been a parade ground for cumberlands infantry to the north across the river called nairn the ground was broken and hilly there murray would have chosen to stand and there brigham thought there would have been a chance for victory but osullivan had the princes ear now and there was no turning back it ends here brigham said softly for better or worse in the east the sun struggled sluggishly to life trapped behind churning clouds spurring his horse he rode through the camp on your feet he shouted will you sleep until you wake with your throats cut can you not hear the english drums beating to arms dragging themselves up men began to gather in their clans artillery was manned what rations were left were passed among the troops but they served only to leave stomachs edgy and empty with pike and ax gun and scythe they rallied under the standard macgregors and macdonalds camerons and chisholms mackintoshes and robertsons and more they were five thousand hungry illequipped held only by the cause that still bound them together charles looked every bit the prince as he rode up and down their lines in his tartan coat and cockaded bonnet they were his men and the oath he had sworn to them was no less than that they had sworn him across the moor they watched the enemy advance they were in three columns that slowly and smoothly swung into line as charles had done the duke pudgy in his red coat a black cockade pinned to his tricorn rode along encouraging his men there was the sound of drum and pipe and the empty hum of wind that whipped sleet into the faces of the jacobites the first shots were fired by jacobite guns they were answered and devastatingly as the first cannon exploded near culloden house maggie arched against a contraction they were coming quickly powerfully her body weakened by the full night of labor was racked with pain her mind no longer registered over and over she cried out for coll poor lass poor lass mrs drummond brought fresh water and linen to the bedchamber such a wee thing she is there darling there fiona bathed maggies streaming face mrs drummond another log on the fire please we need it warm when the baby comes woods nearly gone fiona only nodded well use what we have gwen the babes breech mother gwen straightened a moment to ease the strain in her back maggies so small serena one hand holding maggies laid the other protectively over the child growing inside her own womb can you save them save them both god willing gwen wiped the sweat from her face with the sleeve of her dress lady macgregor i can tell parkins to find more wood mrs drummonds wide face creased with concern as maggie cried out with the next pain she had birthed and lost two babies of her own a man ought to be good for something other than planting a seed in a woman too tired to disapprove of the sentiment fiona nodded please mrs drummond tell him wed be grateful to him coll maggie sobbed turning her head from side to side her eyes focused on serena rena aye my love im here were all here coll i want coll i know i know you do serena kissed maggies limp hand hell be back soon her own baby kicked making her wonder if in a few months she would find herself confined calling out brighams name over waves of pain all the while knowing he wasnt there to answer gwen says you must rest between the pains gather your strength back i try should it take so long weakly she turned her head back to gwen tell me the truth please is something wrong with the babe for a split second gwen debated lying but though she was young still she had already seen that women dealt best with the truth no matter how frightening hes turned wrong maggie i know what to do but it wont be a simple birth am i going to die there was no desperation in maggies question only a need for truth as difficult as it was gwen had already made her decision if she had to choose she would save maggie and lose the child before she could speak the next contraction hit bringing maggie exhausted as she was rearing up oh god my baby dont let my baby die swear it to me swear it no ones going to die serena squeezed her hand hard so hard it cut through the other pain and had maggie quieting no ones going to die she repeated because youre going to fight when the pain comes youre going to scream it out if need be but youre not going to give up macgregors dont give up the round shot of the government artillery cut huge holes in the jacobite lines their own guns could only answer ineffectually as men fell like slain deer wind blew smoke and sleet back in their faces while they stood and suffered the slaughter of their ranks even with their lines running six deep the cannonfire broke through and brought writhing miserable death sweet jesus why wont they give the order to charge coll his face blackened with smoke looked with desperate eyes at the carnage will they have us stand here and be cut down to the last man before we raise a sword brigham swung around and galloped for the right wing driving hard through the smoke and fire in the name of god he cried when he faced the prince give us the command to charge we die like dogs what are you saying we wait for cumberland to attack you cant see what the cannons have done to your front lines if you wait for cumberland you wait in vain he wont attack as long as his guns can murder from a distance we havent their range and sweet lord were dying charles began to dismiss him for indeed his position was such that he had no clear view of the murderous skill of cumberlands artillery but at that moment murray himself rode to the prince with the request give the command charles agreed the messenger was sent but was felled by a cannonball before he could reach the ranks seeing it brigham continued the drive himself shouting the order claymore over the cheers and oaths of the men the center of the line moved first racing like wild stags across the moor and fell upon the dragoons swinging broadsword and scythe it would be written that the highlanders came like wolves desperate for blood fearless in spirit but they were only men and many were cut down by bayonet and dagger if the english had run in front of a highland assault before they had now learned in a canny and merciless maneuver the dragoons shifted lines to catch the charging scots in a sweeping and deadly rifle volley the highland charge continued but the ground itself as predicted served the english a hail of bullets split the line still it seemed for an instant as though their combined strength would crumble cumberlands ranks as the english were forced back to the next line of defense but that second line held pouring devastating fire onto the raging highlanders they fell men heaping onto men so that those who still stood were forced to crawl over the bodies of their comrades still the guns thundered scattering grapeshot now canisters full of nails and lead balls and iron scrap like hideous rain the welltrained dragoons held their ground one rank firing while the next reloaded so that the hail of bullets was unending but still the clansmen pressed on grapeshot blasted against brighams shield scoring his arm and shoulder as he fought his way over the dead and wounded and through the dukes line he saw james macgregor rob roys impetuous son driving his men through the living wall of english troops his own eyes stung from the smoke that blurred his vision ice was in his veins as he hacked and sliced his way towards the back of cumberlands line through the fog he saw that murray had preceded him his hat and wig blown off during the battle only then did the confusion surrounding them start to come clear true their right wing had cut through taking down the dragoons in the press of their charge but elsewhere the jacobites were in tatters the macdonalds had taken fearful punishment as they tried to lure the dragoons into attack with short daring rushes for the men facing them down had stood their ground and fired unrelentingly in a desperate move brigham wheeled back determined to fight his way through yet again and rally what men who could he saw coll legs planted claymore and dirk whistling viciously as he fought off three redcoated english without hesitation brigham went to his aid this was no romantic duel at dawn but a sweaty grunting fight for life the wound brigham had already received was oozing blood and his dagger hand was slippery smoke billowed clogging the lungs even as the sleet continued to fall only small sporadic skirmishes remained in the area around them the jacobites were still fighting wildly but were being forced back over the moor which was already strewn with dead and wounded the wall of men that had once been strong on the right wing had been broken allowing the redcoated cavalry to storm through and threaten the retreating men but the bigger defeat meant little at that moment to coll and brigham who fought backtoback outnumbered in their personal war as surely as the whole of the princes army had been outnumbered by cumberlands coll took a hit to the thigh but the gash went almost unfelt as he continued to lash out with his weapon behind him brigham whirled and struck before another blow hit home with this small personal victory both men turned and began the race over the littered smokecovered moor my god theyve destroyed us breathless and bleeding coll scanned the carnage it was a picture a man would never forget a glimpse of hell steaming with smoke and stinking of blood there must have been ten thousand of them he saw as they broke into a pocket of clear air a dragoon brutally mutilating the body of an alreadydead clansman with a lionlike roar coll fell on him enough sweet jesus brigham dragged him off theres nothing more we can do here but die the cause is lost coll the rebellion is over but coll was like a madman sword raised ready to use it on the first man who crossed his path think glenroe is close too close we have to get back get the family out maggie only at his fathers death had coll felt so much like weeping aye youve the right of it they began again swords at the ready here and there could still be heard the volley of shots and the screams they had nearly reached the hills when a chance twist of his head showed brigham the wounded dragoon lifting his musket and taking unsteady aim there was time only to shove coll out of the line of the fire brigham felt the ball slam into his body felt its roaring hideous pain he fell on the edge of drumossie moor in the place that came to be known as culloden numb nearly asleep on her feet serena burst out of the house to drag in cold fresh air there were wars only women knew and she had fought such a war they had been nearly two nights in the desperate battle to bring maggies child out of her womb and into the world there had been blood and sweat and pain she had never imagined the boy had come feet first into the world leaving his mother wavering between life and death now it was nearly dusk and gwen had said that maggie would live serena could only remember those first thin wailing cries maggie had heard them too before she had fainted from exhaustion and loss of blood here outside the light was soft with approaching evening to the west the first stars had shivered themselves into life luring a lone owl serena felt its call pierce through her oh brigham she wrapped her arms around the slope of her own belly i need you serena she turned narrowing her eyes to focus as a figure limped out of the shadows rob rob macgregor then she saw him fully his doublet streaked with blood his hair matted with dirt and sweat and his eyes his wild eyes what happened to you my god she reached for him as he stumbled at her feet the battle the english theyve killed us serena killed us brigham she snatched at his torn shirt brigham where is he is he safe in the name of pity tell me where is brigham i dont know so many dead so many he wept into her skirts broken he had once been young idealistic fond of fancy waistcoats and pretty girls my father my brothers all dead i saw them fall and old maclean too and young david mackintosh slaughtered the horror of it showed in his eyes when he lifted his face even when we ran they slaughtered us like pigs did you see brigham she said desperately shaking him as he sobbed against her and coll did you see them aye i saw them but there was smoke so much smoke and the guns never stopped even when it was over it didnt stop i saw i saw them killing women and children there was a farmer and his son plowing the dragoons rode over them stabbing and stabbing i was hiding and i saw the wounded on the field they murdered them with clubs no again she wrapped her arms around her unborn child as she began to rock back and forth no a man would put down his weapons in surrender and still be shot down like a dog they came after us there were bodies along the road hundreds we couldnt even bury our dead when when was the battle fought yesterday with a choked sob he wiped his eyes only yesterday he was safe she had to believe that brigham was safe how could she move how could she act if she thought him dead he was not dead she told herself as she slowly rose she would not let him be dead she looked to the house where the candles were already lighted for evening she had a family to protect will they come here rob they are hunting us down like animals recovered he spit on the ground my shame is that i did not kill a dozen more instead of running sometimes you run so you can fight again she remembered him as he had been and knew that he would never be that way again in pity she put her arms around him your mother i havent gone to her yet i dont know how i can tell her tell her that her men died bravely in the service of the true king then get her and the other women into the hills she looked down the path to where the shadows fell over a thin frost this time when the english come to burn there will be no women to rape inside the house she sought out gwen the fear she felt for brigham was trapped in the back of her mind for her own sanity and for the sake of her family she wouldnt allow it to break free over and over hike a chant her thoughts ran on he was alive he would come back gwen taking her sisters hand serena drew her from maggies bedside how is she weak gwen was teetering on the brink of exhaustion herself i wish i knew more there is still so much to learn no one could have done more than you you saved her and the bairn gwen her eyes still clouded with fatigue looked back toward the bed where maggie slept i was afraid we all were even you gwen smiled and pressed her sisters hand you seemed so fearless so confident well the worst is over the bairn is healthy miraculously so she sighed allowing herself to think for the first time of her own bed a few weeks of rest and care and maggie will regain her strength how soon can she be moved moved gwen paused in the act of adjusting the fillet that held back her hair why serena maggie murmured in her sleep with a gesture serena brought gwen outside into the hallway ive just seen rob macgregor rob but there was a battle gwen it was bad very bad coll gwen managed after a moment brigham rob didnt know but he told me that our troops were routed and that the english are pursuing the survivors we can hide them rob and whoever else comes surely if the english come and find us only women alone they will leave again do you forget what happened before when we were only women and the english came that was only one man gwen said in a desperate whisper listen to me serena put her hands on gwens shoulders and struggled to speak calmly rob told me he said it was like madness he said the dragoons murdered the wounded that they struck down woman and children if they come here before the madness is passed they will kill us all even maggie and the bairn we may kill her if we move her better that than have her butchered at the hands of the english gather together what she and the child will need we darent wait to move longer than first light rena what of you and your child a light came into her eyes that had nothing to do with fear had her father seen it he would have smiled we will survive and we will remember with her own words drumming in her ears she walked downstairs in the kitchen her mother was preparing a tray of broth and bread serena i thought you would rest go now get to your bed as soon as i have seen gwen eat this i shall be certain she does the same mama we must talk maggie fiona said immediately the babe no gwen tells me they do well enough she turned her head so that her eyes met mrs drummonds then parkinss we must all talk where is malcolm in the stables my lady parkins told her tending the horses with a nod serena led her mother to a chair at the table is there tea mrs drummond enough for all of us aye silently she poured the cups then took a seat when serena gestured there is news serena said and told them at first light they took what they could carry parkins laid maggie as gently as he could in the utter he had fashioned she bit back her moans and though she tried she was too weak yet to hold the baby the journey into the hills was slow and nearly silent with malcolm leading the way at the top of a ridge where the first early flowers were pushing their way through the thin soil fiona stopped the forest where she had come as a bride spread beneath shimmering behind a thin morning mist at the top of the rise stood the house where she had lived with ian given birth to her children as she stood the breeze rippled her plaid but left her cheeks colorless and her eyes dull we will come back mother serena slipped an arm around her mothers waist and laid her head on fionas shoulder they will not take our home so much of my life is there serena and my heart when they brought your father back i thought my life had ended as well but it has not she took a long breath her slender shoulders straightened her head came up aye the macgregors will come back to glenroe they stood a moment longer watching the blue slate house glimmer in the strengthening sunlight they reached the cave two hours later malcolm and serena had already laid by wood and peat for the fire they had blankets and stores from the kitchen medicines and milk drawn fresh that morning hidden behind rocks was the chest that held brighams shepherdess and a miniature of his grandmother and his strongbox serena set her grandfathers claymore at the entrance to the cave and checked the pistols and ammunition gwen tended maggie while fiona soothed the baby they already called young ian can you fire a pistol parkins serena asked yes lady ashburn should it become necessary despite her fatigue she grinned he had used the same tone of voice he might have if she had asked him if he knew how to remove a wine stain from lace perhaps you would take this one very well my lady he took the pistol with a slight bow you are more than you seem parkins she thought of the competent manner with which he had fashioned the litter and of the way he had pulled it and its fragile burden over the rough ground i begin to see why lord ashburn keeps you close you have been with him long i have been in service with the langstons for many years my lady when she only nodded and stared at the mouth of the cave he softened he will come back to us my lady tears threatened but only one managed to escape before she blinked them back i would give him a son this first time parkins what was his fathers given name it was daniel my lady daniel she was able to smile again we shall name him daniel and he will be brave enough to walk into the lions den she turned her smile up to parkins he shall be the next earl of ashburn and one day he shall walk through glenroe will you rest now lady ashburn the journey has tired you more than you know aye in a moment she turned to be certain the others were busy when brigham and my brother return they will not know where to find us it will be necessary for one of us to go down every few hours and watch for them you and malcolm and i will take shifts no my lady her mouth opened then shut then opened again no no my lady i could not in good conscience permit you to travel again my master would not hear of it your master has nothing to say about it both he and coll will need to be led to this place and so they shall be young malcolm and i will arrange it you and the other women will remain here her face pale and bruised with fatigue set into stubborn lines i will not sit in this bloody cave and wait when i can be of use to my husband parkins merely spread a blanket over her i fear i must insist lady ashburn my lord would demand it serena merely scowled at him i wonder that lord ashburn didnt dismiss you years ago yes my lady parkins said comfortably so he has said himself many times i will bring you a cup of milk she slept she had the pistol at one hand and the sword at the other but her dreams were peaceful and filled with brigham she could see him clearly almost clearly enough to touch him as he smiled at her her hand was in his and she could all but feel the warmth of his flesh as they danced together under dappled sunlight near the riverbank he wore the gleaming black and silver and she the ivory satin seeded with pearls they were alone gloriously alone with only the rippling rush of water and the call of the birds for music their faces were close then closer then close enough to kiss as they continued to step and sway with the dance he was so handsome her tall english lover with the dashing rebels heart his kiss was so sweet so gentle like one of greeting or of farewell then she saw the blood staining his coat seeping through it to dampen her hand as she reached for him the blood was real real enough that she could feel the warmth of it on her skin but when she tried to take him into her arms he faded until she stood alone on the banks of the river with the only sound the high call of a warbler searching for its mate she woke with brighams name on her lips and her heart thundering fighting for air she lifted her trembling hand and found no blood slowly struggling to separate dream from reality she pressed the hand to her heart it wasnt a warbler she heard but an eagle it wasnt the song of the river but the moan of the wind he was alive she told herself and laid a hand over the mound of her stomach as if to reassure her child that its father was safe almost immediately she heard the whimper of the baby already born wearily she rose to make her way to the back of the cave with fionas help maggie held young ian to her breast where he sucked lustily serena maggies voice was thin and her cheeks still deathly pale but her smile was sweet he grows stronger every hour she murmured and lifted a hand to stroke his downy head soon youll have your own hes beautiful with a little sigh serena sat beside her god was good enough to give him your looks instead of his fathers maggie laughed settled comfortably in the crook of fionas arm i didnt know i could love anyone as much as coll but now i do i know the journey was difficult for you how do you feel weak i hate feeling so weak and helpless serena stroked her cheek a man doesnt fall in love with a packhorse you know this time maggies laugh was a little stronger if some girl tries that trick with my little ian ill scratch her eyes out of course but youll be sure to teach it to your daughters oh aye maggie shut her eyes im so tired just sleep fiona murmured when the bairns had his fill well tend him will coll come soon over maggies drooping head fionas eyes met serenas aye fionas voice was soothing very soon hell be so proud of you for giving him a son serena gathered up the dozing baby as fiona settled maggie among the blankets so tiny serena swaddled ian and laid him to sleep it always seems a miracle it is fiona looked to the far side of the cave to where gwen lay curled in exhausted sleep each child is a miracle there is always death serena there is always grief and loss without the promise of new life we couldnt bear it serena asked now what she had not been brave enough to ask before do you think theyre dead i pray they live fiona took serenas hands in hers and i will pray every moment until we know you must eat she said briskly for yourself and the child aye but she let her words trail off as she glanced around the cave where is malcolm with parkins they left soon after you went to sleep down for more supplies frowning serena started to accept the bowl mrs drummond offered dont you fret about them lassie my parkins knows what hes about aye he is a good man mrs drummond a steady one a becoming blush glowed in the widows cheeks we are to be wed i am happy for you she stopped her fingers tightening on the bowl do you hear that she whispered as she set the bowl down i hear nothing but fionas heart had risen into her throat someones coming stay to the back of the cave see that ian makes no sound serena but even as fiona reached for her serena was moving quietly to the cave opening ice ran through her veins freezing her fear and making her strong she would kill if god showed her no other way and she would kill well with a steady hand she picked up the pistol then the sword if the english had come they would find women alone but they would not find women defenseless behind her mrs drummond gripped a carving knife as the footsteps came closer there could be no doubt the cave would be seen holding both weapons serena stepped out of the cave and prepared to do battle the sun fell over her striking her eyes so that she narrowed them even as she leveled the pistol still a hellcat i see brigham supported by coll and parkins managed to grin at her as he was half carried over the broken ground the light shone over his bloodstreaked coat and breeches oh sweet god laying the weapons down serena ran to him her face swam in front of his eyes as he struggled to speak again he could only manage her name before darkness closed in on him and smothered the pain chapter fifteen contents prev next how bad is it serena knelt on the floor of the cave beside brigham while gwen examined his wounds the fear had returned drying her mouth to dust wordlessly gwen probed brighams side where the ball was lodged a few feet away fiona dressed the gash in colls leg while he stared in wonder at his son the shot was meant for me coll clung to maggies hand the fire in his leg was a dull almost dreamy pain beneath his exhaustion he was alive beside his beloved wife and firstborn son while his friend lay bleeding from a bullet that had been meant for him he stepped in front of it took it we were trying to fight our way into the hills wed lost everything was lost we were separated from our regiment i thought at first i thought him dead you brought him back serena looked up gripping a bloodsoaked cloth aye coll turned his face into his wifes hair wanting to smell only the sweetness of it and not the stench of death and battle he would never be able to describe the events of the last day and night but he would always remember the desperation he had felt when he had carried brigham into the hills he would remember hiding like a wild dog and binding the wounds as best he could while the english searched the rocks and heather he had hidden in the lee of a rock too weak to cross the stretch of moor to a barn there lying in scrub with brigham unconscious beside him he had seen the soldiers come and set fire to the building and he had heard the screams of the wounded who had hidden within he had made the rest of the miles to glenroe mostly at night supporting brigham when he was conscious carrying him when he was not we were afraid for you he managed after a moment afraid the english would come before we could warn you the bullet must come out right away gwen pressed a cloth against the wound as all eyes turned toward her we must find a doctor there is no doctor serena felt the hysteria bubbling up and fought to control it had he been given back to her only so that she could watch him die if we searched for one we would only bring the english down on us i know the risk gwen began they would kill him serena spoke flatly as an english nobleman they would be doubly harsh they would heal his wound only to keep him alive for execution you must take it out ive never done anything like this gwen closed a hand over serenas arm i lack the skill and the knowledge i would kill him in trying to save him panic fluttered beneath her hands brigham moaned and stirred better he die with us here her eyes were grim as she looked down at brigham if you wont try i will do it myself my lady parkinss voice was as expressionless as ever as he stepped forward i will remove the ball with miss macgregors assistance you can you serena gave a brittle laugh were not talking about starching lace man i have done it once before my lady that is once more than you and lord ashburn is my master he said stiffly i will tend him he will need to be held parkins turned his gaze to coll i will hold him serena leaned over brighams body as if to shield him and god help you if the knife slips they built a fire and turned a blade in it until the tip glowed red when brigham surfaced gwen held a bowl of medicine heavily laced with poppies to his lips sweat poured down his face no matter how diligently serena wiped his skin with a cool cloth sit with maggie and mother rena coll said quietly let me hold him down no this is for me to do she braced herself over brigham clasping her hands on his arms then lifted her face to parkins i know you will have to hurt him but for mercys sake be quick the valet had stripped off his coat and rolled back his sleeves to reveal thin spindly arms serena closed her eyes a moment she was putting her love her life into the hands of a man who looked able to do no more than shine boots opening them again she studied the valets face steady she had called him so herself loyal more than loyal she realized as a man could love another he loved brigham with a prayer she nodded for parkins to begin and watched the knife cut into her husbands flesh even dazed by the drug brigham stiffened serena used all her strength to press him down even as she murmured to him nonsense endearments promises she watched the knife go deeper and ignored the rolling of her stomach as the pain of the knife sliced through the swoon and the drug brigham began to fight coll tried to take serenas place but she snarled him away and summoned all her strength there was no sound in the cave but for brighams harsh breathing and the low crackle of the fire but the air was charged with silent prayers said with a unity that made them as strong as a novena serena watched her husbands blood stain the floor of the cave and his face go ashen in her prayers she begged to take some of his pain into herself and spare him ive found it sweat streamed down parkinss face as he probed for the ball in his heart he prayed that his master would fault and escape the pain but his thin hand was steady slowly terrified of causing more damage he began to guide the bullet out keep him still my lady get the damn thing out she shot a furious look at parkins as brigham moaned and struggled under her confining hands he suffers she watched her breathing harsh and unsteady as parkins pried the small ball of metal from brighams flesh before parkins could release the breath he had been holding gwen was taking over we must stop the bleeding he cant lose much more and live competently she began to pack the wound mama will you see to his arm and shoulder they are less severe but look ugly mrs drummond my medicines as brigham went limp again serena leaned back her arms and back were trembling with the pressure carefully mindful now of the child she made herself relax how can i help gwen glanced up only briefly from her work serenas face was as pale as brighams by getting air please leave this to me with a nod serena rose and moved slowly to the mouth of the cave it was nearly dusk again she noted how quickly the time had passed and how strangely a year before it had been brigham carrying a wounded coll now it was brigham who lay near death the time between seemed like a dream filled with love and passion laughter and weeping she could see the hills going purple in the lowering light the land she thought would they now lose even that they had fought they had died coll had told her that their fathers last words had been it will not be for naught but the man she loved lay wounded and the land they had fought for was no longer hers lady ashburn blinking serena brought herself back she was lady ashburn she was a macgregor she laid a hand over her stomach as the child within kicked a new life a new hope no she thought she would not say it had been for naught aye i thought you might enjoy a hot drink she turned nearly smiling at the formal tone of parkinss voice he was wearing his coat again and the perspiring intense man who had removed a bullet might never have been thank you parkins she took the cup and let the liquid soothe her raw throat i would like to apologize for speaking to you as i did pray do not consider it my lady you were distraught serena lifted her hand to her face as she was caught between tears and laughter aye distraught you have a steady hand parkins a steady heart i have always strived to my lady she let out a long breath swiping at her face with her knuckles have you a handkerchief as well of course lady ashburn with a slight bow parkins offered one of sensible cloth parkins you have served lord ashburn today and you have also served me there may be a time when you require a favor of me you have only to ask my service was given without condition my lady aye she took his hand causing him to color a bit i know it the boon is still yours when you need it she offered him back the damp handkerchief i will go sit with my husband now the wind picked up and howled like a wild beast it fought its way through the blanket over the cave opening and sent the flames of the low fire dancing in its shrieks serena heard what her ancestors would have called the spirits of the hills they laughed and moaned and mumbled she felt no fear of them she watched brigham through the night unable to sleep even when gwen pleaded with her the fire burned through him so hot at times serena feared it would eat him alive sometimes he spoke in rambling sporadic sentences that told her he was reliving the battle through his words she saw more clearly than ever how complete the slaughter had been once he spoke to his grandmother telling her despairingly of the dreams that had been shattered by the english guns he called for serena and would be soothed for a time by her murmurs and by her hand cool on his brow he would wake again delirious certain that the english had found her i will sit with him serena fiona knelt beside her laying a comforting arm over her shoulders you need rest for yourself and your child i cannot leave him mama serena wrung out a cool cloth and stroked it over brighams pale face i am easier here than i would be if i tried to sleep just looking at him helps somehow sometimes he opens his eyes and looks at me he knows im with him then sleep here for just a little while put your head in my lap as you did when you were a girl with fionas gentle persuasion serena curled up on the floor of the cave reaching out she covered brighams hand with her own he is beautiful is he not mama with a little smile fiona stroked her daughters hair aye he is beautiful our baby will look like him with those fine gray eyes and strong mouth she closed her eyes and listened to the fearless song of the wind i loved him i think almost from the first i was afraid that was foolish fiona continued to soothe and stroke as serenas words grew slurred with sleep love is often foolish the child is moving she murmured smiling as she drifted off brighams child brighams dreams were unrelenting sometimes he was back on the moor trapped in the smoke and fury of battle men died agonizing deaths around him some by his own hand he could smell the blood and the acrid scent of gunpowder he could hear the pipes and drums and the unrelenting boom of artillery then he was limping through the hills the fire in his side and the mist over his brain he thought he smelt burning wood and flesh and heard screams echoing in his head just when he knew he would scream himself from the sound of it it stopped serena stood beside him wearing a white dress that glittered over her skin her hair falling like melted gold sometimes when he opened his eyes he would see her so clearly that he could make out the smudges of sleeplessness under her eyes then his weighted lids would close again and he would be pitched back onto the battlefield for three days he drifted between consciousness and unconsciousness often delirious he knew nothing of the little world that had been conceived within the cave or of the comings and goings of its people he heard voices but had not the strength to understand or to answer once when he floated to the surface it was dark and he thought he heard a womans quiet weeping another time he heard the thin cry of a baby at the end of three days he fell into a deep dreamless sleep a sleep as peaceful as death waking was something like being born confusing painful helpless the light burned his eyes though it was dim in the rear of the cave weakly he shut them again and tried to orient himself with sounds and smells there was earth and smoke and oddly a smell of cooking food there was also the sickly scent of poppies that spoke of sickness he heard murmurs with the patience of the weak he lay still until he began to make them out coll gwen malcolm relief poured through him nearly as strongly as the delirium if they were here and safe so was serena he opened his eyes again wincing at the light he was gathering his strength to speak when he heard a rustle beside him she was there sitting with her knees curled up close her back against a wall of rock her hair had fallen forward almost curtaining her face a wave of love all but drained him rena he murmured and reached to touch she woke immediately emotions raced across her face as she shifted close to run her hands over his face it was cool blessedly cool brigham she lowered her lips to his youve come back to me there was so much to tell him so much to hear at first brigham was only strong enough to stay awake for an hour at a time the memory of the battle was clear but that of the aftermath was mercifully a blur to him there had been pain a hotter sharper one than the throbbing ache he felt now he remembered being dragged and lifted and carried there had been cool water poured down his burning throat once he remembered coming out of a half swoon when he and coll had stumbled across six bodies gradually at his insistence the gaps were filled in he listened grimly his fury and disgust at cumberlands atrocities offset only by the joy of having serena and his unborn child close to him this place wont be safe for long brigham sat braced against the wall of the cave his face still pale in the dim light it had been two days since he had come out of that fever we need to move as soon as possible toward the coast youre not strong enough serena kept his hand in hers a part of her wanted to stay snug in the cave and forget there was a world outside in answer he brought their joined hands to his lips but his eyes were hard and focused he would be damned if he would see her forced to give birth in a cave i think we could seek help from my kin on skye he looked at gwen how soon will maggie and the baby be fit enough to travel in a day or two but you ill be ready youll be ready when we say you are serena cut in a trace of the old arrogance flickered into his eyes youve grown tyrannical since i last saw you madam she smiled and touched her lips to his i have always been a tyrant sassenach rest now she urged as she settled a blanket over him when your strength returns we shall go anywhere you choose his eyes became very intense and her smile wavered i may hold you to that rena just rest the weariness in his voice made her ache he had left her a strong seemingly invincible man he had come back to her inches from death she would not risk losing him to his own stubbornness perhaps coll and malcolm will bring back meat she lay beside him stroking his brow as he drifted off and wondering why her brothers tarried so long they had seen the smoke from the ridge sprawled on their bellies coll and malcolm looked down at glenroe the english had come again bringing their fire and their hate already the crofts lay in ruins their thatched roofs gone macgregor house was alight and flames flickered out of broken windows damn them coll murmured over and over as he pounded a fist against the rock damn them all why do they burn our houses malcolm was ashamed of the tears and hastened to wipe them away what need is there to destroy our homes the stables he said suddenly and would have risen up if coll hadnt restrained him they would have taken the horses lad malcolm pressed his face to the rock caught between childish tears and a mans fury will they go now and leave us coll remembered the carnage surrounding the battlefield i think they will hunt the hills we must get back to the cave serena lay quietly listening to the comforting domestic sounds young ian was suckling again and maggie hummed to him mrs drummond and parkins murmured over the preparation of a meal easily as if they were still gossiping in the kitchen near maggie fiona worked with a spindle peacefully spinning what would one day be made into a blanket for her grandchild gwen fussed with her jars and pots of medicine they were all together at last together and safe one day when the english grew tired of raping scotland and returned over the border they would go back down to glenroe she would make brigham happy there somehow make him forget the glittering life he had led in london they would build a house of their own near the loch smiling serena shifted away to let brigham sleep she had a passing thought to look out and see if she could spot her brothers returning but even as she stood she heard the sound of someone moving near the mouth of the cave words of greeting were on the tip of her tongue but then she stopped neither coll nor malcolm would have a need to come so cautiously with a hand that had gone suddenly cold she reached for the pistol a shadow blocked out the light at the mouth of the cave then she saw with a sickening lurch of her heart the glint of metal and the telling red of the coat the soldier straightened his sword raised as he took quick stock of his find serena noted that his coat and his face were streaked with dirt and soot there was a look of triumph in his eyes and an unmistakable glint in them when he spotted gwen without a word and with no thought of mercy he advanced on parkins serena lifted the pistol and fired he stumbled back blank surprise showing in his face the instant before he crumpled to the ground thinking only of defending what was hers serena gripped the hilt of her grandfathers claymore another soldier broke in even as she raised the sword she felt a hand close over hers brigham was beside her the soldier teeth bared charged forward leading with his bayonet another shot rang out felling him parkins stood his railthin body shielding mrs drummonds the pistol still smoking in his hand reload brigham ordered thrusting serena behind him as another dragoon pushed into the cave the redcoat didnt advance only stood stiffly for an instant before falling headfirst there was an arrow quivering in his back breathing through his teeth brigham rushed out of the cave there were two more coll was fighting one sword to sword as he maneuvered desperately to shield malcolm with his body the other dragoon advanced on the young boy who held an empty bow as a useless defense with a shout brigham lunged the pain exploded afresh in his side almost blinding him the dragoon swung around but raised his sword again over malcolms head serena fired the freshly loaded pistol from the mouth of the cave and sent a ball into his heart it was over in minutes five dragoons lay dead but the sanctuary of the cave was ended they moved at dusk heading west two of the horses the dragoons had tethered were malcolms own they took shifts riding walking when it was possible they sheltered in mud huts or with the cattle highland hospitality was as it had always been through the people they met they learned of cumberland who was already known as the butcher the persecution was unbearable and the search for the prince through the heather unrelenting houses were in ruin cattle and horses and sheep had been driven off the highlanders never rich faced starvation still they hid their prince and any fugitive who asked for shelter progress was slow with each day bringing its own dangers thousands of troops had been engaged to find the prince it was june before they were able to sail from the mainland to skye where they were taken in by the macdonalds of sleat its as beautiful as she said it was brigham murmured as he stood with serena on the lush green grass of a small slope and looked out at uig bay my grandmother told me how she ran through the grass as a girl and watched the boats it is beautiful the breeze was kind against her face everything is beautiful now that were all together and safe for how long brigham wondered there were troops here as well the sea was being patrolled there were rumors that the prince was near if he was the english would be on his heels a way had to be devised for the prince to return to france or italy but more personally and more importantly serena and the child had to be kept safe he had thought of little else during the days of his recovery during the nights they had traveled like outcasts through the hills of scotland he could not now return to england and give serena what was rightfully hers as lady ashburn nor could he though she had yet to accept it return to glenroe for years to come sit with me serena gladly she laughed a little as he helped her settle what had become a cumbersome weight i shall never be able to face a cow again youve never looked more beautiful you lie she grinned and turned her face for a kiss but the truth wouldnt earn you a kiss with her head on his shoulder she looked out at the bay the sun scattered over it edging the blue with gold like a ladys ball gown it is beautiful here brig im glad you had the chance to see the land where your grandmother grew up that we had the chance to see it together with a little sound of discomfort she rested a hand on her stomach do you feel unwell no better every day since weve come here it was true spiritually she didnt want to tell him how poorly she had begun to feel physically only that morning the ache in her back and the pressure had nearly kept her in bed your grandmothers people have been so kind to us i know i shall always be grateful to them and all the others who gave us shelter his eyes clouded as he looked down over the water it is difficult to understand how they could give shelter so freely to an englishman how can you speak so there was genuine anger in her voice as she gripped his arm it was not your england that has murdered scotland it was is cumberland and his thirst for blood his need to destroy it is he who has laid waste to the glens and in london he is cheered like a hero listen to me her grip gentled as she reached for his hand there was a time i blamed all for the wrongs of a few as you love me dont do the same with a smile she moved his hand over her belly our child carries english blood i am proud of it he brought her close a moment just to hold her again you humble me they remained as they were sitting close clinging to the hope that had come even out of loss you know if i am found here what will happen to the macdonalds it was cowardly but she didnt want to think of it you will not be found i cannot run forever rena nor continue to endanger friend and stranger she plucked nervously at the turf it was so green and smelled so sweet i know but what choice do we have the prince is still hunted i know you worry for him i do but i also worry for you and your child when she started to reassure him he gripped her hands i will never forget that last day in the cave the way you were forced to defend me to kill for me and your family i did what needed to be done what you would have done all those months i felt useless because i could do nothing that day things changed a woman might not join the rebellion on a battlefield but a woman can protect what she loves i will tell you in truth that i have never loved you more than i did that day when you held a sword and a pistol in your hands he kissed them then looked steadily into her eyes can you understand that i wanted to give you beauty not a life of fear and running i wanted to give you what was mine but is mine no longer brigham no wait there is something i must ask you you said you would go with me wherever i chose will you she felt a little pain ripple through her but nodded aye will you leave scotland rena and travel with me to the new world i cannot give you all that i once promised though we wont be poor so many of the things i wanted for you will be left behind you will be only mrs langston and the land and the people will be strange to you to both of us i know what i ask you to give up but perhaps one day we can return ssh overcome she wrapped her arms around him dont you know i would ride into hell with you if you asked i dont ask you to ride into hell but i know what i ask you and what promises i break you promised only to love me and to come back to me you have done both she shook her head before he could speak you must listen and try to understand the weeks i had with you at court were beautiful but only because we were together i have never needed such things brigham the title means nothing to me nor do the balls or the gowns only you with a watery laugh she pulled back every day at holyrood i worried that i would make a mistake and embarrass you that you would see you had made a grave error in judgment in taking me for lady ashburn what nonsense is this i shall never be an easy aristocrat brigham i was afraid you would ask me to go to france to court his eyes narrowed as he studied her your life would be easier there as it was in edinburgh and i would have to pretend to be a lady while i longed for my breeches and a fast ride you would rather go to america with only a chest of gold and a dream she framed his face with her hands england was yours and scotland mine weve lost them together we will make our own i love you rena more than my life brigham the child shall be happy i swear it sooner than we think she managed at his expression she managed another laugh then winced oh i think he has my impatience i need gwen brigham and mother but you said it would be a few weeks yet its not what i say she held a hand over her belly as it hardened with a contraction its what he says she caught her breath then giggled when he swept her awkwardly into his arms brigham there is no need ill break your back at that moment she felt weightless madam he said with a trace of mockery have a little faith epilogue contents prev near the last day of june fourteen months after he had raised his standard prince charles landed near mugston house on the isle of skye he was disguised as the ladys maid of flora macdonald a young woman who risked her life to travel with him and see him to safety he had missed capture by a hairbreadth but had lost neither his ambition nor his eagerness nor had he lost his air of romance he left flora with a lock of his hair and the wish that they might meet again at the court of st james brigham saw him briefly they spoke as they had often spoken in the past with ease and mutual respect charles did not though the hope was in his heart ask brigham to join him on the journey to france you will miss him serena said as they stood in their bedchamber at mugston house i will miss him as a man and i will grieve for the loss of what might have been he gathered her close holding her newly slim body against his it was he and his cause that brought me to you we did not win rena but i have only to look at you and my son to know that neither did we lose with his arm around her he turned to look down at the child they had christened daniel it is as your father said love it has not been for naught he pressed his lips to hers lingering over the kiss drawing out the passion the love and the trust are you ready with a nod she picked up her traveling cloak if only mother and coll and maggie would go with us they need to stay as we need to go he waited as she gathered up the child you will have gwen and malcolm i know i only wish there will be a macgregor in glenroe again serena and we will come back she looked at him the sun was streaming through the window at his back he was as he had been when she had first seen him dark stunningly handsome a little reckless it made her smile even as the baby stirred against her there will be a langston at ashburn manor again daniel will come back or his children will they will have their place there and in the highlands he lifted the chest that held the little dresden shepherdess one day he would give it to his son he had bent to kiss her again when there was a knock on the door your pardon my lord what is it parkins we will lose the tide very well he gestured to the other cases and parkins must i remind you that you are to address me as mr langston now parkins hefted the cases in his thin arms he had asked his favor of his lady and he and the new mrs parkins were traveling to america no my lord he said mildly and proceeded them over brighams oath serena laughed and walked out with the baby you will always be lord ashburn sassenach come she held out a hand to him we are going home
