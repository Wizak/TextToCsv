summer one minute it was ohio winter with doors closed windows locked the panes blind with frost icicles fringing every roof children skiing on slopes housewives lumbering like great black bears in their furs along the icy streets and then a long wave of warmth crossed the small town a flooding sea of hot air it seemed as if someone had left a bakery door open the heat pulsed among the cottages and bushes and children the icicles dropped shattering to melt the doors flew open the windows flew up the children worked off their wool clothes the housewives shed their bear disguises the snow dissolved and showed last summers ancient green lawns rocket summer the words passed among the people in the open airing houses rocket summer the warm desert air changing the frost patterns on the windows erasing the art work the skis and sleds suddenly useless the snow falling from the cold sky upon the town turned to a hot rain before it touched the ground rocket summer people leaned from their dripping porches and watched the reddening sky the rocket lay on the launching field blowing out pink clouds of fire and oven heat the rocket stood in the cold wintar morning making summer with every breath of its mighty exhausts the rocket made climates and summer lay for a brief moment upon the land february ylla they had a house of crystal pillars on the planet mars by the edge of an empty sea and every morning you could see mrs k eating the golden fruits that grew from the crystal walls or cleaning the house with handfuls of magnetic dust which taking all dirt with it blew away on the hot wind afternoons when the fossil sea was warm and motionless and the wine trees stood stiff in the yard and the little distant martian bone town was all enclosed and no one drifted out their doors you could see mr k himself in his room reading from a metal book with raised hieroglyphs over which he brushed his hand as one might play a harp and from the book as his fingers stroked a voice sang a soft ancient voice which told tales of when the sea was red steam on the shore and ancient men had carried clouds of metal insects and electric spiders into battle mr and mrs k had lived by the dead sea for twenty years and their ancestors had lived in the same house which turned and followed the sun flowerlike for ten centuries mr and mrs k were not old they had the fair brownish skin of the true martian the yellow coin eyes the soft musical voices once they had liked painting pictures with chemical fire swimming in the canals in the seasons when the wine trees filled them with green liquors and talking into the dawn together by the blue phosphorous portraits in the speaking room they were not happy now this morning mrs k stood between the pillars listening to the desert sands heat melt into yellow wax and seemingly run on the horizon something was going to happen she waited she watched the blue sky of mars as if it might at any moment grip in on itself contract and expel a shining miracle down upon the sand nothing happened tired of waiting she walked through the misting pillars a gentle rain sprang from the fluted pillar tops cooling the scorched air falling gently on her on hot days it was like walking in a creek the floors of the house glittered with cool streams in the distance she heard her husband playing his book steadily his fingers never tired of the old songs quietly she wished he might one day again spend as much time holding and touching her like a little harp as he did his incredible books but no she shook her head an imperceptible forgiving shrug her eyelids closed softly down upon her golden eyes marriage made people old and familiar while still young she lay back in a chair that moved to take her shape even as she moved she closed her eyes tightly and nervously the dream occurred her brown fingers trembled came up grasped at the air a moment later she sat up startled gasping she glanced about swiftly as if expecting someone there before her she seemed disappointed the space between the pillars was empty her husband appeared in a triangular door did you call he asked irritably no she cried i thought i heard you cry out did i i was almost asleep and had a dream in the daytime you dont often do that she sat as if struck in the face by the dream how strange how very strange she murmured the dream oh he evidently wished to return to his book i dreamed about a man a man a tall man six feet one inch tall how absurd a giant a misshapen giant somehowshe tried the words he looked all right in spite of being tall and he hadoh i know youll think it sillyhe had blue eyes blue eyes gods cried mr k whatll you dream next i suppose he had black hair how did you guess she was excited i picked the most unlikely color he replied coldly well black it was she cried and he had a very white skin oh he was most unusual he was dressed in a strange uniform and he came down out of the sky and spoke pleasantly to me she smiled out of the sky what nonsense he came in a metal thing that glittered in the sun she remembered she closed her eyes to shape it again i dreamed there was the sky and something sparkled like a coin thrown into the air and suddenly it grew large and fell down softly to land a long silver craft round and alien and a door opened in the side of the silver object and this tall man stepped out if you worked harder you wouldnt have these silly dreams i rather enjoyed it she replied lying back i never suspected myself of such an imagination black hair blue eyes and white skin what a strange man and yetquite handsome wishful thinking youre unkind i didnt think him up on purpose he just came in my mind while i drowsed it wasnt like a dream it was so unexpected and different he looked at me and he said ive come from the third planet in my ship my name is nathaniel york a stupid name its no name at all objected the husband of course its stupid because its a dream she explained softly and he said this is the first trip across space there are only two of us in our ship myself and my friend bert another stupid name and he said were from a city on earth thats the name of our planet continued mrs k thats what he said earth was the name he spoke and he used another language somehow i understood him with my mind telepathy i suppose mr k turned away she stopped him with a word yll she called quietly do you ever wonder ifwell if there are people living on the third planet the third planet is incapable of supporting life stated the husband patiently our scientists have said theres far too much oxygen in their atmosphere but wouldnt it be fascinating if there were people and they traveled through space in some sort of ship really ylla you know how i hate this emotional wailing lets get on with our work it was late in the day when she began singing the song as she moved among the whispering pillars of rain she sang it over and over again whats that song snapped her husband at last walking in to sit at the fire table i dont know she looked up surprised at herself she put her hand to her mouth unbelieving the sun was setting the house was closing itself in like a giant flower with the passing of light a wind blew among the pillars the fire table bubbled its fierce pool of silver lava the wind stirred her russet hair crooning softly in her ears she stood silently looking out into the great sallow distances of sea bottom as if recalling something her yellow eyes soft and moist drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine she sang softly quietly slowly or leave a kiss within the cup and ill not ask for wine she hummed now moving her hands in the wind ever so lightly her eyes shut she finished the song it was very beautiful never heard that song before did you compose it he inquired his eyes sharp no yes no i dont know really she hesitated wildly i dont even know what the words are theyre another language what language she dropped portions of meat numbly into the simmering lava i dont know she drew the meat forth a moment later cooked served on a plate for him its just a crazy thing i made up i guess i dont know why he said nothing he watched her drown meats in the hissing fire pool the sun was gone slowly slowly the night came in to fill the room swallowing the pillars and both of them like a dark wine poured to the ceiling only the silver lavas glow lit their faces she hummed the strange song again instantly he leaped from his chair and stalked angrily from the room later in isolation he finished supper when he arose he stretched glanced at her and suggested yawning lets take the flame birds to town tonight to see an entertainment you dont mean it she said are you feeling well whats so strange about that but we havent gone for an entertainment in six months i think its a good idea suddenly youre so solicitous she said dont talk that way he replied peevishly do you or do you not want to go she looked out at the pale desert the twin white moons were rising cool water ran softly about her toes she began to tremble just the least bit she wanted very much to sit quietly here soundless not moving until this thing occurred this thing expected all day this thing that could not occur but might a drift of song brushed through her mind i do you good he urged come along now im tired she said some other night heres your scarf he handed her a phial we havent gone anywhere in months except you twice a week to xi city she wouldnt look at him business he said oh she whispered to herself from the phial a liquid poured turned to blue mist settled about her neck quivering the flame birds waited like a bed of coals glowing on the cool smooth sands the white canopy ballooned on the night wind flapping softly tied by a thousand green ribbons to the birds ylla laid herself back in the canopy and at a word from her husband the birds leaped burning toward the dark sky the ribbons tautened the canopy lifted the sand slid whining under the blue hills drifted by drifted by leaving their home behind the raining pillars the caged flowers the singing books the whispering floor creeks she did not look at her husband she heard him crying out to the birds as they rose higher like ten thousand hot sparkles so many redyellow fireworks in the heavens tugging the canopy like a flower petal burning through the wind she didnt watch the dead ancient bonechess cities slide under or the old canals filled with emptiness and dreams past dry rivers and dry lakes they flew like a shadow of the moon like a torch burning she watched only the sky the husband spoke she watched the sky did you hear what i said what he exhaled you might pay attention i was thinking i never thought you were a nature lover but youre certainly interested in the sky tonight he said its very beautiful i was figuring said the husband slowly i thought id call hulle tonight id like to talk to him about us spending some time oh only a week or so in the blue mountains its just an idea the blue mountains she held to the canopy rim with one hand turning swiftly toward him oh its just a suggestion when do you want to go she asked trembling i thought we might leave tomorrow morning you know an early start and all that he said very casually but we never go this early in the year just this once i thought he smiled do us good to get away some peace and quiet you know you havent anything else planned well go wont we she took a breath waited and then replied no what his cry startled the birds the canopy jerked no she said firmly its settled i wont go he looked at her they did not speak after that she turned away the birds flew on ten thousand flrebrands down the wind in the dawn the sun through the crystal pillars melted the fog that supported ylla as she slept all night she had hung above the floor buoyed by the soft carpeting of mist that poured from the walls when she lay down to rest all night she had slept on this silent river like a boat upon a soundless tide now the fog burned away the mist level lowered until she was deposited upon the shore of wakening she opened her eyes her husband stood over her he looked as if he had stood there for hours watching she did not know why but she could not look him in the face youve been dreaming again he said you spoke out and kept me awake i really think you should see a doctor ill be all right you talked a lot in your sleep did i she started up dawn was cold in the room a gray light filled her as she lay there what was your dream she had to think a moment to remember the ship it came from the sky again landed and the tall man stepped out and talked to me telling me little jokes laughing and it was pleasant mr k touched a pillar founts of warm water leaped up steaming the chill vanished from the room mr ks face was impassive and then she said this man who said his strange name was nathaniel york told me i was beautiful andand kissed me ha cried the husband turning violently away his jaw working its only a dream she was amused keep your silly feminine dreams to yourself youre acting like a child she lapsed back upon the few remaining remnants of chemical mist after a moment she laughed softly i thought of some more of the dream she confessed well what is it what is it he shouted yll youre so badtempered tell me he demanded you cant keep secrets from me his face was dark and rigid as he stood over her ive never seen you this way she replied half shocked half entertained all that happened was this nathaniel york person told mewell he told me that hed take me away into his ship into the sky with him and take me back to his planet with him its really quite ridiculous ridiculous is it he almost screamed you should have heard yourself fawning on him talking to him singing with him oh gods all night you should have heard yourself yll whens he landing wheres he coming down with his damned ship yll lower your voice voice be damned he bent stiffly over her and in this dreamhe seized her wristdidnt the ship land over in green valley didnt it answer me why yes and it landed this afternoon didnt it he kept at her yes yes i think so yes but only in a dream wellhe flung her hand away stifflyits good youre truthful i heard every word you said in your sleep you mentioned the valley and the time breathing hard he walked between the pillars like a man blinded by a lightning bolt slowly his breath returned she watched him as if he were quite insane she arose finally and went to him yll she whispered im all right youre sick no he forced a tired smile just childish forgive me darling he gave her a rough pat too much work lately im sorry i think ill lie down awhile you were so excited im all right now fine he exhaled lets forget it say i heard a joke about uel yesterday i meant to tell you what do you say you fix breakfast ill tell the joke and lets not talk about all this it was only a dream of course he kissed her cheek mechanically only a dream at noon the sun was high and hot and the hills shimmered in the light arent you going to town asked ylla town he raised his brows faintly this is the day you always go she adjusted a flower cage on its pedestal the flowers stirred opening their hungry yellow mouths he closed his book no its too hot and its late oh she finished her task and moved toward the door well ill be back soon wait a minute where are you going she was in the door swiftly over to paos she invited me today i havent seen her in a long time its only a little way over in green valley isnt it yes just a walk not far i thought id she hurried im sorry really sorry he said running to fetch her back looking very concerned about his forgetfulness it slipped my mind i invited dr nlle out this afternoon dr nile she edged toward the door he caught her elbow and drew her steadily in yes but pao pan can wait ylla we must entertain nile just for a few minutes no ylla no he shook his head no besides its a terribly long walk to paos all the way over through green valley and then past the big canal and down isnt it and itll be very very hot and dr nile would be delighted to see you well she did not answer she wanted to break and run she wanted to cry out but she only sat in the chair turning her fingers over slowly staring at them expressionlessly trapped ylla he murmured you will be here wont you yes she said after a long time ill be here all afternoon her voice was dull all afternoon late in the day dr nile had not put in an appearance yllas husband did not seem overly surprised when it was quite late he murmured something went to a closet and drew forth an evil weapon a long yellowish tube ending in a bellows and a trigger he turned and upon his face was a mask hammered from silver metal expressionless the mask that he always wore when he wished to hide his feelings the mask which curved and hollowed so exquisitely to his thin cheeks and chin and brow the mask glinted and he held the evil weapon in his hands considering it it hummed constantly an insect hum from it hordes of golden bees could be flung out with a high shriek golden horrid bees that stung poisoned and fell lifeless like seeds on the sand where are you going she asked what he listened to the bellows to the evil hum if dr nile is late ill be damned if ill wait im going out to hunt a bit ill be back you be sure to stay right here now wont you the silver mask glimmered yes and tell dr nile ill return just hunting the triangular door closed his footsteps faded down the hill she watched him walking through the sunlight until he was gone then she resumed her tasks with the magnetic dusts and the new fruits to be plucked from the crystal walls she worked with energy and dispatch but on occasion a numbness took hold of her and she caught herself singing that odd and memorable song and looking out beyond the crystal pillars at the sky she held her breath and stood very still waiting it was coming nearer at any moment it might happen it was like those days when you heard a thunderstorm coming and there was the waiting silence and then the faintest pressure of the atmosphere as the climate blew over the land in shifts and shadows and vapors and the change pressed at your ears and you were suspended in the waiting time of the coming storm you began to tremble the sky was stained and coloured the clouds were thickened the mountains took on an iron taint the caged flowers blew with faint sighs of warning you felt your hair stir softly somewhere in the house the voiceclock sang time time time time ever so gently no more than water tapping on velvet and then the storm the electric illumination the engulfments of dark wash and sounding black fell down shutting in forever thats how it was a storm gathered yet the sky was clear lightning was expected yet there was no cloud ylla moved through the breathless summer house lightning would strike from the sky any instant there would be a thunderclap a boil of smoke a silence footsteps on the path a rap on the crystalline door and her running to answer crazy ylla she scoffed why think these wild things with your idle mind and then it happened there was a warmth as of a great fire passing in the air a whirling rushing sound a gleam in the sky of metal ylla cried out running through the pillars she flung wide a door she faced the hills but by this time there was nothing she was about to race down the hill when she stopped herself she was supposed to stay here go nowhere the doctor was coming to visit and her husband would be angry if she ran off she waited in the door breathing rapidly her hand out she strained to see over toward green valley but saw nothing silly woman she went inside you and your imagination she thought that was nothing but a bird a leaf the wind or a fish in the canal sit down rest she sat down a shot sounded very clearly sharply the sound of the evil insect weapon her body jerked with it it came from a long way off one shot the swift humming distant bees one shot and then a second shot precise and cold and far away her body winced again and for some reason she started up screaming and screaming and never wanting to stop screaming she ran violently through the house and once more threw wide the door the echoes were dying away away gone she waited in the yard her face pale for five minutes finally with slow steps her head down she wandered about the pillared rooms laying her hand to things her lips quivering until finally she sat alone in the darkening wine room waiting she began to wipe an amber glass with the hem of her scarf and then from far off the sound of footsteps crunching on the thin small rocks she rose up to stand in the center of the quiet room the glass fell from her fingers smashing to bits the footsteps hesitated outside the door should she speak should she cry out come in oh come in she went forward a few paces the footsteps walked up the ramp a hand twisted the door latch she smiled at the door the door opened she stopped smiling it was her husband his silver mask glowed dully he entered the room and looked at her for only a moment then he snapped the weapon bellows open cracked out two dead bees heard them spat on the floor as they fell stepped on them and placed the empty bellows gun in the corner of the room as ylla bent down and tried over and over with no success to pick up the pieces of the shattered glass what were you doing she asked nothing he said with his back turned he removed the mask but the guni heard you fire it twice just hunting once in a while you like to hunt did dr nile arrive no wait a minute he snapped his fingers disgustedly why i remember now he was supposed to visit us tomorrow afternoon how stupid of me they sat down to eat she looked at her food and did not move her hands whats wrong he asked not looking up from dipping his meat in the bubbling lava i dont know im not hungry she said why not i dont know im just not the wind was rising across the sky the sun was going down the room was small and suddenly cold ive been trying to remember she said in the silent room across from her cold erect goldeneyed husband remember what he sipped his wine that song that fine and beautiful song she closed her eyes and hummed but it was not the song ive forgotten it and somehow i dont want to forget it its something i want always to remember she moved her hands as if the rhythm might help her to remember all of it then she lay back in her chair i cant remember she began to cry why are you crying he asked i dont know i dont know but i cant help it im sad and i dont know why i cry and i dont know why but im crying her head was in her hands her shoulders moved again and again youll be all right tomorrow he said she did not look up at him she looked only at the empty desert and the very bright stars coming out now on the black sky and far away there was a sound of wind rising and canal waters stirring cold in the long canals she shut her eyes trembling yes she said ill be all right tomorrow august the summer night in the stone galleries the people were gathered in clusters and groups filtering up into shadows among the blue hills a soft evening light shone over them from the stars and the luminous double moons of mars beyond the marble amphitheater in darkness and distances lay little towns and villas pools of silver water stood motionless and canals glittered from horizon to horizon it was an evening in summer upon the placid and temperate planet mars up and down green wine canals boats as delicate as bronze flowers drifted in the long and endless dwellings that curved like tranquil snakes across the hills lovers lay idly whispering in cool night beds the last children ran in torchlit alleys gold spiders in their hands throwing out films of web here or there a late supper was prepared in tables where lava bubbled silvery and hushed in the amphitheaters of a hundred towns on the night side of mars the brown martian people with gold coin eyes were leisurely met to fix their attention upon stages where musicians made a serene music flow up like blossom scent on the still air upon one stage a woman sang the audience stirred she stopped singing she put her hand to her throat she nodded to the musicians and they began again the musicians played and she sang and this time the audience sighed and sat forward a few of the men stood up in surprise and a winter chill moved through the amphitheater for it was an odd and a frightening and a strange song this woman sang she tried to stop the words from coming out of her lips but the words were these she walks in beauty like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies and all thats best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes the singer dasped her hands to her mouth she stood bewildered what words are those asked the musicians what song is that what language is that and when they blew again upon their golden horns the strange music came forth and passed slowly over the audience which now talked aloud and stood up whats wrong with you the musicians asked each other what tune is that you played what tune did you play the woman wept and ran from the stage and the audience moved out of the amphitheater and all around the nervous towns of mars a similar thing had happened a coldness had come like white snow falling on the air in the black alleys under the torches the children sang and when she got there the cupboard was bare and so her poor dog had none children voices cried what was that rhyme where did you learn it we just thought of it all of a sudden its just words we dont understand doors slammed the streets were deserted above the blue hills a green star rose all over the night side of mars lovers awoke to listen to their loved ones who lay humming in the darkness what is that tune and in a thousand villas in the middle of the night women awoke screaming they had to be soothed while the tears ran down their faces there there sleep whats wrong a dream something terrible will happen in the morning nothing can happen all is well with us a hysterical sobbing it is coming nearer and nearer and nearer nothing can happen to us what could sleep now sleep it was quiet in the deep morning of mars as quiet as a cool and black well with stars shining in the canal waters and breathing in every room the children curled with their spiders in closed hands the lovers arm in arm the moons gone the torches cold the stone amphitheaters deserted the only sound just before dawn was a night watchman far away down a lonely street walking along in the darkness humming a very strange song august the earth men whoever was knocking at the door didnt want to stop mrs ttt threw the door open well you speak english the man standing there was astounded i speak what i speak she said its wonderful english the man was in uniform there were three men with him in a great hurry all smiling all dirty what do you want demanded mrs ttt you are a martian the man smiled the word is not familiar to you certainly its an earth expression he nodded at his then we are from earth im captain williams weve landed on mars within the hour here we are the second expedition there was a first expedition but we dont know what happened to it but here we are anyway and you are the first martian weve met martian her eyebrows went up what i mean to say is you live on the fourth planet from the sun correct elementary she snapped eyeing them and wehe pressed his chubby pink hand to his chest we are from earth right men right sir a chorus this is the planet tyrr she said if you want to use the proper name tyrr tyrr the captain laughed exhaustedly what a fine name but my good woman how is it you speak such perfect english im not speaking im thinking she said telepathy good day and she slammed the door a moment later there was that dreadful man knocking again she whipped the door open what now she wondered the man was still there trying to smile looking bewildered he put out his hands i dont think you understand what she snapped the man gazed at her in surprise were from earth i havent time she said ive a lot of cooking today and theres cleaning and sewing and all you evidently wish to see mr ttt hes upstairs in his study yes said the earth man confusedly blinking by all means let us see mr ttt hes busy she slammed the door again this time the knock on the door was most impertinently loud see here cried the man when the door was thrust open again he jumped in as if to surprise her this is no way to treat visitors all over my clean floor she cried mud get out if you come in my house wash your boots first the man looked in dismay at his muddy boots this he said is no time for trivialities i think he said we should be celebrating he looked at her for a long time as if looking might make her understand if youve made my crystal buns fall in the oven she exclaimed ill hit you with a piece of wood she peered into a little hot oven she came back red steamyfaced her eyes were sharp yellow her skin was soft brown she was thin and quick as an insect her voice was metallic and sharp wait here ill see if i can let you have a moment with mr ttt what was your business the man swore luridly as if shed hit his hand with a hammer tell him were from earth and its never been done before what hasnt she put her brown hand up never mind ill be back the sound of her feet fluttered through the stone house outside the immense blue martian sky was hot and still as a warm deep sea water the martian desert lay broiling like a prehistoric mud pot waves of heat rising and shimmering there was a small rocket ship reclining upon a hilltop nearby large footprints came from the rocket to the door of this stone house now there was a sound of quarreling voices upstairs the men within the door stared at one another shifting on their boots twiddling their fingers and holding onto their hip belts a mans voice shouted upstairs the womans voice replied after fifteen minutes the earth men began walking in and out the kitchen door with nothing to do cigarette said one of the men somebody got out a pack and they lit up they puffed slow streams of pale white smoke they adjusted their uniforms fixed their collars the voices upstairs continued to mutter and chant the leader of the men looked at his watch twentyfive minutes he said i wonder what theyre up to up there he went to a window and looked out hot day said one of the men yeah said someone else in the slow warm time of early afternoon the voices had faded to a murmur and were now silent there was not a sound in the house all the men could hear was their own breathing an hour of silence passed i hope we didnt cause any trouble said the captain he went and peered into the living room mrs ttt was there watering some flowers that grew in the center of the room i knew i had forgotten something she said when she saw the captain she walked out to the kitchen im sorry she handed him a slip of paper mr ttt is much too busy she turned to her cooking anyway its not mr ttt you want to see its mr aaa take that paper over to the next farm by the blue canal and mr aaall advise you about whatever it is you want to know we dont want to know anything objected the captain pouting out his thick lips we already know it you have the paper what more do you want she asked him straight off and she would say no more well said the captain reluctant to go he stood as if waiting for something he looked like a child staring at an empty christmas tree well he said again come on men the four men stepped out into the hot silent day half an hour later mr aaa seated in his library sipping a bit of electric fire from a metal cup heard the voices outside in the stone causeway he leaned over the window sill and gazed at the four uniformed men who squinted up at him are you mr aaa they called i am mr ttt sent us to see you shouted the captain why did he do that asked mr aaa he was busy well thats a shame said mr ass sarcastically does he think i have nothing else to do but entertain people hes too busy to bother with thats not the important thing sir shouted the captain well it is to me i have much reading to do mr ttt is inconsiderate this is not the first time he has been this thoughtless of me stop waving your hands sir until i finish and pay attention people usually listen to me when i talk and youll listen courteously or i wont talk at all uneasily the four men in the court shifted and opened their mouths and once the captain the veins on his face bulging showed a few little tears in his eyes now lectured mr aaa do you think it fair of mr ttt to be so illmannered the four men gazed up through the heat the captain said were from earth i think it very ungentlemanly of him brooded mr aaa a rocket ship we came in it over there not the first time ttts been unreasonable you know all the way from earth why for half a mind id call him up and tell him off just the four of us myself and these three men my crew ill call him up yes thats what ill do earth rocket men trip space call him and give him a good lashing cried mr aaa he vanished like a puppet from a stage for a minute there were angry voices back and forth over some weird mechanism or other below the captain and his crew glanced longingly back at their pretty rocket ship lying on the hillside so sweet and lovely and fine mr aaa jerked up in the window wildly triumphant challenged him to a duel by the gods a duel mr aaa the captain started all over again quietly ill shoot him dead do you hear mr aaa id like to tell you we came sixty million miles mr aaa regarded the captain for the first time whered you say you were from the captain flashed a white smile aside to his men he withpered now were getting someplace to mr aaa he called we traveled sixty million miles from earth mr aaa yawned thats only fifty million miles this time of year he picked up a frightfullooking weapon well i have to go now just take that silly note though i dont know what good itll do you and go over that hill into the little town of iopr and tell mr iii all about it hes the man you want to see not mr ttt hes an idiot im going to kill him not me because youre not in my line of work line of work line of work bleated the captain do you have to be in a certain line of work to welcome earth men dont be silly everyone knows that mr aaa rushed downstairs goodby and down the causeway he raced like a pair of wild calipers the four travelers stood shocked finally the captain said well find someone yet wholl listen to us maybe we could go out and come in again said one of the men in a dreary voice maybe we should take off and land again give them time to organize a party that might be a good idea murmured the tired captain the little town was full of people drifting in and out of doors saying hello to one another wearing golden masks and blue masks and crimson masks for pleasant variety masks with silver lips and bronze eyebrows masks that smiled or masks that frowned according to the owners dispositions the four men wet from their long walk paused and asked a little girl where mr iiis house was there the child nodded her head the captain got eagerly carefully down on one knee looking into her sweet young face little girl i want to talk to you he seated her on his knee and folded her small brown hands neatly in his own big ones as if ready for a bedtime story which he was shaping in his mind slowly and with a great patient happiness in details well heres how it is little girl six months ago another rocket came to mars there was a man named york in it and his assistant whatever happened to them we dont know maybe they crashed they came in a rocket so did we you should see it a big rocket so were the second expedition following up the first and we came all the way from earth the little girl disengaged one hand without thinking about it and clapped an expressionless golden mask over her face then she pulled forth a golden spider toy and dropped it to the ground while the captain talked on the toy spider climbed back up to her knee obediently while she speculated upon it coolly through the slits of her emotionless mask and the captain shook her gently and urged his story upon her were earth men he said do you believe me yes the little girl peeped at the way she was wiggling her toes in the dust fine the captain pinched her arm a little bit with joviality a little bit with meanness to get her to look at him we built our own rocket ship do you believe that the little girl dug in her nose with a finger yes andtake your finger out of your nose little girli am the captain and never before in history has anybody come across space in a big rocket ship recited the little creature eyes shut wonderful how did you know oh telepathy she wiped a casual finger on her knee well arent you just ever so excited cried the captain arent you glad you just better go see mr iii right away she dropped her toy to the ground mr iii will like talking to you she ran off with the toy spider scuttling obediently after her the captain squatted there looking after her with his hand out his eyes were watery in his head he looked at his empty hands his mouth hung open the other three men stood with their shadows under them they spat on the stone street mr iii answered his door he was on his way to a lecture but he had a minute if they would hurry inside and tell him what they desired a little attention said the captain redeyed and tired were from earth we have a rocket there are four of us crew and captain were exhausted were hungry wed like a place to sleep wed like someone to give us the key to the city or something like that and wed like somebody to shake our hands and say hooray and say congratulations old man that about sums it up mr iii was a tall vaporous thin man with thick blind blue crystals over his yellowish eyes he bent over his desk and brooded upon some papers glancing now and again with extreme penetration at his guests well i havent the forms with me here i dont think he rummaged through the desk drawers now where did i put the forms he mused somewhere somewhere oh here we are now he handed the papers over crisply youll have to sign these papers of course do we have to go through all this rigmarole mr iii gave him a thick glassy look you say youre from earth dont you well then theres nothing for it but you sign the captain wrote his name do you want my crew to sign also mr iii looked at the captain looked at the three others and burst into a shout of derision them sign ho how marvelous them oh them sign tears sprang from his eyes he slapped his knee and bent to let his laughter jerk out of his gaping mouth he held himself up with the desk them sign the four men scowled whats funny them sign sighed mr iii weak with hilarity so very funny ill have to tell mr xxx about this he examined the filledout form still laughing everything seems to be in order he nodded even the agreement for euthanasia if final decision on such a step is necessary he chuckled agreement for what dont talk i have something for you here take this key the captain flushed its a great honor not the key to the city you fool snapped mr iii just a key to the house go down that corridor unlock the big door and go inside and shut the door tight you can spend the night there in the morning ill send mr xxx to see you dubiously the captain took the key in hand he stood looking at the floor his men did not move they seemed to be emptied of all their blood and their rocket fever they were drained dry what is it whats wrong inquired mr iii what are you waiting for what do you want he came and peered up into the captains face stooping out with it you i dont suppose you could even suggested the captain i mean that is try to or think about he hesitated weve worked hard weve come a long way and maybe you could just shake our hands and say well done do youthink his voice faded mr iii stuck out his hand stiffly congratulations he smiled a cold smile congratulations he turned away i must go now use that key without noticing them again as if they had melted down through the floor mr iii moved about the room packing a little manuscript case with papers he was in the room another five minutes but never again addressed the solemn quartet that stood with heads down their heavy legs sagging the light dwindling from their eyes when mr iii went out the door he was busy looking at his fingernails they straggled along the corridor in the dull silent afternoon light they came to a large burnished silver door and the silver key opened it they entered shut the door and turned they were in a vast sunlit hall men and woman sat at tables and stood in conversing groups at the sound of the door they regarded the four uniformed men one martian stepped forward bowing i am mr uuu he said and i am captain jonathan williams of new york city on earth said the captain without emphasis immediately the hall exploded the rafters trembled with shouts and cries the people rushing forward waved and shrieked happily knocking down tables swarming rollicking seizing the four earth men lifting them swiftly to their shoulders they charged about the hall six times six times making a full and wonderful circuit of the room jumping bounding singing the earth men were so stunned that they rode the toppling shoulders for a full minute before they began to laugh and shout at each other hey this is more like it this is the life boy yay yow whoopee they winked tremendously at each other they flung up their hands to clap the air hey hooray said the crowd they set the earth men on a table the shouting died the captain almost broke into tears thank you its good its good tell us about yourselves suggested mr uuu the captain cleared his throat the audience ohed and ahed as the captain talked he introduced his crew each made a small speech and was embarrassed by the thunderous applause mr uuu dapped the captains shoulder its good to see another man from earth i am from earth also how was that again there are many of us here from earth you from earth the captain stared but is that possible did you come by rocket has space travel been going on for centuries his voice was disappointed whatwhat country are you from tuiereol i came by the spirit of my body years ago tuiereol the captain mouthed the word i dont know that country whats this about spirit of body and miss rrr over here shes from earth too arent you miss rrr miss rrr nodded and laughed strangely and so is mr www and mr qqq and mr vvv im from jupiter declared one man preening himself im from saturn said another eyes glinting slyly jupiter saturn murmured the captain blinking it was very quiet now the people stood around and sat at the tables which were strangely empty for banquet tables their yellow eyes were glowing and there were dark shadows under their cheekbones the captain noticed for the first time that there were no windows the light seemed to permeate the walls there was only one door the captain winced this is confusing where on earth is this tuiereol is it near america what is america you never heard of america you say youre from earth and yet you dont know mr uuu drew himself up angrily earth is a place of seas and nothing but seas there is no land i am from earth and know wait a minute the captain sat back you look like a regular martian yellow eyes brown skin earth is a place of all jungle said miss rrr proudly im from orri on earth a civilization built of silver now the captain turned his head from and then to mr uuu and then to mr www and mr zzz and mr nnn and mr hhh and mr bbb he saw their yellow eyes waxing and waning in the light focusing and unfocusing he began to shiver finally he turned to his men and regarded them somberly do you realize what this is what sir this is no celebration replied the captain tiredly this is no banquet these arent government representatives this is no surprise party look at their eyes listen to them nobody breathed there was only a soft white move of eyes in the close room now i understandthe captains voice was far away why everyone gave us notes and passed us on one from the other until we met mr iii who sent us down a corridor with a key to open a door and shut a door and here we are where are we sir the captain exhaled in an insane asylum it was night the large hall lay quiet and dimly illuminated by hidden light sources in the transparent walls the four earth men sat around a wooden table their bleak heads bent over their whispers on the floors men and women lay huddled there were little stirs in the dark corners solitary men or women gesturing their hands every halfhour one of the captains men would try the silver door and return to the table nothing doing sir were locked in proper they think were really insane sir quite thats why there was no hullabaloo to welcome us they merely tolerated what to them must be a constantly recurring psychotic condition he gestured at the dark sleeping shapes all about them paranoids every single one what a welcome they gave us for a moment therea little fire rose and died in his eyesi thought we were getting our true reception all the yelling and singing and speeches pretty nice wasnt itwhile it lasted how long will they keep us here sir until we prove were not psychotics that should be easy i hope so you dont sound very certain sir im not look in that corner a man squatted alone in darkness out of his mouth issued a blue flame which turned into the round shape of a small naked woman it flourished on the air softly in vapors of cobalt light whispering and sighing the captain nodded at another corner a woman stood there changing first she was embedded in a crystal pillar then she melted into a golden statue finally a staff of polished cedar and back to a woman all through the midnight hall people were juggling thin violet flames shifting changing for nighttime was the time of change and affliction magicians sorcerers whispered one of the earth men no hallucination they pass their insanity over into us so that we see their hallucinations too telepathy autosuggestion and telepathy is that what worries you sir yes if hallucinations can appear this real to us to anyone if hallucinations are catching and almost believable its no wonder they mistook us for psychotics if that man can produce little blue fire women and that woman there melt into a pillar how natural if normal martians think we produce our rocket ship with our minds oh said his men in the shadows around them in the vast hall flames leaped blue flared evaporated little demons of red sand ran between the teeth of sleeping men women became oily snakes there was a smell of reptiles and animals in the morning everyone stood around looking fresh happy and normal there were no flames or demons in the room the captain and his men waited by the silver door hoping it would open mr xxx arrived after about four hours they had a suspicion that he had waited outside the door peering in at them for at least three hours before he stepped in beckoned and led them to his small office he was a jovial smiling man if one could believe the mask he wore for upon it was painted not one smile but three behind it his voice was the voice of a not so smiling psychologist what seems to be the trouble you think were insane and were not said the captain contrarily i do not think all of you are insane the psychologist pointed a little wand at the captain no just you sir the others are secondary hallucinations the captain slapped his knee so thats it thats why mr iii laughed when i suggested my men sign the papers too yes mr iii told me the psychologist laughed out of the carved smiling mouth a good joke where was i secondary hallucinations yes women come to me with snakes crawling from their ears when i cure them the snakes vanish well be glad to be cured go right ahead mr xxx seemed surprised unusual not many people want to be cured the cure is drastic you know cure ahead im confident youll find were all sane let me check your papers to be sure theyre in order for a cure he checked a file yes you know such cases as yours need special curing the people in that hall are simpler forms but once youve gone this far i must point out with primary secondary auditory olfactory and labial hallucinations as well as tactile and optical fantasies it is pretty bad business we have to resort to euthanasia the captain leaped up with a roar look here weve stood quite enough test us tap our knees check our hearts exercise us ask questions you are free to speak the captain raved for an hour the psychologist listened incredible he mused most detailed dream fantasy ive ever heard god damn it well show you the rocket ship screamed the captain id like to see it can you manifest it in this room oh certainly its in that file of yours under r mr xxx peered seriously into his file he went tsk and shut the file solemnly why did you tell me to look the rocket isnt there of course not you idiot i was joking does an insane man joke you find some odd senses of humor now take me out to your rocket i wish to see it it was noon the day was very hot when they reached the rocket so the psychologist walked up to the ship and tapped it it gonged softly may i go inside he asked slyly you may mr xxx stepped in and was gone for a long time of all the silly exasperating things the captain chewed a cigar as he waited for two cents id go back home and tell people not to bother with mars what a suspicious bunch of louts i gather that a good number of their population are insane sir that seems to be their main reason for doubting nevertheless this is all so damned irritating the psychologist emerged from the ship after half an hour of prowling tapping listening smelling tasting now do you believe shouted the captain as if he were deaf the psychologist shut his eyes and scratched his nose this is the most incredible example of sensual hallucination and hypnotic suggestion ive ever encountered i went through your rocket as you call it he tapped the hull i hear it auditory fantasy he drew a breath i smell it olfactory hallucination induced by sensual telepathy he kissed the ship i taste it labial fantasy he shook the captains hand may i congratulate you you are a psychotic genius you have done a most complete job the task of projecting your psychotic image life into the mind of another via telepathy and keeping the hallucinations from becoming sensually weaker is almost impossible those people in the house usually concentrate on visuals or at the most visuals and auditory fantasies combined you have balanced the whole conglomeration your insanity is beautifully complete my insanity the captain was pale yes yes what a lovely insanity metal rubber gravitizers foods clothing fuel weapons ladders nuts bolts spoons ten thousand separate items i checked on your vessel never have i seen such a complexity there were even shadows under the bunks and under everything such concentration of will and everything no matter how or when tested had a smell a solidity a taste a sound let me embrace you he stood back at last ill write this into my greatest monograph ill speak of it at the martian academy next month look at you why youve even changed your eye color from yellow to blue your skin to pink from brown and those clothes and your hands having five fingers instead of six biological metamorphosis through psychological imbalance and your three friends he took out a little gun incurable of course you poor wonderful man you will be happier dead have you any last words stop for gods sake dont shoot you sad creature i shall put you out of this misery which has driven you to imagine this rocket and these three men it will be most engrossing to watch your friends and your rocket vanish once i have killed you i will write a neat paper on the dissolvement of neurotic images from what i perceive here today im from earth my name is jonathan williams and these yes i know soothed mr xxx and fired his gun the captain fell with a bullet in his heart the other three men screamed mr xxx stared at them you continue to exist this is superb hallucinations with time and spatial persistence he pointed the gun at them well ill scare you into dissolving no cried the three men an auditory appeal even with the patient dead observed mr xxx as he shot the three men down they lay on the sand intact not moving he kicked them then he rapped on the ship it persists they persist he fired his gun again and again at the bodies then he stood back the smiling mask dropped from his face slowly the little psychologists face changed his jaw sagged the gun dropped from his fingers his eyes were dull and vacant he put his hands up and turned in a blind cirde he fumbled at the bodies saliva filling his mouth hallucinations he mumbled frantically taste sight smell sound feeling he waved his hands his eyes bulged his mouth began to give off a faint froth go away he shouted at the bodies go away he screamed at the ship he examined his trembling hands contaminated he whispered wildly carried over into me telepathy hypnosis now im insane now im contaminated hallucinations in all their sensual forms he stopped and searched around with his numb hands for the gun only one cure only one way to make them go away vanish a shot rang out mr xxx fell the four bodies lay in the sun mr xxx lay where he fell the rocket reclined on the little sunny hill and didnt vanish when the town people found the rocket at sunset they wondered what it was nobody knew so it was sold to a junkman and hauled off to be broken up for scrap metal that night it rained all night the next day was fair and warm march the taxpayer he wanted to go to mars on the rocket he went down to the rocket field in the early morning and yelled in through the wire fence at the men in uniform that he wanted to go to mars he told them he was a taxpayer his name was pritchard and he had a right to go to mars wasnt he born right here in ohio wasnt he a good citizen then why couldnt he go to mars he shook his fists at them and told them that he wanted to get away from earth anybody with any sense wanted to get away from earth there was going to be a big atomic war on earth in about two years and he didnt want to be here when it happened he and thousands of others like him if they had any sense would go to mars see if they wouldnt to get away from wars and censorship and statism and conscription and government control of this and that of art and science you could have earth he was offering his good right hand his heart his head for the opportunity to go to mars what did you have to do what did you have to sign whom did you have to know to get on the rocket they laughed out through the wire screen at him he didnt want to go to mars they said didnt he know that the first and second expeditions had failed had vanished the men were probably dead but they couldnt prove it they didnt know for sure he said clinging to the wire fence maybe it was a land of milk and honey up there and captain york and captain williams had just never bothered to come back now were they going to open the gate and let him in to board the third expeditionary rocket or was he going to have to kick it down they told him to shut up he saw the men walking out to the rocket wait for me he cried dont leave me here on this terrible world ive got to get away theres going to be an atom war dont leave me on earth they dragged him struggling away they slammed the policewagon door and drove him off into the early morning his face pressed to the rear window and just before they sirened over a hill he saw the red fire and heard the big sound and felt the huge tremor as the silver rocket shot up and left him behind on an ordinary monday morning on the ordinary planet earth april the third expedition the ship came down from space it came from the stars and the black velocities and the shining movements and the silent gulfs of space it was a new ship it had fire in its body and men in its metal cells and it moved with a clean silence fiery and warm in it were seventeen men induding a captain the crowd at the ohio field had shouted and waved their hands up into the sunlight and the rocket had bloomed out great flowers of heat and color and run away into space on the third voyage to mars now it was decelerating with metal efficiency in the upper martian atmospheres it was still a thing of beauty and strength it had moved in the midnight waters of space like a pale sea leviathan it had passed the ancient moon and thrown itself onward into one nothingness following another the men within it had been battered thrown about sickened made well again each in his turn one man had died but now the remaining sixteen with their eyes clear in their heads and their faces pressed to the thick glass ports watched mars swing up under them mars cried navigator lustig good old mars said samuel hinkston archaeologist well said captain john black the rocket landed on a lawn of green grass outside upon this lawn stood an iron deer further up on the green stood a tall brown victorian house quiet in the sunlight all covered with scrolls and rococo its windows made of blue and pink and yellow and green colored glass upon the porch were hairy geraniums and an old swing which was hooked into the porch ceiling and which now swung back and forth back and forth in a little breeze at the summit of the house was a cupola with diamond leadedglass windows and a duncecap roof through the front window you could see a piece of music titled beautiful ohio sitting on the music rest around the rocket in four directions spread the little town green and motionless in the martian spring there were white houses and red brick ones and tall elm trees blowing in the wind and tall maples and horse chestnuts and church steeples with golden bells silent in them the rocket men looked out and saw this then they looked at one another and then they looked out again they held to each others elbows suddenly unable to breathe it seemed their faces grew pale ill be damned whispered lustig rubbing his face with his numb fingers ill be damned it just cant be said samuel hinkston lord said captain john black there was a call from the chemist sir the atmosphere is thin for breathing but theres enough oxygen its safe then well go out said lustig hold on said captain john black how do we know what this is its a small town with thin but breathable air in it sir and its a small town the like of earth towns said hinkston the archaeologist incredible it cant be but it is captain john black looked at him idly do you think that the civilizations of two planets can progress at the same rate and evolve in the same way hinkston i wouldnt have thought so sir captain black stood by the port look out there the geraniums a specialized plant that specific variety has only been known on earth for fifty years think of the thousands of years it takes to evolve plants then tell me if it is logical that the martians should have one leadedglass windows two cupolas three porch swings four an instrument that looks like a piano and probably is a piano and five if you look closely through this telescopic lens here is it logical that a martian composer would have published a piece of music titled strangely enough beautiful ohio all of which means that we have an ohio river on mars captain williams of course cried hinkston what captain williams and his crew of three men or nathaniel york and his partner that would explain it that would explain absolutely nothing as far as weve been able to figure the york expedition exploded the day it reached mars killing york and his partner as for williams and his three men their ship exploded the second day after their arrival at least the pulsations from their radios ceased at that time so we figure that if the men were alive after that theyd have contacted us and anyway the york expedition was only a year ago while captain williams and his men landed here some time during last august theorizing that they are still alive could they even with the help of a brilliant martian race have built such a town as this and aged it in so short a time look at that town out there why its been standing here for the last seventy years look at the wood on the porch newel look at the trees a century old all of them no this isnt yorks work or williams its something else i dont like it and im not leaving the ship until i know what it is for that matter said lustig nodding williams and his men as well as york landed on the opposite side of mars we were very careful to land on this side an excellent point just in case a hostile local tribe of martians killed off york and williams we have instructions to land in a further region to forestall a recurrence of such a disaster so here we are as far as we know in a land that williams and york never saw damn it said hinkston i want to get out into this town sir with your permission it may be there are similar thought patterns civilization graphs on every planet in our sun system we may be on the threshold of the greatest psychological and metaphysical discovery of our age im willing to wait a moment said captain john black it may be sir that were looking upon a phenomenon that for the first time would absolutely prove the existence of god sir there are many people who are of good faith without such proof mr hinkston im one myself sir but certainly a town like this could not occur without divine intervention the detail it fills me with such feelings that i dont know whether to laugh or cry do neither then until we know what were up against up against lustig broke in against nothing captain its a good quiet green town a lot like the oldfashioned one i was born in i like the looks of it when were you born lustig nineteenfifty sir and you hinkston nineteen fiftyfive sir grinnell iowa and this looks like home to me hinkston lustig i could be either of your fathers im just eighty years old born in in illinois and through the grace of god and a science that in the last fifty years knows how to make some old men young again here i am on mars not any more tired than the rest of you but infinitely more suspicious this town out here looks very peaceful and cool and so much like green bluff illinois that it frightens me its too much like green bluff he turned to the radioman radio earth tell them weve landed thats all tell them well radio a full report tomorrow yes sir captain black looked out the rocket port with his face that should have been the face of a man eighty but seemed like the face of a man in his fortieth year tell you what well do lustig you and i and hinkstonll look the town over the other menll stay aboard if anything happens they can get the hell out a loss of three mens better than a whole ship if something bad happens our crew can warn the next rocket thats captain wilders rocket i think due to be ready to take off next christmas if theres something hostile about mars we certainly want the next rocket to be well armed so are we weve got a regular arsenal with us tell the men to stand by the guns then come on lustig hinkston the three men walked together down through the levels of the ship it was a beautiful spring day a robin sat on a blossoming apple tree and sang continuously showers of petal snow sifted down when the wind touched the green branches and the blossom scent drifted upon the air somewhere in the town someone was playing the piano and the music came and went came and went softly drowsily the song was beautiful dreamer somewhere else a phonograph scratchy and faded was hissing out a record of roamin in the gloamin sung by harry lauder the three men stood outside the ship they sucked and gasped at the thin thin air and moved slowly so as not to tire themselves now the phonograph record being played was oh give me a june night the moonlight and you lustig began to tremble samuel hinkston did likewise the sky was serene and quiet and somewhere a stream of water ran through the cool caverns and tree shadings of a ravine somewhere a horse and wagon trotted and rolled by bumping sir said samuel hinkston it must be it has to be that rocket travel to mars began in the years before the first world war no how else can you explain these houses the iron deer the pianos the music hinkston took the captains elbow persuasively and looked into the captains face say that there were people in the year who hated war and got together with some scientists in secret and built a rocket and came out here to mars no no hinkston why not the world was a different world in they could have kept it a secret much more easily but a complex thing like a rocket no you couldnt keep it secret and they came up here to live and naturally the houses they built were similar to earth houses because they brought the culture with them and theyve lived here all these years said the captain in peace and quiet yes maybe they made a few trips enough to bring enough people here for one small town and then stopped for fear of being discovered thats why this town seems so oldfashioned i dont see a thing myself older than the year do you or maybe sir rocket travel is older than we think perhaps it started in some part of the world centuries ago and was kept secret by the small number of men who came to mars with only occasional visits to earth over the centuries you make it sound almost reasonable it has to be weve the proof here before us all we have to do is find some people and verify it their boots were deadened of all sound in the thick green grass it smelled from a fresh mowing in spite of himself captain john black felt a great peace come over him it had been thirty years since he had been in a small town and the buzzing of spring bees on the air lulled and quieted him and the fresh look of things was a balm to the soul they set foot upon the porch hollow echoes sounded from under the boards as they walked to the screen door inside they could see a bead curtain hung across the hall entry and a crystal chandelier and a maxfield parrish painting framed on one wall over a comfortable morris chair the house smelled old and of the attic and infinitely comfortable you could hear the tinkle of ice in a lemonade pitcher in a distant kitchen because of the heat of the day someone was preparing a cold lunch someone was humming under her breath high and sweet captain john black rang the bell footsteps dainty and thin came along the hall and a kindfaced lady of some forty years dressed in a sort of dress you might expect in the year peered out at them can i help you she asked beg your pardon said captain black uncertainly but were looking forthat is could you help us he stopped she looked out at him with dark wondering eyes if youre selling something she began no wait he cried what town is this she looked him up and down what do you mean what town is it how could you be in a town and not know the name the captain looked as if he wanted to go sit under a shady apple tree were strangers here we want to know how this town got here and how you got here are you census takers no everyone knows she said this town was built in is this a game no not a game cried the captain were from earth out of the ground do you mean she wondered no we came from the third planet earth in a ship and weve landed here on the fourth planet mars this explained the woman as if she were addressing a child is green bluff illinois on the continent of america surrounded by the atlantic and pacific oceans on a place called the world or sometimes the earth go away now goodby she trotted down the hall running her fingers through the beaded curtains the three men looked at one another lets knock the screen door in said lustig we cant do that this is private property good god they went to sit down on the porch step did it ever strike you hinkston that perhaps we got ourselves somehow in some way off track and by accident came back and landed on earth how could we have done that i dont know i dont know oh god let me think hinkston said but we checked every mile of the way our chronometers said so many miles we went past the moon and out into space and here we are im positive were on mars lustig said but suppose by accident in space in time we got lost in the dimensions and landed on an earth that is thirty or forty years ago oh go away lustig lustig went to the door rang the bell and called into the cool dim rooms what year is this nineteen twentysix of course said the lady sitting in a rocking chair taking a sip of her lemonade did you hear that lustig turned wildly to the others nineteen twentysix we have gone back in time this is earth lustig sat down and the three men let the wonder and terror of the thought afflict them their hands stirred fitfully on their knees the captain said i didnt ask for a thing like this it scares the hell out of me how can a thing like this happen i wish wed brought einstein with us will anyone in this town believe us said hinkston are we playing with something dangerous time i mean shouldnt we just take off and go home no not until we try another house they walked three houses down to a little white cottage under an oak tree i like to be as logical as i can be said the captain and i dont believe weve put our finger on it yet suppose hinkston as you originally suggested that rocket travel occurred years ago and when the earth people lived here a number of years they began to get homesick for earth first a mild neurosis about it then a fullfledged psychosis then threatened insanity what would you do as a psychiatrist if faced with such a problem hinkston thought well i think id rearrange the civilization on mars so it resembled earth more and more each day if there was any way of reproducing every plant every road and every lake and even an ocean id do so then by some vast crowd hypnosis id convince everyone in a town this size that this really was earth not mars at all good enough hinkston i think were on the right track now that woman in that house back there just thinks shes living on earth it protects her sanity she and all the others in this town are the patients of the greatest experiment in migration and hypnosis you will ever lay eyes on in your life thats it sir cried lustig right said hinkston well the captain sighed now weve got somewhere i feel better its all a bit more logical that talk about time and going back and forth and traveling through time turns my stomach upside down but this way the captain smiled well well it looks as if well be fairly popular here or will we said lustig after all like the pilgrims these people came here to escape earth maybe they wont be too happy to see us maybe theyll try to drive us out or kill us we have superior weapons this next house now up we go but they had hardly crossed the lawn when lustig stopped and looked off across the town down the quiet dreaming afternoon street sir he said what is it lustig oh sir sir what i see said lustig and he began to cry his fingers came up twisting and shaking and his face was all wonder and joy and incredulity he sounded as if at any moment he might go quite insane with happiness he looked down the street and began to run stumbling awkwardly falling picking himself up and running on look look dont let him get away the captain broke into a run now lustig was running swiftly shouting he turned into a yard halfway down the shady street and leaped up upon the porch of a large green house with an iron rooster on the roof he was beating at the door hollering and crying when hinkston and the captain ran up behind him they were all gasping and wheezing exhausted from their run in the thin air grandma grandpa cried lustig two old people stood in the doorway david their voices piped and they rushed out to embrace and pat him on the back and move around him david oh david its been so many years how youve grown boy how big you are boy oh david boy how are you grandma grandpa sobbed david lustig you look fine fine he held them turned them kissed them hugged them cried on them held them out again blinking at the little old people the sun was in the sky the wind blew the grass was green the screen door stood wide come in boy come in theres iced tea for you fresh lots of it ive got friends here lustig turned and waved at the captain and hinkston frantically laughing captain come on up howdy said the old people come in any friends of davids are our friends too dont stand there in the living room of the old house it was cool and a grandfather clock ticked high and long and bronzed in one corner there were soft pillows on large couches and walls filled with books and a rug cut in a thick rose pattern and iced tea in the hand sweating and cool on the thirsty tongue heres to our health grandma tipped her glass to her porcelain teeth how long you been here grandma said lustig ever since we died she said tartly ever since you what captain john black set down his glass oh yes lustig nodded theyve been dead thirty years and you sit there calmly shouted the captain tush the old woman winked glitteringly who are you to question what happens here we are whats life anyway who does what for why and where all we know is here we are alive again and no questions asked a second chance she toddled over and held out her thin wrist feel the captain felt solid aint it she asked he nodded well then she said triumphantly why go around questioning well said the captain its simply that we never thought wed find a thing like this on mars and now youve found it i dare say theres lots on every planet thatll show you gods infinite ways is this heaven asked hinkston nonsense no its a world and we get a second chance nobody told us why but then nobody told us why we were on earth either that other earth i mean the one you came from how do we know there wasnt another before that one a good question said the captain lustig kept smiling at his grandparents gosh its good to see you gosh its good the captain stood up and slapped his hand on his leg in a casual fashion weve got to be going thank you for the drinks youll be back of course said the old people for supper tonight well try to make it thanks theres so much to be done my men are waiting for me back at the rocket and he stopped he looked toward the door startled far away in the sunlight there was a sound of voices a shouting and a great hello whats that asked hinkston well soon find out and captain john black was out the front door abruptly running across the green lawn into the street of the martian town he stood looking at the rocket the ports were open and his crew was streaming out waving their hands a crowd of people had gathered and in and through and among these people the members of the crew were hurrying talking laughing shaking hands people did little dances people swarmed the rocket lay empty and abandoned a brass band exploded in the sunlight flinging off a gay tune from upraised tubas and trumpets there was a bang of drums and a shrill of fifes little girls with golden hair jumped up and down little boys shouted hooray fat men passed around tencent cigars the town mayor made a speech then each member of the crew with a mother on one arm a father or sister on the other was spirited off down the street into little cottages or big mansions stop cried captain black the doors slammed shut the heat rose in the clear spring sky and all was silent the brass band banged off around a corner leaving the rocket to shine and dazzle alone in the sunlight abandoned said the captain they abandoned the ship they did ill have their skins by god they had orders sir said lustig dont be too hard on them those were all old relatives and friends thats no exuse think how they felt captain seeing familiar faces outside the ship they had their orders damn it but how would you have felt captain i would have obeyed orders the captains mouth remained open striding along the sidewalk under the martian sun tall smiling eyes amazingly clear and blue came a young man of some twentysix years john the man called out and broke into a trot what captain john black swayed john you old son of a bitch the man ran up and gripped his hand and slapped him on the back its you said captain black of course whod you think it was edward the captain appealed now to lustig and hinkston holding the strangers hand this is my brother edward ed meet my men lustig hinkston my brother they tugged at each others hands and arms and then finally embraced ed john you bum you youre looking fine ed but ed what is this you havent changed over the years you died i remember when you were twentysix and i was nineteen good god so many years ago and here you are and lord what goes on moms waiting said edward black grinning mom and dad too dad the captain almost fell as if he had been hit by a mighty weapon he walked stiffly and without coordination mom and dad alive where at the old house on oak knoll avenue the old house the captain stared in delighted amaze did you hear that lustig hinkston hinkston was gone he had seen his own house down the street and was running for it lustig was laughing you see captain what happened to everyone on the rocket they couldnt help themselves yes yes the captain shut his eyes when i open my eyes youll be gone he blinked youre still there god ed but you look fine come on lunchs waiting i told mom lustig said sir ill be with my grandfolks if you need me what oh fine lustig later then edward seized his arm and marched him theres the house remember it hell bet i can beat you to the front porch they ran the trees roared over captain blacks head the earth roared under his feet he saw the golden figure of edward black pull ahead of him in the amazing dream of reality he saw the house rush forward the screen door swing wide beat you cried edward im an old man panted the captain and youre still young but then you always beat me i remember in the doorway mom pink plump and bright behind her peppergray dad his pipe in his hand mom dad he ran up the steps like a child to meet them it was a fine long afternoon they finished a late lunch and they sat in the parlor and he told them all about his rocket and they nodded and smiled upon him and mother was just the same and dad bit the end off a cigar and lighted it thoughtfully in his old fashion there was a big turkey dinner at night and time flowing on when the drumsticks were sucked clean and lay brittle upon the plates the captain leaned back and exhaled his deep satisfaction night was in all the trees and coloring the sky and the lamps were halos of pink light in the gentle house from all the other houses down the street came sounds of music pianos playing doors slammng mom put a record on the victrola and she and captain john black had a dance she was wearing the same perfume he remembered from the summer when she and dad had been killed in the train accident she was very real in his arms as they danced lightly to the music its not every day she said you get a second chance to live ill wake in the morning said the captain and ill be in my rocket in space and all this will be gone no dont think that she cried softly dont question gods good to us lets be happy sorry mom the record ended in a circular hissing youre tired son dad pointed with his pipe your old bedrooms waiting for you brass bed and all but i should report my men in why why well i dont know no reason i guess no none at all theyre all eating or in bed a good nights sleep wont hurt them good night son mom kissed his cheek its good to have you home its good to be home he left the land of cigar smoke and perfume and books and gentle light and ascended the stairs talking talking with edward edward pushed a door open and there was the yellow brass bed and the old semaphore banners from college and a very musty raccoon coat which he stroked with muted affection its too much said the captain im numb and im tired too much has happened today i feel as if id been out in a pounding rain for fortyeight hours without an umbrella or a coat im soaked to the skin with emotion edward slapped wide the snowy linens and flounced the pillows he slid the window up and let the nightblooming jasmine float in there was moonlight and the sound of distant dancing and whispering so this is mars said the captain undressing this is it edward undressed in idle leisurely moves drawing his shirt off over his head revealing golden shoulders and the good muscular neck the lights were out they were in bed side by side as in the days how many decades ago the captain lolled and was flourished by the scent of jasmine pushing the lace curtains out upon the dark air of the room among the trees upon a lawn someone had cranked up a portable phonograph and now it was playing softly always the thought of marilyn came to his mind is marilyn here his brother lying straight out in the moonlight from the window waited and then said yes shes out of town but shell be here in the morning the captain shut his eyes i want to see marilyn very much the room was square and quiet except for their breathing good night ed a pause good night john he lay peacefully letting his thoughts float for the first time the stress of the day was moved aside he could think logically now it had all been emotion the bands playing the familiar faces but now how he wondered how was all this made and why for what purpose out of the goodness of some divine intervention was god then really that thoughtful of his children how and why and what for he considered the various theories advanced in the first heat of the afternoon by hinkston and lustig he let all kinds of new theories drop in lazy pebbles down through his mind turning throwing out dull flashes of light mom dad edward mars earth mars martians who had lived here a thousand years ago on mars martians or had this always been the way it was today martians he repeated the word idly inwardly he laughed out loud almost he had the most ridiculous theory quite suddenly it gave him a kind of chill it was really nothing to consider of course highly improbable silly forget it ridiculous but he thought just suppose just suppose now that there were martians living on mars and they saw our ship coming and saw us inside our ship and hated us suppose now just for the hell of it that they wanted to destroy us as invaders as unwanted ones and they wanted to do it in a very clever way so that we would be taken off guard well what would the best weapon be that a martian could use against earth men with atomic weapons the answer was interesting telepathy hypnosis memory and imagination suppose all of these houses arent real at all this bed not real but only figments of my own imagination given substance by telepathy and hypnosis through the martians thought captain john black suppose these houses are really some other shape a martian shape but by playing on my desires and wants these martians have made this seem like my old home town my old house to lull me out of my suspicions what better way to fool a man using his own mother and father as bait and this town so old from the year long before any of my men were born from a year when i was six years old and there were records of harry lauder and maxfield parrish paintings still hanging and bead curtains and beautiful ohio and turnofthecentury architecture what if the martians took the memories of a town exclusively from my mind they say childhood memories are the clearest and after they built the town from my mind they populated it with the mostloved people from all the minds of the people on the rocket and suppose those two people in the next room asleep are not my mother and father at all but two martians incredibly brilliant with the ability to keep me under this dreaming hypnosis all of the time and that brass band today what a startlingly wonderful plan it would be first fool lustig then hinkston then gather a crowd and all the men in the rocket seeing mothers aunts uncles sweethearts dead ten twenty wears ago naturally disregarding orders rush out and abandon ship what more natural what more unsuspecting what more simple a man doesnt ask too many questions when his mother is soddenly brought back to life hes much too happy and here we all are tonight in various houses in various beds with no weapons to protect us and the rocket lies in the moonlight empty and wouldnt it be horrible and terrifying to discover that all of this was part of some great clever plan by the martians to divide and conquer us and kill us sometime during the night perhaps my brother here on this bed will change form melt shift and become another thing a terrible thing a martian it would be very simple for him just to turn over in bed and put a knife into my heart and in all those other houses down the street a dozen other brothers or fathers suddenly melting away and taking knives and doing things to the unsuspecting sleeping men of earth his hands were shaking under the covers his body was cold suddenly it was not a theory suddenly he was very afraid he lifted himself in bed and listened the night was very quiet the music had stopped the wind had died his brother lay sleeping beside him carefully he lifted the covers rolled them back he slipped from bed and was walking softly across the room when his brothers voice said where are you going what his brothers voice was quite cold i said where do you think youre going for a drink of water but youre not thirsty yes yes i am no youre not captain john black broke and ran across the room he screamed he screamed twice he never reached the door in the morning the brass band played a mournful dirge from every house in the street came little solemn processions bearing long boxes and along the sunfilled street weeping came the grandmas and mothers and sisters and brothers and uncles and fathers walking to the churchyard where there were new holes freshly dug and new tombstones installed sixteen holes in all and sixteen tombstones the mayor made a little sad speech his face sometimes looking like the mayor sometimes looking like something else mother and father black were there with brother edward and they cried their faces melting now from a familiar face into something else grandpa and grandma lustig were there weeping their faces shifting like wax shimmering as all things shimmer on a hot day the coffins were lowered someone murmured about the unexpected and sudden deaths of sixteen fine men during the night earth pounded down on the coffin lids the brass band playing columbia the gem of the ocean marched and slammed back into town and everyone took the day off june and the moon be still as bright it was so cold when they first came from the rocket into the night that spender began to gather the dry martian wood and build a small fire he didnt say anything about a celebration he merely gathered the wood set fire to it and watched it burn in the flare that lighted the thin air of this driedup sea of mars he looked over his shoulder and saw the rocket that had brought them all captain wilder and cheroke and hathaway and sam parkhill and himself across a silent black space of stars to land upon a dead dreaming world jeff spender waited for the noise he watched the other men and waited for them to jump around and shout it would happen as soon as the numbness of being the first men to mars wore off none of them said anything but many of them were hoping perhaps that the other expeditions had failed and that this the fourth would be the one they meant nothing evil by it but they stood thinking it nevertheless thinking of the honor and fame while their lungs became accustomed to the thinness of the atmosphere which almost made you drunk if you moved too quiddy gibbs walked over to the freshly ignited fire and said why dont we use the ship chemical fire instead of that wood never mind said spender not looking up it wouldnt be right the first night on mars to make a loud noise to introduce a strange silly bright thing like a stove it would be a kind of imported blasphemy thered be time for that later time to throw condensedmilk cans in the proud martian canals time for copies of the new york times to blow and caper and rustle across the lone gray martian sea bottoms time for banana peels and picnic papers in the fluted delicate ruins of the old martian valley towns plenty of time for that and he gave a small inward shiver at the thought he fed the fire by hand and it was like an offering to a dead giant they had landed on an immense tomb here a civilization had died it was only simple courtesy that the first night be spent quietly this isnt my idea of a celebration gibbs turned to captain wilder sir i thought we might break out rations of gin and meat and whoop it up a bit captain wilder looked off toward a dead city a mile away were all tired he said remotely as if his whole attention was on the city and his men forgotten tomorrow night perhaps tonight we should be glad we got across all that space without getting a meteor in our bulkhead or having one man of us die the men shifted around there were twenty of them holding to each others shoulders or adjusting their belts spender watched them they were not satisfied they had risked their lives to do a big thing now they wanted to be shouting drunk firing off guns to show how wonderful they were to have kicked a hole in space and ridden a rocket all the way to mars but nobody was yelling the captain gave a quiet order one of the men ran into the ship and brought forth food tins which were opened and dished out without much noise the men were beginning to talk now the captain sat down and recounted the trip to them they already knew it all but it was good to hear about it as something over and done and safely put away they would not talk about the return trip someone brought that up but they told him to keep quiet the spoons moved in the double moonlight the food tasted good and the wine was even better there was a touch of fire across the sky and an instant later the auxiliary rocket landed beyond the camp spender watched as the small port opened and hathaway the physiciangeologistthey were all men of twofold ability to conserve space on the tripstepped out he walked slowly over to the captain well said captain wilder hathaway gazed out at the distant cities twinkling in the starlight after swallowing and focusing his eyes he said that city there captain is dead and has been dead a good many thousand years that applies to those three cities in the hills also but that fifth city two hundred miles over sir what about it people were living in it last week sir spender got to his feet martians said hathaway where are they now dead said hathaway i went into a house on one street i thought that it like the other towns and houses had been dead for centuries my god there were bodies there it was like walking in a pile of autumn leaves like sticks and pieces of burnt newspaper thats all and fresh theyd been dead ten days at the outside did you check other towns did you see anything alive nothing whatever so i went out to check the other towns four out of five have been empty for thousands of years what happened to the original inhabitants i havent the faintest idea but the fifth city always contained the same thing bodies thousands of bodies what did they die of spender moved forward you wont believe it what killed them hathaway said simply chicken pox my god no yes i made tests chicken pox it did things to the martians it never did to earth men their metabolism reacted differently i suppose burnt them black and dried them out to brittle flakes but its chicken pox nevertheless so york and captain williams and captain black must have got through to mars all three expeditions god knows what happened to them but we at least know what they unintentionally did to the martians you saw no other life chances are a few of the martians if they were smart escaped to the mountains but there arent enough ill lay you money to be a native problem this planet is through spender turned and went to sit at the fire looking into it chicken pox god chicken pox think of it a race builds itself for a million years refines itself erects cities like those out there does everything it can to give itself respect and beauty and then it dies part of it dies slowly in its own time before our age with dignity but the rest does the rest of mars die of a disease with a fine name or a terrifying name or a majestic name no in the name of all thats holy it has to be chicken pox a childs disease a disease that doesnt even kill children on earth its not right and its not fair its like saying the greeks died of mumps or the proud romans died on their beautiful hills of athletes foot if only wed given the martians time to arrange their death robes lie down look fit and think up some other excuse for dying it cant be a dirty silly thing like chicken pox it doesnt fit the architecture it doesnt fit this entire world all right hathaway get yourself some food thank you captain and as quickly as that it was forgotten the men talked among themselves spender did not take his eyes off them he left his food on his plate under his hands he felt the land getting colder the stars drew closer very clear when anyone talked too loudly the captain would reply in a low voice that made them talk quietly from imitation the air smelled clean and new spender sat for a long time just enjoying the way it was made it had a lot of things in it he couldnt identify flowers chemistries dusts winds then there was that time in new york when i got that blonde whats her nameginnie cried biggs that was it spender tightened in his hand began to quiver his eyes moved behind the thin sparse lids and ginnie said to me cried biggs the men roared so i smacked her shouted biggs with a bottle in his hand spender set down his plate he listened to the wind over his ears cool and whispering he looked at the cool ice of the white martian buildings over there on the empty sea lands what a woman what a woman biggs emptied his bottle in his wide mouth of all the women i ever knew the smell of biggss sweating body was on the air spender let the fire die hey kick her up there spender said biggs glancing at him for a moment then back to his bottle well one night ginnie and me a man named schoenke got out his accordion and did a kicking dance the dust springing up around him ahooim alive he shouted yay roared the men they threw down their empty plates three of them lined up and kicked like chorus maidens joking loudly the others clapping hands yelled for something to happen cheroke pulled off his shirt and showed his naked chest sweating as he whirled about the moonlight shone on his crewcut hair and his young cleanshaven cheeks in the sea bottom the wind stirred along faint vapors and from the mountains great stone visages looked upon the silvery rocket and the small fire the noise got louder more men jumped up someone sucked on a mouth organ someone else blew on a tissuepapered comb twenty more bottles were opened and drunk biggs staggered about wagging his arms to direct the dancing men come on sir cried cheroke to the captain wailing a song the captain had to join the dance he didnt want to his face was solemn spender watched thinking you poor man what a night this is they dont know what theyre doing they should have had an orientation program before they came to mars to tell them how to look and how to walk around and be good for a few days that does it the captain begged off and sat down saying he was exhausted spender looked at the captains chest it wasnt moving up and down very fast his face wasnt sweaty either accordion harmonica wine shout dance wail roundabout dash of pan laughter biggs weaved to the rim of the martian canal he carried six empty bottles and dropped them one by one into the deep blue canal waters they made empty hollow drowning sounds as they sank i christen thee i christen thee i christen thee said biggs thickly i christen thee biggs biggs biggs canal spender was on his feet over the fire and alongside biggs before anyone moved he hit biggs once in the teeth and once in the ear biggs toppled and fell down into the canal water after the splash spender waited silently for biggs to climb back up onto the stone bank by that time the men were holding spender hey whats eating you spender hey they asked biggs climbed up and stood dripping he saw the men holding spender well he said and started forward thats enough snapped captain wilder the men broke away from spender biggs stopped and glanced at the captain all right biggs get some dry clothes you men carry on your party spender come with me the men took up the party wilder moved off some distance and confronted spender suppose you explain what just happened he said spender looked at the canal i dont know i was ashamed of biggs and us and the noise christ what a spectade its been a long trip theyve got to have their fling wheres their respect sir wheres their sense of the right thing youre tired and youve a different way of seeing things spender thats a fiftydollar fine for you yes sir it was just the idea of them watching us make fools of ourselves them the martians whether theyre dead or not most certainly dead said the captain do you think they know were here doesnt an old thing always know when a new thing comes i suppose so you sound as if you believe in spirits i believe in the things that were done and there are evidences of many things done on mars there are streets and houses and there are books i imagine and big canals and docks and places for stabling if not horses well then some domestic animal perhaps with twelve legs who knows everywhere i look i see things that were used they were touched and handled for centuries ask me then if i believe in the spirit of the things as they were used and ill say yes theyre all here all the things which had uses all the mountains which had names and well never be able to use them without feeling uncomfortable and somehow the mountains will never sound right to us well give them new names but the old names are there somewhere in time and the mountains were shaped and seen under those names the names well give to the canals and mountains and cities will fall like so much water on the back of a mallard no matter how we touch mars well never touch it and then well get mad at it and you know what well do well rip it up rip the skin off and change it to fit ourselves we wont ruin mars said the captain its too big and too good you think not we earth men have a talent for ruining big beautiful things the only reason we didnt set up hotdog stands in the midst of the egyptian temple of karnak is because it was out of the way and served no large commercial purpose and egypt is a small part of earth but here this whole thing is ancient and different and we have to set down somewhere and start fouling it up well call the canal the rockefeller canal and the mountain king george mountain and the sea the dupont sea and therell be roosevelt and lincoln and coolidge cities and it wont ever be right when there are the proper names for these places thatll be your job as archaeologists to find out the old names and well use them a few men like us against all the commercial interests spender looked at the iron mountains they know were here tonight to spit in their wine and i imagine they hate us the captain shook his head theres no hatred here he listened to the wind from the look of their cities they were a graceful beautiful and philosophical people they accepted what came to them they acceded to racial death that much we know and without a lastmoment war of frustration to tumble down their cities every town weve seen so far has been flawlessly intact they probably dont mind us being here any more than theyd mind children playing on the lawn knowing and understanding children for what they are and anyway perhaps all this will change us for the better did you notice the peculiar quiet of the men spender until biggs forced them to get happy they looked pretty humble and frightened looking at all this we know were not so hot were kids in rompers shouting with our play rockets and atoms loud and alive but one day earth will be as mars is today this will sober us its an object lesson in civilizations well learn from mars now suck in your chin lets go back and play happy that fiftydollar fine still goes the party was not going too well the wind kept coming in off the dead sea it moved around the men and it moved around the captain and jeff spender as they returned to the group the wind pulled at the dust and the shining rocket and pulled at the accordion and the dust got into the vamped harmonica the dust got in their eyes and the wind made a high singing sound in the air as suddenly as it had come the wind died but the party had died too the men stood upright against the dark cold sky come on gents come on biggs bounded from the ship in a fresh uniform not looking at spender even once his voice was like someone in an empty auditorium it was alone come on nobody moved come on whitie your harmonica whitie blew a chord it sounded funny and wrong whitie knocked the moisture from his harmonica and put it away what kinda party is this biggs wanted to know someone hugged the accordion it gave a sound like a dying animal that was all okay me and my bottle will go have our own party biggs squatted against the rocket drinking from a flask spender watched him spender did not move for a long time then his fingers crawled up along his trembling leg to his holstered pistol very quietly and stroked and tapped the leather sheath all those who want to can come into the city with me announced the captain well post a guard here at the rocket and go armed just in case the men counted off fourteen of them wanted to go including biggs who laughingly counted himself in waving his bottle six others stayed behind here we go biggs shouted the party moved out into the moonlight silently they made their way to the outer rim of the dreaming dead city in the light of the racing twin moons their shadows under them were double shadows they did not breathe or seemed not to perhaps for several minutes they were waiting for something to stir in the dead city some gray form to rise some ancient ancestral shape to come galloping across the vacant sea bottom on an ancient armored steel of impossible lineage of unbelievable derivation spender filled the streets with his eyes and his mind people moved like blue vapor lights on the cobbled avenues and there were faint murmurs of sound and odd animals scurrying across the grayred sands each window was given a person who leaned from it and waved slowly as if under a timeless water at some moving form in the fathoms of space below the moonsilvered towers music was played on some inner ear and spender imagined the shape of such instruments to evoke such music the land was haunted hey shouted biggs standing tall his hands around his open mouth hey you people in the city there you biggs said the captain biggs quieted they walked forward on a tiled avenue they were all whispering now for it was like entering a vast open library or a mausoleum in which the wind lived and over which the stars shone the captain spoke quietly he wondered where the people had gone and what they had been and who their kings were and how they had died and he wondered quietly aloud how they had built this city to last the ages through and had they ever come to earth were they ancestors of earth men ten thousand years removed and had they loved and hated similar loves and hates and done similar silly things when silly things were done nobody moved the moons held and froze them the wind beat slowly around them lord byron said jeff spender lord who the captain turned and regarded him lord byron a nineteenthcentury poet he wrote a poem a long time ago that fits this city and how the martians must feel if theres anything left of them to feel it might have been written by the last martian poet the men stood motionless their shadows under them the captain said how does the poem go spender spender shifted put out his hand to remember squinted silently a moment then remembering his slow quiet voice repeated the words and the men listened to everything he said so well go no more aroving so late into the night though the heart be still as loving and the moon be still as bright the city was gray and high and motionless the mens faces were turned in the light for the sword outwears its sheath and the soul wears out the breast and the heart must pause to breathe and love itself must rest though the night was made for loving and the day returns too soon yet well go no more aroving by the light of the moon without a word the earth men stood in the center of the city it was a clear night there was not a sound except the wind at their feet lay a tile court worked into the shapes of ancient animals and peoples they looked down upon it biggs made a sick noise in his throat his eyes were dull his hands went to his mouth he choked shut his eyes bent and a thick rush of fluid filled his mouth spilled out fell to splash on the tiles covering the designs biggs did this twice a sharp winy stench filled the cool air no one moved to help biggs he went on being sick spender stared for a moment then turned and walked off into the avenues of the city alone in the moonlight never once did he pause to look back at the gathered men there they turned in at four in the morning they lay upon blankets and shut their eyes and breathed the quiet air captain wilder sat feeding little sticks into the fire mcclure opened his eyes two hours later arent you sleeping sir im waiting for spender the captain smiled faintly mcclure thought it over you know sir i dont think hell ever come back i dont know how i know but thats the way i feel about him sir hell never come back mcclure rolled over into sleep the fire cradded and died spender did not return in the following week the captain sent searching parties but they came back saying they didnt know where spender could have gone he would be back when he got good and ready he was a sorehead they said to the devil with him the captain said nothing but wrote it down in his log it was a morning that might have been a monday or a tuesday or any day on mars biggs was on the canal rim his feet hung down into the cool water soaking while he took the sun on his face a man walked along the bank of the canal the man threw a shadow down upon biggs biggs glanced up well ill be damned said biggs im the last martian said the man taking out a gun what did you say asked biggs im going to kill you cut it what kind of jokes that spender stand up and take it in the stomach for christs sake put that gun away spender pulled the trigger only once biggs sat on the edge of the canal for a moment before he leaned forward and fell into the water the gun had made only a whispering hum the body drifted with slow unconcern under the slow canal tides it made a hollow bubbling sound that ceased after a moment spender shoved his gun into its holster and walked soundlessly away the sun was shining down upon mars he felt it burn his hands and slide over the sides of his tight face he did not run he walked as if nothing were new except the daylight he walked down to the rocket and some of the men were eating a freshly cooked breakfast under a shelter built by cookie here comes the lonely one someone said hello spender long time no see the four men at the table regarded the silent man who stood looking back at them you and them goddamn ruins laughed cookie stirring a black substance in a crock youre like a dog in a bone yard maybe said spender ive been finding out things what would you say if i said id found a martian prowling around the four men laid down their forks did you where never mind let me ask you a question how would you feel if you were a martian and people came to your land and started tearing it up i know exactly how id feel said cheroke ive got some cherokee blood in me my grandfather told me lots of things about oklahoma territory if theres a martian around im all for him what about you other men asked spender carefully nobody answered their silence was talk enough catch as catch can finders keepers if the other fellow turns his cheek slap it hard etc well said spender ive found a martian the men squinted at him up in a dead town i didnt think id find him i didnt intend looking him up i dont know what he was doing there ive been living in a little valley town for about a week learning how to read the ancient books and looking at their old art forms and one day i saw this martian he stood there for a moment and then he was gone he didnt come back for another day i sat around learning how to read the old writing and the martian came back each time a little nearer until on the day i learned how to decipher the martian languageits amazingly simple and there are picturegraphs to help youthe martian appeared before me and said give me your boots and i gave him my boots and he said give me your uniform and all the rest of your apparel and i gave him all of that and then he said give me your gun and i gave him my gun then he said now come along and watch what happens and the martian walked down into camp and hes here now i dont see any martian said cheroke im sorry spender took out his gun it hummed softly the first bullet got the man on the left the second and third bullets took the men on the right and the center of the table cookie turned in horror from the fire to receive the fourth bullet he fell back into the fire and lay there while his clothes caught fire the rocket lay in the sun three men sat at breakfast their hands on the table not moving their food getting cold in front of them cheroke untouched sat alone staring in numb disbelief at spender you can come with me said spender cheroke said nothing you can be with me on this spender waited finally cheroke was able to speak you killed them he said daring to look at the men around him they deserved it youre crazy maybe i am but you can come with me come with you for what cried cheroke the color gone from his face his eyes watering go on get out spenders face hardened of all of them i thought you would understand get out cheroke reached for his gun spender fired one last time cheroke stopped moving now spender swayed he put his hand to his sweating face he glanced at the rocket and suddenly began to shake all over he almost fell the physical reaction was so overwhelming his face held an expression of one awakening from hypnosis from a dream he sat down for a moment and told the shaking to go away stop it stop it he commanded of his body every fiber of him was quivering and shaking stop it he crushed his body with his mind until all the shaking was squeezed out of it his hands lay calmly now upon his silent knees he arose and strapped a portable storage locker on his back with quiet efficiency his hand began to tremble again just for a breath of an instant but he said no very firmly and the trembling passed then walking stiffly he moved out between the hot red hills of the land alone the sun burned farther up the sky an hour later the captain climbed down out of the rocket to get some ham and eggs he was just saying hello to the four men sitting there when he stopped and noticed a faint smell of gun fumes on the air he saw the cook lying on the ground with the campfire under him the four men sat before food that was now cold a moment later parkhill and two others climbed down the captain stood in their way fascinated by the silent men and the way they sat at their breakfast call the men all of them said the captain parkhill hurried off down the canal rim the captain touched cheroke cheroke twisted quietly and fell from his chair sunlight burned in his bristled short hair and on his high cheekbones the men came in whos missing its still spender sir we found biggs floating in the canal spender the captain saw the hills rising in the daylight the sun showed his teeth in a grimace damn him he said tiredly why didnt he come and talk to me he shouldve talked to me cried parkhill eyes blazing id have shot his bloody brains out thats what id have done by god captain wilder nodded at two of his men get shovels he said it was hot digging the graves a warm wind came from over the vacant sea and blew the dust into their faces as the captain turned the bible pages when the captain closed the book someone began shoveling slow streams of sand down upon the wrapped figures they walked back to the rocket clicked the mechanisms of their rifles put thick grenade packets on their backs and checked the free play of pistols in their holsters they were each assigned part of the hills the captain directed them without raising his voice or moving his hands where they hung at his sides lets go he said spender saw the thin dust rising in several places in the valley and he knew the pursuit was organized and ready he put down the thin silver book that he had been reading as he sat easily on a flat boulder the books pages were tissuethin pure silver handpainted in black and gold it was a book of philosophy at least ten thousand years old he had found in one of the villas of a martian valley town he was reluctant to lay it aside for a time he had thought whats the use ill sit here reading until they come along and shoot me the first reaction to his killing the six men this morning had caused a period of stunned blankness then sickness and now a strange peace but the peace was passing too for he saw the dust billowing from the trails of the hunting men and he experienced the return of resentment he took a drink of cool water from his hip canteen then he stood up stretched yawned and listened to the peaceful wonder of the valley around him how very fine if he and a few others he knew on earth could be here live out their lives here without a sound or a worry he carried the book with him in one hand the pistol ready in his other there was a little swiftrunning stream filled with white pebbles and rocks where he undressed and waded in for a brief washing he took all the time he wanted before dressing and picking up his gun again the firing began about three in the afternoon by then spender was high in the hills they followed him through three small martian hill towns above the towns scattered like pebbles were single villas where ancient families had found a brook a green spot and laid out a tile pool a library and a court with a pulsing fountain spender took half an hour swimming in one of the pools which was filled with the seasonal rain waiting for the pursuers to catch up with him shots rang out as he was leaving the little villa tile chipped up some twenty feet behind him exploded he broke into a trot moved behind a series of small bluffs turned and with his first shot dropped one of the men dead in his tracks they would form a net a circle spender knew that they would go around and close in and they would get him it was a strange thing that the grenades were not used captain wilder could easily order the grenades tossed but im much too nice to be blown to bits thought spender thats what the captain thinks he wants me with only one hole in me isnt that odd he wants my death to be clean nothing messy why because he understands me and because he understands hes willing to risk good men to give me a clean shot in the head isnt that it nine ten shots broke out in a rattle rocks around him jumped up spender fired steadily sometimes while glancing at the silver book he carried in his hand the captain ran in the hot sunlight with a rifle in his hands spender followed him in his pistol sights but did not fire instead he shifted and blew the top off a rock where whitie lay and heard an angry shout suddenly the captain stood up he had a white handkerchief in his hands he said something to his men and came walking up the mountain after putting aside his rifle spender lay there then got to his feet his pistol ready the captain came up and sat down on a warm boulder not looking at spender for a moment the captain reached into his blouse pocket spenders fingers tightened on the pistol the captain said cigarette thanks spender took one light got my own they took one or two puffs in silence warm said the captain it is you comfortable up here quite how long do you think you can hold out about twelve mens worth why didnt you kill all of us this morning when you had the chance you could have you know i know i got sick when you want to do a thing badly enough you lie to yourself you say the other people are all wrong well soon after i started killing people i realized they were just fools and i shouldnt be killing them but it was too late i couldnt go on with it then so i came up here where i could lie to myself some more and get angry to build it all up again is it built up not very high enough the captain considered his cigarette why did you do it spender quietly laid his pistol at his feet because ive seen that what these martians had was just as good as anything well ever hope to have they stopped where we should have stopped a hundred years ago ive walked in their cities and i know these people and id be glad to call them my ancestors they have a beautiful city there the captain nodded at one of several places its not that alone yes their cities are good they knew how to blend art into their living its always been a thing apart for americans art was something you kept in the crazy sons room upstairs art was something you took in sunday doses mixed with religion perhaps well these martians have art and religion and everything you think they knew what it was all about do you for my money and for that reason you started shooting people when i was a kid my folks took me to visit mexico city ill always remember the way my father actedloud and big and my mother didnt like the people because they were dark and didnt wash enough and my sister wouldnt talk to most of them i was the only one really liked it and i can see my mother and father coming to mars and acting the same way here anything thats strange is no good to the average american if it doesnt have chicago plumbing its nonsense the thought of that oh god the thought of that and thenthe war you heard the congressional speeches before we left if things work out they hope to establish three atomic research and atom bomb depots on mars that means mars is finished all this wonderful stuff gone how would you feel if a martian vomited stale liquor on the white house floor the captain said nothing but listened spender continued and then the other power interests coming up the mineral men and the travel men do you remember what happened to mexico when cortez and his very fine good friends arrived from spain a whole civilization destroyed by greedy righteous bigots history will never forgive cortez you havent acted ethically yourself today observed the captain what could i do argue with you its simply me against the whole crooked grinding greedy setup on earth theyll be flopping their filthy atoms bombs up here fighting for bases to have wars isnt it enough theyve ruined one planet without ruining another do they have to foul someone elses manger the simpleminded windbags when i got up here i felt i was not only free of their socalled culture i felt i was free of their ethics and their customs im out of their frame of reference i thought all i have to do is kill you all off and live my own life but it didnt work out said the captain no after the fifth killing at breakfast i discovered i wasnt all new all martian after all i couldnt throw away everything i had learned on earth so easily but now im feeling steady again ill kill you all off thatll delay the next trip in a rocket for a good five years theres no other rocket in existence today save this one the people on earth will wait a year two years and when they hear nothing from us theyll be very afraid to build a new rocket theyll take twice as long and make a hundred extra experimental models to insure themselves against another failure youre correct a good report from you on the other hand if you returned would hasten the whole invasion of mars if im lucky ill live to be sixty years old every expedition that lands on mars will be met by me there wont be more than one ship at a time coming up one every year or so and never more than twenty men in the crew after ive made friends with them and explained that our rocket exploded one dayi intend to blow it up after i finish my job this weekill kill them off every one of them mars will be untouched for the next half century after a while perhaps the earth people will give up trying remember how they grew leery of the idea of building zeppelins that were always going down in flames youve got it all planned admitted the captain i have yet youre outnumbered in an hour well have you surrounded in an hour youll be dead ive found some underground passages and a place to live youll never find ill withdraw there to live for a few weeks until youre off guard ill come out then to pick you off one by one the captain nodded tell me about your civilization here he said waving his hand at the mountain towns they knew how to live with nature and get along with nature they didnt try too hard to be all men and no animal thats the mistake we made when darwin showed up we embraced him and huxley and freud all smiles and then we discovered that darwin and our religions didnt mix or at least we didnt think they did we were fools we tried to budge darwin and huxley and freud they wouldnt move very well so like idiots we tried knocking down religion we succeeded pretty well we lost our faith and went around wondering what life was for if art was no more than a frustrated outflinging of desire if religion was no more than selfdelusion what good was life faith had always given us answers to all things but it all went down the drain with freud and darwin we were and still are a lost people and these martians are a found people inquired the captain yes they knew how to combine science and religion so the two worked side by side neither denying the other each enriching the other that sounds ideal it was id like to show you how the martians did it my men are waiting well be gone half an hour tell them that sir the captain hesitated then rose and called an order down the hill spender led him over into a little martian village built all of cool perfect marble there were great friezes of beautiful animals whitelimbed cat things and yellowlimbed sun symbols and statues of bulllike creatures and statues of men and women and huge finefeatured dogs theres your answer captain i dont see the martians discovered the secret of life among animals the animal does not question life it lives its very reason for living is life it enjoys and relishes life you seethe statuary the animal symbols again and again it looks pagan on the contrary those are god symbols symbols of life man had become too much man and not enough animal on mars too and the men of mars realized that in order to survive they would have to forgo asking that one question any longer why live life was its own answer life was the propagation of more life and the living of as good a life is possible the martians realized that they asked the question why live at all at the height of some period of war and despair when there was no answer but once the civilization calmed quieted and wars ceased the question became senseless in a new way life was now good and needed no arguments it sounds as if the martians were quite naive only when it paid to be naive they quit trying too hard to destroy everything to humble everything they blended religion and art and science because at base science is no more than an investigation of a miracle we can never explain and art is an interpretation of that mirade they never let science crush the aesthetic and the beautiful its all simply a matter of degree an earth man thinks in that picture color does not exist really a scientist can prove that color is only the way the cells are placed in a certain material to reflect light therefore color is not really an actual part of things i happen to see a martian far cleverer would say this is a fine picture it came from the hand and the mind of a man inspired its idea and its color are from life this thing is good there was a pause sitting in the afternoon sun the captain looked curiously around at the little silent cool town id like to live here he said you may if you want you ask me that will any of those men under you ever really understand all this theyre professional cynics and its too late for them why do you want to go back with them so you can keep up with the joneses to buy a gyro just like smith has to listen to music with your pocketbook instead of your glands theres a little patio down here with a reel of martian music in it at least fifty thousand years old it still plays music youll never hear in your life you could hear it there are books ive gotten on well in reading them already you could sit and read it all sounds quite wonderful spender but you wont stay no thanks anyway and you certainly wont let me stay without trouble ill have to kill you all youre optimistic i have something to fight for and live for that makes me a better killer ive got what amounts to a religion now its learning how to breathe all over again and how to lie in the sun getting a tan letting the sun work into you and how to hear music and how to read a book what does your civilization offer the captain shifted his feet he shook his head im sorry this is happening im sorry about it all i am too i guess id better take you back now so you can start the attack i guess so captain i wont kill you when its all over youll still be alive what i decided when i started that youd be untouched well ill save you out from the rest when theyre dead perhaps youll change your mind no said the captain theres too much earth blood in me ill have to keep after you even when you have a chance to stay here its funny but yes even with that i dont know why ive never asked myself well here we are they had returned to their meeting place now will you come quietly spender this is my last offer thanks no spender put out his hand one last thing if you win do me a favor see what can be done to restrict tearing this planet apart at least for fifty years until the archaeologists have had a decent chance will you right and lastif it helps any just think of me as a very crazy fellow who went berserk one summer day and never was right again itll be a little easier on you that way ill think it over so long spender good luck youre an odd one said spender as the captain walked back down the trail in the warmblowing wind the captain returned like something lost to his dusty men he kept squinting at the sun and breathing bard is there a drink he said he felt a bottle put cool into his hand thanks he drank he wiped his mouth all right he said be careful we have all the time we want i dont want any more lost youll have to kill him he wont come down make it a clean shot if you can dont mess him get it over with ill blow his damned brains out said sam parkhill no through the chest said the captain he could see spenders strong clearly determined face his bloody brains said parkhill the captain handed him the bottle jerkingly you heard what i said through the chest parkhill muttered to himself now said the captain they spread again walking and then running and then walking on the hot hillside places where there would be sudden cool grottoes that smelled of moss and sudden open blasting places that smelled of sun on stone i hate being clever thought the captain when you dont really feel clever and dont want to be clever to sneak around and make plans and feel big about making them i hate this feeling of thinking im doing right when im not really certain i am who are we anyway the majority is that the answer the majority is always holy is it not always always just never wrong for one little insignificant tiny moment is it never ever wrong in ten million years he thought what is this majority and who are in it and what do they think and how did they get that way and will they ever change and how the devil did i get caught in this rotten majority i dont feel comfortable is it claustrophobia fear of crowds or common sense can one man be right while all the world thinks they are right lets not think about it lets crawl around and act exciting and pull the trigger there and there the men ran and ducked and ran and squatted in shadows and showed their teeth gasping for the air was thin not meant for running the air was thin and they had to sit for five minutes at a time wheezing and seeing black lights in their eyes eating at the thin air and wanting more tightening their eyes and at last getting up lifting their guns to tear holes in that thin summer air holes of sound and heat spender remained where he was firing only on occasion damned brains all over parkhill yelled running uphill the captain aimed his gun at sam parkhill he put it down and stared at it in horror what were you doing he asked of his limp hand and the gun he had almost shot parkhill in the back god help me he saw parkhill still running then falling to lie safe spender was being gathered in by a loose running net of men at the hilltop behind two rocks spender lay grinning with exhaustion from the thin atmosphere great islands of sweat under each arm the captain saw the two rocks there was an interval between them of some four inches giving free access to spenders chest hey you cried parkhill heres a slug for your head captain wilder waited go on spender he thought get out like you said you would youve only a few minutes to escape get out and come back later go on you said you would go down in the tunnels you said you found and lie there and live for months and years reading your fine books and bathing in your temple pools go on now man before its too late spender did not move from his position whats wrong with him the captain asked himself the captain picked up his gun he watched the running hiding men he looked at the towers of the little clean martian village like sharply carved chess pieces lying in the afternoon he saw the rocks and the interval between where spenders chest was revealed parkhill was charging up screaming in fury no parkhill said the captain i cant let you do it nor the others no none of you only me he raised the gun and sighted it will i be clean after this he thought is it right that its me who does it yes it is i know what im doing for what reason and its right because i think im the right person i hope and pray i can live up to this he nodded his head at spender go on he called in a loud whisper which no one heard ill give you thirty seconds more to get away thirty seconds the watch ticked on his wrist the captain watched it tick the men were running spender did not move the watch ticked for a long time very loudly in the captains ears go on spender go on get away the thirty seconds were up the gun was sighted the captain drew a deep breath spender he said exhaling he pulled the trigger all that happened was that a faint powdering of rock went up in the sunlight the echoes of the report faded the captain arose and called to his men hes dead the other men did not believe it their angles had prevented their seeing that particular fissure in the rocks they saw their captain run up the hill alone and thought him either very brave or insane the men came after him a few minutes later they gathered around the body and someone said in the chest the captain looked down in the chest he said he saw how the rocks had changed color under spender i wonder why he waited i wonder why he didnt escape as he planned i wonder why he stayed on and got himself killed who knows someone said spender lay there his hands clasped one around the gun the other around the silver book that glittered in the sun was it because of me thought the captain was it because i refused to give in myself did spender hate the idea of killing me am i any different from these others here is that what did it did he figure he could trust me what other answer is there none he squatted by the silent body ive got to live up to this he thought i cant let him down now if he figured there was something in me that was like himself and couldnt kill me because of it then what a job i have ahead of me thats it yes thats it im spender all over again but i think before i shoot i dont shoot at all i dont kill i do things with people and he couldnt kill me because i was himself under a slightly different condition the captain felt the sunlight on the back of his neck he heard himself talking if only he had come to me and talked it over before he shot anybody we could have worked it out somehow worked what out said parkhill what could we have worked out with his likes there was a singing of heat in the land off the rocks and off the blue sky i guess youre right said the captain we could never have got together spender and myself perhaps but spender and you and the others no never hes better off now let me have a drink from that canteen it was the captain who suggested the empty sarcophagus for spender they had found an ancient martian tomb yard they put spender into a silver case with waxes and wines which were ten thousand years old his hands folded on his chest the last they saw of him was his peaceful face they stood for a moment in the ancient vault i think it would be a good idea for you to think of spender from time to time said the captain they walked from the vault and shut the marble door the next afternoon parkhill did some target practice in one of the dead cities shooting out the crystal windows and blowing the tops off the fragile towers the captain caught parkhiil and knocked his teeth out august the settlers the men of earth came to mars they came because they were afraid or unafraid because they were happy or unhappy because they felt like pilgrims or did not feel like pilgrims there was a reason for each man they were leaving bad wives or bad jobs or bad towns they were coming to find something or leave something or get something to dig up something or bury something or leave something alone they were coming with small dreams or large dreams or none at all but a government finger pointed from fourcolor posters in many towns theres work for you in the sky see mars and the men shuffled forward only a few at first a doublescore for most men felt the great illness in them even before the rocket fired into space and this disease was called the loneliness because when you saw your home town dwindle the size of your fist and then lemonsize and then pinsize and vanish in the firewake you felt you had never been born there was no town you were nowhere with space all around nothing familiar only other strange men and when the state of illinois iowa missouri or montana vanished into cloud seas and doubly when the united states shrank to a misted island and the entire planet earth became a muddy baseball tossed away then you were alone wandering in the meadows of space on your way to a place you couldnt imagine so it was not unusual that the first men were few the number grew steadily in proportion to the census of earth men already on mars there was comfort in numbers but the first lonely ones had to stand by themselves december the green morning when the sun set he crouched by the path and cooked a small supper and listened to the fire crack while he put the food in his mouth and chewed thoughtfully it had been a day not unlike thirty others with many neat holes dug in the dawn hours seeds dropped in and water brought from the bright canals now with an iron weariness in his slight body he lay and watched the sky color from one darkness to another his name was benjamin driscoll and he was thirtyone years old and the thing that be wanted was mars grown green and tall with trees and foliage producing air more air growing larger with each season trees to cool the towns in the boiling summer trees to hold back the winter winds there were so many things a tree could do add color provide shade drop fruit or become a childrens playground a whole sky universe to climb and hang from an architecture of food and pleasure that was a tree but most of all the trees would distill an icy air for the lungs and a gentle rustling for the ear when you lay nights in your snowy bed and were gentled to sleep by the sound he lay listening to the dark earth gather itself waiting for the sun for the rains that hadnt come yet his ear to the ground he could hear the feet of the years ahead moving at a distance and he imagined the seeds he had placed today sprouting up with green and taking hold on the sky pushing out branch after branch until mars was an afternoon forest mars was a shining orchard in the early morning with the small sun lifting faintly among the folded hills he would be up and finished with a smoky breakfast in a few minutes and trodding out the fire ashes be on his way with knapsacks testing digging placing seed or sprout tamping lightly watering going on whistling looking at the clear sky brightening toward a warm noon you need the air he told his night fire the fire was a ruddy lively companion that snapped back at you that slept close by with drowsy pink eyes warm through the chilly night we all need the air its a thin air here on mars you get tired so soon its like living in the andes in south america high you inhale and dont get anything it doesnt satisfy he felt his rib case in thirty days how it had grown to take in more air they would all have to build their lungs or plant more trees thats what im here for he said the fire popped in school they told a story about johnny appleseed walking across america planting apple trees well im doing more im planting oaks elms and maples every kind of tree aspens and deodars and chestnuts instead of making just fruit for the stomach im making air for the lungs when those trees grow up some year think of the oxygen theyll make he remembered his arrival on mars like a thousand others he had gazed out upon a still morning and thought how do i fit here what will i do is there a job for me then he had fainted someone pushed a vial of ammonia to his nose and coughing he came around youll be all right said the doctor what happened the airs pretty thin some cant take it i think youll have to go back to earth no he sat up and almost immediately felt his eyes darken and mars revolve twice around under him his nostrils dilated and he forced his lungs to drink in deep nothingness ill be all right ive got to stay here they let him lie gasping in horrid fishlike motions and he thought air air air theyre sending me back because of air and he turned his head to look across the martian fields and hills he brought them to focus and the first thing he noticed was that there were no trees no trees at all as far as you could look in any direction the land was down upon itself a land of black loam but nothing on it not even grass air he thought the thin stuff whistling in his nostrils air air and on top of hills or in their shadows or even by little creeks not a tree and not a single green blade of grass of course he felt the answer came not from his mind but his lungs and his throat and the thought was like a sudden gust of pure oxygen raising him up trees and grass he looked down at his hands and turned them over he would plant trees and grass that would be his job to fight against the very thing that might prevent his staying here he would have a private horticultural war with mars there lay the old soil and the plants of it so ancient they had worn themselves out but what if new forms were introduced earth trees great mimosas and weeping willows and magnolias and magnificent eucalyptus what then there was no guessing what mineral wealth hid in the soil untapped because the old ferns flowers bushes and trees had tired themselves to death let me up he shouted ive got to see the coordinator he and the coordinator had talked an entire morning about things that grew and were green it would be months if not years before organized planting began so far frosted food was brought from earth in flying icicles a few community gardens were greening up in hydroponic plants meanwhile said the coordinator its your job well get what seed we can for you a little equipment space on the rockets is mighty precious now im afraid since these first towns are mining communities there wont be much sympathy for your tree planting but youll let me do it they let him do it provided with a single motorcycle its bin full of rich seeds and sprouts he had parked his vehicle in the valley wilderness and struck out on foot over the land that had been thirty days ago and he had never glanced back for looking back would have been sickening to the heart the weather was excessively dry it was doubtful if any seeds had sprouted yet perhaps his entire campaign his four weeks of bending and scooping were lost he kept his eyes only ahead of him going on down this wide shallow valley under the sun away from first town waiting for the rains to come clouds were gathering over the dry mountains now as he drew his blanket over his shoulders mars was a place as unpredictable as time he felt the baked hills simmering down into frosty night and he thought of the rich inky soil a soil so black and shiny it almost crawled and stirred in your fist a rank soil from which might sprout gigantic beanstalks from which with boneshaking concussion might drop screaming giants the fire fluttered into sleepy ash the air tremored to the distant roll of a cartwheel thunder a sudden odor of water tonight he thought and put his hand out to feel for rain tonight he awoke to a tap on his brow water ran down his nose into his lips another drop hit his eye blurring it another splashed his chin the rain raw gentle and easy it mizzled out of the high air a special elixir tasting of spells and stars and air carrying a peppery dust in it and moving like a rare light sherry on his tongue rain he sat up he let the blanket fall and his blue denim shirt spot while the rain took on more solid drops the fire looked as though an invisible animal were dancing on it crushing it until it was angry smoke the rain fell the great black lid of sky cracked in six powdery blue chips like a marvelous crackled glaze and rushed down he saw ten billion rain crystals hesitating long enough to be photographed by the electrical display then darkness and water he was drenched to the skin but he held his face up and let the water hit his eyelids laughing he clapped his hands together and stepped up and walked around his little camp and it was one oclock in the morning it rained steadily for two hours and then stopped the stars came out freshly washed and clearer than ever changing into dry clothes from his cellophane pack mr benjamin driscoll lay down and went happily to sleep the sun rose slowly among the hills it broke out upon the land quietly and wakened mr driscoll where he lay he waited a moment before arising he had worked and waited a long hot month and now standing up he turned at last and faced the direction from which he had come it was a green morning as far as he could see the trees were standing up against the sky not one tree not two not a dozen but the thousands he had planted in seed and sprout and not little trees no not saplings not little tender shoots but great trees huge trees trees as tall as ten men green and green and huge and round and full trees shimmering their metallic leaves trees whispering trees in a line over hills lemon trees lime trees redwoods and mimosas and oaks and elms and aspens cherry maple ash apple orange eucalyptus stung by a tumultuous rain nourished by alien and magical soil and even as he watched throwing out new branches popping open new buds impossible cried mr benjamin driscoll but the valley and the morning were green and the air all about like a moving current a mountain river came the new air the oxygen blowing from the green trees you could see it shimmer high in crystal billows oxygen fresh pure green cold oxygen turning the valley into a river delta in a moment the town doors would flip wide people would run out through the new miracle of oxygen sniffing gusting in lungfuls of it cheeks pinking with it noses frozen with it lungs revivified hearts leaping and worn bodies lifted into a dance mr benjamin driscoll took one long deep drink of green water air and fainted before he woke again five thousand new trees had climbed up into the yellow sun february the locusts the rockets set the bony meadows afire turned rock to lava turned wood to charcoal transmitted water to steam made sand and silica into green glass which lay like shattered mirrors reflecting the invasion all about the rockets came like drums beating in the night the rockets came like locusts swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke and from the rockets ran men with hammers in their hands to beat the strange world into a shape that was familiar to the eye to bludgeon away all the strangeness their mouths fringed with nails so they resembled steeltoothed carnivores spitting them into their swift hands as they hammered up frame cottages and scuttled over roofs with shingles to blot out the eerie stars and fit green shades to pull against the night and when the carpenters had hurried on the women came in with flowerpots and chintz and pans and set up a kitchen clamor to cover the silence that mars made waiting outside the door and the shaded window in six months a dozen small towns had been laid down upon the naked planet filled with sizzling neon tubes and yellow electric bulbs in all some ninety thousand people came to mars and more on earth were packing their grips august night meeting before going up into the blue hills tomбs gomez stopped for gasoline at the lonely station kind of alone out here arent you pop said tomбs the old man wiped off the windshield of the small truck not bad how do you like mars pop fine always something new i made up my mind when i came here last year i wouldnt expect nothing nor ask nothing nor be surprised at nothing weve got to forget earth and how things were weve got to look at what were in here and how different it is i get a hell of a lot of fun out of just the weather here its martian weather hot as hell daytimes cold as hell nights i get a big kick out of the different flowers and different rain i came to mars to retire and i wanted to retire in a place where everything is different an old man needs to have things different young people dont want to talk to him other old people bore hell out of him so i thought the best thing for me is a place so different that all you got to do is open your eyes and youre entertained i got this gas station if business picks up too much ill move on back to some other old highway thats not so busy where i can earn just enough to live on and still have time to feel the different things here you got the right idea pop said tomбs his brown hands idly on the wheel he was feeling good he had been working in one of the new colonies for ten days straight and now he had two days off and was on his way to a party im not surprised at anything any more said the old man im just looking im just experiencing if you cant take mars for what she is you might as well go back to earth everythings crazy up here the soil the air the canals the natives the clocks even my clock acts funny even time is crazy up here sometimes i feel im here all by myself no one else on the whole damn planet id take bets on it sometimes i feel about eight years old my body squeezed up and everything else tall jesus its just the place for an old man keeps me alert and keeps me happy you know what mars is its like a thing i got for christmas seventy years agodont know if you ever had onethey called them kaleidoscopes bits of crystal and cloth and beads and pretty junk you held it up to the sunlight and looked in through at it and it took your breath away all the patterns well thats mars enjoy it dont ask it to be nothing else but what it is jesus you know that highway right there built by the martians is over sixteen centuries old and still in good condition thats one dollar and fifty cents thanks and good night tomбs drove off down the ancient highway laughing quietly it was a long road going into darkness and hills and he held to the wheel now and again reaching into his lunch bucket and taking out a piece of candy he had been driving steadily for an hour with no other car on the road no light just the road going under the hum the roar and mars out there so quiet mars was always quiet but quieter tonight than any other the deserts and empty seas swung by him and the mountains against the stars there was a smell of time in the air tonight he smiled and turned the fancy in his mind there was a thought what did time smell like like dust and clocks and people and if you wondered what time sounded like it sounded like water running in a dark cave and voices crying and dirt dropping down upon hollow box lids and rain and going further what did time look like time looked like snow dropping silently into a black room or it looked like a silent film in an ancient theater one hundred billion faces falling like those new year balloons down and down into nothing that was how time smelled and looked and sounded and tonighttomбs shoved a hand into the wind outside the trucktonight you could almost touch time he drove the truck between hills of time his neck prickled and he sat up watching ahead he pulled into a little dead martian town stopped the engine and let the silence come in around him he sat not breathing looking out at the white buildings in the moonlight uninhabited for centuries perfect faultless in ruins yes but perfect nevertheless he started the engine and drove on another mile or more before stopping again climbing out carrying his lunch bucket and walking to a little promontory where he could look back at that dusty city he opened his thermos and poured himself a cup of coffee a night bird flew by he felt very good very much at peace perhaps five minutes later there was a sound off in the hills where the ancient highway curved there was a motion a dim light and then a murmur tomбs turned slowly with the coffee cup in his hand and out of the hills came a strange thing it was a machine like a jadegreen insect a praying mantis delicately rushing through the cold air indistinct countless green diamonds winking over its body and red jewels that glittered with multifaceted eyes its six legs fell upon the ancient highway with the sounds of a sparse rain which dwindled away and from the back of the machine a martian with melted gold for eyes looked down at tomбs as if he were looking into a well tomбs raised his hand and thought hello automatically but did not move his lips for this was a martian but tomбs had swum in blue rivers on earth with strangers passing on the road and eaten in strange houses with strange people and his weapon had always been his smile he did not carry a gun and he did not feel the need of one now even with the little fear that gathered about his heart at this moment the martians hands were empty too for a moment they looked across the cool air at each other it was tomis who moved first hello he called hello called the martian in his own language they did not understand each other did you say hello they both asked what did you say they said each in a different tongue they scowled who are you said tomбs in english what are you doing here in martian the strangers lips moved where are you going they said and looked bewildered im tomбs gomez im muhe ca neither understood but they tapped their chests with the words and then it became clear and then the martian laughed wait tomбs felt his head touched but no hand had touched him there said the martian in english that is better you learned my language so quick nothing at all they looked embarrassed with a new silence at the steaming coffee he had in one hand something different said the martian eying him and the coffee referring to them both perhaps may i offer you a drink said tomбs please the martian slid down from his machine a second cup was produced and filled steaming tomбs held it out their hands met andlike mistfell through each other jesus christ cried tomбs and dropped the cup name of the gods said the martian in his own tongue did you see what happened they both whispered they were very cold and terrified the martian bent to touch the cup but could not touch it jesus said tomбs indeed the martian tried again and again to get hold of the cup but could not he stood up and thought for a moment then took a knife from his belt hey cried tomбs you misunderstand catch said the martian and tossed it tomбs cupped his hands the knife fell through his flesh it hit the ground tomбs bent to pick it up but could not touch it and he recoiled shivering now he looked at the martian against the sky the stars he said the stars said the martian looking in turn at tomбs the stars were white and sharp beyond the flesh of the martian and they were sewn into his flesh like scintillas swallowed into the thin phosphorescent membrane of a gelatinous sea fish you could see stars flickering like violet eyes in the martians stomach and chest and through his wrists like jewelry i can see through you said tomбs and i through you said the martian stepping back tomбs felt of his own body and feeling the warmth was reassured i am real he thought the martian touched his own nose and lips i have flesh he said half aloud i am alive tomбs stared at the stranger and if i am real then you must be dead no you a ghost a phantom they pointed at each other with starlight burning in their limbs like daggers and icicles and fireflies and then fell to judging their limbs again each finding himself intact hot excited stunned awed and the other ah yes that other over there unreal a ghostly prism flashing the accumulated light of distant worlds im drunk thought tomбs i wont tell anyone of this tomorrow no no they stood there on the ancient highway neither of them moving where are you from asked the martian at last earth what is that there tomбs nodded to the sky when we landed over a year ago remember no and all of you were dead all but a few youre rare dont you know that thats not true yes dead i saw the bodies black in the rooms in the houses dead thousands of them thats ridiculous were alive mister youre invaded only you dont know it you must have escaped i havent escaped there was nothing to escape what do you mean im on my way to a festival now at the canal near the eniall mountains i was there last night dont you see the city there the martian pointed tomбs looked and saw the ruins why that citys been dead thousands of years the martian laughed dead i slept there yesterday and i was in it a week ago and the week before that and i just drove through it now and its a heap see the broken pillars broken why i see them perfectly the moonlight helps and the pillars are upright theres dust in the streets said tomбs the streets are clean the canals are empty right there the canals are full of lavender wine its dead its alive protested the martian laughing more now oh youre quite wrong see all the carnival lights there are beautiful boats as slim as women beautiful women as slim as boats women the color of sand women with fire flowers in their hands i can see them small running in the streets there thats where im going now to the festival well float on the waters all night long well sing well drink well make love cant you see it mister that city is dead as a dried lizard ask any of our party me im on my way to green city tonight thats the new colony we just raised over near illinois highway youre mixed up we brought in a million board feet of oregon lumber and a couple dozen tons of good steel nails and hammered together two of the nicest little villages you ever saw tonight were warming one of them a couple rockets are coming in from earth bringing our wives and girl friends therell be barn dances and whisky the martian was now disquieted you say it is over that way there are the rockets tomбs walked him to the edge of the hill and pointed down see no damn it there they are those long silver things no now tomбs laughed youre blind i see very well you are the one who does not see but you see the new town dont you i see nothing but an ocean and water at low tide mister that waters been evaporated for forty centuries ah now now that is enough its true i tell you the martian grew very serious tell me again you do not see the city the way i describe it the pillars very white the boats very slender the festival lightsoh i see them clearly and listen i can hear them singing its no space away at all tomбs listened and shook his head no and i on the other hand said the martian cannot see what you describe well againthey were cold an ice was in their flesh can it be what you say from the sky earth earth a name nothing said the martian but as i came up the pass an hour ago he touched the back of his neck i felt cold yes and now cold again oddly there was a thing to the light to the hills the road said the martian i felt the strangeness the road the light and for a moment i felt as if i were the last man alive on this world so did i said tomбs and it was like talking to an old and dear friend confiding growing warm with the topic the martian closed his eyes and opened them again this can only mean one thing it has to do with time yes you are a figment of the past no you are from the past said the earth man having had time to think of it now you are so certain how can you prove who is from the past who from the future what year is it two thousand and one what does that mean to me tomбs considered and shrugged nothing it is as if i told you that it is the year sec it is nothing and more than nothing where is the clock to show us how the stars stand but the ruins prove it they prove that i am the future i am alive you are dead everything in me denies this my heart beats my stomach hungers my mouth thirsts no no not dead not alive either of us more alive than anything else caught between is more like it two strangers passing in the night that is it two strangers passing ruins you say yes youre afraid who wants to see the future who ever does a man can face the past but to thinkthe pillars crumbled you say and the sea empty and the canals dry and the maidens dead and the flowers withered the martian was silent but then he looked on ahead but there they are i see them isnt that enough for me they wait for me now no matter what you say and for tomбs the rockets far away waiting for him and the town and the women from earth we can never agree he said let us agree to disagree said the martian what does it matter who is past or future if we are both alive for what follows will follow tomorrow or in ten thousand years how do you know that those temples are not the temples of your own civilization one hundred centuries from now tumbled and broken you do not know then dont ask but the night is very short there go the festival fires in the sky and the birds tomгs put out his hand the martian did likewise in imitation their hands did not touch they melted through each other will we meet again who knows perhaps some other night id like to go with you to that festival and i wish i might come to your new town to see this ship you speak of to see these men to hear all that has happened goodby said tomбs good night the martian rode his green metal vehicle quietly away into the hills the earth man turned his truck and drove it silently in the opposite direction good lord what a dream that was sighed tomбs his hands on the wheel thinking of the rockets the women the raw whisky the virginia reels the party how strange a vision was that thought the martian rushing on thinking of the festival the canals the boats the women with golden eyes and the songs the night was dark the moons had gone down starlight twinkled on the empty highway where now there was not a sound no car no person nothing and it remained that way all the rest of the cool dark night october the shore mars was a distant shore and the men spread upon it in waves each wave different and each wave stronger the first wave carried with it men accustomed to spaces and coldness and being alone the coyote and cattlemen with no fat on them with faces the years had worn the flesh off with eyes like nailheads and hands like the material of old gloves ready to touch anything mars could do nothing to them for they were bred to plains and prairies as open as the martian fields they came and made things a little less empty so that others would find courage to follow they put panes in hollow windows and lights behind the panes they were the first men everyone knew who the first women would be the second men should have traveled from other countries with other accents and other ideas but the rockets were american and the men were american and it stayed that way while europe and asia and south america and australia and the islands watched the roman candles leave them behind the rest of the world was buried in war or the thoughts of war so the second men were americans also and they came from the cabbage tenements and subways and they found much rest and vacation in the company of silent men from the tumbleweed states who knew how to use silences so they filled you up with peace after long years crushed in tubes tins and boxes in new york and among the second men were men who looked by their eyes as if they were on their way to god february interim they brought in fifteen thousand lumber feet of oregon pine to build tenth city and seventynine thousand feet of california redwood and they hammered together a clean neat little town by the edge of the stone canals on sunday nights you could see red blue and green stainedglass light in the churches and hear the voices singing the numbered hymns we will now sing we will now sing and in certain houses you heard the hard clatter of a typewriter the novelist at work or the scratch of a pen the poet at work or no sound at all the former beachcomber at work it was as if in many ways a great earthquake had shaken loose the roots and cellars of an iowa town and then in an instant a whirlwind twister of ozlike proportions had carried the entire town off to mars to set it down without a bump april the musicians the boys would hike far out into the martian country they carried odorous paper bags into which from time to time upon the long walk they would insert their noses to inhale the rich smell of the ham and mayonnaised pickles and to listen to the liquid gurgle of the orange soda in the warming bottles swinging their grocery bags full of clean watery green onions and odorous liverwurst and red catsup and white bread they would dare each other on past the limits set by their stem mothers they would run yelling first one there gets to kick they biked in summer autumn or winter autumn was most fun because then they imagined like on earth they were scuttering through autumn leaves they would come like a scatter of jackstones on the marble flats beside the canals the candycheeked boys with blueagate eyes panting oniontainted commands to each other for now that they had reached the dead forbidden town it was no longer a matter of last one theres a girl or first one gets to play musician now the dead towns doors lay wide and they thought they could hear the faintest crackle like autumn leaves from inside they would hush themselves forward by each others elbows carrying sticks remembering their parents had told them not there no to none of the old towns watch where you hike youll get the beating of your life when you come home well check your shoes and there they stood in the dead city a heap of boys their hiking lunches half devoured daring each other in shrieky whispers here goes nothing and suddenly one of them took off into the nearest stone house through the door across the living room and into the bedroom where without half looking he would kick about thrash his feet and the black leaves would fly through the air brittle thin as tissue cut from midnight sky behind him would race six others and the first boy there would be the musician playing the white xylophone bones beneath the outer covering of black flakes a great skull would roll to view like a snowball they shouted ribs like spider legs plangent as a dull harp and then the black flakes of mortality blowing all about them in their scuffling dance the boys pushed and heaved and fell in the leaves in the death that had turned the dead to flakes and dryness into a game played by boys whose stomachs gurgled with orange pop and then out of one house into another into seventeen houses mindful that each of the towns in its turn was being burned clean of its horrors by the firemen antiseptic warriors with shovels and bins shoveling away at the ebony tatters and peppermintstick bones slowly but assuredly separating the terrible from the normal so they must play very hard these boys the firemen would soon be here then luminous with sweat they gnashed at their last sandwiches with a final kick a final marimba concert a final autumnal lunge through leaf stacks they went home their mothers examined their shoes for black flakelets which when discovered resulted in scalding baths and fatherly beatings by the years end the firemen had raked the autumn leaves and white xylophones away and it was no more fun june way in the middle of the air did you hear about it about what the niggers the niggers what about em them leaving pulling out going away did you hear what you mean pulling out how can they do that they can they will they are just a couple every single one here in the south no yes i got to see that i dont believe it where they going africa a silence mars you mean the planet mars thats right the men stood up in the hot shade of the hardware porch someone quit lighting a pipe somebody else spat out into the hot dust of noon they cant leave they cant do that theyre doing it anyways whered you hear this its everywhere on the radio a minute ago just come through like a series of dusty statues the men came to life samuel teece the hardware proprietor laughed uneasily i wondered what happened to silly i sent him on my bike an hour ago he aint come back from mrs bordmans yet you think that black fool just pedaled off to mars the men snorted all i say is he better bring back my bike i dont take stealing from no one by god listen the men collided irritably with each other turning far up the street the levee seemed to have broken the black warm waters descended and engulfed the town between the blazing white banks of the town stores among the tree silences a black tide flowed like a kind of summer molasses it poured turgidly forth upon the cinnamondusty road it surged slow slow and it was men and women and horses and barking dogs and it was little boys and girls and from the mouths of the people partaking of this tide came the sound of a river a summerday river going somewhere murmuring and irrevocable and in that slow steady channel of darkness that cut across the white glare of day were touches of alert white the eyes the ivory eyes staring ahead glancing aside as the river the long and endless river took itself from old channels into a new one from various and uncountable tributaries in creeks and brooks of color and motion the parts of this river had joined become one mother current and flowed on and brimming the swell were things carried by the river grandfather clocks chiming kitchen clocks ticking caged hens screaming babies wailing and swimming among the thickened eddies were mules and cats and sudden excursions of burst mattress springs floating by insane hair stuffing sticking out and boxes and crates and pictures of dark grandfathers in oak frames the river flowing it on while the men sat like nervous hounds on the hardware porch too late to mend the levee their hands empty samuel teece wouldnt believe it why hell whered they get the transportation how they goin to get to mars rockets said grandpa quartermain all the damnfool things whered they get rockets saved their money and built them i never heard about it seems these niggers kept it secret worked on the rockets all themselves dont know wherein africa maybe could they do that demanded samuel teece pacing about the porch aint there a

rockets be there at one oclock pick em up take em to mars telephone the governor call out the militia cried teece they shouldve given notice here comes your woman teece the men turned again as they watched down the hot road in the windless light first one white woman and then another arrived all of them with stunned faces all of them rustling like ancient papers some of them were crying some were stern all came to find their husbands they pushed through barroom swing doors vanishing they entered cool quiet groceries they went in at drug shops and garages and one of them mrs clara teece came to stand in the dust by the hardware porch blinking up at her stiff and angry husband as the black river flowed full behind her its lucinda pa you got to come home im not comin home for no damn darkie shes leaving whatll i do without her fetch for yourself maybe i wont get down on my knees to stop her but shes like a family member mrs teece moaned dont shout i wont have you blubberin in

luncheon on the table and all of us too upset to even eat it its still there now i know last time i looked it was getting cold teece almost struck her god damn it mrs teece you get the hell home standin there makin a sight of yourself but pa he strode away into the hot dimness of the store he came back out a few seconds later with a silver pistol in his hand his wife was gone the river flowed black between the buildings with a rustle and a creak and a constant whispering shuffle it was a very quiet thing with a great certainty to it no laughter no wildness just a steady decided and ceaseless flow teece sat on the edge of his hardwood chair if one of em so much as laughs by christ ill kill em the men waited the river passed quietly in the dreamful noon looks like you goin to have to hoe your own turnips sam grandpa chuckled im not bad at shootin white folks neither teece didnt look at grandpa grandpa turned his head away and shut up his mouth hold on there samuel teece leaped off the porch he reached up and seized the reins of a horse ridden by a tall negro man you belter come down off there yes sir belter slid down teece looked him over now just what you think youre doin

going along the street that dark river flowing and flowing between the shops the dark river on wheels and horses and in dusty shoes the dark river from which he had been snatched on his journey he began to shiver let me go mr teece ill send your money from up there i promise listen belter teece grasped the mans suspenders like two harp strings playing them now and again contemptuously snorting at the sky pointing one bony finger straight at god belter you know anything about whats up there what they tells me what they tells him christ hear that what they tells him he swung the mans weight

a shame now teece tried to look sad i give you my horse sir horse aint legal tender you dont move until i get my money teece laughed inside he felt very warm and good a small crowd of dark people had gathered to hear all this now as belter stood head down trembling an old man stepped forward mister teece flashed him a quick look well how much this man owe you mister none of your damn business the old man looked at belter how much son fifty dollars the old man put out his black hands at the people around him theres twentyfive of you each give two dollars quick now this no time for argument here

guess i aint teece shouted you give that money back to them belter bowed respectfully handing the money over and when teece would not touch it he set it down in the dust at teeces feet theres your money sir he said thank you kindly smiling he gained the saddle of his horse and whipped his horse along thanking the old man who rode with him now until they were out of sight and hearing son of a bitch whispered teece staring blind at the sun son of a bitch pick up the money samuel said someone from the porch it was happening all along the way little white boys barefoot dashed up with the news them that has helps them that hasnt and that way they all get free seen a rich man give a poor man two hundred bucks to pay off someun seen someun else give someun else ten bucks five bucks sixteen lots of that all over everybody the white men sat with sour water in their mouths their eyes were almost puffed shut as if they had been struck in their faces by wind and sand and heat the rage was in samuel teece he climbed up on the porch and glared at the passing swarms he waved his gun and after a while when he had to do something he began to shout at anyone any negro who looked up at him bang theres another rocket out in space he shouted so all could hear bang by god the dark heads didnt flicker or pretend to hear but their white eyes slid swiftly over and back crash all them rockets fallin screamin dyin bang god almighty im glad im right here on old terra firma as they says in that old joke the more firma the less terra ha ha horses clopped along shuffling up dust wagons bumbled on ruined springs bang his voice was lonely in the heat trying to terrify the dust and the blazing sun sky wham niggers all over space jerked outa rockets like so many minnows hit by a meteor by god space fulla meteors you know that sure thick as buckshot powie shoot down them tincan rockets like so many ducks so many clay pipes ole sardine cans full of black cod bangin like a stringa ladyfingers bang bang bang ten thousand dead here ten thousand there floatin in space around and around earth ever and ever cold and way out lord you hear that you there silence the river was broad and continuous having entered all cotton shacks during the hour having flooded all the valuables out it was now carrying the clocks and the washboards the silk bolts and curtain rods on down to some distant black sea high tide passed it was two oclock low tide came soon the river was dried up the town silent the dust settling in a film on the stores the seated men the tall hot trees silence the men on the porch listened hearing nothing they extended their thoughts and their imaginations out and into the surrounding meadows in the early morning the land had been filled with its usual concoctions of sound here and there with stubborn persistence to custom there had been voices singing the honey laughter under the mimosa branches the pickaninnies rushing in clear water laughter at the creek movements and bendings in the fields jokes and shouts of amusement from the shingle shacks covered with fresh green vine now it was as if a great wind had washed the land clean of sounds there was nothing skeleton doors hung open on leather hinges rubbertire swings hung in the silent air uninhibited the washing rocks at the river were empty and the watermelon patches if any were left alone to heat their hidden liquors in the sun spiders started building new webs in abandoned huts dust started to sift in from unpatched roofs in golden spicules here and there a fire forgotten in the last rush lingered and in a sudden access of strength fed upon the dry bones of some littered shack the sound of a gentle feeding burn went up through the silenced air the men sat on the hardware porch not blinking or swallowing i cant figure why they left now with things lookin up i mean every day they got more rights what they want anyway heres the poll tax gone and more and more states passin antilynchin bills and all kinds of equal rights what more they want they make almost as good money as a white man but there they go far down the empty street a bicycle came ill be goddamned teece here comes your silly now the bicycle pulled up before the porch a seventeenyearold colored boy on it all arms and feet and long legs and round watermelon head he looked up at samuel teece and smiled so you got a guilty conscience and came back said teece no sir i just brought the bicycle whats wrong couldnt get it on the rocket that wasnt it sir dont tell me what it was get off youre not goin to steal my property he gave the boy a push the bicycle fell get inside and start cleaning the brass beg pardon the boys eyes widened you heard what i said theres guns need unpacking there and a crate of nails just come from natchez mr teece and a box of hammers need fixin mr teece sir you still standin there teece glared mr teece you dont mind i take the day off he said apologetically and tomorrow and day after tomorrow and the day after the day after that said teece im afraid so sir you should be afraid boy come here he marched the boy across the porch and drew a paper out of a desk remember this sir its your workin paper you signed it theres your x right there aint it answer me i didnt sign that mr teece the boy trembled anyone can make an x listen to this silly contract i will work for mr samuel teece two years starting july and if intending to leave will give four weeks notice and continue working until my position is filled there teece slapped the paper his eyes glittering you

well treat you good and give you good food boy now you just get inside and start working and forget all about that nonsense eh silly sure teece grinned and patted the boys shoulder the boy turned and looked at the old men sitting on the porch he could hardly see now for his tears maybemaybe one of these gentlemen here the men looked up in the hot uneasy shadows looking first at the boy and then at teece you meanin to say you think a white man should take your place boy asked teece coldly grandpa quartermain took his red hands off his knees he looked out at the horizon thoughtfully and said teece what about me what ill take sillys job the porch was silent teece balanced himself in the air grandpa he said warningly let the boy go ill clean the brass would you would you really silly ran over to grandpa laughing tears on his cheeks unbelieving sure grandpa said teece keep your damn trap outa this give the kid a break teece teece walked over and seized the boys arm hes mine im lockin him in the back room until tonight dont mr teece the boy began to sob now his crying filled the air of the porch his eyes were tight far down the street an old tin ford was choking along approaching a last load of colored people in it here comes my family mr teece oh please please oh god please teece said one of the other men on the porch getting up let him go another man rose also that goes for me too and me said another whats the use the men all talked now cut it out teece let him go teece felt for his gun in his pocket he saw the mens faces he took his hand away and left the gun in his pocket and said so thats how it is thats how it is someone said teece let the boy go all right get out he jerked his hand back in the store but i hope you dont think youre gonna leave any trash behind to clutter my store no sir you clean everything outa your shed in back burn it silly shook his head ill take it with they wont let you put it on that damn rocket ill take it with insisted the boy softly he rushed back through the hardware store there were sounds of sweeping and cleaning out and a moment later he appeared his hands full of tops and marbles and old dusty kites and junk collected through the years just then the old tin ford drove up and silly climbed in and the door slammed teece stood on the porch with a bitter smile what you goin to do up there startin new said silly gonna have my own hardware god damn it you been learnin my trade so you could run off and use it no sir i never thought one day thisd happen sir but it did i cant help it if i learned mr teece i suppose you

the ships mr teece god the son and the holy ghost i wouldnt wonder say boy you got one named the first baptist church we got to leave now mr teece teece laughed you got one named swing low and another named sweet chariot the car started up goodby mr teece you got one named roll dem bones goodby mister and another called over jordan ha well tote that rocket boy lift that rocket boy go on get blown up see if i care the car churned off into the dust the boy rose and cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted one last time at teece mr teece mr teece what you goin to do nights from now on what you goin to do nights mr teece silence the car faded down the road it was gone what in hell did he mean mused teece what am i goin to do nights he watched the dust settle and it suddenly came to him he remembered nights when men drove to his house their knees sticking up sharp and their shotguns sticking up sharper like a carful of cranes under the night trees of summer their eyes mean honking the horn and him slamming his door a gun in his hand laughing to himself his heart racing like a tenyearolds driving off down the summernight road a ring of hemp rope coiled on the car floor fresh shell boxes making every mans coat look bunchy how many nights over the years how many nights of the wind rushing in the car flopping their hair over their mean eyes roaring as they picked a tree a good strong tree and rapped on a shanty door so thats what the son of a bitch meant teece leaped out into the sunlight come back you bastard what am i goin to do nights why that lousy insolent son of a it was a good question he sickened and was empty yes what will we do nights he thought now theyre gone what he was absolutely empty and numb he pulled the pistol from his pocket checked its load what you goin to do sam someone asked kill that son of a bitch grandpa said dont get yourself heated but samuel teece was gone around behind the store a moment later he drove out the drive in his opentop car anyone comin with me id like a drive said grandpa and got up anyone else nobody replied grandpa got in and slammed the door samuel teece gutted the car out in a great whorl of dust they didnt speak as they rushed down the road under the bright sky the heat from the dry meadows was shimmering they stopped at a crossroad which wayd they go grandpa grandpa squinted straight on ahead i figure they went on under the summer trees their car made a lonely sound the road was empty and as they drove along they began to notice something teece slowed the car and bent out his yellow eyes fierce god damn it grandpa you see what them bastards did what asked grandpa and looked where they had been carefully set down and left in neat bundles every few feet along the empty country road were old roller skates a bandanna full of knicknacks some old shoes a cartwheel stacks of pants and coats and ancient hats bits of oriental crystal that had once tinkled in the wind tin cans of pink geraniums dishes of waxed fruit cartons of confederate money washtubs scrubboards wash lines soap somebodys tricycle someone elses hedge shears a toy wagon a jackinthebox a stainedglass window from the negro baptist church a whole set of brake rims inner tubes mattresses couches rocking chairs jars of cold cream hand mirrors none of it flung down no but deposited gently and with feeling with decorum upon the dusty edges of the road as if a whole city had walked here with hands full at which time a great bronze trumpet had sounded the articles had been relinquished to the quiet dust and one and all the inhabitants of the earth had fled straight up into the blue heavens wouldnt burn them they said cried teece angrily no wouldnt burn them like i said but had to take them along and leave them where they could see them for the last time on the road all together and whole them niggers think theyre smart he veered the car wildly mile after mile down the road tumbling smashing breaking scattering bundles of paper jewel boxes mirrors chairs there by damn and there the front tire gave a whistling cry the car spilled crazily off the road into a ditch flinging teece against the glass son of a bitch he dusted himself off and stood out of the car almost crying with rage he looked at the silent empty road well never catch them now never never as far as he could see there was nothing but bundles and stacks and more bundles neatly placed like little abandoned shrines in the late day in the warmblowing wind teece and grandpa came walking tiredly back to the hardware store an hour later the men were still sitting there listening and watching the sky just as teece sat down and eased his tight shoes off someone cried look ill be damned if i will said teece but the others looked and they saw the golden bobbins rising in the sky far away leaving flame behind they vanished in the cotton fields the wind blew idly among the snow dusters in still farther meadows the watermelons lay unfingerprinted striped like tortoise cats lying in the sun the men on the porch sat down looked at each other looked at the yellow rope piled neat on the store shelves glanced at the gun shells glinting shiny brass in their cartons saw the silver pistols and long black metal shotguns hung high and quiet in the shadows somebody put a straw in his mouth someone else drew a figure in the dust finally samuel teece held his empty shoe up in triumph turned it over stared at it and said did you notice right up to the very last by god he said mister the naming of names they came to the strange blue lands and put their names upon the lands here was hinkston creek and lustig corners and black river and driscoll forest and peregrine mountain and wilder town all the names of people and the things that the people did here was the place where martians killed the first earth men and it was red town and had to do with blood and here where the second expedition was destroyed and it was named second try and each of the other places where the rocket men had set down their fiery caldrons to burn the land the names were left like cinders and of course there was a spender hill and a nathaniel york town the old martian names were names of water and air and hills they were the names of snows that emptied south in stone canals to fill the empty seas and the names of sealed and buried sorcerers and towers and obeisks and the rockets struck at the names like hammers breaking away the marble into shale shattering the crockery milestones that named the old towns in the rubble of which great pylons were plunged with new names iron town steel town aluminum city electric village corn town grain villa detroit ii all the mechanical names and the metal names from earth and after the towns were built and named the graveyards were built and named too green hill moss town boot hill bide a wee and the first dead went into their graves but after everything was pinned down and neat and in its place when everything was safe and certain when the towns were well enough fixed and the loneliness was at a minimum then the sophisticates came in from earth they came on parties and vacations on little shopping trips for trinkets and photographs and the atmosphere they came to study and apply sociological laws they came with stars and badges and rules and regulations bringing some of the red tape that had rawled across earth like an alien weed and letting it grow on mars wherever it could take root they began to plan peoples lives and libraries they began to instruct and push about the very people who had come to mars to get away from being instructed and ruled and pushed about and it was inevitable that some of these people pushed back april usher ii during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher mr william stendahl paused in his quotation there upon a low black hill stood the house its cornerstone bearing the inscription ad mr bigelow the architect said its completed heres the key mr stendahl the two men stood together silently in the quiet autumn afternoon blueprints rustled on the raven grass at their feet the house of usher said mr stendahl with pleasure planned built bought paid for wouldnt mr poe be delighted mr bigelow squinted is it everything you wanted sir yes is the color right is it desolate and terrible very desolate very terrible the walls arebleak amazingly so the tarn is it black and lurid enough most incredibly black and lurid and the sedgeweve dyed it you knowis it the proper gray and ebon hideous mr bigelow consulted his architectural plans from these he quoted in part does the whole structure cause an iciness a sickening of the heart a dreariness of thought the house the lake the land mr stendahl mr bigelow its worth every penny my god its beautiful thank you i had to work in total ignorance thank the lord you had your own private rockets or wed never have been allowed to bring most of the equipment through you notice its always twilight here this land always october barren sterile dead it took a bit of doing we killed everything ten thousand tons of ddt not a snake frog or martian fly left twilight always mr stendahl im proud of that there are machines hidden which blot out the sun its always properly dreary stendahl drank it in the dreariness the oppression the fetid vapors the whole atmosphere so delicately contrived and fitted and that house that crumbling horror that evil lake the fungi the extensive decay plastic or otherwise who could guess he looked at the autumn sky somewhere above beyond far off was the sun somewhere it was the month of april on the planet mars a yellow month with a blue sky somewhere above the rockets burned down to civilize a beautifully dead planet the sound of their screaming passage was muffled by this dim soundproofed world this ancient autumn world now that my jobs done said mr bigelow uneasily i feel free to ask what youre going to do with all this with usher havent you guessed no does the name usher mean nothing to you nothing well what about this name edgar allan poe mr bigelow shook his head of course stendahl snorted delicately a combination of dismay and contempt how could i expect you to know blessed mr poe he died a long while ago before lincoln all of his books were burned in the great fire thats thirty years ago ah said mr bigelow wisely one of those yes one of those bigelow he and lovecraft and hawthorne and ambrose bierce and all the tales of terror and fantasy and horror and for that matter tales of the future were burned heartlessly they passed a law oh it started very small in and it was a grain of sand they began by controlling books of cartoons and then detective books and of course films one way or another one group or another political bias religions prejudice union pressures there was always a minority afraid of something and a great majority afraid of the dark afraid of the future afraid of the past afraid of the present afraid of themselves and shadows of themselves i see afraid of the word politics and with a screw tightened here a bolt fastened there a push a pull a yank art and literature were soon like a great twine of taffy strung about being twisted in braids and tied in knots and thrown in all directions until there was no more resiliency and no more savor to it then the film cameras chopped short and the theaters turned dark and the print presses trickled down from a great niagara of reading matter to a mere innocuous dripping of pure material oh the word escape was radical too i tell you was it it was every man they said must face reality must face the here and now everything that was not so must go all the beautiful literary lies and flights of fancy must be shot in midair so they lined them up against a library wall one sunday morning thirty years ago in they lined them up st nicholas and the headless horseman and snow white and rumpelstiltskin and mother gooseoh what a wailingand shot them down and burned the paper castles and the fairy frogs and old kings and the people who lived happily ever after and once upon a time became no more and they spread the ashes of the phantom rickshaw with the rubble of the land of oz they filleted the bones of glinda the good and ozma and shattered polychrome in a spectroscope and served jack pumpkinhead with meringue at the biologists ball the beanstalk died in a bramble of red tape sleeping beauty awoke at the kiss of a scientist and expired at the fatal puncture of his syringe and they made alice drink something from a bottle which reduced her to a size where she could no longer cry curiouser and curiouser and they gave the looking glass one hammer blow to smash it and every red king and oyster away he clenched his fists lord how immediate it was his face was red and he was gasping for breath as for mr bigelow he was astounded at this long explosion he blinked and at last said sorry dont know what youre talking about just names to me from what i hear the burning was a good thing get out screamed stendahl youve done your job now let me alone you idiot mr bigelow summoned his carpenters and went away mr stendahl stood alone before his house listen here he said to the unseen rockets i came to mars to get away from you cleanminded people but youre flocking in thicker every day like flies to offal so im going to show you im going to teach you a fine lesson for what you did to mr poe on earth as of this day beware the house of usher is open for business he pushed a fist at the sky the rocket landed a man stepped out jauntily he glanced at the house and his gray eyes were displeased and vexed he strode across the moat to confront the small man there your name stendahl yes im garrett investigator of moral climates so you finally got to mars you moral climate people i wondered when youd appear we arrived last week well soon have things as neat and tidy as earth the man waved an identification card irritably toward the house suppose you tell me about that place stendahl its a haunted castle if you like i dont like stendahl i dont like the sound of that word haunted simple enough in this year of our lord i have built a mechanical sanctuary in it copper bats fly on electronic beams brass rats scuttle in plastic cellars robot skeletons dance robot vampires harlequins wolves and white phantoms compounded of chemical and ingenuity live here thats what i was afraid of said garrett smiling quietly im afraid were going to have to tear your place down i knew youd come out as soon as you discovered what went on id have come sooner but we at moral climates wanted to be sure of your intentions before we moved in we can have the dismantlers and burning crew here by supper by midnight your place will be razed to the cellar mr stendahl i consider you somewhat of a fool sir spending hardearned money on a folly why it must have cost you three million dollars four million but mr garrett i inherited twentyfive million when very young i can afford to throw it about seems a dreadful shame though to have the house finished only an hour and have you race out with your dismantlers couldnt you possibly let me play with my toy for just well twentyfour hours you know the law strict to the letter no books no houses nothing to be produced which in any way suggests ghosts vampires fairies or any creature of the imagination youll be burning babbitts next youve caused us a lot of trouble mr stendahl its in the record twenty years ago on earth you and your library yes me and my library and a few others like me oh poes been forgotten for many years now and oz and the other creatures but i had my little cache we had our libraries a few private citizens until you sent your men around with torches and incinerators and tore my fifty thousand books up and burned them just as you put a stake through the heart of halloween and told your film producers that if they made anything at all they would have to make and remake earnest hemingway my god how many times have i seen for whom the bell tolls done thirty different versions all realistic oh realism oh here oh now oh hell it doesnt pay to be bitter mr garrett you must turn in a full report mustnt you yes then for curiositys sake youd better come in and look around itll take only a minute all right lead the way and no tricks ive a gun with me the door to the house of usher creaked wide a moist wind issued forth there was an immense sighing and moaning like a subterranean bellows breathing in the lost catacombs a rat pranced across the floor stones garrett crying out gave it a kick it fell over the rat did and from its nylon fur streamed an incredible horde of metal fleas amazing garrett bent to see an old witch sat in a niche quivering her wax hands over some orangeandblue tarot cards she jerked her head and hissed through her toothless mouth at garrett tapping her greasy cards death she cried now thats the sort of thing i mean said garrett deplorable ill let you burn her personally will you really garrett was pleased then he frowned i must say youre taking this all so well it was enough just to be able to create this place to be able to say i did it to say i nurtured a medieval atmosphere in a modern incredulous world ive a somewhat reluctant admiration for your genius myself sir garrett watched a mist drift by whispering and whispering shaped like a beautiful and nebulous woman down a moist corridor a machine whirled like the stuff from a cottoncandy centrifuge mists sprang up and floated murmuring in the silent halls an ape appeared out of nowhere hold on cried garrett dont be afraid stendahl tapped the animals black chest a robot copper skeleton and all like the witch see he stroked the fur and under it metal tubing came to light yes garrett put out a timid hand to pet the thing but why mr stendahl why all this what obsessed you bureaucracy mr garrett but i havent time to explain the government will discover soon enough he nodded to the ape all right now the ape killed mr garrett are we almost ready pikes pikes looked up from the table yes sir youve done a splendid job well im paid for it mr stendahl said pikes softly as he lifted the plastic eyelid of the robot and inserted the glass eyeball to fasten the rubberoid muscles neatly there the spitting image of mr garrett what do we do with him sir pikes nodded at the slab where the real mr garrett lay dead better burn him pikes we wouldnt want two mr gasretts would we pikes wheeled mr garrett to the brick incinerator goodby he pushed mr garrett in and slammed the door stendahl confronted the robot garrett you have your orders garrett yes sir the robot sat up im to return to moral climates ill file a complementary report delay action for at least fortyeight hours say im investigating more fully right garrett goodby the robot hurried out to garretts rocket got in and flew away stendahl turned now pikes we send the remainder of the invitations for tonight i think well have a jolly time dont you considering we waited twenty years quite jolly they winked at each other seven oclock stendahl studied his watch almost time he twirled the sherry glass in his hand he sat quietly above him among the oaken beams the bats their delicate copper bodies hidden under rubber flesh blinked at him and shrieked he raised his glass to them to our success then he leaned back closed his eyes and considered the entire affair how he would savor this in his old age this paying back of the antiseptic government for its literary terrors and conflagrations oh how the anger and hatred had grown in him through the years oh how the plan had taken a slow shape in his numbed mind until that day three years ago when he had met pikes ah yes pikes pikes with the bitterness in him as deep as a black charred well of green acid who was pikes only the greatest of them all pikes the man of ten thousand faces a fury a smoke a blue fog a white rain a bat a gargoyle a monster that was pikes better than lon chaney the father stendabi ruminated night after night he had watched chaney in the old old films yes better than chaney better than that other ancient mummer what was his name karloff far better lugosi the comparison was odious no there was only one pikes and he was a man stripped of his fantasies now no place on earth to go no one to show off to forbidden even to perform for himself before a mirror poor impossible defeated pikes how must it have felt pikes the night they seized your films like entrails yanked from the camera out of your guts dutching them in coils and wads to stuff them up a stove to burn away did it feel as bad as having some fifty thousand books annihilated with no recompense yes yes stendahl felt his hands grow cold with the senseless anger so what more natural than they would one day talk over endless coffeepots into innumerable midnights and out of all the talk and the bitter brewings would come the house of usher a great church bell rang the guests were arriving smiling he went to greet them full grown without memory the robots waited in green silks the color of forest pools in silks the color of frog and fern they waited in yellow hair the color of the sun and sand the robots waited oiled with tube bones cut from bronze and sunk in gelatin the robots lay in coffins for the not dead and not alive in planked boxes the metronomes waited to be set in motion there was a smell of lubrication and lathed brass there was a silence of the tomb yard sexed but sexless the robots named but unnamed and borrowing from humans everything but humanity the robots stared at the nailed lids of their labeled fob boxes in a death that was not even a death for there had never been a life and now there was a vast screaming of yanked nails now there was a lifting of lids now there were shadows on the boxes and the pressure of a hand squirting oil from a can now one clock was set in motion a faint ticking now another and another until this was an immense clock shop purring the marble eyes rolled wide their rubber lids the nostrils winked the robots clothed in hair of ape and white of rabbit arose tweedledum following tweedledee mockturtle dormouse drowned bodies from the sea compounded of salt and whiteweed swaying hanging bluethroated men with turnedup clamflesh eyes and creatures of ice and burning tinsel loamdwarfs and pepperelves tiktok ruggedo st nicholas with a selfmade snow flurry blowing on before him bluebeard with whiskers like acetylene flame and sulphur clouds from which green fire snouts protruded and in scaly and gigantic serpentine a dragon with a furnace in its belly reeled out the door with a scream a tick a bellow a silence a rush a wind ten thousand lids fell back the clock shop moved out into usher the night was enchanted a warm breeze came over the land the guest rockets burning the sky and turning the weather from autumn to spring arrived the men stepped out in evening clothes and the women stepped out after them their hair coiffed up in elaborate detail so thats usher but wheres the door at this moment stendahl appeared the women laughed and chattered mr stendahl raised a hand to quiet them turning he looked up to a high castle window and called rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair and from above a beautiful maiden leaned out upon the night wind and let down her golden hair and the hair twined and blew and became a ladder upon which the guests might ascend laughing into the house what eminent sociologists what clever psychologists what tremendously important politicians bacteriologists and neurologists there they stood within the dank walls welcome all of you mr tryon mr owen mr dunne mr lang mr steffens mr fletcher and a doubledozen more come in come in miss gibbs miss pope miss churchil miss blunt miss drummond and a score of other women glittering eminent eminent people one and all members of the society for the prevention of fantasy advocators of the banishment of halloween and guy fawkes killers of bats burners of books bearers of torches good clean citizens every one who had waited until the rough men had come up and buried the martians and cleansed the cities and built the towns and repaired the highways and made everything safe and then with everything well on its way to safety the spoilfuns the people with mercurochrome for blood and iodinecolored eyes came now to set up their moral climates and dole out goodness to everyone and they were his friends yes carefully carefully he had met and befriended each of them on earth in the last year welcome to the vasty halls of death he cried hello stendahl what is all this youll see everyone off with their clothes youll find booths to one side there change into costumes you find there men on this side women on that the people stood uneasily about i dont know if we should stay said miss pope i dont like the looks of this it verges onblasphemy nonsense a costume ball seems quite illegal mr steffens sniffed about come off it stendahl laughed enjoy yourselves tomorrow itll be a ruin get in the booths the house blazed with life and color harlequins rang by with belled caps and white mice danced miniature quadrilles to the music of dwarfs who tickled tiny fiddles with tiny bows and flags rippled from scorched beams while bats flew in clouds about gargoyle mouths which spouted down wine cool wild and foaming a creek wandered through the seven rooms of the masked ball guests sipped and found it to be sherry guests poured from the booths transformed from one age into another their faces covered with dominoes the very act of putting on a mask revoking all their licenses to pick a quarrel with fantasy and horror the women swept about in red gowns laughing the men danced them attendance and on the walls were shadows with no people to throw them and here or there were mirrors in which no image showed all of us vampires laughed mr fletcher dead there were seven rooms each a different color one blue one purple one green one orange another white the sixth violet and the seventh shrouded in black velvet and in the black room was an ebony clock which struck the hour loud and through these rooms the guests ran drunk at last among the robot fantasies amid the dormice and mad hatters the trolls and giants the black cats and white queens and under their dancing feet the floor gave off the massive pumping beat of a hidden and telltale heart mr stendahl a whisper mr stendahl a monster with the face of death stood at his elbow it was pikes i must see you alone what is it here pikes held out a skeleton hand in it were a few halfmelted charred wheels nuts cogs bolts stendahl looked at them for a long moment then he drew pikes into a corridor garrett he whispered pikes nodded he sent a robot in his place cleaning out the incinerator a moment ago i found these they both stared at the fateful cogs for a time this means the police will be here any minute said pikes our plan will be ruined i dont know stendahl glanced in at the whirling yellow and blue and orange people the music swept through the misting halls i should have guessed garrett wouldnt be fool enough to come in person but wait whats the matter nothing theres nothing the matter garrett sent a robot to us well we sent one back unless he checks closely he wont notice the switch of course next time hell come himself now that he thinks its safe why he might be at the door any minute in person more wine pikes the great bell rang there he is now ill bet you go let mr garrett in rapunzel let down her golden hair mr stendahl mr garrett the real mr garrett the same garrett eyed the dank walls and the whirling people i thought id better come see for myself you cant depend on robots other peoples robots especially i also took the precaution of summoning the dismantlers theyll be here in one hour to knock the props out from under this horrible place stendahl bowed thanks for telling me he waved his hand in the meantime you might as well enjoy this a little wine no thank you whats going on how low can a man sink see for yourself mr garrett murder said garrett murder most foul said stendahl a woman screamed miss pope ran up her face the color of a cheese the most horrid thing just happened i saw miss blunt strangled by an ape and stuffed up a chimney they looked and saw the long yellow hair trailing down from the flue garrett cried out horrid sobbed miss pope and then ceased crying she blinked and turned miss blunt yes said miss blunt standing there but i just saw you crammed up the flue no laughed miss blunt a robot of myself a clever facsimile but but dont cry darling im quite all right let me look at myself well so there i am up the chimney like you said isnt that funny miss blunt walked away laughing have a drink garrett i believe i will that unnerved me my god what a place this does deserve tearing down for a moment there garrett drank another scream mr steffens borne upon the shoulders of four white rabbits was carried down a flight of stairs which magically appeared in the floor into a pit went mr steffens where bound and tied he was left to face the advancing razor steel of a great pendulum which now whirled down down closer and closer to his outraged body is that me down there said mr steffens appearing at garretts elbow he bent over the pit how strange how odd to see yourself die the pendulum made a final stroke how realistic said mr steffens turning away another drink mr garrett yes please it wont be long the dismantlers will be here thank god and for a third time a scream what now said garrett apprehensively its my turn said miss drummond look and a second miss druxnmond shrieking was nailed into a coffin and thrust into the raw earth under the floor why i remember that gasped the investigator of moral climates from the old forbidden books the premature burial and the others the pit the pendulum and the ape the chimney the murders in the rue morgue in a book i burned yes another drink garrett here hold your glass steady my lord you have an imagination havent you they stood and watched five others die one in the mouth of a dragon the others thrown off into the black tarn sinking and vanishing would you like to see what we have planned for you asked stendahl certainly said garrett whats the difference well blow the whole damn thing up anyway youre nasty come along then this way and he led garrett down into the floor through numerous passages and down again upon spiral stairs into the earth into the catacombs what do you want to show me down here said garrett yourself killed a duplicate yes and also something else what the amontillado said stendahl going ahead with a blazing lantern which he held high skeletons froze half out of coffin lids garrett held his hand to his nose his face disgusted the what havent you ever heard of the amontillado no dont you recognize this stendahl pointed to a cell should i or this stendahl produced a trowel from under his cape smiling whats that thing come said stendahl they stepped into the cell in the dark stendahl affixed the chains to the halfdrunken man for gods sake what are you doing shouted garrett rattling about im being ironic dont interrupt a man in the midst of being ironic its not polite there youve locked me in chains so i have what are you going to do leave you here youre joking a very good joke wheres my duplicate dont we see him killed theres no duplicate but the others the others are dead the ones you saw killed were the real people the duplicates the robots stood by and watched garrett said nothing now youre supposed to say for the love of god montresor said stendahl and i will reply yes for the love of god wont you say it come on say it you fool must i coax you say it say for the love of god montresor i wont you idiot get me out of here he was sober now here put this on stendahl tossed in something that belled and rang what is it a cap and bells put it on and i might let you out stendahl put it on i said garrett obeyed the bells tinkled dont you have a feeling that this has all happened before inquired stendahl setting to work with trowel and mortar and brick now whatre you doing walling you in heres one row heres another youre insane i wont argue that point youll be prosecuted for this he tapped a brick and placed it on the wet mortar humming now there was a thrashing and pounding and a crying out from within the darkening place the bricks rose higher more thrashing please said stendahl lets make it a good show let me out let me out there was one last brick to shove into place the screaming was continuous garrett called stendahl softly garrett silenced himself garrett said stendahl do you know why ive done this to you because you burned mr poes books without really reading them you took other peoples advice that they needed burning otherwise youd have realized what i was going to do to you when we came down here a moment ago ignorance is fatal mr garrett garrett was silent i want this to be perfect said stendahl holding his lantern up so its light penetrated in upon the slumped figure jingle your bells softly the bells rustled now if youll please say for the love of god monstresor i might let you free the mans face came up in the light there was a hesitation then grotesquely the man said for the love of god montresor ah said stendahl eyes closed he shoved the last brick into place and mortared it tight requiescat in pace dear friend he hastened from the catacomb in the seven rooms the sound of a midnight clock brought everything to a halt the red death appeared stendahl turned for a moment at the door to watch and then he ran out of the great house across the moat to where a helicopter waited ready pikes ready there it goes they looked at the great house smiling it began to crack down the middle as with an earthquake and as stendahl watched the magnificent sight he heard pikes reading behind him in a low cadenced voice my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher the helicopter rose over the steaming lake and flew into the west august the old ones and what more natural than that at last the old people come to mars following in the trail left by the loud frontiersmen the aromatic sophisticates and the professional travelers and romantic lecturers in search of new grist and so the dry and crackling people the people who spent their time listening to their hearts and feeling their pulses and spooning syrups into their wry mouths these people who once had taken chair cars to california in november and thirdclass steamers to italy in april the driedapricot people the mummy people came at last to mars september the martian the blue mountains lifted into the rain and the rain fell down into the long canals and old lafarge and his wife came out of their house to watch first rain this season lafarge pointed out its good said his wife very welcome they shut the door inside they warmed their hands at a fire they shivered in the distance through the window they saw rain gleaming on the sides of the rocket which had brought them from earth theres only one thing said lafarge looking at his hands whats that asked his wife i wish we could have brought tom with us oh now lafe i wont start again im sorry we came here to enjoy our old age in peace not to think of tom hes been dead so long now we should try to forget him and everything on earth youre right he said and turned his hands again to the heat he gazed into the fire i wont speak of it any more its just i miss driving out to green lawn park every sunday to put flowers on his marker it used to be our only excursion the blue rain fell gently upon the house at nine oclock they went to bed and lay quietly hand in hand he fiftyfive she sixty in the raining darkness anna he called softly yes she replied did you hear something they both listened to the rain and the wind nothing she said someone whistling he said no i didnt hear it im going to get up to see anyhow he put on his robe and walked through the house to the front door hesitating he pulled the door wide and rain fell cold upon his face the wind blew in the dooryard stood a small figure lightning cracked the sky and a wash of white color illumined the face looking in at old lafarge there in the doorway whos there called lafarge trembling no answer who is it what do you want still not a word he felt very weak and tired and numb who are you he cried his wife entered behind him and took his arm why are you shouting a small boys standing in the yard and wont answer me said the old man trembling he looks like tom come to bed youre dreaming but hes there see for yourself he pulled the door wider to let her see the cold wind blew and the thin rain fell upon the soil and the figure stood looking at them with distant eyes the old woman held to the doorway go away she said waving one hand go away doesnt it look like tom asked the old man the figure did not move im afraid said the old woman lock the door and come to bed i wont have anything to do with it she vanished moaning to herself into the bedroom the old man stood with the wind raining coldness on his hands tom he called softly tom if thats you if by some chance it is you tom ill leave the door unlatched and if youre cold and want to come in to warm yourself just come in later and lie by the hearth theres some fur rugs there he shut but did not lock the door his wife felt him return to bed and shuddered its a terrible night i feel so old she said sobbing hush hush he gentled her and held her in his arms go to sleep after a long while she slept and then very quietly as he listened he heard the front door open the rain and wind come in the door shut he heard soft footsteps on the hearth and a gentle breathing tom he said to himself lightning struck in the sky and broke the blackness apart in the morning the sun was very hot mr lafarge opened the door into the living room and glanced all about quickly the hearthrugs were empty lafarge sighed im getting old he said he went out to walk to the canal to fetch a bucket of clear water to wash in at the front door he almost knocked young tom down carrying in a bucket already filled to the brim good morning father morning tom the old man fell aside the young boy barefooted hurried across the room set the bucket down and turned smiling its a fine day yes it is said the old man incredulously the boy acted as if nothing was unusual he began to wash his face with the water the old man moved forward tom how did you get here youre alive shouldnt i be the boy glanced up but tom green lawn park every sunday the flowers and lafarge had to sit down the boy came and stood before him and took his hand the old man felt of the fingers warm and firm youre really here its not a dream you do want me to be here dont you the boy seemed worried yes yes tom then why ask questions accept me but your mother the shock dont worry about her during the night i sang to both of you and youll accept me more because of it especially her i know what the shock is wait till she comes youll see he laughed shaking his head of coppery curled hair his eyes were very blue and clear good morning lafe tom mother came from the bedroom putting her hair up into a bun isnt it a fine day tom turned to laugh in his fathers face you see they ate a very good lunch all three of them in the shade behind the house mrs lafarge had found an old bottle of sunflower wine she had put away and they all had a drink of that mr lafarge had never seen his wifes face so bright if there was any doubt in her mind about tom she didnt voice it it was completely natural thing to her and it was also becoming natural to lafarge himself while mother cleared the dishes lafarge leaned toward his son and said confidentially how old are you now son dont you know father fourteen of course who are you really you cant be tom but you are someone who dont startled the boy put his hands to his face you can tell me said the old man ill understand youre a martian arent you ive heard tales of the martians nothing definite stories about how rare martians are and when they come among us they come as earth men theres something about youyoure tom and yet youre not why cant you accept me and stop talking cried the boy his hands completely shielded his face dont doubt please dont doubt me he turned and ran from the table tom come back but the boy ran off along the canal toward the distant town wheres tom going asked anna returning for more dishes she looked at her husbands face did you say something to bother him anna he said taking her hand anna do you remember anything about green lawn park a market and tom having pneumonia what are you talking about she laughed never mind he said quietly in the distance the dust drifted down after tom had run along the canal rim at five in the afternoon with the sunset tom returned he looked doubtfully at his father are you going to ask me anything he wanted to know no questions said lafarge the boy smiled his white smile swell whereve you been near the town i almost didnt come back i was almost the boy sought for a wordtrapped how do you mean trapped i passed a small tin house by the canal and i was almost made so i couldnt come back here ever again to see you i dont know how to explain it to you theres no way i cant tell you even i dont know its strange i dont want to talk about it we wont then better wash up boy suppertime the boy ran perhaps ten minutes later a boat floated down the serene surface of the canal a tall lank man with black hair poling it along with leisurely drives of his arms evening brother lafarge he said pausing at his task evening saul whats the word all kinds of words tonight you know that fellow named nomland who lives down the canal in the tin hut lafarge stiffened yes you know what sort of rascal he was rumor had it he left earth because he killed a man saul leaned on his wet pole gazing at lafarge remember the name of the man he killed gillings wasnt it right gillings well about two hours ago mr nomland came running to town crying about how he had seen gillings alive here on mars today this afternoon he tried to get the jail to lock him up safe the jail wouldnt so nomland went home and twenty minutes ago as i get the story blew his brains out with a gun i just came from there well well said lafarge the darnedest things happen said saul well good night lafarge good night the boat drifted on down the serene canal waters suppers hot called the old woman mr lafarge sat down to his supper and knife in hand looked over at tom tom he said what did you do this afternoon nothing said tom his mouth full why just wanted to know the old man tucked his napkin in at seven that night the old woman wanted to go to town havent been there in months she said but tom desisted im afraid of the town he said the people i dont want to go there such talk for a grown boy said anna i wont listen to it youll come along i say so anna if the boy doesnt want to started the old man but there was no arguing she hustled them into the canalboat and they floated up the canal under the evening stars tom lying on his back his eyes closed asleep or not there was no telling the old man looked at him steadily wondering who is this he thought in need of love as much as we who is he and what is he that out of loneliness he comes into the alien camp and assumes the voice and face of memory and stands among us accepted and happy at last from what mountain what cave what small last race of people remaining on this world when the rockets came from earth the old man shook his head there was no way to know this to all purposes was tom the old man looked at the town ahead and did not like it but then he returned to thoughts of tom and anna again and he thought to himself perhaps this is wrong to keep tom but a little while when nothing can come of it but trouble and sorrow but how are we to give up the very thing weve wanted no matter if it stays only a day and is gone making the emptiness emptier the dark nights darker the rainy nights wetter you might as well force the food from our mouths as take this one from us and he looked at the boy slumbering so peacefully at the bottom of the boat the boy whimpered with some dream the people he murmured in his sleep changing and changing the trap there there boy lafarge stroked the boys soft curls and tom ceased lafarge helped wife and son from the boat here we are anna smiled at all the lights listening to the music from the drinking houses the pianos the phonographs watching people arm in arm striding by in the crowded streets i wish i was home said tom you never talked that way before said the mother you always liked saturday nights in town stay close to me whispered tom i dont want to get trapped anna overheard stop talking that way come along lafarge noticed that the boy held his hand lafarge squeezed it ill stick with you tommyboy he looked at the throngs coming and going and it worried him also we wont stay long nonsense well spend the evening said anna they crossed a street and three drunken men careened into them there was much confusion a separation a wheeling about and then lafarge stood stunned tom was gone where is he asked anna irritably him always running off alone any chance he gets tom she called mr lafarge hurried through the crowd but tom was gone hell come back hell be at the boat when we leave said anna certainly steering her husband back toward the motionpicture theater there was a sudden commotion in the crowd and a man and woman rushed by lafarge he recognized them joe spaulding and his wife they were gone before he could speak to them looking back anxiously he purchased the tickets for the theater and allowed his wife to draw him into the unwelcome darkness tom was not at the landing at eleven oclock mrs lafarge turned very pale now mother said lafarge dont worry ill find him wait here hurry back her voice faded into the ripple of the water he walked through the night streets hands in pockets all about lights were going out one by one a few people were still leaning out their windows for the night was warm even though the sky still held storm clouds from time to time among the stars as he walked he recalled the boys constant references to being trapped his fear of crowds and cities there was no sense in it thought the old man tiredly perhaps the boy was gone forever perhaps he had never been lafarge turned in at a particular alley watching the numbers hello there lafarge a man sat in his doorway smoking a pipe hello mike you and your woman quarrel you out walking it off no just walking you look like you lost something speaking of lost things said mike somebody got found this evening you know joe spaulding you remember his daughter lavinia yes lafarge was cold it all seemed a repeated dream he knew which words would come next lavinia came home tonight said mike smoking you recall she was lost on the dead sea bottoms about a month ago they found what they thought was her body badly deteriorated and ever since the spaulding familys been no good joe went around saying she wasnt dead that wasnt really her body guess he was right tonight lavinia showed up where lafarge felt his breath come swiftly his heart pounding on main street the spauldings were buying tickets for a show and there all of a sudden in the crowd was lavinia must have been quite a scene she didnt know them first off they followed her half down a street and spoke to her then she remembered did you see her no but i heard her singing remember how she used to sing the bonnie banks of loch lomond i heard her trilling out for her father a while ago over there in their house it was good to hear her such a beautiful girl a shame i thought her dead and now with her back again its fine here now you look weak yourself better come in for a spot of whisky thanks no mike the old man moved away he heard mike say good night and did not answer but fixed his eyes upon the twostory building where rambling clusters of crimson martian flowers lay upon the high crystal roof around back above the garden was a twisted iron balcony and the windows above were lighted it was very late and still he thought to himself what will happen to anna if i dont bring tom home with me this second shock this second death what will it do to her will she remember the first death too and this dream and the sudden vanishing oh god ive got to find tom or what will come of anna poor anna waiting there at the landing he paused and lifted his head somewhere above voices bade other soft voices good night doors turned and shut lights dimmed and a gentle singing continued a moment later a girl no more than eighteen very lovely came out upon the balcony lafarge called up through the wind that was blowing the girl turned and looked down whos there she cried its me said the old man and realizing this reply to be silly and strange fell silent his lips working should he call out tom my son this is your father how to speak to her she would think him quite insane and summon her parents the girl bent forward in the blowing light i know you she replied softly please go theres nothing you can do youve got to come back it escaped lafarge before he could prevent it the moonlit figure above drew into shadow so there was no identity only a voice im not your son any more it said we should never have come to town annas waiting at the landing im sorry said the quiet voice but what can i do im happy here im loved even as you loved me i am what i am and i take what can be taken too late now theyve caught me but anna the shock to her think of that the thoughts are too strong in this house its like being imprisoned i cant change myself back you are tom you were tom werent you you arent joking with an old man youre not really lavinia spaulding im not anyone im just myself wherever i am i am something and now im something you cant help youre not safe in the town its better out on the canal where no one can hurt you pleaded the old man thats true the voice hesitated but i must consider these people now how would they feel if in the morning i was gone again this time for good anyway the mother knows what i am she guessed even as you did i think they all guessed but didnt question you dont question providence if you cant have the reality a dream is just as good perhaps im not their dead one back but im something almost better to them an ideal shaped by their minds i have a choice of hurting them or your wife theyre a family of five they can stand your loss better please said the voice im tired the old mans voice hardened youve got to come i cant let anna be hurt again youre our son youre my son and you belong to us no please the shadow trembled you dont belong to this house or these people no dont do this to me tom tom son listen to me come back slip down the vines boy come along annas waiting well give you a good home everything you want he stared and stared upward willing it to be the shadows drifted the vines rustled at last the quiet voice said all right father tom in the moonlight the quick figure of a boy slid down through the vines lafarge put up his arms to catch him the room lights above flashed on a voice issued from one of the grilled windows whos down there hurry boy more lights more voices stop i have a gun vinny are you all right a running of feet together the old man and the boy ran across the garden a shot sounded the bullet struck the wall as they slammed the gate tom you that way ill go here and lead them off run to the canal ill meet you there in ten minutes boy they parted the moon hid behind a cloud the old man ran in darkness anna im here the old woman helped him trembling into the boat wheres tom hell be here in a minute panted lafarge they turned to watch the alleys and the sleeping town late strollers were still out a policeman a night watchman a rocket pilot several lonely men coming home from some nocturnal rendezvous four men and women issuing from a bar laughing music played dimly somewhere why doesnt he come asked the old woman hell come hell come but lafarge was not certain suppose the boy had been caught again somehow someway in his travel down to the landing running through the midnight streets between the dark houses it was a long run even for a young boy but he should have reached here first and now far away along the moonlit avenue a figure ran lafarge cried out and then silenced himself for also far away was another sound of voices and running feet lights blazed on in window after window across the open plaza leading to the landing the one figure ran it was not tom it was only a running shape with a face like silver shining in the light of the globes dustered about the plaza and as it rushed nearer nearer it became more familiar until when it reached the landing it was tom anna flung up her hands lafarge hurried to cast off but already it was too late for out of the avenue and across the silent plaza now came one man another a woman two other men mr spaulding all running they stopped bewildered they stared about wanting to go back because this could be only a nightmare it was quite insane but they came on again hesitantly stopping starting it was too late the night the event was over lafarge twisted the mooring rope in his fingers he was very cold and lonely the people raised and put down their feet in the moonlight drifting with great speed wideeyed until the crowd all ten of them halted at the landing they peered wildly down into the boat they cried out dont move lafarge spaulding had a gun and now it was evident what had happened tom flashing through the moonlit streets alone passing people a policeman seeing the figure dart past the policeman pivoting staring at the face calling a name giving pursuit you stop seeing a criminal face all along the way the same thing men here women there night watchmen rocket pilots the swift figure meaning everything to them all identities all persons all names how many different names had been uttered in the last five minutes how many different faces shaped over toms face all wrong all down the way the pursued and the pursuing the dream and the dreamers the quarry and the hounds all down the way the sudden revealment the flash of familiar eyes the cry of an old old name the remembrances of other times the crowd multiplying everyone leaping forward as like an image reflected from ten thousand mirrors ten thousand eyes the running dream came and went a different face to those ahead those behind those yet to be met those unseen and here they all are now at the boat wanting the dream for their own just as we want him to be tom not lavinia or william or roger or any other thought lafarge but its all done now the thing has gone too far come up all of you spaulding ordered them tom stepped up from the boat spaulding seized his wrist youre coming home with me i know wait said the policeman hes my prisoner names dexter wanted for murder no a woman sobbed its my husband i guess i know my husband other voices objected the crowd moved in mrs lafarge shielded tom this is my son you have no right to accuse him of anything were going home right now as for tom he was trembling and shaking violently he looked very sick the crowd thickened about him putting out their wild hands seizing and demanding tom screamed before their eyes he changed he was tom and james and a man named switchman another named butterfield he was the town mayor and the young girl judith and the husband william and the wife clarisse he was melting wax shaping to their minds they shouted they pressed forward pleading he screamed threw out his hands his face dissolving to each demand tom cried lafarge alice another william they snatched his wrists whirled him about until with one last shriek of horror he fell he lay on the stones melted wax cooling his face all faces one eye blue the other golden hair that was brown red yellow black one eyebrow thick one thin one hand large one small they stood over him and put their fingers to their mouths they bent down hes dead someone said at last it began to rain the rain fell upon the people and they looked up at the sky slowly and then more quickly they turned and walked away and then started running scattering from the scene in a minute the place was desolate only mr and mrs lafarge remained looking down hand in hand terrified the rain fell upon the upturned unrecognizable face anna said nothing but began to cry come along home anna theres nothing we can do said the old man they climbed down into the boat and went back along the canal in the darkness they entered their house and lit a small fire and warmed their hands they went to bed and lay together cold and thin listening to the rain returned to the roof above them listen said lafarge at midnight did you hear something nothing nothing ill go look anyway he fumbled across the dark room and waited by the outer door for a long time before he opened it he pulled the door wide and looked out rain poured from the black sky upon the empty dooryard into the canal and among the blue mountains he waited five minutes and then softly his hands wet he shut and bolted the door november the luggage store it was a very remote thing when the luggagestore proprietor heard the news on the night radio received all the way from earth on a lightsound beam the proprietor felt how remote it was there was going to be a war on earth he went out to peer into the sky yes there it was earth in the evening heavens following the sun into the hills the words on the radio and that green star were one and the same i dont believe it said the proprietor its because youre not there said father peregrine who had stopped by to pass the time of evening what do you mean father its like when i was a boy said father peregrine we heard about wars in china but we never believed them it was too far away and there were too many people dying it was impossible even when we saw the motion pictures we didnt believe it well thats how it is now earth is china its so far away its unbelievable its not here you cant touch it you cant even see it all you see is a green light two billion people living on that light unbelievable war we dont hear the explosions we will said the proprietor i keep thinking about all those people that were going to come to mars this week what was it a hundred thousand or so coming up in the next month or so what about them if the war starts i imagine theyll turn back theyll be needed on earth well said the proprietor id better get my luggage dusted off i got a feeling therell be a rush sale here any time do you think everyone now on mars will go back to earth if this is the big war weve all been expecting for years its a funny thing father but yes i think well all go back i know we came up here to get away from thingspolitics the atom bomb war pressure groups prejudice lawsi know but its still home there you wait and see when the first bomb drops on america the people up herell start thinking they havent been here long enough a couple years is all if theyd been here forty years itd be different but they got relatives down there and their home towns me i cant believe in earth any more i cant imagine it much but im old i dont count i might stay on here i doubt it yes i guess youre right they stood on the porch watching the stars finally father peregrine pulled some money from his pocket and handed it to the proprietor come to think of it youd better give me a new valise my old ones in pretty bad condition november the off season sam parkhill motioned with the broom sweeping away the blue martian sand here we are he said yes sir look at that he pointed look at that sign sams hot dogs aint that beautiful elma sure sam said his wife boy what a change for me if the boys from the fourth expedition could see me now am i glad to be in business myself while all the rest of them guysre off soldiering around still well make thousands elma thousands his wife looked at him for a long time not speaking whatever happened to captain wilder she asked finally that captain that killed that guy who thought he was going to kill off every other earth man what was his name spender that nut he was too damn particular oh captain wilder hes off on a rocket to jupiter i hear they kicked him upstairs i think he was a little batty about mars too touchy you know hell be back down from jupiter and pluto in about twenty years if hes lucky thats what he gets for shooting off his mouth and while hes freezing to death look at me look at this place this was a crossroads where two dead highways came and went in darkness here sam parkhill had flung up this riveted aluminum structure garish with white light trembling with jukebox melody he stooped to fix a border of broken glass he had placed on the footpath he had broken the glass from some old martian buildings in the hills best hot dogs on two worlds first man on mars with a hotdog stand the best onions and chili and mustard you cant say im not alert heres the main highways over there is the dead city and the mineral deposits those trucks from earth settlement will have to pass here twentyfour hours a day do i know my locations or dont i his wife looked at her fingernails you think those ten thousand newtype work rockets will come through to mars she said at last in a month he said loudly why you look so funny i dont trust those earth people she said ill believe it when i see them ten thousand rockets arrive with the one hundred thousand mexicans and chinese on them customers he lingered on the word one hundred thousand hungry people if said his wife slowly watching the sky theres no atomic war i dont trust no atom bombs theres so many of them on earth now you never can tell ah said sam and went on sweeping from the corners of his eyes he caught a blue flicker something floated in the air gently behind him he heard his wife say sam a friend of yours to see you sam whirled to see the mask seemingly floating in the wind so youre back again and sam held his broom like a weapon the mask nodded it was cut from pale blue glass and was fitted above a thin neck under which were blowing loose robes of thin yellow silk from the silk two mesh silver bands appeared the mask mouth was a slot from which musical sounds issued now as the robes the mask the hands increased to a height decreased mr parkhill ive come back to speak to you again the voice said from behind the mask i thought i told you i dont want you near here cried sam go on ill give you the disease ive already had the disease said the voice i was one of the few survivors i was sick a long time go on and hide in the hills thats where you belong thats where youve been why you come on down and bother me now all of a sudden twice in one day we mean you no harm but i mean you harm said sam backing up i dont like strangers i dont like martians i never seen one before it aint natural all these years you guys hide and all of a sudden you pick on me leave me alone we come for an important reason said the blue mask if its about this land its mine i built this hotdog stand with my own hands in a way it is about the land look here said sam im from new york city where i come from theres ten million others just like me you martians are a couple dozen left got no cities you wander around in the hills no leaders no laws and now you come tell me about this land well the old got to give way to the new thats the law of give and take i got a gun here after you left this morning i got it out and loaded it we martians are telepathic said the cold blue mask we are in contact with one of your towns across the dead sea have you listened on your radio my radios busted then you dont know theres big news it concerns earth a silver hand gestured a bronze tube appeared in it let me show you this a gun cried sam parkhill an instant later he had yanked his own gun from his hip holster and fired into the mist the robe the blue mask the mask sustained itself a moment then like a small circus tent pulling up its stakes and dropping soft fold on fold the silks rustled the mask descended the silver claws tinkled on the stone path the mask lay on a small huddle of silent white bones and material sam stood gasping his wife swayed over the huddled pile thats no weapon she said bending down she picked up the bronze tube he was going to show you a message its all written out in snakescript all the blue snakes i cant read it can you no that martian picture writing it wasnt anything let it go sam glanced hastily around there may be others weve got to get him out of sight get the shovel whatre you going to do bury him of course you shouldnt have shot him it was a mistake quick silently she fetched him the shovel at eight oclock he was back sweeping the front of the hotdog stand selfconsciously his wife stood arms folded in the bright doorway im sorry what happened he said he looked at her then away you know it was purely the circumstances of fate yes said his wife i hated like hell to see him take out that weapon what weapon well i thought it was one im sorry im sorry how many times do i say it ssh said elma putting one finger to her lips ssh i dont care he said i got the whole earth settlements inc back of me he snorted these martians wont dare look said elma he looked out onto the dead sea bottom he dropped his broom he picked it up and his mouth was open a little free drop of saliva flew on the air and he was suddenly shivering elma elma elma he said here they come said elma across the ancient sea floor a dozen tall bluesailed martian sand ships floated like blue ghosts like blue smoke sand ships but there arent any more elma no more sand ships those seem to be sand ships she said but the authorities confiscated all of them they broke them up sold some at auction im the only one in this whole damn territorys got one and knows how to run one not any more she said nodding at the sea come on lets get out of here why she asked slowly fascinated with the martian vessels theyll kill me get in our truck quick elma didnt move he had to drag her around back of the stand where the two machines stood his truck which he had used steadily until a month ago and the old martian sand ship which he had bid for at auction smiling and which during the last three weeks he had used to carry supplies back and forth over the glassy sea floor he looked at his truck now and remembered the engine was out on the ground he had been puttering with it for two days the truck dont seem to be in running condition said elma the sand ship get in and let you drive me in a sand ship oh no get in i can do it he shoved her in jumped in behind her and flapped the tiller let the cobalt sail up to take the evening wind the stars were bright and the blue martian ships were skimming across the whispering sands at first his own ship would not move then he remembered the sand anchor and yanked it in there the wind hurled the sand ship keening over the dead sea bottom over longburied crystals past upended pillars past deserted docks of marble and brass past dead white chess cities past purple foothills into distance the figures of the martian ships receded and then began to pace sams ship guess i showed them by god cried sam ill report to the rocket corporation theyll give me protection im pretty quick they could have stopped you if they wanted elma said tiredly they just didnt bother he laughed come off it why should they let me get off no they werent quick enough is all werent they elma nodded behind him he did not turn he felt a cold wind blowing he was afraid to turn he felt something in the seat behind him something as frail as your breath on a cold morning something as blue as hickorywood smoke at twilight something like old white lace something like a snowfall something like the icy rime of winter on the brittle sedge there was a sound as of a thin plate of glass brokenlaughter then silence he turned the young woman sat at the tiller bench quietly her wrists were thin as icicles her eyes as clear as the moons and as large steady and white the wind blew at her and like an image on cold water she rippled silk standing out from her frail body in tatters of blue rain go back she said no sam was quivering the fine delicate fearquivering of a hornet suspended in the air undecided between fear and hate get off my ship this isnt your ship said the vision its old as our world it sailed the sand seas ten thousand years ago when the seas were whispered away and the docks were empty and you came and took it stole it now turn it around go back to the crossroad place we have need to talk with you something important has happened get off my ship said sam he took a gun from his holster with a creak of leather he pointed it carefully jump off before i count three or dont cried the girl i wont hurt you neither will the others we came in peace one said sam sam said elma listen to me said the girl two said sam firmly cocking the gun trigger sam cried elma three said sam we only said the girl the gun went off in the sunlight snow melts crystals evaporate into a steam into nothing in the firelight vapors dance and vanish in the core of a volcano fragile things burst and disappear the girl in the gunfire in the heat in the concussion folded like a soft scarf melted like a crystal figurine what was left of her ice snowflake smoke blew away in the wind the tiller seat was empty sam holstered his gun and did not look at his wife sam she said after a minute more of traveling whispering over the mooncolored sea of sand stop the ship he looked at her and his face was pale no you dont not after all this time youre not pulling out on me she looked at his hand on his gun i believe you would she said you actually would he jerked his head from side to side hand tight on the tiller bar elma this is crazy well be in town in a minute well be okay yes said his wife lying back cold in the ship elma listen to me theres nothing to hear sam elma they were passing a little white chess city and in his frustration in his rage he sent six bullets crashing among the crystal towers the city dissolved in a shower of ancient glass and splintered quartz it fell away like carved soap shattered it was no more he laughed and fired again and one last tower one last chess piece took fire ignited and in blue flinders went up to the stars ill show them ill show everybody go ahead show us sam she lay in the shadows here comes another city sam reloaded his gun watch me fix it the blue phantom ships loomed up behind them drawing steadily apace he did not see them at first he was only aware of a whistling and a high windy screaming as of steel on sand and it was the sound of the sharp razor prows of the sand ships preening the sea bottoms their red pennants blue pennants unfurled in the blue light ships were blue dark images masked men men with silvery faces men with blue stars for eyes men with carved golden ears men with tinfoil cheeks and rubystudded lips men with arms folded men following him martian men one two three sam counted the martian ships closed in elma elma i cant hold them all off elma did not speak or rise from where she had slumped sam fired his gun eight times one of the sand ships fell apart the sail the emerald body the bronze hull points the moonwhite tiller and all the separate images in it the masked men all of them dug into the sand and separated out into orange and then smokeflame but the other ships closed in im outnumbered elma he cried theyll kill me he threw out the anchor it was no use the sail fluttered down folding unto itself sighing the ship stopped the wind stopped travel stopped mars stood still as the majestic vessels of the martians drew around and hesitated over him earth man a voice called from a high seat somewhere a silverine mask moved rubyrimmed lips glittered with the words i didnt do anything sam looked at all the faces one hundred in all that surrounded him there werent many martians left on marsone hundred one hundred and fifty all told and most of them were here now on the dead seas in their resurrected ships by their dead chess cities one of which had just fallen like some fragile vase hit by a pebble the silverine masks glinted it was all a mistake he pleaded standing out of his ship his wife slumped behind him in the deeps of the hold like a dead woman i came to mars like any honest enterprising businessman i took some surplus material from a rocket that crashed and i built me the finest little stand you ever saw right there on that land by the crossroadsyou know where it is youve got to admit its a good job of building sam laughed staring around and that martiani know he was a friend of yourscame his death was an accident i assure you all i wanted to do was have a hotdog stand the only one on mars the first and most important one you understand how it is i was going to serve the best darned hot dogs there with chili and onions and orange juice the silver masks did not move they burned in the moonlight yellow eyes shone upon sam he felt his stomach clench in wither become a rock he threw his gun in the sand i give up pick up your gun said the martians in chorus what your gun a jeweled hand waved from the prow of a blue ship pick it up put it away unbelieving he picked up the gun now said the voice turn your ship and go back to your stand now now said the voice we will not harm you you ran away before we were able to explain come now the great ships turned as lightly as moon thistles their wingsails flapped with a sound of soft applause on the air the masks were coruscating turning firing the shadows elma sam tumbled into the ship get up elma were going back he was excited he almost gibbered with relief they arent going to hurt me kill me elma get up honey get up whatwhat elma blinked around and slowly as the ship was sent into the wind again she helped herself as in a dream back up to a seat and slumped there like a sack of stones saying no more the sand slid under the ship in half an hour they were back at the crossroads the ships planted all of them out of the ships the leader stood before sam and elma his mask beaten of polished bronze the eyes only empty slits of endless blueblack the mouth a slot out of which words drifted into the wind ready your stand said the voice a diamondgloved hand waved prepare the viands prepare the foods prepare the strange wines for tonight is indeed a great night you mean said sam youll let me stay on here yes youre not mad at me the mask was rigid and carved and cold and sightless prepare your place of food said the voice softly and take this what is it sam blinked at the silverfoil scroll that was handed him upon which in hieroglyph snake figures danced it is the land grant to all of the territory from the silver mountains to the blue hills from the dead salt sea there to the distant valleys of moonstone and emerald said the leader mmine said sam incredulous yours one hundred thousand miles of territory yours did you hear that elma elma was sitting on the ground leaning against the aluminum hotdog stand eyes shut but why whywhy are you giving me all this asked sam trying to look into the metal slots of the eyes that is not all here six other scrolls were produced the names were declared the territories announced why thats half of mars i own half of mars sam rattled the scrolls in his fists he shook them at elma insane with laughing elma did you hear i heard said elma looking at the sky she seemed to be watching for something she was becoming a little more alert now thank you oh thank you said sam to the bronze mask tonight is the night said the mask you must be ready i will be what it isa surprise are the rockets coming through earlier than we thought a month earlier from earth all ten thousand rockets bringing the settlers the miners the workers and their wives all hundred thousand of them wont that be swell elma you see i told you i told you that town there wont always have just one thousand people in it therell be fifty thousand more coming and the month after that a hundred thousand more and by the end of the year five million earth men and me with the only hotdog stand staked out on the busiest highway to the mines the mask floated on the wind we leave you prepare the land is yours in the blowing moonlight like metal petals of some ancient flower like blue plumes like cobalt butterflies immense and quiet the old ships turned and moved over the shifting sands the masks beaming and glittering until the last shine the last blue color was lost among the hills elma why did they do it why didnt they kill me dont they know anything whats wrong with them elma do you understand he shook her shoulder i own half of mars she watched the night sky waiting come on he said weve got to get the place fixed all the hot dogs boiling the buns warm the chili cooking the onions peeled and diced the relish laid out the napkins in the dips the place spotless hey he did a little wild dance kicking his heels oh boy im happy yes sir im happy he sang off key this is my lucky day he boiled the hot dogs cut the buns sliced the onions in a frenzy just think that martian said a surprise that can only mean one thing elma those hundred thousand people coming in ahead of schedule tonight of all nights well be flooded well work long hours for days what with tourists riding around seeing things elma think of the money he went out and looked at the sky he didnt see anything in a minute maybe he said snuffing the cool air gratefully arms up beating his chest ah elma said nothing she peeled potatoes for french fries quietly her eyes always on the sky sam she said half an hour later there it is look he looked and saw it earth it rose full and green like a finecut stone above the hills good old earth he whispered lovingly good old wonderful earth send me your hungry and your starved something somethinghow does that poem go send me your hungry old earth heres sam parkhill his hot dogs all boiled his chili cooking everything neat as a pin come on you earth send me your rocket he went out to look at his place there it sat perfect as a freshlaid egg on the dead sea bottom the only nucleus of light and warmth in hundreds of miles of lonely wasteland it was like a heart beating alone in a great dark body he felt almost sorrowful with pride gazing at it with wet eyes it sure makes you humble he said among the cooking odors of wieners warm buns rich butter step up he invited the various stars in the sky wholl be the first to buy sam said elma earth changed in the black sky it caught fire part of it seemed to come apart in a million pieces as if a gigantic jigsaw had exploded it burned with an unholy dripping glare for a minute three times normal size then dwindled what was that sam looked at the green fire in the sky earth said elma holding her hands together that cant be earth thats not earth no that aint earth it cant be you mean it couldnt be earth said elma looking at him that just isnt earth no thats not earth is that what you mean not earthoh no it couldnt be he wailed he stood there his hands at his sides his mouth open his eyes wide and dull not moving sam she called his name for the first time in days her eyes were bright sam he looked up at the sky well she said she glanced around for a minute or so in silence then briskly she flapped a wet towel over her arm switch on more lights turn up the music open the doors therell be another batch of customers along in about a million years gotta be ready yes sir sam did not move what a swell spot for a hotdog stand she said she reached over and picked a toothpick out of a jar and put it between her front teeth let you in on a little secret sam she whispered leaning toward him this looks like its going to be an off season november the watchers they all came out and looked at the sky that night they left their suppers or their washing up or their dressing for the show and they came out upon their nownotquiteasnew porches and watched the green star of earth there it was a move without conscious effort they all did it to help them understand the news they had heard on the radio a moment before there was earth and there the coming war and there hundreds of thousands of mothers or grandmothers or fathers or brothers or aunts or uncles or cousins they stood on the porches and tried to believe in the existence of earth much as they had once tried to believe in the existence of mars it was a problem reversed to all intents and purposes earth now was dead they had been away from it for three or four years space was an anesthetic seventy million miles of space numbed you put memory to sleep depopulated earth erased the past and allowed these people here to go on with their work but now tonight the dead were risen earth was reinhabited memory awoke a million names were spoken what was soandso doing tonight on earth what about this one and that one the people on the porches glanced sidewise at each others faces at nine oclock earth seemed to explode catch fire and burn the people on the porches put up their hands as if to beat the fire out they waited by midnight the fire was extinguished earth was still there there was a sigh like an autumn wind from the porches we havent heard from harry for a long time hes all right we should send a message to mother shes all right is she now dont worry will she be all right do you think of course of course now come to bed but nobody moved late dinners were carried out onto the night lawns and set upon collapsible tables and they picked at these slowly until two oclock and the lightradio message flashed from earth they could read the great morsecode flashes which flickered like a distant firefly australian continent atomized in premature explosion of atomic stockpile los angeles london bombed war come home come home come home they stood up from their tables come home come home come home have you heard from your brother ted this year you know with mail rates five bucks a letter to earth i dont write much come home ive been wondering about jane you remember jane my kid sister come home at three in the chilly morning the luggagestore proprietor glanced up a lot of people were coming down the street stayed open late on purpose whatll it be mister by dawn the luggage was gone from his shelves december the silent towns there was a little white silent town on the edge of the dead martian sea the town was empty no one moved in it lonely lights burned in the stores all day the shop doors were wide as if people had run off without using their keys magazines brought from earth on the silver rocket a month before fluttered untouched burning brown on wire racks fronting the silent drugstores the town was dead its beds were empty and cold the only sound was the power hum of electric lines and dynamos still alive all by themselves water ran in forgotten bathtubs poured out into living rooms onto porches and down through little garden plots to feed neglected flowers in the dark theaters gum under the many seats began to harden with tooth impressions still in it across town was a rocket port you could still smell the hard scorched smell where the last rocket blasted off when it went back to earth if you dropped a dime in the telescope and pointed it at earth perhaps you could see the big war happening there perhaps you could see new york explode maybe london could be seen covered with a new kind of fog perhaps then it might be understood why this small martian town is abandoned how quick was the evacuation walk in any store bang the no sale key cash drawers jump out all bright and jingly with coins that war on earth must be very bad along the empty avenues of this town now whistling softly kicking a tin can ahead of him in deepest concentration came a tall thin man his eyes glowed with a dark quiet look of loneliness he moved his bony hands in his pockets which were tinkling with new dimes occasionally he tossed a dime to the ground he laughed temperately doing this and walked on sprinkling bright dimes everywhere his name was walter gripp he had a placer mine and a remote shack far up in the blue martian hills and he walked to town once every two weeks to see if he could marry a quiet and intelligent woman over the years he had always returned to his shack alone and disappointed a week ago arriving in town he had found it this way that day he had been so surprised that he rushed to a delicatessen flung wide a case and ordered a tripledecker beef sandwich coming up he cried a towel on his arm he flourished meats and bread baked the day before dusted a table invited himself to sit and ate until he had to go find a soda fountain where he ordered a bicarbonate the druggist being one walter gripp was astoundingly polite and fizzed one right up for him he stuffed his jeans with money all he could find he loaded a boys wagon with tendollar bills and ran licketysplit through town reaching the suburbs he suddenly realized how shamefully silly he was he didnt need money he rode the tendollar bills back to where hed found them counted a dollar from his own wallet to pay for the sandwiches dropped it in the delicatessen till and added a quarter tip that night he enjoyed a hot turkish bath a succulent filet carpeted with delicate mushrooms imported dry sherry and strawberries in wine he fitted himself for a new blue flannel suit and a rich gray homburg which balanced oddly atop his gaunt head he slid money into a juke box which played that old gang of mine he dropped nickels in twenty boxes all over town the lonely streets and the night were full of the sad music of that old gang of mine as he walked tall and thin and alone his new shoes clumping softly his cold hands in his pockets but that was a week past he slept in a good house on mars avenue rose mornings at nine bathed and idled to town for ham and eggs no morning passed that he didnt freeze a ton of meats vegetables and lemon cream pies enough to last ten years until the rockets came back from earth if they ever came now tonight he drifted up and down seeing the wax women in every colorful shop window pink and beautiful for the first time he knew how dead the town was he drew a glass of beer and sobbed gently why he said im all alone he entered the elite theater to show himself a film to distract his mind from his isolation the theater was hollow empty like a tomb with phantoms crawling gray and black on the vast screen shivering he hurried from the haunted place having decided to return home he was striking down the middle of a side street almost running when he heard the phone he listened phone ringing in someones house he proceeded briskly someone should answer that phone he mused he sat on a curb to pick a rock from his shoe idly someone he screamed leaping me good lord whats wrong with me he shrieked he whirled which house that one he raced over the lawn up the steps into the house down a dark hall he yanked up the receiver hello he cried buzzzzzzzzz hello hello they had hung up hello he shouted and banged the phone you stupid idiot he cried to himself sitting on that curb you fool oh you damned and awful fool he squeezed the phone come on ring again come on he had never thought there might be others left on mars in the entire week he had seen no one he had figured that all other towns were as empty as this one now staring at this terrible little black phone he trembled interlocking dial systems connected every town on mars from which of thirty cities had the call come he didnt know he waited he wandered to the strange kitchen thawed some iced huckleberries ate them disconsolately there wasnt anyone on the other end of that call he murmured maybe a pole blew down somewhere and the phone rang by itself but hadnt he heard a click which meant someone had hung up far away he stood in the hall the rest of the night not because of the phone he told himself i just havent anything else to do he listened to his watch tick she wont phone back he said she wont ever call a number that didnt answer shes probably dialing other houses in town right now and here i sitwait a minute he laughed why do i keep saying she he blinked it could as easily be a he couldnt it his heart slowed he felt very cold and hollow he wanted very much for it to be a she he walked out of the house and stood in the center of the early dim morning street he listened not a sound no birds no cars only his heart beating beat and pause and beat again his face ached with strain the wind blew gently oh so gently flapping his coat sh he whispered listen he swayed in a slow cirde turning his head from one silent house to another shell phone more and more numbers he thought it must be a woman why only a woman would call and call a man wouldnt a mans independent did i phone anyone no never thought of it it must be a woman it has to be by god listen far away under the stars a phone rang he ran he stopped to listen the ringing soft he ran a few more steps louder he raced down an alley louder still he passed six houses six more much louder he chose a house and its door was locked the phone rang inside damn you he jerked the doorknob the phone screamed he heaved a porch chair through a parlor window leaped in after it before he even touched the phone it was silent he stalked through the house then and broke mirrors tore down drapes and kicked in the kitchen stove finally exhausted he picked up the thin directory which listed every phone on mars fifty thousand names he started with number one amelia ames he dialed her number in new chicago one hundred miles over the dead sea no answer number two lived in new new york five thousand miles across the blue mountains no answer he called three four five six seven eight his fingers jerking unable to grip the receiver a womans voice answered hello walter cried back at her hello oh lord hello this is a recording recited the womans voice miss helen arasumian is not home will you leave a message on the wire spool so she may call you when she returns hello this is a recording miss arasumian is not home will you leave a message he hung up he sat with his mouth twitching on second thought he redialed that number when miss helen arasumian comes home he said tell her to go to hell he phoned mars junction new boston arcadia and roosevelt city exchanges theorizing that they would be logical places for persons to dial from after that he contacted local city halls and other public institutions in each town he phoned the best hotels leave it to a woman to put herself up in luxury suddenly he stopped clapped his hands sharply together and laughed of course he checked the directory and dialed a longdistance call through to the biggest beauty parlor in new texas city if ever there was a place where a woman would putter around patting mud packs on her face and sitting under a drier it would be a velvetsoft diamondgem beauty parlor the phone rang someone at the other end lifted the receiver a womans voice said hello if this is a recording announced walter gripp ill come over and blow the place up this isnt a record said the womans voice hello oh hello there is someone alive where are you she gave a delighted scream walter almost collapsed you he stood up jerkily eyes wild good lord what luck whats your name genevieve selsor she wept into the receiver oh im so glad to hear from you whoever you are walter gripp walter hello walter hello genevieve walter its such a nice name walter walter thank you walter where are you her voice was so kind and sweet and fine he held the phone tight to his ear so she could whisper sweetly into it he felt his feet drift off the floor his cheeks burned im in marlin village he said i buzz hello he said buzz he jiggled the hook nothing somewhere a wind had blown down a pole as quickly as she had come genevieve selsor was gone he dialed but the line was dead i know where she is anyway he ran out of the house the sun was rising as he backed a bettlecar from the strangers garage filled its backseat with food from the house and set out at eighty miles an hour down the highway heading for new texas city a thousand miles he thought genevieve selsor sit tight youll hear from me he honked his horn on every turn out of town at sunset after an impossible day of driving he pulled to the roadside kicked off his tight shoes laid himself out in the seat and slid the gray homburg over his weary eyes his breathing became slow and regular the wind blew and the stars shone gently upon him in the new dusk the martian mountains lay all around millions of years old starlight glittered on the spires of a little martian town no bigger than a game of chess in the blue hills he lay in the halfplace between awakeness and dreams he whispered genevieve oh genevieve sweet genevieve he sang softly the years may come the years may go but genevieve sweet genevieve there was a warmth in him he heard her quiet sweet cool voice singing hello oh hello walter this is no record where are you walter where are you he sighed putting up a hand to touch her in the moonlight long dark hair shaking in the wind beautiful it was and her lips like red peppermints and her cheeks like freshcut wet roses and her body like a clear vaporous mist while her soft cool sweet voice crooned to him once more the words to the old sad song oh genevieve sweet genevieve the years may come the years may go he slept he reached new texas city at midnight he halted before the deluxe beauty salon yelling he expected her to rush out all perfume all laughter nothing happened shes asleep he walked to the door here i am he called hello genevieve the town lay in double moonlit silence somewhere a wind flapped a canvas awning he swung the glass door wide and stepped in hey he laughed uneasily dont hide i know youre here he searched every booth he found a tiny handkerchief on the floor it smelled so good he almost lost his balance genevieve he said he drove the car through the empty streets but saw nothing if this is a practical joke he slowed the car wait a minute we were cut off maybe she drove to marlin village while i was driving here she probably took the old sea road we missed each other during the day howd she know id come get her i didnt say i would and she was so afraid when the phone died that she rushed to marlin village to find me and here i am by god what a fool i am giving the horn a blow he shot out of town he drove all night he thought what if she isnt in marlin village waiting when i arrive he wouldnt think of that she must be there and he would run up and hold her and perhaps even kiss her once on the lips genevieve sweet genevieve he whistled stepping it up to one hundred miles an hour marlin village was quiet at dawn yellow lights were still burning in several stores and a juke box that had played steadily for one hundred hours finally with a crackle of electricity ceased making the silence complete the sun warmed the streets and warmed the cold and vacant sky walter turned down main street the car lights still on honking the horn a double toot six times at one corner six times at another he peered at the store names his face was white and tired and his hands slid on the sweaty steering wheel genevieve he called in the empty street the door to a beauty salon opened genevieve he stopped the car genevieve selsor stood in the open door of the salon as he ran across the street a box of cream chocolates lay open in her arms her fingers cuddling it were plump and pallid her face as he stepped into the light was round and thick and her eyes were like two immense eggs stuck into a white mess of bread dough her legs were as big around as the stumps of trees and she moved with an ungainly shuffle her hair was an indiscriminate shade of brown that had been made and remade it appeared as a nest for birds she had no lips at all and compensated this by stenciling on a large red greasy mouth that now popped open in delight now shut in sudden alarm she had plucked her brows to thin antenna lines walter stopped his smile dissolved he stood looking at her she dropped her candy box to the sidewalk are yougenevieve selsor his ears rang are you walter griff she asked gripp gripp she corrected herself how do you do he said with a restrained voice how do you do she shook his hand her fingers were sticky with chocolate well said walter gripp what asked genevieve selsor i just said well said walter oh it was nine oclock at night they had spent the day picnicking and for supper he had prepared a filet mignon which she didnt like because it was too rare so he broiled it some more and it was too much broiled or fried or something he laughed and said well see a movie she said okay and put her chocolaty fingers on his elbow but all she wanted to see was a fiftyyearold film of clark gable doesnt he just kill you she giggled doesnt he kill you now the film ended run it off again she commanded again he asked again she said and when he returned she snuggled up and put her paws all over him youre not quite what i expected but youre nice she admitted thanks he said swallowing oh that gable she said and pinched his leg ouch he said after the film they went shopping down the silent streets she broke a window and put on the brightest dress she could find dumping a perfume bottle on her hair she resembled a drowned sheep dog how old are you he inquired guess dripping she led him down the street oh thirty he said well she announced stiffly im only twentyseven so there heres another candy store she said honest ive led the life of reilly since everything exploded i never liked my folks they were fools they left for earth two months ago i was supposed to follow on the last rocket but i stayed on you know why why because everyone picked on me so i stayed where i could throw perfume on myself all day and drink ten thousand malts and eat candy without people saying oh thats full of calories so here i am here you are walter shut his eyes its getting late she said looking at him yes im tired she said funny im wide awake oh she said i feel like staying up all night he said say theres a good record at mikes come on ill play it for you im tired she glanced up at him with sly bright eyes im very alert he said strange come back to the beauty shop she said i want to show you something she took him in through the glass door and walked him over to a large white box when i drove from texas city she said i brought this with me she untied the pink ribbon i thought well here i am the only lady on mars and here is the only man and well she lifted the lid and folded back crisp layers of whispery pink tissue paper she gave it a pat there walter gripp stared what is it he asked beginning to tremble dont you know silly its all lace and all white and all fine and everything no i dont know what it is its a wedding dress silly is it his voice cracked he shut his eyes her voice was still soft and cool and sweet as it had been on the phone but when he opened his eyes and looked at her he backed up how nice he said isnt it genevieve he glanced at the door yes genevieve ive something to tell you yes she drifted toward him the perfume smell thick about her round white face the thing i have to say to you is he said yes goodby and he was out the door and into his car before she could scream she ran and stood on the curb as he swung the car about walter griff come back here she wailed flinging up her arms gripp he corrected her gripp she shouted the car whirled away down the silent street regardless of her stompings and shriekings the exhaust from it fluttered the white dress she crumpled in her plump hands and the stars shone bright and the car vanished out onto the desert and away into blackness he drove all night and all day for three nights and days once he thought he saw a car following and he broke into a shivering sweat and took another highway cutting off across the lonely martian world past little dead cities and he drove and drove for a week and a day until he had put ten thousand miles between himself and marlin village then he pulled into a small town named holtville springs where there were some tiny stores he could light up at night and restaurants to sit in ordering meals and hes lived there ever since with two deep freezes packed with food to last him one hundred years and enough cigars to last ten thousand days and a good bed with a soft mattress and when once in a while over the long years the phone ringshe doesnt answer april the long years whenever the wind came through the sky he and his small family would sit in the stone hut and warm their hands over a wood fire the wind would stir the canal waters and almost blow the stars out of the sky but mr hathaway would sit contented and talk to his wife and his wife would reply and he would speak to his two daughters and his son about the old days on earth and they would all answer neatly it was the twentieth year after the great war mars was a tomb planet whether or not earth was the same was a matter for much silent debate for hathaway and his family on the long martian nights this night one of the violent martian dust storms had come over the low martian graveyards blowing through ancient towns and tearing away the plastic walls of the newer americanbuilt city that was melting down into the sand desolated the storm abated hathaway went out into the cleared weather to see earth burning green on the windy sky he put his hand up as one might reach to adjust a dimly burning globe in the ceiling of a dark room he looked across the longdead sea bottoms not another living thing on this entire planet he thought just myself and them he looked back within the stone hut what was happening on earth now he had seen no visible sign of change in earths aspect through his thirtyinch telescope well he thought im good for another twenty years if im careful someone might come either across the dead seas or out of space in a rocket on a little thread of red flame he called into the hut im going to take a walk all right his wife said he moved quietly down through a series of ruins made in new york he read from a piece of metal as he passed and all these things from earth will be gone long before the old martian towns he looked toward the fiftycenturiesold village that lay among the blue mountains he came to a solitary martian graveyard a series of small hexagonal stones on a hill swept by the lonely wind he stood looking down at four graves with crude wooden crosses on them and names tears did not come to his eyes they had dried long ago do you forgive me for what ive done he asked of the crosses i was very much alone you do understand dont you he returned to the stone hut and once more just before going in shaded his eyes searching the black sky you keep waiting and waiting and looking he said and one night perhaps there was a tiny red flame on the sky he stepped away from the light of the hut and you look again he whispered the tiny red flame was still there it wasnt there last night he whispered he stumbled and fell picked himself up ran behind the hut swiveled the telescope and pointed it at the sky a minute later after a long wild staring he appeared in the low door of the hut the wife and the two daughters and the son turned their heads to him finally he was able to speak i have good news he said i have looked at the sky a rocket is coming to take us all home it will be here in the early morning he put his hands down and put his head into his hands and began to cry gently he burned what was left of new new york that morning at three he took a torch and moved into the plastic city and with the flame touched the walls here or there the city bloomed up in great tosses of heat and light it was a square mile of illumination big enough to be seen out in space it would beckon the rocket down to mr hathaway and his family his heart beating rapidly withpain he returned to the hut see he held up a dusty bottle into the light wine i saved just for tonight i knew that some day someone would find us well have a drink to celebrate he poured five glasses full its been a long time he said gravely looking into his drink remember the day the war broke twenty years and seven months ago and all the rockets were called home from mars and you and i and the children were out in the mountains doing archaeological work research on the ancient surgical methods of the martians we ran our horses almost killing them remember but we got here to the city a week late everyone was gone america had been destroyed every rocket had left without waiting for stragglers remember remember and it turned out we were the only ones left lord lord how the years pass i couldnt have stood it without you here all of you id have killed myself without you but with you it was worth waiting heres to us then he lifted his glass and to our long wait together he drank the wife and the two daughters and the son raised their glasses to their lips the wine ran down over the chins of all four of them by morning the city was blowing in great black soft flakes across the sea bottom the fire was exhausted but it had served its purpose the red spot on the sky grew larger from the stone hut came the rich brown smell of baked gingerbread his wife stood over the table setting down the hot pans of new bread as hathaway entered the two daughters were gently sweeping the bare stone floor with stiff brooms and the son was polishing the silverware well have a huge breakfast for them laughed hathaway put on your best clothes he hurried across his land to the vast metal storage shed inside was the coldstorage unit and power plant he had repaired and restored with his efficient small nervous fingers over the years just as he had repaired clocks telephones and spool recorders in his spare time the shed was full of things he had built some senseless mechanisms the functions of which were a mystery even to himself now as he looked upon them from the deep freeze he fetched rimed cartons of beans and strawberries twenty years old lazarus come forth he thought and pulled out a cool chicken the air was full of cooking odors when the rocket landed like a boy hathaway raced down the hill he stopped once because of a sudden sick pain in his chest he sat on a rock to regain his breath then ran all the rest of the way he stood in the hot atmosphere generated by the fiery rocket a port opened a man looked down hathaway shielded his eyes and at last said captain wilder who is it asked captain wilder and jumped down and stood there looking at the old man he put his hand out good lord its hathaway thats right they looked into each others faces hathaway from my old crew from the fourth expedition its been a long time captain too long its good to see you im old said hathaway simply im not young myself any more ive been out to jupiter and saturn and neptune for twenty years i heard they had kicked you upstairs so you wouldnt interfere with colonial policy here on mars the old man looked around youve been gone so long you dont know whats happened wilder said i can guess weve circled mars twice found only one other man name of walter gripp about ten thousand miles from here we offered to take him with us but he said no the last we saw of him he was sitting in the middle of the highway in a rocking chair smoking a pipe waving to us mars is pretty well dead not even a martian alive what about earth you know as much as i do once in a while i get the earth radio very faintly but its always in some other language im sorry to say i only know latin a few words come through i take it most of earths a shambles but the war goes on are you going back sir yes were curious of course we had no radio contact so far out in space well want to see earth no matter what youll take us with you the captain started of course your wife i remember her twentyfive years ago wasnt it when they opened first town and you quit the service and brought her up here and there were children my son and two daughters yes i remember theyre here up at our hut theres a fine breakfast waiting all of you up the hill will you come we would be honored mr hathaway captain wilder called to the rocket abandon ship they walked up the hill hathaway and captain wilder the twenty crew members following taking deep breaths of the thin cool morning air the sun rose and it was a good day do you remember spender captain ive never forgotten him about once a year i walk up past his tomb it looks like he got his way at last he didnt want us to come here and i suppose hes happy now that weve all gone away what aboutwhat was his nameparkhill sam parkhill he opened a hotdog stand it sounds just like him and went back to earth the next week for the war hathaway put his hand to his chest and sat down abruptly upon a boulder im sorry the excitement seeing you again after all these years have to rest he felt his heart pound he counted the beats it was very bad weve a doctor said wilder excuse me hathaway i know you are one but wed better check you with our own the doctor was summoned ill be all right insisted hathaway the waiting the excitement he could hardly breathe his lips were blue you know he said as the doctor placed a stethoscope to him its as if i kept alive all these years just for this day and now youre here to take me back to earth im satisfied and i can just lie down and quit here the doctor handed him a yellow pellet wed better let you rest nonsense just let me sit a moment its good to see all of you good to hear new voices again is the pellet working fine here we go they walked on up the hill alice come see whos here hathaway frowned and bent into the hut alice did you hear his wife appeared a moment later the two daughters tall and gracious came out followed by an even taller son alice you remember captain wilder she hesitated and looked at hathaway as if for instructions and then smiled of course captain wilder i remember we had dinner together the night before i took off for jupiter mrs hathaway she shook his hand vigorously my daughters marguerite and susan my son john you remember the captain surely hands were shaken amid laughter and much talk captain wilder sniffed the air is that gingerbread will you have some everyone moved folding tables were hurried out while hot foods were rushed forth and plates and fine damask napkins and good silverware were laid captain wilder stood looking first at mrs hathaway and then at her son and her two tall quietmoving daughters he looked into their faces as they darted past and he followed every move of their youthful hands and every expression of their wrinkleless faces he sat upon a chair the son brought how old are you john the son replied twentythree wilder shifted his silverware clumsily his face was suddenly pale the man next to him whispered captain wilder that cant be right the son moved away to bring more chairs whats that williamson im fortythree myself captain i was in school the same time as young john hathaway there twenty years ago he says hes only twentythree now he only looks twentythree but thats wrong he should be fortytwo at least whats it mean sir i dont know you look kind of sick sir i dont feel well the daughters too i saw them twenty years or so ago they havent changed not a wrinkle will you do me a favor i want you to run an errand williamson ill tell you where to go and what to check late in the breakfast slip away it should take you only ten minutes the place isnt far from here i saw it from the rocket as we landed here what are you talking about so seriously mrs hathaway ladled quick spoons of soup into their bowls smile now were all together the trips over and its like home yes captain wilder laughed you certainly look very well and young mrs hathaway isnt that like a man he watched her drift away drift with her pink face warm smooth as an apple unwrinkled and colorful she chimed her laugh at every joke she tossed salads neatly never once pausing for breath and the bony son and curved daughters were brilliantly witty like their father telling of the long years and their secret life while their father nodded proudly to each williamson slipped off down the hill wheres he going asked hathaway checking the rocket said wilder but as i was saying hathaway theres nothing on jupiter nothing at all for men that includes saturn and pluto wilder talked mechanically not hearing his words thinking only of williamson running down the hill and climbing back to tell what he had found thanks marguerite hathaway was filling his water glass impulsively he touched her arm she did not even mind her flesh was warm and soft hathaway across the table paused several times touched his chest with his fingers painfully then went on listening to the murmuring talk and sudden loud chattering glancing now and again with concern at wilder who did not seem to like chewing his gingerbread williamson returned he sat picking at his food until the captain whispered aside to him well i found it sir and williamsons cheeks were white he kept his eyes on the laughing people the daughters were smiling gravely and the son was telling a joke williamson said i went into the graveyard the four crosses were there the four crosses were there sir the names were still on them i wrote them down to be sure he read from a white paper alice marguerite susan and john hathaway died of unknown virus july thank you williamson wilder closed his eyes nineteen years ago sir williamsons hand trembled yes then who are these i dont know what are you going to do i dont know that either will we tell the other men later go on with your food as if nothing happened im not very hungry now sir the meal ended with wine brought from the rocket hathaway arose a toast to all of you its good to be with friends again and to my wife and children without whom i couldnt have survived alone it is only through their kindness in caring for me that ive lived on waiting for your arrival he moved his wineglass toward his family who looked back selfconsciously lowering their eyes at last as everyone drank hathaway drank down his winehe did not cry out as he fell forward onto the table and slipped to the ground several men eased him to rest the doctor bent to him and listened wilder touched the doctors shoulder the doctor looked up and shook his head wilder knelt and took the old mans hand wilder hathaways voice was barely audible i spoiled the breakfast nonsense say goodby to alice and the children for me just a moment ill call them no no dont gasped hathaway they wouldnt understand i wouldnt want them to understand dont wilder did not move hathaway was dead wilder waited for a long time then he arose and walked away from the stunned group around hathaway he went to alice hathaway looked into her face and said do you know what has just happened something about my husband hes just passed away his heart said wilder watching her im sorry she said how do you feel he asked he didnt want us to feel badly he told us it would happen one day and he didnt want us to cry he didnt teach us how you know he didnt want us to know he said it was the worst thing that could happen to a man to know how to be lonely and know how to be sad and then to cry so were not to know what crying is or being sad wilder glanced at her hands the soft warm hands and the fine manicured nails and the tapered wrists he saw her slender smooth white neck and her intelligent eyes finally he said mr hathaway did a fine job on you and your children he would have liked to hear you say that he was so proud of us after a while he even forgot that he had made us at the end he loved and took us as his real wife and children and in a way we are you gave him a good deal of comfort yes for years on end we sat and talked he so much loved to talk he liked the stone hut and the open fire we could have lived in a regular house in the town but he liked it up here where he could be primitive if he liked or modern if he liked he told me all about his laboratory and the things he did in it he wired the entire dead american town below with sound speakers when he pressed a button the town lit up and made noises as if ten thousand people lived in it there were airplane noises and car noises and the sounds of people talking he would sit and light a cigar and talk to us and the sounds of the town would come up to us and once in awhile the phone would ring and a recorded voice would ask mr hathaway scientific and surgical questions and he would answer them with the phone ringing and us here and the sounds of the town and his cigar mr hathaway was quite happy theres only one thing he couldnt make us do she said and that was to grow old he got older every day but we stayed the same i guess he didnt mind i guess he wanted us this way well bury him down in the yard where the other four crosses are i think he would like that she put her hand on his wrist lightly im sure he would orders were given the family followed the little procession down the hill two men carried hathaway on a covered stretcher they passed the stone hut and the storage shed where hathaway many years before had begun his work wilder paused within the workshop door how would it be he wondered to live on a planet with a wife and three children and have them die leaving you alone with the wind and silence what would a person do bury them with crosses in the graveyard and then come back up to the workshop and with all the power of mind and memory and accuracy of finger and genius put together bit by bit all those things that were wife son daughter with an entire american city below from which to draw needed supplies a brilliant man might do anything the sound of their footsteps was muffled in the sand at the graveyard as they turned in two men were already spading out the earth they returned to the rocket in the late afternoon williamson nodded at the stone hut what are we going to do about them i dont know said the captain are you going to turn them off off the captain looked faintly surprised it never entered my mind youre not taking them back with us no it would be useless you mean youre going to leave them here like that as they are the captain handed williamson a gun if you can do anything about this youre a better man than i five minutes later williamson returned from the hut sweating here take your gun i understand what you mean now i went in the hut with the gun one of the daughters smiled at me so did the others the wife offered me a cup of tea lord itd be murder wilder nodded therell never be anything as fine as them again theyre built to last ten fifty two hundred years yes theyve as much right toto life as you or i or any of us he knocked out his pipe well get aboard were taking off this citys done for well not be using it it was late in the day a cold wind was rising the men were aboard the captain hesitated williamson said dont tell me youre going back to saygoodby to them the captain looked at williamson coldly none of your business wilder strode up toward the hut through the darkening wind the men in the rocket saw his shadow lingering in the stonehut doorway they saw a womans shadow they saw the captain shake her hand moments later he came running back to the rocket on nights when the wind comes over the dead sea bottoms and through the hexagonal graveyard over four old crosses and one new one there is a light burning in the low stone hut and in that hut as the wind roars by and the dust whirls and the cold stars burn are four figures a woman two daughters a son tending a low fire for no reason and talking and laughing night after night for every year and every year for no reason at all the woman comes out and looks at the sky her hands up for a long moment looking at the green burning of earth not knowing why she looks and then she goes back and throws a stick on the fire and the wind comes up and the dead sea goes on being dead august there will come soft rains in the living room the voiceclock sang ticktock seven oclock time to get up time to get up seven oclock as if it were afraid that nobody would the morning house lay empty the clock ticked on repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness sevennine breakfast time sevennine in the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly browned toast eight eggs sunnyside up sixteen slices of bacon two coffees and two cool glasses of milk

oclock off to school off to work run run eightone but no doors slammed no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels it was raining outside the weather box on the front door sang quietly rain rain go away rubbers raincoats for today and the rain tapped on the empty house echoing outside the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car after a long wait the door swung down again at eightthirty the eggs were shriveled and the toast was like stone an aluminum wedge scraped them into the sink where hot water whirled them down a metal throat which digested and flushed them away to the distant sea the dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emerged twinkling dry ninefifteen sang the clock time to clean out of warrens in the wall tiny robot mice darted the rooms were acrawl with the small cleaning animals all rubber and metal they thudded against chairs whirling their mustached runners kneading the rug nap sucking gently at hidden dust then like mysterious invaders they popped into their burrows their pink electric eyes faded the house was clean ten oclock the sun came out from behind the rain the house stood alone in a city of rubble and ashes this was the one house left standing at night the ruined city gave off a radioactive glow which could be seen for miles tenfifteen the garden sprinklers whirled up in golden founts filling the soft morning air with scatterings of brightness the water pelted windowpanes running down the charred west side where the house had been burned evenly free of its white paint the entire west face of the house was black save for five places here the silhouette in paint of a man mowing a lawn here as in a photograph a woman bent to pick flowers still farther over their images burned on wood in one titanic instant a small boy hands flung into the air higher up the image of a thrown ball and opposite him a girl hands raised to catch a ball which never came down the five spots of paintthe man the woman the children the ballremained the rest was a thin charcoaled layer the gentle sprinkler rain filled the garden with falling light until this day how well the house had kept its peace how carefully it had inquired who goes there whats the password and getting no answer from lonely foxes and whining cats it had shut up its windows and drawn shades in an oldmaidenly preoccupation with selfprotection which bordered on a mechanical paranoia it quivered at each sound the house did if a sparrow brushed a window the shade snapped up the bird startled flew off no not even a bird must touch the house the house was an altar with ten thousand attendants big small servicing attending in choirs but the gods had gone away and the ritual of the religion continued senselessly uselessly twelve noon a dog whined shivering on the front porch the front door recognized the dog voice and opened the dog once huge and fleshy but now gone to bone and covered with sores moved in and through the house tracking mud behind it whirred angry mice angry at having to pick up mud angry at inconvenience for not a leaf fragment blew under the door but what the wall panels flipped open and the copper scrap rats flashed swiftly out the offending dust hair or paper seized in miniature steel jaws was raced back to the burrows there down tubes which fed into the cellar it was dropped into the sighing vent of an incinerator which sat like evil baal in a dark corner the dog ran upstairs hysterically yelping to each door at last realizing as the house realized that only silence was here it sniffed the air and scratched the kitchen door behind the door the stove was making pancakes which filled the house with a rich baked odor and the scent of maple syrup the dog frothed at the mouth lying at the door sniffing its eyes turned to fire it ran wildly in circles biting at its tail spun in a frenzy and died it lay in the parlor for an hour two oclock sang a voice delicately sensing decay at last the regiments of mice hummed out as softly as blown gray leaves in an electrical wind twofifteen the dog was gone in the cellar the incinerator glowed suddenly and a whirl of sparks leaped up the chimney two thirtyfive bridge tables sprouted from patio walls playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips martinis manifested on an oaken bench with eggsalad sandwiches music played but the tables were silent and the cards untouched at four oclock the tables folded like great butterflies back through the paneled walls fourthirty the nursery walls glowed animals took shape yellow giraffes blue lions pink antelopes lilac panthers cavorting in crystal substance the walls were glass they looked out upon color and fantasy hidden films clocked through welloiled sprockets and the walls lived the nursery floor was woven to resemble a crisp cereal meadow over this ran aluminum roaches and iron crickets and in the hot still air butterflies of delicate red tissue wavered among the sharp aroma of animal spoors there was the sound like a great matted yellow hive of bees within a dark bellows the lazy bumble of a purring lion and there was the patter of okapi feet and the murmur of a fresh jungle rain like other hoofs falling upon the summerstarched grass now the walls dissolved into distances of parched weed mile on mile and warm endless sky the animals drew away into thorn brakes and water holes it was the childrens hour five oclock the bath filled with clear hot water six seven eight oclock the dinner dishes manipulated like magic tricks and in the study a click in the metal stand opposite the hearth where a fire now blazed up warmly a cigar popped out half an inch of soft gray ash on it smoking waiting nine oclock the beds warmed their hidden circuits for nights were cool here ninefive a voice spoke from the study ceiling mrs mcclellan which poem would you like this evening the house was silent the voice said at last since you express no preference i shall select a poem at random quiet music rose to back the voice sara teasdale as i recall your favorite there will come soft rains and the smell of the ground and swallows circling with their shimmering sound and frogs in the pools singing at night and wild plum trees in tremulous white robins will wear their feathery fire whistling their whims on a low fencewire and not one will know of the war not one will care at last when it is done not one would mind neither bird nor tree if mankind perished utterly and spring herself when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone the fire burned on the stone hearth and the cigar fell away into a mound of quiet ash on its tray the empty chairs faced each other between the silent walls and the music played at ten oclock the house began to die the wind blew a falling tree bough crashed through the kitchen window cleaning solvent bottled shattered over the stove the room was ablaze in an instant fire screamed a voice the house lights flashed water pumps shot water from the ceilings but the solvent spread on the linoleum licking eating under the kitchen door while the voices took it up in chorus fire fire fire the house tried to save itself doors sprang tightly shut but the windows were broken by the heat and the wind blew and sucked upon the fire the house gave ground as the fire in ten billion angry sparks moved with flaming ease from room to room and then up the stairs while scurrying water rats squeaked from the walls pistoled their water and ran for more and the wall sprays let down showers of mechanical rain but too late somewhere sighing a pump shrugged to a stop the quenching rain ceased the reserve water supply which had filled baths and washed dishes for many quiet days was gone the fire crackled up the stairs it fed upon picassos and matisses in the upper halls like delicacies baking off the oily flesh tenderly crisping the canvases into black shavings now the fire lay in beds stood in windows changed the colors of drapes and then reinforcements from attic trapdoors blind robot faces peered down with faucet mouths gushing green chemical the fire backed off as even an elephant must at the sight of a dead snake now there were twenty snakes whipping over the floor killing the fire with a clear cold venom of green froth but the fire was clever it had sent flames outside the house up through the attic to the pumps there an explosion the attic brain which directed the pumps was shattered into bronze shrapnel on the beams the fire rushed back into every closet and felt of the clothes hung there the house shuddered oak bone on bone its bared skeleton cringing from the heat its wire its nerves revealed as if a surgeon had torn the skin off to let the red veins and capillaries quiver in the scalded air help help fire run run heat snapped mirrors like the brittle winter ice and the voices wailed fire fire run run like a tragic nursery rhyme a dozen voices high low like children dying in a forest alone alone and the voices fading as the wires popped their sheathings like hot chestnuts one two three four five voices died in the nursery the jungle burned blue lions roared purple giraffes bounded off the panthers ran in cirdes changing color and ten million animals running before the fire vanished off toward a distant steaming river ten more voices died in the last instant under the fire avalanche other choruses oblivious could be heard announcing the time playing music cutting the lawn by remotecontrol mower or setting an umbrella frantically out and in the slamming and opening front door a thousand things happening like a clock shop when each clock strikes the hour insanely before or after the other a scene of maniac confusion yet unity singing screaming a few last cleaning mice darting bravely out to carry the horrid ashes away and one voice with sublime disregard for the situation read poetry aloud in the fiery study until all the film spools burned until all the wires withered and the circuits cracked the fire burst the house and let it slam flat down puffing out skirts of spark and smoke in the kitchen an instant before the rain of fire and timber the stove could be seen making breakfasts at a psychopathic rate ten dozen eggs six loaves of toast twenty dozen bacon strips which eaten by fire started the stove working again hysterically hissing the crash the attic smashing into kitchen and parlor the parlor into cellar cellar into subcellar deep freeze armchair film tapes circuits beds and all like skeletons thrown in a cluttered mound deep under smoke and silence a great quantity of smoke dawn showed faintly in the east among the ruins one wall stood alone within the wall a last voice said over and over again and again even as the sun rose to shine upon the heaped rubble and steam today is august today is august today is october the millionyear picnic somehow the idea was brought up by mom that perhaps the whole family would enjoy a fishing trip but they werent moms words timothy knew that they were dads words and mom used them for him somehow dad shuffled his feet in a clutter of martian pebbles and agreed so immediately there was a tumult and a shouting and very quickly the camp was tucked into capsules and containers mom slipped into traveling jumpers and blouse dad stuffed his pipe full with trembling hands his eyes on the martian sky and the three boys piled yelling into the motorboat none of them really keeping an eye on mom and dad except timothy dad pushed a stud the water boat sent a humming sound up into the sky the water shook back and the boat nosed ahead and the family cried hurrah timothy sat in the back of the boat with dad his small fingers atop dads hairy ones watching the canal twist leaving the crumbled place behind where they had landed in their small family rocket all the way from earth he remembered the night before they left earth the hustling and hurrying the rocket that dad had found somewhere somehow and the talk of a vacation on mars a long way to go for a vacation but timothy said nothing because of his younger brothers they came to mars and now first thing or so they said they were going fishing dad had a funny look in his eyes as the boat went upcanal a look that timothy couldnt figure it was made of strong light and maybe a sort of relief it made the deep wrinkles laugh instead of worry or cry so there went the cooling rocket around a bend gone how far are we going robert splashed his hand it looked like a small crab jumping in the violet water dad exhaled a million years gee said robert look kids mother pointed one soft long arm theres a dead city they looked with fervent anticipation and the dead city lay dead for them alone drowsing in a hot silence of summer made on mars by a martian weatherman and dad looked as if he was pleased that it was dead it was a futile spread of pink rocks sleeping on a rise of sand a few tumbled pillars one lonely shrine and then the sweep of sand again nothing else for miles a white desert around the canal and a blue desert over it just then a bird flew up like a stone thrown across a blue pond hitting falling deep and vanishing dad got a frightened look when he saw it i thought it was a rocket timothy looked at the deep ocean sky trying to see earth and the war and the ruined cities and the men killing each other since the day he was born but he saw nothing the war was as removed and far off as two flies battling to the death in the arch of a great high and silent cathedral and just as senseless william thomas wiped his forehead and felt the touch of his sons hand on his arm like a young tarantula thrilled he beamed at his son how goes it timmy fine dad timothy hadnt quite figured out what was ticking inside the vast adult mechanism beside him the man with the immense hawk nose sunburnt peelingand the hot blue eyes like agate marbles you play with after school in summer back on earth and the long thick columnar legs in the loose riding breeches what are you looking at so hard dad i was looking for earthian logic common sense good government peace and responsibility all that up there no i didnt find it its not there any more maybe itll never be there again maybe we fooled ourselves that it was ever there huh see the fish said dad pointing there rose a soprano clamor from all three boys as they rocked the boat in arching their tender necks to see they oohed and ahed a silver ring fish floated by them undulating and closing like an iris instantly around food partides to assimilate them dad looked at it his voice was deep and quiet just like war war swims along sees food contracts a moment laterearth is gone william said mom sorry said dad they sat still and felt the canal water rush cool swift and glassy the only sound was the motor hum the glide of water the sun expanding the air when do we see the martians cried michael quite soon perhaps said father maybe tonight oh but the martians are a dead race now said mom no theyre not ill show you some martians all right dad said presently timothy scowled at that but said nothing everything was odd now vacations and fishing and looks between people the other boys were already engaged making shelves of their small hands and peering under them toward the sevenfoot stone banks of the canal watching for martians what do they look like demanded michael youll know them when you see them dad sort of laughed and timothy saw a pulse beating time in his cheek mother was slender and soft with a woven plait of spungold hair over her head in a tiara and eyes the color of the deep cool canal water where it ran in shadow almost purple with flecks of amber caught in it you could see her thoughts swimming around in her eyes like fishsome bright some dark some fast quick some slow and easy and sometimes like when she looked up where earth was being nothing but color and nothing else she sat in the boats prow one hand resting on the side lip the other on the lap of her dark blue breeches and a line of sunburnt soft neck showing where her blouse opened like a white flower she kept looking ahead to see what was there and not being able to see it clearly enough she looked backward toward her husband and through his eyes reflected then she saw what was ahead and since he added part of himself to this reflection a determined firmness her face relaxed and she accepted it and she turned back knowing suddenly what to look for timothy looked too but all he saw was a straight pencil line of canal going violet through a wide shallow valley penned by low eroded hills and on until it fell over the skys edge and this canal went on and on through cities that would have rattled like beetles in a dry skull if you shook them a hundred or two hundred cities dreaming hot summerday dreams and cool summernight dreams they had come millions of miles for this outingto fish but there had been a gun on the rocket this was a vacation but why all the food more than enough to last them years and years left hidden back there near the rocket vacation just behind the veil of the vacation was not a soft face of laughter but something hard and bony and perhaps terrifying timothy could not lift the veil and the two other boys were busy being ten and eight years old respectively no martians yet nuts robert put his vshaped chin on his hands and glared at the canal dad had brought an atomic radio along strapped to his wrist it functioned on an oldfashioned principle you held it against the bones near your ear and it vibrated singing or talking to you dad listened to it now his face looked like one of those fallen martian cities caved in sucked dry almost dead then he gave it to mom to listen her lips dropped open what timothy started to question but never finished what he wished to say for at that moment there were two titanic marrowjolting explosions that grew upon themselves followed by a half dozen minor concussions jerking his head up dad notched the boat speed higher immediately the boat leaped and jounced and spanked this shook robert out of his funk and elicited yelps of frightened but esctatic joy from michael who clung to moms legs and watched the water pour by his nose in a wet torrent dad swerved the boat cut speed and ducked the craft into a little branch canal and under an ancient crumbling stone wharf that smelled of crab flesh the boat rammed the wharf hard enough to throw them all forward but no one was hurt and dad was already twisted to see if the ripples on the canal were enough to map their route into hiding water lines went across lapped the stones and rippled back to meet each other settling to be dappled by the sun it all went away dad listened so did everybody dads breathing echoed like fists beating against the cold wet wharf stones in the shadow moms cat eyes just watched father for some clue to what next dad relaxed and blew out a breath laughing at himself the rocket of course im getting jumpy the rocket michael said what happened dad what happened oh we just blew up our rocket is all said timothy trying to sound matteroffact ive heard rockets blown up before ours just blew why did we blow up our rocket asked michael huh dad its part of the game silly said timothy a game michael and robert loved the word dad fixed it so it would blow up and no oned know where we landed or went in case they ever came looking see oh boy a secret scared by my own rocket admitted dad to mom i am nervous its silly to think therell ever be any more rockets except one perhaps if edwards and his wife get through with their ship he put his tiny radio to his ear again after two mintes he dropped his hand as you would drop a rag its over at last he said to mom the radio just went off the atomic beam every other world stations gone they dwindled down to a couple in the last few years now the airs completely silent itll probably remain silent for how long asked robert maybeyour greatgrandchildren will hear it again said dad he just sat there and the children were caught in the center of his awe and defeat and resignation and acceptance finally he put the boat out into the canal again and they continued in the direction in which they had originally started it was getting late already the sun was down the sky and a series of dead cities lay ahead of them dad talked very quietly and gently to his sons many times in the past he had been brisk distant removed from them but now he patted them on the head with just a word and they felt it mike pick a city what dad pick a city son any one of these cities we pass all right said michael how do i pick pick the one you like the most you too robert and tim pick the city you like best i want a city with martians in it said michael youll have that said dad i promise his lips were for the children but his eyes were for mom they passed six cities in twenty minutes dad didnt say anything more about the explosions he seemed much more interested in having fun with his sons keeping them happy than anything else michael liked the first city they passed but this was vetoed because everyone doubted quick first judgments the second city nobody liked it was an earth mans settlement built of wood and already rotting into sawdust timothy liked the third city because it was large the fourth and fifth were too small and the sixth brought acclaim from everyone induding mother who joined in the gees goshes and lookatthats there were fifty or sixty huge structures still standing streets were dusty but paved and you could see one or two old centrifugal fountains still pulsing wetly in the plazas that was the only lifewater leaping in the late sunlight this is the city said everybody steering the boat to a wharf dad jumped out here we are this is ours this is where we live from now on from now on michael was incredulous he stood up looking and then turned to blink back at where the rocket used to be what about the rocket what about minnesota here said dad he touched the small radio to michaels blond head listen michael listened nothing he said thats right nothing nothing at all any more no more minneapolis no more rockets no more earth michael considered the lethal revelation and began to sob little dry sobs wait a moment said dad the next instant im giving you a lot more in exchange mike what michael held off the tears curious but quite ready to continue in case dads further revelation was as disconcerting as the original im giving you this city mike its yours mine for you and robert and timothy all three of you to own for yourselves timothy bounded from the boat look guys all for us all of that he was playing the game with dad playing it large and playing it well later after it was all over and things had settled he could go off by himself and cry for ten minutes but now it was still a game still a family outing and the other kids must be kept playing mike jumped out with robert they helped mom be careful of your sister said dad and nobody knew what he meant until later they hurried into the great pinkstoned city whispering among themselves because dead cities have a way of making you want to whisper to watch the sun go down in about five days said dad quietly ill go back down to where our rocket was and collect the food hidden in the ruins there and bring it here and ill hunt for bert edwards and his wife and daughters there daughters asked timothy how many four i can see thatll cause trouble later mom nodded slowly girls michael made a face like an ancient martian stone image girls are they coming in a rocket too yes if they make it family rockets are made for travel to the moon not mars we were lucky we got through where did you get the rocket whispered timothy for the other boys were running ahead i saved it i saved it for twenty years tim i had it hidden away hoping id never have to use it i suppose i should have given it to the government for the war but i kept thinking about mars and a picnic right this is between you and me when i saw everything was finishing on earth after id waited until the last moment i packed us up bert edwards had a ship hidden too but we decided it would be safer to take off separately in case anyone tried to shoot us down whyd you blow up the rocket dad so we cant go back ever and so if any of those evil men ever come to mars they wont know were here is that why you look up all the time yes its silly they wont follow us ever they havent anything to follow with im being too careful is all michael came running back is this really our city dad the whole darn planet belongs to us kids the whole darn planet they stood there king of the hill top of the heap ruler of all they surveyed unimpeachable monarchs and presidents trying to understand what it meant to own a world and how big a world really was night came quickly in the thin atmosphere and dad left them in the square by the pulsing fountain went down to the boat and came walking back carrying a stack of paper in his big hands he laid the papers in a clutter in an old courtyard and set them afire to keep warm they crouched around the blaze and laughed and timothy saw the little letters leap like frightened animals when the flames touched and engulfed them the papers crinkled like an old mans skin and the cremation surrounded innumerable words government bonds business graph religious prejudice an essay the science of logistics problems of the panamerican unity stock report for july the war digest dad had insisted on bringing these papers for this purpose he sat there and fed them into the fire one by one with satisfaction and told his children what it all meant its time i told you a few things i dont suppose it was fair keeping so much from you i dont know if youll understand but i have to talk even if only part of it gets over to you he dropped a leaf in the fire im burning a way of life just like that way of life is being burned clean of earth right now forgive me if i talk like a politician i am after all a former state governor and i was honest and they hated me for it life on earth never settled down to doing anything very good science ran too far ahead of us too quickly and the people got lost in a mechanical wilderness like children making over pretty things gadgets helicopters rockets emphasizing the wrong items emphasizing machines instead of how to run the machines wars got bigger and bigger and finally killed earth thats what the silent radio means thats what we ran away from we were lucky there arent any more rockets left its time you knew this isnt a fishing trip at all i put off telling you earth is gone interplanetary travel wont be back for centuries maybe never but that way of life proved itself wrong and strangled itself with its own hands youre young ill tell you this again every day until it sinks in he paused to feed more papers to the fire now were alone we and a handful of others wholl land in a few days enough to start over enough to turn away from all that back on earth and strike out on a new line the fire leaped up to emphasize his talking and then all the papers were gone except one all the laws and beliefs of earth were burnt into small hot ashes which soon would be carried off inawind timothy looked at the last thing that dad tossed in the fire it was a map of the world and it wrinkled and distorted itself hotly and wentflimpfand was gone like a warm black butterfly timothy turned away now im going to show you the martians said dad come on all of you here alice he took her hand michael was crying loudly and dad picked him up and carried him and they walked down through the ruins toward the canal the canal where tomorrow or the next day their future wives would come up in a boat small laughing girls now with their father and mother the night came down around them and there were stars but timothy couldnt find earth it had already set that was something to think about a night bird called among the ruins as they walked dad said your mother and i will try to teach you perhaps well fail i hope not weve had a good lot to see and learn from we planned this trip years ago before you were born even if there hadnt been a war we would have come to mars i think to live and form our own standard of living it would have been another century before mars would have been really poisoned by the earth civilization now of course they reached the canal it was long and straight and cool and wet and reflective in the night ive always wanted to see a martian said michael where are they dad you promised there they are said dad and he shifted michael on his shoulder and pointed straight down the martians were there timothy began to shiver the martians were therein the canalreflected in the water timothy and michael and robert and mom and dad the martians stared back up at them for a long long silent time from the
