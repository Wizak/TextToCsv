inheritance arthur c clarke as david said when one falls on africa from a height of two hundred and fifty kilometers a broken ankle may be an anticlimax but it is none the less painful but what hurt him most he pretended was the way we had all rushed out into the desert to see what had happened to the a and hadnt come near him until hours later be logical david jimmy langford had protested we knew that you were ok because the base copter radioed when it picked you up but the a might have been a complete writeoff theres only one a i said trying to be helpful but rocket testpilots arewell if not two a penny at any rate twelve for a dime david glared back at us from beneath his bushy eyebrows and said something in welsh the druids curse jimmy remarked to me any moment now youll turn into a leek or a perspex model of stonehenge you see we were still pretty lightheaded and it wouldnt do to be serious for a while even davids iron nerve must have taken a terrific beating yet somehow he seemed the calmest of us all i couldnt understand itthen the a had come down fifty kilometers from her launching point wed followed her by radar for the whole trajectory so we knew her position to within a few metersthough we didnt know at the time that david had landed ten kilometers farther east the first warning of disaster had come seventy seconds after takeoff the a had reached fifty kilometers and was following the correct trajectory to within a few per cent as far as the eye could tell the luminous track on the radar screen had scarcely deviated from the precomputed path david was doing two kilometers a second not much but the fastest any man had ever traveled up to then and goliath was just about to be jettisoned the a was a twostep rocket it had to be for it was using chemical fuels the upper component with its tiny cabin its folded acrofoils and flaps weighed just under twenty tons when fully fuelled it was to be lifted by a lower twohundredton booster which would take it up to fifty kilometers after which it could carry on quite happily under its own power the big fellow would then drop back to earth by parachute it wouldnt weigh much when its fuel was burnt meanwhile the upper step would have built up enough speed to reach the sixhundredkilometer level before falling back and going into a glide that would take david halfway round the world if he wished i dont remember who called the two rockets david and goliath but the names caught on at once having two davids around caused a lot of confusion not all of it accidental well that was the theory but as we watched the tiny green spot on the screen fall away from its calculated course we knew that something had gone wrong and we guessed what it was at fifty kilometers the spot should have divided in two the brighter echo should have continued to rise as a free projectile and then fallen back to earth but the other should have gone on still accelerating drawing swiftly away from the discarded booster there had been no separation the empty goliath had refused to come free and was dragging david back to earthhelplessly for davids motors could not be used their exhausts were blocked by the machine beneath we saw all this in about ten seconds we waited just long enough to calculate the new trajectory and then we climbed into the copters and set off for the target area all we expected to find of course was a heap of magnesium looking as if a bulldozer had gone over it we knew that goliath couldnt eject its parachute while david was sitting on top of it any more than david could use its motors while goliath was clinging beneath i remember wondering who was going to break the news to mavis and then realizing that shed be listening to the radio and would know all about it as soon as anyone we could scarcely believe our eyes when we found the two rockets still coupled together lying undamaged beneath the big parachute there was no sign of david but a few minutes later base called to say that hed been found the plotters at number two station had picked up the tiny echo from his parachute and sent a copter to collect him he was in the hospital twenty minutes later but we stayed out in the desert for several hours checking over the machines and making arrangements to retrieve them when at last we got back to base we were pleased to see our besthated sciencereporters among the mob being held at bay we waved aside their protests and sailed on into the ward the shock and the subsequent relief had left us all feeling rather irresponsible and perhaps childish only david seemed unaffected the fact that hed just had one of the most miraculous escapes in human history hadnt made him turn a hair he sat there in the bed pretending to be annoyed at our jibes until wed calmed down well said jimmy at last what went wrong thats for you to discover david replied goliath went like a dream until fuelcutoff point i waited then for the fivesecond pause before the explosive bolts detonated and the springs threw it clear but nothing happened so i punched the emergency release the lights dimmed but the kick id expected never came i tried a couple more times but somehow i knew it was useless i guessed that something had shorted in the detonator circuit and was earthling the power supply well i did some rather rapid calculations from the flight charts and abacs in the cabin at my present speed id continue to rise for another two hundred kilometers and would reach the peak of my trajectory in about three minutes then id start the twohundred andfiftykilometer fall and should make a nice hole in the desert four minutes later all told i seemed to have a good seven minutes of life leftignoring airresistance to use your favorite phrase that might add a couple of minutes to my expectation of life i knew that i couldnt get the big parachute out and davids wings would be useless with the fortyton mass of goliath on its tail id used up two of my seven minutes before i decided what to do its a good job i made you widen that airlock even so it was a sq v spacesuit i tied the end of the safety rope to a locking lever and crawled along the hull until i reached the junction of the two steps the parachute compartment couldnt be opened from the outside but id taken the emergency axe from the pilots cabin it didnt take long to get through the magnesium skin once it had been punctured i could almost tear it apart with my hands a few seconds later id released the chute the silk floated aimlessly around me i had expected some trace of airresistance at this speed hut there wasnt a sign of it the canopy simply stayed where it was put i could only hope that when we reentered atmosphere it would spread itself without fouling the rocket i thought i had a fairly good chance of getting away with it the additional weight of david would increase the loading of the parachute by less than twenty per cent but there was always the chance that the shrouds would chafe against the broken metal and be worn through before i could reach earth in addition the canopy would be distorted when it did open owing to the unequal lengths of the cords there was nothing i could do about that when id finished looked about me for the first time i couldnt see very well for perspiration bad misted over the glass of my suit i was still rising though very slowly now to the northeast i could see the whole of sicily and some of the italian mainland farther south i could follow the libyan coast as far as bengasi spread out beneath me was all the land over which alexander and montgomery and rommel had fought when i was a boy it seemed rather surprising that anyone had ever made such a fuss about it i didnt stay long in three minutes i would be entering the atmosphere i took a last look at the flaccid parachute straightened some of the shrouds and climbed back into the cabin then i jettisoned davids fuelfirst the oxygen and then as soon as it had had time to disperse the alcohol that three minutes seemed an awfully long time i was just over twentyfive kilometers high when i heard the first sound it was a very highpitched whistle so faint that i could scarcely bear it glancing through the portholes i saw that the parachute shrouds were becoming taut and the canopy was beginning to billow above me at the same time i felt weight returning and knew that the rocket was beginning to decelerate the calculation wasnt very encouraging id fallen free for over two hundred kilometers and if i was to stop in time id need an average deceleration of ten gravities the peaks might be twice that but id stood fifteen g before now in a lesser cause so i gave myself a double shot of dynocaine and uncaged the gimbals of my seat i remember wondering whether i should let out davids little wings and decided that it wouldnt help then i must have blacked out when i came round again it was very hot and i had normal weight i felt very stiff and sore and to make matters worse the cabin was oscillating violently i struggled to the port and saw that the desert was uncomfortably close the big parachute had done its work but i thought that the impact was going to be rather too violent for comfort so i jumped from what you tell me id have done better to have stayed in the ship but i dont suppose i can grumble we sat in silence for a while then jimmy remarked casually the accelerometer shows that you touched twentyone gravities on the way down only for three seconds though most of the time it was between twelve and fifteen david didnt seem to hear and presently i said well we cant hold the reporters off much longer do you feel like seeing them david hesitated no he answered not now he read our faces and shook his head violently no he said with emphasis its not that at all id be willing to take off again right now but i want to sit and think things over for a while his voice sank and when he spoke again it was to show the real david behind the perpetual mask of extraversion you think i havent any nerves he said and that i take risks without bothering about the consequences well that isnt quite true and id like you to know why ive never told anyone this not even mavis you know im not superstitious he began a little apologetically but most materialists have some secret reservations even if they wont admit them many years ago i had a peculiarly vivid dream by itself it wouldnt have meant much but later i discovered that two other men had put almost identical experiences on record one youve probably read for the man was j w dunne in his first book an experiment with time dunne tells how once dreamed that he was sitting at the controls of a curious flying machine with sweptback wings and years later the whole experience came true when he was testing his inherentstability aeroplane remembering my own dream which id had before reading dunnes book this made a considerable impression on me but the second incident i found even more striking youve heard of igor sikorsky he designed some of the first commercial longdistance flyingboatsclippers they were called in his autobiography the story of the wingeds he tells us how he had a dream very similar to dunnes he was walking along a corridor with doors opening on either side and electric lights glowing overhead there was a slight vibration underfoot and somehow he knew that he was in a flying machine yet at that time there were no aeroplanes in the world and few people believed there ever would be sikorskys dream like dunnes came true many years later he was on the maiden flight of his first clipper when he found himself walking along that familiar corridor david laughed a little selfconsciously youve probably guessed what my dream was about he continued remember it would have made no permanent impression if i hadnt come across these parallel cases i was in a small bare room with no windows there were two other men with me and we were all wearing what i thought at the time were divingsuits i had a curious control panel in front of me with a circular screen built into it there was a picture on the screen but it didnt mean anything to me and i cant recall it now though ive tried many times since all i remember is turning to the other two men and saying five minutes to go boysthough im not sure if those were the exact words and then of course i woke up that dream has haunted me ever since i became a test pilot no haunted isnt the right word its given me confidence that in the long run everything would be all rightat least until im in that cabin with those other two men what happens after that i dont know but now you understand why i felt quite safe when i brought down the a and when i crashlanded the a off pantelleria so now you know you can laugh if you please i sometimes do myself but even if theres nothing in it that dreams given my subconscious a boost thats been pretty useful we didnt laugh and presently jimmy said those other mendid you recognize them david looked doubtful ive never made up my mind he answered remember they were wearing spacesuits and i didnt see their faces clearly but one of them looked rather like you though he seemed a good deal older than you are now im afraid you werent there arthur sorry im glad to hear it i said as ive told you before ill have to stay behind to explain what went wrong im quite content to wait until the passenger service starts jimmy rose to his feet ok david he said ill deal with the gang outside get some sleep nowwith or without dreams and by the way the a will be ready again in a week i think shell be the last of the chemical rockets they say the atomic drives nearly ready for us we never spoke of davids dream again but i think it was often in our minds three months later he took the a up to six hundred and eighty kilometers a record which will never be broken by a machine of this type because no one will ever build a chemical rocket again davids uneventful landing in the nile valley marked the end of an epoch it was three years before the a was ready she looked very small compared with her giant predecessors and it was hard to believe that she was the nearest thing to a spaceship man had yet built this time the takeoff was from sea level and the atlas mountains which had witnessed the start of our earlier shots were now merely the distant background to the scene by now both jimmy and i had come to share davids belief in his own destiny i remember jimmys parting words as the airlock closed it wont be long now david before we build that threeman ship and i knew he was only half joking we saw the a climb slowly into the sky in great widening circles unlike any rocket the world had ever known before there was no need to worry about gravitational loss now that we had a builtin fuel supply and david wasnt in a hurry the machine was still traveling quite slowly when i lost sight of it and went into the plotting room when i got there the signal was just fading from the screen and the detonation reached me a little later and that was the end of david and his dreams the next i recall of that period is flying down the conway valley in jimmys copter with snowdon gleaming far away on our right we had never been to davids home before and were not looking forward to this visit but it was the least that we could do as the mountains drifted beneath us we talked about the suddenly darkened future and wondered what the next step would be apart from the shock of personal loss we were beginning to realize how much of davids confidence we had come to share ourselves and now that confidence had been shattered we wondered what mavis would do and discussed the boys future he must be fifteen now though i hadnt seen him for several years and jimmy had never met him at all according to his father he was going to be an architect and already showed considerable promise mavis was quite calm and collected though she seemed much older than when i had last met her for a while we talked about business matters and the disposal of davids estate id never been an executor before but tried to pretend that i knew all about it we had just started to discuss the boy when we beard the front door open and he came into the house mavis called to him and his footsteps came slowly along the passage we could tell that he didnt want to meet us and his eyes were still red when he entered the room i had forgotten how much like his father he was and i heard a little gasp from jimmy hello david i said but he didnt look at me he was staring at jimmy with that puzzled expression of a man who has seen someone before but cant remember where and quite suddenly i knew that young david would never be art architect
