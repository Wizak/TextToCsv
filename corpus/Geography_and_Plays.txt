do it he did not ever think about it he just thought some time he might do something his father mr abram colhard spoke about it to every one and very many of them spoke to barnes colhard about it and he always listened to them then barnes fell in love with a very nice girl and she would not marry him he cried then his father mr abram colhard comforted him and they took a trip and barnes promised he would do what his father wanted him to be doing he did not do the thing he thought he would do another thing he did not do the other thing his father mr colhard did not want him to do the other thing he really did not do anything then when he was a good deal older he married a very rich girl he had thought perhaps he would not propose to her but his sister wrote to him that it would be a good thing he married the rich girl and she thought he was the most wonderful man and one who knew everything barnes never spent more than the income of the fortune he and his wife had then that is to say they did not spend more than the income and this was a surprise to very many who knew about him and about his marrying the girl who had such a large fortune he had a happy life while he was living and after he was dead his wife and children remembered him he had a sister who also was successful enough in being one being living his sister was one who came to be happier than most people come to be in living she came to be a completely happy one she was twice as old as her brother she had been a very good daughter to her mother she and her mother had always told very pretty stories to each other many old men loved to hear her tell these stories to her mother every one who ever knew her mother liked her mother many were sorry later that not every one liked the daughter many did like the daughter but not every one as every one had liked the mother the daughter was charming inside in her it did not show outside in her to every one it certainly did to some she did sometimes think her mother would be pleased with a story that did not please her mother when her mother later was sicker the daughter knew that there were some stories she could tell her that would not please her mother her mother died and really mostly altogether the mother and the daughter had told each other stories very happily together the daughter then kept house for her father and took care of her brother there were many relations who lived with them the daughter did not like them to live with them and she did not like them to die with them the daughter ada they had called her after her grandmother who had delightful ways of smelling flowers and eating dates and sugar did not like it at all then as she did not like so much dying and she did not like any of the living she was doing then every now and then some old gentlemen told delightful stories to her mostly then there were not nice stories told by any one then in her living she told her father mr abram colhard that she did not like it at all being one being living then he never said anything she was afraid then she was one needing charming stories and happy telling of them and not having that thing she was always trembling then every one who could live with them were dead and there were then the father and the son a young man then and the daughter coming to be that one then her grandfather had left some money to them each one of them ada said she was going to use it to go away from them the father said nothing then then he said something and she said nothing then then they both said nothing and then it was that she went away from them the father was quite tender then she was his daughter then he wrote her tender letters then she wrote him tender letters then she never went back to live with him he wanted her to come and she wrote him tender letters then he liked the tender letters she wrote to him he wanted her to live with him she answered him by writing tender letters to him and telling very nice stories indeed in them he wrote nothing and then he wrote again and there was some waiting and then he wrote tender letters again and again she came to be happier than anybody else who was living then it is easy to believe this thing she was telling some one who was loving every story that was charming some one who was living was almost always listening some one who was loving was almost always listening that one who was loving was almost always listening that one who was loving was telling about being one then listening that one being loving was then telling stories having a beginning and a middle and an ending

them helen furr and georgine skeene were regularly living where very many were living and cultivating in themselves something helen furr and georgine skeene were living very regularly then being very regular then in being gay then they did then learn many ways to be gay and they were then being gay being quite regular in being gay being gay and they were learning little things little things in ways of being gay they were very regular then they were learning very many little things in ways of being gay they were being gay and using these little things they were learning to have to be gay with regularly gay with then and they were gay the same amount they had been gay they were quite gay they were quite regular they were learning little things gay little things they were gay inside them the same amount they had been gay they were gay the same length of time they had been gay every day they were regular in being gay they learned little things that are things in being gay they learned many little things that are things in being gay they were gay every day they were regular they were gay they were gay the same length of time every day they were gay they were quite regularly gay georgine skeene went away to stay two months with her brother helen furr did not go then to stay with her father and her mother helen furr stayed there where they had been regularly living the two of them and she would then certainly not be lonesome she would go on being gay she did go on being gay she was not any more gay but she was gay longer every day than they had been being gay when they were together being gay she was gay then quite exactly the same way she learned a few more little ways of being in being gay she was quite gay and in the same way the same way she had been gay and she was gay a little longer in the day more of each day she was gay she was gay longer every day than when the two of them had been being gay she was gay quite in the way they had been gay quite in the same way she was not lonesome then she was not at all feeling any need of having georgine skeene she was not astonished at this thing she would have been a little astonished by this thing but she knew she was not astonished at anything and so she was not astonished at this thing not astonished at not feeling any need of having georgine skeene helen furr had quite a completely pleasant voice and it was quite well enough cultivated and she could use it and she did use it but then there was not any way of working at cultivating a completely pleasant voice when it has become a quite completely well enough cultivated one and there was not much use in using it when one was not wanting it to be helping to make one a gay one helen furr was not needing using her voice to be a gay one she was gay then and sometimes she used her voice and she was not using it very often it was quite completely enough cultivated and it was quite completely a pleasant one and she did not use it very often she was then she was quite exactly as gay as she had been she was gay a little longer in the day than she had been she was gay exactly the same way she was never tired of being gay that way she had learned very many little ways to use in being gay very many were telling about using other ways in being gay she was gay enough she was always gay exactly the same way she was always learning little things to use in being gay she was telling about using other ways in being gay she was telling about learning other ways in being gay she was learning other ways in being gay she would be using other ways in being gay she would always be gay in the same way when georgine skeene was there not so long each day as when georgine skeene was away she came to using many ways in being gay she came to use every way in being gay she went on living where many were cultivating something and she was gay she had used every way to be gay they did not live together then helen furr and georgine skeene helen furr lived there the longer where they had been living regularly together then neither of them were living there any longer helen furr was living somewhere else then and telling some about being gay and she was gay then and she was living quite regularly then she was regularly gay then she was quite regular in being gay then she remembered all the little ways of being gay she used all the little ways of being gay she was quite regularly gay she told many then the way of being gay she taught very many then little ways they could use in being gay she was living very well she was gay then she went on living then she was regular in being gay she always was living very well and was gay very well and was telling about little ways one could be learning to use in being gay and later was telling them quite often telling them again and again a collection my dear miss carey a story there were little places to see fernville the town the hospital the lying in hospital the seashore and the city once we met my brother he was ringing a bell he needed an umbrella but he would not buy it i sent him one not prepaid oh yes the people are kind they all drink together even now no not now we are late did you see the pear tree it resembles the figs they are often ripe they grow in great abundance we like milk my father likes milk and coffee whenever there are flowers my mother is angry she is even angry with me that is to say she is generous enough and wishes everything back we are all that way my brother takes coal away in a little bag for use all dark days are necessary no permission is asked and it is given for all day for all day whenever it is needed not whenever it is needed we do as we say it is best to do even religious people do so come together in fernville not i i thank you my brother finds handkerchiefs there for men for men and for women so does his wife many not very many she brings them with her is that so many handkerchiefs are not necessary in fernville no indeed we dismiss the church we separate it we have it today a great many people call on one another not altogether that the postoffice the postoffice of my brother now not now yes he is there now since the war yes since the war i remember when i was a b of c i did not speak to old men then not when i was busy i waited until i was tired and then we all sat down and had a cup of coffee coffee is very nourishing i am very sensitive to the influence of coffee so are we all do you think that we are married that we are all married mr weeks is married he is going to be able to follow my advice i advise him to go to my country there he will do very well the only advice i have to give him is never to live in the city his wife does not like the city nor does she like a sunny climate she is not able to go about with him we are all of us leaving the end of the month do not be angry i was very much surprised that water was the same color as what as the sun i feel that i must go at once did you entirely forget about the other drowning in water this is a question that i have never asked about because in the summer one does not think about it now it is winter but it is as warm as in summer dear friends have a way of relating themselves to a town we find in some districts that there are better ways of investing money some find that at the end of the war they are not able to continue paying on their houses does this affect you oh no because even if the father of my child is killed his sister will continue to give the money she is obliged to by law this makes the whole matter very simple not to me i have always been accustomed to it and have had some difficulty yes we know we know that it is suddenly cold you are not pleased to see the sun setting indeed i cannot blame you polybe in port a curtain raiser polybe in port a hunter he was not a hunter he had a gun i do not know whether they have permission to shoot of course he must have if he has a gun in this country they have a great many dogs who hunt rabbits they run quicker we are surprised to see him polybe is an ornament he is not thinner he likes the water now this i do not believe neither do i believe there was any intention to go that way which way do you mean polybe does not remember me yes the house yes the servant yes you are not mistaken we are not mistaken a great many shrubs every one of which are labelled scene ii a credit to me the cares and duties of a mother had been denied to carrie russell polybe silent he said earnestly that it didnt matter spanish chattings do you keep books all weddings are back pigeons pigeons recognise persons do they we saw them they flew around shooting pigeons is necessary for what for the sea i see old peppers that are dried we do not complain we say winds are violent and i do not wish them wish for them i do not wish to see the stars call it out of here you mean that pole no indeed i dont mean inca oh yes certainly they came together i can tell a little story i cannot describe the character nor the color in the street nor the kind of a stone a great many people have silver purses wild flowers we collected wild flowers we enjoyed it very much in a window we saw exhibited the things that can be found in the country there was a satisfaction that we had the temporary installation which made it possible for us to ask another servant not to visit our servant we did not do so we were not neglectful of our best interests will they crush germany they will crush germany there is no doubt about it france likely and more than evenly unevenly and not unlikely very much that and anyway more this is the left over method there is nothing left because if it were left it would be left over this does not make music the time to state that is in reading there is a beginning in a lesson in smiling what is up is not down and what is down is not reversing and what is refused is not a section and what is silenced is not speaking this does not make the rude ones murmur this does not make a penny smaller this does not make religion all the time there is a melodrama there is monopoly and all the time there is more there is no excuse a luck in breaths is more to be denied than music much more the only long string is that which is not twisted all the same there is no excuse a sight is not a shadow and a whole rise in a cry is not more piercing than danger of being mixed into an affair where there are witnesses if writing is in little pieces and little places and a little door is open many little doors are not open and writing is not surreptitious it is not even obliging to show the difference between an occasion and merit and a button it is necessary to recognise that an honor is not forced so that there is no question of taste to exchange a single statue for a coat of silk and a coat of wool is not necessary as there are appliances a somber day is one when there is no pleading made in haste not made in haste made in darkness not made in darkness made in a place made in a place the whole stretched out is not part of the whole block the whole stretched out is so arranged that there is not stumbling but what is just as remarkable pushing an easy expression of being willing of being hunting of being so stupid that there is no question of not selling all these things cause more discussion than a resolution and this is so astonishing when there is nothing to do and an excellent reason for an exchange and yet the practice of it makes such an example that any day is a season to be sure that the trees have winter and the plants have summer and the houses painting to be sure of this engages some attention the time to place this in the way is not what is expected from a diner the whole thing that shows the result is the little way that the balls and the pieces that are with them which are not birds as they are older do not measure the distance between a cover and a calendar this which is not a question is not reverse and the question which is a question is at noon to question a special date is not mercenary to answer a single servant is not obligatory to be afraid is not nearsighted an exclamation does not connect more grass than there is with any more trees than have branches the special scenery which makes the blameless see and the solitary resemble a conversation is not that which resembles that memory there is no necessity for furthering the regulation of the understanding one special absence does not make any place empty the dampness which is not covered by a cloth is not mingled with color and it comes there is no astonishment nor width education education apprenticeship and all the meeting of nephews and trains and changing papers and remaining when there is no chance to go there all this occupied a whole sentence it is a shame that there is not such an only use for that it is a shame and there is no indignation more indignant everything is an indication of the simple remedy that is applied when there is no refusal and no application every thing which shows that is not tied with a string or any little string all the same there is not much of a remedy alarm over the action of the one who when he sees the light rise and the sun set and the stars shine and the water flow alarm is the same alarm as any alarm in all the same ways that pieces are separated in all these ways there are those placed things which are not pieces they are not pieces and there is reason there is reason in it because the whole thing shows such dissociation that all doing it for that purpose and together there can be no question but that they succeed a tobacco habit is one that a leaf does not enlighten and yet carelessness is so extraordinary supposing that the arrangement had been made and that it was agreed that no separation between any one being one and being another one could be established supposing this were agreed and there was no conversation would this enlighten any one if it would why is the result so ambiguous it is not ambiguous because the authority which does not authorise washing does supply soap this does not make any change it is sensible to be around it is very sensible it is so sensible that there is every way of stopping a selection and then there is selection there is a respect for resignation there is no disturbance in a disappointment the question is is there more urging than satisfaction is there more distribution than renewal this is not a question it is a relaxing and then the time comes for more noise is there then more noise there is then reestablishment does that mean return of a price which is plentiful nobody knows all this shows something it shows that there can be suspicion there is no separation in majesty terms lines sections extra packing nothing shows that confidence all the same there is news the time to stay away is in vacation why is there no place chosen the answer is simple it consists in explaining that there has been given the use of all that will be used this does not show feeling a curtain is not crazy it has no way of being crazy it has hardly a way of enraging a resemblance it has no resurrection indeed the chances are that when there is seen more astonishment than anything that is placed it is very likely that the whole system will be not so much estranged as devastated and yet supposing they do not mean that supposing they do say that it will be a success supposing they do say does that mean that oration is contradiction it does not just a word to show a kite that clouds are higher than a thing that is smaller just that word and no single silence is closer suggest that the passage is filled with feathers suggest that there are all together suggest that using boxes is heavy suggest that there is no feather suggest all these things and what is result the result is that everything gets put away all the silence is adequate to a rumble and all the silliness is adequate to a procession and all the recitation is equal to the hammer and all the paving is equal to summer all the same the detaining most is the reason that there is a pillar and mostly what is shocking is a rooster this is not so easily said there is no occasion for a red result laugh to laugh all the same the tittle is inclinable what a change from any yesterday a period of singular results and no gloom such a period shows such a rapid approach that there is no search in silence and yet not a sound not any sound is searching no sound is an occasion a fine fan and a fine closet and a very fine handkerchief and quite a fine article all these together shows where there has been plenty of rebuke and plenty of expectation and plenty plentifully reduction of suspension and so the season is the same and there is every corner no chance shows the rapidity of exchange no chance and this which means one is the same as any two halves and this is not outrageous not a bit outrageous it is simply the sign of splendor all the tempting and the chewing and the cloth all of it shows no sign and no symbol it does not and that is no disgrace if standing is an illusion is it necessary to be pressed to bend in that direction is it necessary and if it is necessary is it polite and if it is polite is it urgent and if it is not urgent is it an impulse no question has so much disturbance as the principal reunion this is not so distinguished when there are no ties in the window this is completely changed once there were none and now there are none there are no rebukes a privilege is not painful a recurrence is not artificial it is not separating that which satisfies no finger it is not fading what was it that was not wished the reason is that the section is there and no reflection makes abundance the only tangle is when there is abundance and there is abundance when there is pulling and piling does this seem to scream it does not there is not even clustering and yet not hampering not singling everything does not make sorrow it makes no plant grander it does make a plant slender it does not make it so slender that there is every size all privilege and all practice all suspicion and grandeur all the timber and a little wood all this makes silver paper is chosen and gold is cheap does this make a little salt it does not it makes copper little frame if it is cheaper than a big one is a different size there is no use disputing as memory is a reminder not to pay for a conversation not to pay anything for any conversation not to throw away paying not to pass paying not to pay anything this is not being a victim what is victory victory is that which eschewing liberation and a girdle and gratitude and resignation and a choice display and more flavor shows a strange reluctance to have a maritime connection this is victory a license what is a license what is a license an angry coat a very angry coat shines butter is not frozen this does not mean that there is no bravery and no mistake this does show a conclusion difference is no excuse grain is no excuse even the remains of a pear is an excuse and yet is there graciousness there is if there is generosity there is so much fruit this is kindly a mistake no misunderstanding is insurmountable cage no lion not to cage a lion is not dirty it is not even merciless it is not malodorous it is not virtue to surround a giraffe what does that mean to surround a mixture that means something solid what is solid is more solid than everything it is not doubtful because there is no necessity haughtiness there is haughtiness when there is no tape and no billiard rooms and no need to be secured from wet there is certainly some selected obstacles the certainty of a change in the parts that speak this uncertainty does not show as it does not fashion speech all union is in the widow and all menace is in the band any way to bend the hat is the way to encourage vice virtue all virtue is resolved and some and any hat every hat is identical a shadow a white shadow is a mountain kindness what is kindness kindness is the necessity of preserving of really preserving all the parts of speech and teaching not music so much as trimming and a costume and sincerely most sincerely shoving regions together notice a room in noticing a room what is there to notice the first thing to notice is the room and the windows and the door and the table and the place where there are divisions and the center of the room and the rest of the people all this is necessary and then there is finance heavy where heaviness is and no mistake plentifully heavy where the breeze is and no darkness plentifully heavy where there is a voice and a noise and singling out a company heavy where there is a sale of accents and raisins and possibly more ways of not being heavy certainly there is no peril and yet think think often is daintiness and a collar heavy is it and what is the disturbance is there not more registration so there is not coming anything there certainly is no single space useful and betrothed and vulgar and not pretty there is a sign in placing nothing this changes from day to day any day surely no change is a blessing all the search is in violation and yet a single search is a single search willing it is cautious there is riot the likelihood of dipping and drawing and digesting and drinking and dirtying not dirtying smoking the likelihood of all this makes such an order that every discussion is simultaneous a large increase in beer any large increase is here some large increase is clear no large increase is dear a lily a very lily lily is accurate and described and surrounded and so venturesome that there is risk and writing there is even inlaying darkness there is no darkness in extremity and in mixing and in originating scattering religion there is no darkness in designing a group a single group proceeding show the necessity of the distribution of the same organization as there is if there is assuming that there is if there is reorganization flower flower and water and even more even a gram of grain and a single little blister very likely the chance is not perfect and the exquisite arrangement has lace very likely there are no stains and more likely there are ruffles in all of this there is no use in practicing medicine quinine any quinine is useful and more there is more there can be more there is an apartment a sign of saving consists in spending the late morning in the morning and in urging in certainly not urging a calculation a sign of saving is so simple if there is enough handed about and surely no pains in piling are more shown than when everything is in dishes this does not happen in an asylum it does not even happen in the hay and in the double shapes that shelter cooking a top a tiny little top that sits and spits and shows the courage calmly this this is so soon an exasperation and a piece of lightning it is so ordinarily just that occasion it is so kindly dispiriting it is so haughty if there is pushing there is pushing this is what makes it repetition a long what is a log to do when it floats it is to do nothing as it floats but certainly it would be best that it should adjust that to itself certainly this alone does not make an explanation a degree of resorts and a shining wave all this together does not make a regulation and it does not make that irregular it sustains mischief and an order and it even enforces the likelihood of the season and some color so sustained is a paragraph that a sentence shows no staring and some noise this is so simple in the size that is medium and is medium sized sentinel there is no kilometer that does not make a sample keep the place that is not open close the place that has one door shut the place that has a cellar suffer where all suffer more argue and shelter the understanding orphan and silence that is silence is not sufficient there must even be sleep puzzle is more than a speck and a soiled collar a pound is more than oat meal and a new institution a silence is no more than occasional it respects understanding and salt and even a rope it respects a newsstand and it also it very also respects desert all the ice can descend together was there freedom was there enchaining was there even a height rising from higher if there was what is a coat worth and by whom was it made when a lining any lining is a trimming more trimming is extra a sort of arranging a kindling of paying a shilling does that mean another extravagance and more candles no more candles it does not show a famous single candle has a chance to shine so that glaring meant that no more would be reversed by lightning the safe lamp and the bright lamp and the dirty lamp and the long lamp were all not the lamps that were attending baptism why is the baptism patient baptism is patient in the first place because there is no coarse cloth in the second place because when there is nothing taken enough is left to give every reason a practice which engaged more attention than the rest was that which shaved a tame stopper and did not even end that supposing crossing a street is necessary supposing it is

other one being simply enough different enough and certainly these then are expressing this thing and certainly this has been completely expressed by them and they are expressing this thing some are needing that not any one is one some are not wondering about and then again and again finding that they are knowing everything that that one is ever doing very many are needing this thing and these then are ones being living and these then being ones being living are ones sometimes singing and sometimes making noises in being ones just then not wondering and not knowing anything about any one doing anything so then all of them all of each of them that are being existing and being ones being such ones are being ones who are ones being ones of this kind of them this kind then are all of them for all of them are of this kind of them many of them any of them are ones that are completely not needing going on being living when they are ones any one is hearing many of them any of them are almost not at all needing going on being living if any one has been listening and certainly very many are listening mostly all of them are listening any of them are listening and so not any of them

enemy much quicker if a servant is your friend there is no getting rid of her belmonte is a bullfighter i have not seen him he is sick he had bronchitis and now hes wounded they put him in a specially prepared place and they say the wound is serious he will recover it is said that the queen hit the king not here in greece so be it this is going to be the story of cook oh yes that will be alright the story of belmonte is that we know he is hurt in the leg a mexican is to take his place the man at the cafe artistos after much experience likes him better and says that though not good looking has better technique the dog he thought he wanted it at once the curtain they wanted it and liked to look with a telescope first he came that way then the same women had places they can read cook does and he says and he is kind to all he has french as a friend and he speaks mallorcan he understands all he is so kind continually fatten they continually fatten she is so she likes it she says she is dreadfully bitten this is the way they met he was abroad and he was used to english not to speak but to be disappointed he was never disappointed he spoke it he called it he spoke in a low tone he said i am sorry i have no faults i am without fear but i have no money i am not afraid of that and i am not reckless i am very careful i always pay back he does he never said i said so i said mrs hardy was right when she said he had honest eyes he is fond of swimming we saw it she could not go because it was hot the one who was advertised was a failure the other one the one we had seen had learnt how to do somethings very nearly and he did it using all his old vigor and carrying it successfully a man of talent and plenty he had blue eyes he was carried away by whom by many men they were really there the other one is one one is not sorry for he is too old for yesterday and we remember him we remember him at the same time two years ago and he was not the strongest man or even the good one i do not understand why they speak to him belmonte we have not seen him after all he doesnt talk french very fluently and so perhaps it would be better if only you came to dinner of course you know best the moon the moon rises more to the left every night considerably more i remember how i felt about it we began on top and slowly came down and this time we were down but there was no liveliness in it even if there had been anything delicate it would not have been pleasurable thats how i felt about it dont listen to her in places they go to see their husbands they wait until he is off the boat then they rush it is a sweet story dont come up after ten if you want to come come alone thats alright but dont come with fanny after ten i love you fanny fanny is your name isnt it this is they way they disturb him belmonte belmonte they are going to have an opportunity at night not he horses they are going to do it in the way we have not seen it is not right to wear those clothes made by a dressmaker who eats lunch no all men are dark and women white we went out and saw six soldiers and a woman a little boy bartholomew goes to school in the hot weather august and june also july july and august his father is proud he says he does not eat too much he does not eat enough he learns english french spanish and arabic arabic is for the arabs he learns it so that he can speak it he is not a son of a baker he is the son of a hotel keeper a small hotel nobody sleeps there capable of studying he is capable of studying we were not sure that she was french we thought she spoke it how do you know how to say we do not care about lemonade we have not yet mentioned that on the twentyfirst there will be an opportunity to see fighting when it is lighted by electric light we will certainly go by this means they say that the effect is not interesting this is not the history of belmonte because there are so many mounted men we said we did not admire them here but we have admired them we said this instructedly today we were pleased to see our servant he said that electricity does not work on sunday cook works he said he asked every one about guano and they said he worked better than belmonte if so they are both of the school of gallito in the manner of gallito who does continually what he does a little he is no doubt incorrect in what he had heard he often is he does not understand nevertheless there are horses and electric light we will see today we walked we walked up and around the hill one would speak of this as not having taken a very long time we were full of discussion we were frightened that evening no we werent certainly we said we were plain dear things what is it this is not like his painting talk about mathilda grief for belmonte he did not hurt his foot it was cocherita of bilbao who hurt his foot he hurt it so badly that he cannot walk tonight it is very different cocherita de bilbao he is not an american torquito is he reminds us of it he is very successful he is intelligent and he is strong and he has blue eyes in the distance i saw him very near horses why are horses blind they are in one eye what does a lizard want to get he wants to get polybe who will train him who will wash him who is beside him where is he we do not know cook is such a believer in parents age he says it all the time he is certainly or thirteen or fourteen plus seventeen i mean it i think he is older we never hear about belmonte when they gave a dinner the other day belmonte was not there plan this you meant to walk up to the horse kneeling on one knee throw your weight on the barrier and relieve the attack relieve it by planting sharp stars into his shoulder relieve it by stroking the horn by hurrying this was the plan and he did it again he continued to assure the attack by not being quick he was very quick this is the way to pursue it follow it about and have the understanding with the uncertainty nothing is uncertain to him he is a wretch we can be angry we were disappointed belmonte was not there and we had paid as if he were i remember long dashes mr kitchener said that he was to go and he would meet him mr potter he said if you will go later i will be there mr potter did not go or he would not have met him mr kitchener did not go neither did mr potter belmonte had his foot hurt he is still in the hospital they were here to eat their dinner they ate their dinner and they advised us to get seaweed they said seaweed he said seaweed contains iodine which is very important for medicine it is very important in medicine belmonte uses it for his foot he uses it to put on his foot belmonte uses it on his hurt foot it is put on his foot a great deal they use it often they use it on his foot whenever he is hurt he has been hurt belmonte was hurt his foot was not hurt it was just above his foot and there he was seriously hurt necessarily the secret of belmonte i do not wish to weep i forget war and fear and courage

little lively hue and copper up england leave off more time than the hope which assures the rent of a custom the sweetness is not only there it is the reason left and monkeys are not merry if you do have the eyes blue and the hair the color then it is easy to see the hands all along and the day the prize is not driven and the selecting of all the coal is that all the while is light and cleaning is not repetition if you see the chance then spring again and if not be extreme be certain that the show has that line in line and do not never see the patent desert the measles so the cloth is alright and the carpet is english pink and the moon that sweet sugar is brown cane sour asparagus and do not season with reason certainly the union of oxygen with ostriches is not that of the taught tracer it is not a window that has an elastic it is planted gutta percha the change is not plain seeking the hills are not dislocated and the cluster has not the name of the intermediate beginning to paste more attention on a bridge is not the path that is taken all of it is planted the blossom is pealing the tender dew is green the presence is in the time in between the sacrifice is that that the bell which rings has a clapper the pleasure in the use is not so dreary but that there is an exchange one sees a custom one sees a date one sees a potatoe one sees a caterpillar one sees more particulars than kissing one sees the blame distributed one sees more than any one powder and food union and despatch so that there is no pale color so that there is black so that there is much preperation of a return to the same if a little meadow and a tree have that use and a morning and the west wind have that use and the evening and the continuation have that use then there is no use when the sing song ends rising yes there is the same there is all of that which makes it certain that something is what is there and not misplaced this means that to be different there is not any place that is the same and if the whole place is there then it is not alarming it is confirming this is so shrewdly what is proven bailing the center of a spot and not having an embankment is not the only way to flirt so soon so left without a spoon so august and so strange and taller than every other it is not astonishing that some one is older there is not a seed and an orange an orange is red and yellow a seed has only a little way to grow and there is not any palm that grows larger it is the same it is astonishing it is the same the sweet spread of the union with intuition and every anger is so certain that there is no bloom there is red feeling and the color is deeper blue is of some use there is more place for weather a pigeon is a bird and flying it is not widening the piece that cooking makes duller not at all it does not taste that way the cause and any effect this does not make the smell stronger this does not make what is pie to change any sigh then to place all of that hope to destroy dancing and to make a lovely turn that is not the season of every day that is not the season of monday that is not the season of sunday a pleasant taste and plenty of butter a pleasant drink and plenty of water tea and more fruit than in winter bread and more eaten than ever this is so sad and every one sees that it is to be cheerful any one sees cheerful weather every one eats cheerful potatoes they are large and there is water and there is butter a whole city is not subdued it is iniquitous it is so soon to see the plant that is not buried showing more white tail than ever a little thing is never tender the size is there in the moan where there is no groan in the noise where there is no presence in the palm where there is the range of the seed and the light of more in the room where there is all there the place where there is every chair in the hall where there is steamheat all about there is union in the height of some so then there is no prayer where the use is more strange than none this does not make for cheese and the rest are the same every day butter which is every where has a little table fish is all the time of day when the silver is away and there is more there all the daylight makes for meat and the washing has that price every price is cheaper all the finished way to treat everything there is to place is not the only way to shape the standing heating all the day is every day and exercise is made that way and piling plates where there is grass is something that is neater to originate a smash means more tasting than there is when there is no use in stewing more than has been put in there to stay so comes more length and some more weight and the bestowal of that piece is not astonishing the lantern of blinking is not lively and this is distracted by quick ways of winking there is so much use the line of the rise is afternoon sunrise so the main is seen and the green is green pleasure the rotten winter when there is a rotten summer there are some things a place can not show so there is no end to a name and there is no end of likelihood a darling makes no noise and a spoon makes nothing pink return the whole special short sentence and then say that he will be pleased to say that in that result is so much more particular the cleanliness comes from washing the little pieces at the center and not making them have the sparkle in black this is not all of a windy day so much more that is green and not gold makes the bottom have that form the shapes are there they are not there when they are the same a reason is given it has a whole name soon the susan is all past the land is clean and the green color is not singled with more yellow than some this shows in the catalogue and in the hair all the plate is glass and cleaned with white which are hanging the whole is spent and there is more than the size all the long way to be in that length which makes no more of some cuckoo is not shown by the intermission of every reply it is so cheerful and the breath which is not all of a response is used some more there is a sound that came and made the agreeable deplacement of no sign if it is to be had there is a way to surround the time of day the sooner sand is not the smell of heating and this more ancient than the day does not mean all the noon he can be pleased in the same time as a bright sunday he can be dancing so he can be and he is somewhat he is altogether he and there are the patience he and all the whole way is uplifted with that and surely the simple thing is to neglect that and to do so soon to have an eye soon to have plenty of them soon to have a nose soon to have plenty of them soon to have a light soon to have plenty of them the argument is that if there is a way there is no need to say that separation means more use than all the cake that is true that is a belief a thorough substance is one that has no particular caterpillar a caterpillar has no color this is no loss there is no less more than there is clothing it shows that much and anybody can say no anybody has a hat a hat has no use that does not mean that it does shine when there is a plain sight all the heavy weight is that color and nobody is more famous than an oaken piece of wood not any body and every one is famous every one when there is no lavender peace to more calm and rest to more regret that selling is not burdening buying still so many change the time to say that the change is not a meadow is not to all the same and anyway all have nothing bare they season their chocolate they partake tender the rest is the finish of the street the houses are adjusted and adjoining the conclusion is no veil the breeze is taller and surely walking is something there is any occasion there is no pink appurtenance so much suit so much harbor so much that is described in response a land is not more seen than a beefsteak and a beefsteak is wasted all the roast has a sale and all sale is varnish the section that has the twin set of notwithstanding are all suited with the linen and more camps are made to fit than there is hair on a peninsular the reason is so just that a question has that right and a belief is universal that is to say there is no doubt of something drafts are not dark nor is the sea and livelier are the seven months of warning all the perils are serene and laughing is not stranger piling for a witness means the boat and all the floating places are so searched tighter and more of the breathing there makes any swelling so much simpler a plain tie makes a connection on saturday and they are the first they have that reason no one can oppose visiting there is no use in obtaining a station time to go away is october that shows more winter than weather this does make a written reason a bloom on a red thing means that there is a single country an apple offered means that there is no disgrace a single thing that has no seeds means that there is land a same joint and no appetite means that there are no sandwiches like the mantle and the light and the crackling underwear like the colors that are dark and the mixtures that are bright like them all there is no destruction there is no analogy there is a dislocation there is no disturbance startling and true the same are few the presence of many is acute the death of more is arduous the relation of all that is in that language so simple a date makes no hard singing if it is a wild cow it is tame the single hair shows the reason in a precise ham it is a dinner it is leaning kindling is wood and coal is tonny that is the blame and a blower is funny the time comes to state that there is seriousness blame is not forecast it is a sunrise how soon is there more shade than light a bang is the sound of water a simple string ties it together it is so struck that there is water moisture has a sample of more there is no sympathy there is no educator if the width is more the wider is wider the width is not a wayside it is the block there is the color soon there is no shade shadows are a sampler there is no sampler the width is precious it is wading in length the wide angel has no wet winter it is not drained wetter bursting no more and being the sample of more of it is not so much simpler than it was it was so sudden it was suddenly so much more safer then there came the same time and there is analysis there is the whole time and there is no more simplification than there is there is very much more there is that there there is there more than that there is to avoid a shot means that there is no way to jump why should an engagement fit two there is no cause in despair the darkness that makes a mind show dirt is that which is practical the union of all that is wetness the change is underweight and yet the practical use of length is the same as width there is that belief ink is black that is brutal if there are fish a church is so enchanted that there is hymning this makes the question safer all the peals that were ruined were those that were stumbling and if these were in the way they were a shop that means that selling is an obligation a clamp is that which when attached has a pin this keeps it from coming more to say less this does not show wagering if the time is between then there is no certain wisdom and yet there is no denial why should there be what is the taste it is not so painful to see hanging hunger is more perforated that does not mean that there is a change in weight no powder pink is not a color any color is an order that is to say if a window is not the same every one has that resemblance saving no soap and coming in coming right in means that there is that action the tone of surprise is uplifting but there is not that disgrace there is down that is sinking coming in that is coming and rinsing that which is used is the room that which is used is washing that which is used is not preventing anything resembling any soaking so much substance so much receipt so many more cakes of wintry dancing is it astonishing it is there is every disturbance why is there whether why is the thames warmer packing and not mentioning being adjoining does not mean eyesight it does not mean a release from an operation it is not destroying a button so then the price is the same and the size is dependent on the whole piece it shows no holes clearly there is no use in scissors a kind of wading is not so poisonous as wiped water the length of a street is not disturbed by the use of slippers not at all loud and not louder and the time is stouter and the width is wider and the selection is thicker no time to be tall and small no time to prick a finger no time to surprise a noise in the sides and yet all that is used by there being more time there every birthday every birthday which is not yesterday has an occupation an occupation is that which when there is the time shows the center of that which is the lamentation and lamenting does not destroy that use it does not fulfill a judgement it does more it is relined the same shows more when there is no date any reading is simple the use is all day a response uses words they mean that full the length is more than the joining there is that reestablishment and no violence the time is more so than peculiar there is nothing to see reading is action there is a swim in a way all the time is an accident there is a reason there is that experience of detraction there there is expression there is a blame not intending disturbing unattaching unintelligent attention to extreme intention payment and subjoining sin the length of death is not between the tooth and the age and more than all the salt and more than all also the hard bed and no petition there is the use in pointing harder than no wind and no other this is not white there is no cream any kind color there is the time to grow longer and all the same if there is no paper it does not show in the print and penwiper it does not it can see more than what than then henry and a doleful danger there is a sending of a principle line of unpointed apples and a target a whole thing is no example and the caneseat joint is so soundless in quiet cushions there is no more penwiper anything that is everything and everything that is anywhere and everything that is everywhere has no special singular purpose if purpose is intellectual then there is a garden if there is a garden there is a fountain if there is a fountain then there is an intellectual purpose no respect is resembling that more than the mischief to choose more is to choose something that choice which is admonished is not more dated than that which is remembered and there is a fine display of zeal there certainly is and nothing is more orderly nothing and when there is washing there is interlacing this means so much cleaning and cleaning which has that sign is the same as the whole time of being peculiar any one is older any one is a sight for a beholder any one is saved a sickness and any one is a particular substitute for remaining undetermined and seeing a clean collar all the same the full service is in the height of a rich thick sandy sticky silence there is no dispute when there is harmony all the date is in the place there are such red ones when they are pretty a color which shows is one that is not seen anywhere this will happen this does not start a subject to be reckless and rejoined to be sad and not forsaken to be earnest and awake to be sure that there is freedom all this makes no difference at all a sight that disturbed was not that after all there was restraint and to look differently shows that there is a resemblance and that the nation has partaken the nation has partaken and there is no pleasanter reunion to be forced to say that there is no denial not to be forced but to be rejoiced that comes from the time when there is no hesitation and much ease very much ease is more ease than much ease much ease is more ease than the ease which is not that ease that comes to be said that comes to be so said that there is no individual reunion between the first second third fourth and fifth a cause for disturbance rests in the fact that more time is used in a long time than in a short time there is no criticism when the time is long the time is so long that an answer comes promptly this is so much the more satisfactory as the occasion for an answer is whenever there is cause for a question the difference between this and no elaboration is extreme no elaboration is not achieved in a question nor in an answer and this which is so eminently satisfactory is that there is no doubt that there will be no reason for the occasion to be faithful is to be accustomed and the custom which is without that reservation has no circumstance to replace it the time to state that is when there is no reason to doubt a result there never is a reason to doubt a result if there is a promise if there is a promise it means that idleness is only another name for a thing the whole place is so large that there is no dust and so there not being that there is every occasion for no difference to be noticeable this makes reading so necessary nothing is perplexing if there is an island the special sign of this is in dusting it then extends itself and as there is no destruction it remains a principle this which makes that reveals that and revelation is not fortuitous it is combined and ordered and a bargain all this shows the condition to be erect suppose that there is no question if there is no question then certainly the absence of no particular is not designed and then when it is astonishing it is not liberty liberty is that which gathered together is not disturbed by distribution and not given without remark and not disturbed by frugality and an outline all this makes the impression that is so disturbed that there is no question there is no use in denying what any one hearing reading is hearing there is no use and doing it every day is not tantalising it is not a bit more tantalising than exaggeration not a bit and the whole result is spoken out in the best time and place and moment this increases daily and all the time what if there is meddling meddling is not automatic and if it is automatic why should it not be obligatory a candle light does not mean that there are candles a candle light means arithmetic and training and ways of stating a question and it means much more it means that every night if there is moonlight there is that light and light has so much place in a lighted place that every one is accustomed to it it is so wintry and hair is blowing and all the slippery slides have water on them it is so summery and wind is water and all that is red is what is burning the whole excitement all the wedding shows the spring to be the place where water springs all the horizon all the dwelling shows that escaping is not an escapade that is in a suggestion so to reason and so to eclipse and so to redden the western sun so to accept and so to annoy and so to have no piece of money so much so is not a tangible substance it is intangible and therefore it is sliced a toil that has no frozen dishwater a trembling that has an appetite a refusal that has a nervous extremity an expression that has a direction of disregarding all this shows the essential use of a minority they show it and they caution it they do not outrage giving it credit the time does not come to any one who is pardoned it comes and then when there is patience when there is use when there is talking and a table when there is even a slice of ham it comes then to be announced that certainly understanding is what is not partial it is so kind and strong and lengthy that certainly there is no disgrace a goose girl is no goose girl when there are geese a church is a church a ship is a ship thunder is thunder silence which makes silence give that sense to all there is silence which has light and water and unison and appetite and result and a motion and more exaggeration and no recklessness silence which is there is not disturbed by expression there is no doubt of one thing there is no doubt that the real rate of establishing frequency is that which is used when there are numbers what comes out of silence what comes out of silence is that which having that usefulness that nature and that fashion is not shown to be managed by the combination surely silence is sustained and the change is sudden supposing that there was no use for that which there is use for supposing there was a bridge there where there is what there is supposing all this and suppose that the enlightenment of everybody consisted in everybody having that condition supposing all this this is then the answer that silence gives in answer the silence that is not preserved the silence is the same as the characteristic which is not finished a pound of paper and no more string a pound of string and no more leather no pounds of anything else does that make indifference it does it does make authority all the calamity that shows origin and design is that which when it is understood is redetermined all this is entitled readministration there is no use in a pencil there is no use in any direction of succeeding in experience there is not one single objection the wholesale cloth is not handled with a sprinkler it is so handled that when there is no obligation there is every inducement it is so handled that pathways are mended it is so handled that there is a single sound all the same there is no such language it does not mean by that that the letters are smaller it does not mean that at all the strength of purpose which joins resignation with neglect and action with reducing and interpretation with resignation the strength of purpose which connects distribution with desertion and pink coloring with bathing the strength of purpose which does not deny reddening which does not authorize forbidding which does not disturb utilizing the strength of purpose which adjusts desertion and exercise and resolution the strength of purpose which organizes recognition and the disturbing of a perfectly satisfactory reception the strength of purpose that withdraws no application and registers no reaction and suggests no opening such a strength of purpose is resolute and reliant and reлstablished such a strength of purpose has the same service as the expression of recognition such a strength of purpose has the borrowing of relaxation and the neglect of retardation such a strength of purpose is selected selecting articles for recollecting such a strength of purpose has origin and unison such a strength of purpose has the surface of differentiation such a strength of purpose has the organ of rehabilitation such a strength of purpose is not pasting it is not nailing it is not swinging it is not fighting it is not saving it is not utilizing the origin of sewing all the same the strength of purpose is something it is there it is worried it is in the precise situation that nothing shows it is displaced it is practiced it even has a little place to spread a certain kind of preparation it even is the kind of thing that has celebrations and bursts and specks and a kind of thing that has no particular name but is useful when it is not used in the end in every way there is adaptation and that does not mean the same as the use of no excuse it means something that any one can see is opposite it means what is coming to be realized as the intended metal to make nothing of and not be wasted all the same there is that idea and if there are no more pieces why then there is a difference there is a kind of way of saying that there is no doubt that any one can join in with some member and surely if the rest makes no matter what is there any use to say there is no difference there is none and so the whole thing shows that there is no pot and no dirty winter all the same it does sound that way the shed and the house and any shelter shows mud in winter it does and it shows in summer as well it shows it in summer and in winter and it shows so well that anybody says something different anybody shows something when something is showing and something is showing whenever there is sauce and there always is that to save and put around there always is some way to be reconciled to a difference the whole thing is just shown in their being no celebrated invalid mallorcan stories romanonos no maurer see sun never sets napoleon the third cathedral mckinleys eagle popes prayers for peace pins and needles ship mallorcan stories scenes actions and disposition of relations and positions keep away and visit every saturday that is the only way to resist carrying all the attention when there is enough time time is not the thing any evening time is not the thing in the afternoon there is not such a morning not a time when there is occupation not such a time is the time that is not used and a knock that has no intention has some hope it is not open to stay there is a way to go away that is not the use of that way there is every return that which is not used is not a word it is enough that which is asked is not a conversation it is a piece of typewriting and so there is no choice and yet if there were not would there be the exchange of everything there is enough of that which is admitted often and sometimes to make any difference there comes to be of returning receiving this is not what is kindly to keep on is to use what there is when there is enough of what is in daily use that is not the medium that has that renewal it was the time of day to fill all day the steadiness of that and that which is useful is the thing that is individual and a refusal to sing is one thing to go on with a song is not wrong to say that a use is not passed away when what is not said is not useful is one way to say that the quality that is the same has any experience winter in a room and living there and many rooms and some air and all the same breath when food is not scarce and enough to eat if boiling is neat all of that which does not pass away stays to place the work that has that presentation it was not dark and the light was not lost as that which was finishing the condition was the same if it was wood it had not the same description there are ways of admiring something there is a regular way of having that position that entering is not permission if there is no need of question all the time that the talk is done there is a way to stay to use anything is not the best way to have the right answer all of the time is so placed that an awkwardness does not mean a pleasant entrance and there is the presence of that which is not necessary which induces a reception there is no dreariness in success and selling a picture and arranging an exhibition there is no dreariness in four galleries and five cities and a packer there is no dreariness in charging a direction and using up a special expression and seeing that sustain reorganisation there is no dreariness in having some reception there is no dreariness the time has come when seeing a different coat reminds some one of the time of the year and this does not make the same difference as a strong nature this makes the particular use of some understanding and loss of hope and change of face this does mean that the pleasant time has been near a darker day is not darker and the reason of that is that the impression being made it is continued until there is that change and the change is not coming it has not that complexion the whole time is occupied when there is no place where the effect of that impression is not wearing into some shape and then when the copy is not perfect it is not prettier and the thing to show is the intention and the way to spend the whole piece is to move away and explain that in a letter if there is a faithful action then belief is certain if there is no change of reputation all that is received is answered when any subject is open and there is no place to sit and talk there is a way to say that the thing there is not in the square and when it is in the square if it is there then seeing it is enough if going into it is to be put there and there is a way to go in the way to go out is if it is the same is the same the whole of that time is not used when a little thing that remains has no meaning any little thing has that meaning there is another way of being a dirty fellow if the effect of a defect is to allure and to change the base of any recognition then it is a wonderful way that makes a vision and that is what is if no one is the same and the one is only that one and is not any different it has not any meaning that which is so plain that a screen keeps nothing clean the air is not there if there is no surface then the only way to choose is by example and there is not a way to compliment there is a way to try any way and to have had no resolution and to have been received by some to come into the relation means that if there is a response something has been said this is not too exact it does not exhaust a preparation not lading the leaning and not exhilerating the creation and the tending of the flowering is practically all of that thing arranging the renewal of refusing by accepting is the only sweetness succeeding is not subduing succeeding is not staggering when it is not proceeding and the best plan is the day that has less provision the whole place is one place and the place that is that place is the place where the hope is that which has no time the only withdrawing of nothing that has longing is the time that it takes to say that there is joining arrive and wait and say to no other that there is no deception when there is relaxation not to say anything is obliging to have that position and to meet that destination and to show the way which is not changed as a pleasant greeting and that reception is all there is of all reunion it does not copy the relation and it does have that movement to see no harm and to see all the charm and to have possession and to defend permission if there is any way to ask it is to despise one another if there is the same reason what can be used if all that is held is supported by everything what can be some change the whole place is there to see and to go there means that the same thing is begun the regard is different leading in hearing that is to be tired that is what is the way to hear more and always then there is that result there is a change leading in hearing and then that is being tired and being then staying and being remaining and exchanging that for that thing not feeding eating that is eating in feeding eating is what eating is and feeding is what feeding is and eating and feeding that is the use of that receptacle which is not empty nothing is empty and open and everything is full when it is opening and closing closing is nothing the open way the open way and the closing way the open way is not the origin of that which is interesting the parts of speech are not the same they have some origin the whole place has that which it has when it is found and it is there where there is more room room has not that expression it has no change in a place it is not dirty there is no cleaner passage and the best way to have it all express that is to cook a dinner there is enough to get a suit that is not had when there is no hope that is the difference if there is much and there is much more to place one by the side of another and they both have something that is their color to do that and not languish is to look then and see that relinquish what it will have when it remains where it is to be this is not foolish it is a part of all distraction it is the intention of all dissension it is the measure of all language to see that a piece is used where there is no receipt is one way to express that things which are different have that resemblance and this does not mean that there is not a denial this means that the same room is different when the furniture is colored to color furniture is to say that the furniture is wider and the walls are taller and the light is clearer to change often is to say that the use of something is the same to answer when there is no question to intend to follow when there is no plunging to embody that which has that knowledge all that is the way to remain with the little button that has a buttonhole this is so attached it is not there to squeeze that which has no meaning it is not there to squeeze the order that has not been begun is the one that sends ten away the ten stay some where and the time is longer the use of it is that there is more in any long way the distaste for cold meat does not lead to eating it leads to everything this is not all of a feeling it is enough to suggest any little thing the way to thank is to respect the whole opening and the way to despise one apple is to choose another this can be done by weighing it can also be done by looking the way to use a quotation is to hope that it will be heard when it is spoken that is the way to make that sound it is not the same that which is not sad with that which is repeated it is not the same and the sight is so different that there is that hope and no more excitement then the change is there and there is all the comparison the rising of the wedding is not the same as one child if there are no children but one child has that to use and there is enough to give it a cold this is not seasonable this is not the way to despair the heat of hearing is not the silence of answering and nothing is produced when the question is the same as the name that is one way to answer and there might have been more but it was different it was the same the whole district was not used when a place was borrowed and the pleasure in that union is the same as giving permission the hope of that intention is what keeps the answer from being prepared and if it is prepared then it is printed there is enough intermission to cause a special heat and to be colder is not the way of having any custom there is no irregularity in that it is too plain the time for that grief is not in the head it is in the origin of salvation so there has come to be no neglect and there does not waste any order when the time which is all day is the same time and if not older then not that difference in spending it is not all the same if nothing is spent it is not all the same because then there are all the things there that have come to be gotten by searching and finding something this which happens often uses the time that is not plain to see it is not so discouraging and the whole thing is not so full as it would be if there was not another the resemblance is there there is no paint when there is nothing to dirty there is never any change in that and the silence is not there when it is empty and there is no intention to show more than enough all the time there is the exact way of changing it a little and not mixing more and that is not the origin of industry the origin of industry is the evening of recitation there is some past playing of singing every past evening this is not more than the future a pleasing way to use a broom is to lean upon the wall and not do more than make any one who is the one welcome this if it is pleasing is pleasing and working is industry that does not change everything intending to remove the dirt does not destroy the variegated color the color is not a stain it shows what glass is when there is a reflection this peaceable pursuit is so earnest and so steady that there is no remark made when all the time there is that description and the way is that way as there is what is said as the way that is that way the door is not so open it was not dark and the weather was not clear and the sunshine was not gloomy and the color was not red it was not dusty and the window was not open and the stove was not shut and the table was set there was no pepper and there was some salt and there was more chicken and there was more sweet there was cauliflower and there was cake and there was no steamer and there was butter and there was potato and there was cucumber there was no cream and there was banana and there was cream later and there was orange mixture all the potato that was eaten had been roasted and the pigeons were kept and the fruit was finished and there was another platter all the time is dark and there is a light and the time to think is the time to paint and the grey blue purple is the red rose color and the pink white cover is the fine broken china the object of more is to stay that way and the use of the present is to mingle that future and the presence of all is the use of that and the pleasure of that date is to separate in weight the time to express is to receive that attention and the change in tone is not the disgust the dwindling of more is not to show that wear the spring of the change is the loosening of that the mingling of this is not the spurt and the winning of the white is not the soiling of the black the tin that presses has not a hollow sound and the color blue is not so pure and true the best of all is the presence of the best and the way to stay is to sit long in that way no way to stay is a way to go away no way is a way no way is way there is enough to sound the note and the little flute is there where there is no air and the blowing is strong and the blowing is long and the air is there where there is no air solemnly to stay is not a sad way to stay away is not the glory of that day to begin the time is not the time to dim the evening and enough decision has no origin this is that result labor and not long makes a sad song and that is not true when the name is short and the preparation is the same there was a particular time of day to hope more and this was not all of the morning and the evening and the beginning of the afternoon this was after finishing a piece of the copying that gives splendor to any situation and this was also the time when having stayed long enough there was no more explanation all the best permission lies in correspondence and more permission is not used when there is no distance this does not disentangle vice this makes a season last longer and the cold weather which is not such very cold weather has the happiness of expecting to rain this does not warrant all that intention in the time to wait and tell the truth there is no more dispute than if there had been more time this does show the antiquity of acknowledging that a morning is used for something to deny that is to deny everything and to determine that would need no hesitation this is not what there is to think this is more of the presence of witnesses this which is assured would make the nervous one not so worried when the answer is not coming a great many risks need that advice a dash of the following is so distinct and the time to send more is what is not hopeless all the time and all the date and all the superfluous wood and porcelain show the mark and the use and the continuation of retention patience is not plenty and waiting is not abusing the intention any little thing is more than a question any attempt is a return of a permission to be attentive and intended and make that mistake is not more deceptive than anything present the detachment and have the words continue to come there and this will not make a tune slower and destroyed this will not at all be that to put that question does not mean the mention of an author to repeat the name is not the same when there is no chair to draw it in is one way to approach the place that was not there to intrude this does not make the objection clearer it just makes the same tune it was thought that as the mountain of something which does not grow does not grow it was once thought it was thought that the change was not so old and the age was older it was thought that the same thing pressed would be put on there where there was no custom it was thought that there would be some more age it was intended and there was that which was earnest it was intended that the obligation which was not climbing would lead to the showing of anything and it was there where there was hope that the time was the whole thing was not the same to open a door and turn in the direction that the one entering will bow shows so little quick movement that there is a way to advance and so to be timely to have that hesitation to bring a chair up and to enter into standing does not occupy the whole evening if there is some singing that is settled that which needs some introduction it is not necessary to refuse it any evening there is more hesitation any thickening of the coat shows something and there is a use of that word it was all right there was that hesitation there was the time of the afternoon and there was one evening of some which were those which were evenings there was that and the best way to show that is to have more than each little piece not used as a question this can commence that there is no perplexity there is that abuse there is more there is something there is no bit of more than was used by any writing there can be more printing there can be intending lending there can be that interest a peculiarity of the steps and the entrance is that it is not so peculiar as there are more calling out something this would change a beginning if there had not been a setting this which was was the time to do that and the result is different so the whole thing means this that if there is a continual use of it all there can be and there is the expression of that emotion the pleasantest anticipation is that reaction and more time is then spent and the whole place is lonely there are four in it if the cleverness of that copy means that a voice is louder then certainly there is not that connection that there is as there is what has been lasting this is not so dirty cold water is not cleaner pound the little timetable and then spread it so that reading it is not any more simple than it was this has that charm and every little quality has that intensity it is not more distinguished to be whiter than to be redder to be taller than to be shorter the meaning has more necessity a beaming expression does not mean that the eye is so clear that there is no fatigue the drag that keeps that important is not spread out this is a reason why if that which is left to do is done there is no admission all the same there could be more if the direction was necessary and it is so full that there is always that hope and that room blessed are the patient particulars manifesting that hesitation so that when there is no hope there is always a guide in the languages that one used and sung some words are longer than others and this has so much seasoning and so strong a fence that certainly the tangle is not made by more than the three words that come being divided by there being no more this does take the time all the beginning has that intelligence and certainly a useful time to make requests is when there are any addresses and there are always addresses in places this does mean that need and that use and that return and that plentiful remorse there is so much to say a timidity that has no use in a boast is not that which tells about drawing the continuance of that is not more than promised it is continued to have the land behind when there is no sea has that to do which is not settling that which is more than free it is so natural that the opinion is there to detail more is to ask that question it is to refuse to answer it is to add that to it that is some excuse and more would not be enough and certainly that way is that authority to control the time is where there is an impression about the time when a book is borrowed is the time to return it and leave it this makes any one having that light not need to put it where it is to be put adding any more to a change is to occupy what is offended and the refusal to go together may mean that this when there is a song does not make a choice depend upon meaning that rising and falling which singing is doing means that drawing a chair closer can be repeated this would be more than that interruption there is no place for that time to sweeten a lucky star means that a sad way to sweep together the leavings is the one way to continue favor and that which is most active is more active as industry has that meaning it has it has that meaning the surplus weight is inside and when it is put into the pockets it is not heavier this gives some feeling of not lingering the authority that makes that lonesome is not the same as disgust it is always different sometime this makes an attempt more tedious than it would be if the change were coming and the presence of that is some little quality there can be agreement and the spectacle is the same then this which is not too much is often and so there comes to be that time and certainly that which was spent was not wasted as waste has not that meaning so there is no empty place all the time the chairs are there and there are enough tables wood has not that meaning this is not a slice and all the juice that is dry is not so dry when the hair and all is fair this does not make a greeting any less pleasing and certainly that which is done is not so discouraging there is no hope to use paint the little piece of wood more and there is no way to know that which is sore this does not mean more rarity than an exception this does not displace waiting for a wedding to ponder and not plaster any section is so long to stay in the house where the meals are given if there is food provision that enough of it means something it does not mean a color in a symptom that is not the only way to hope see thomas bring the grain see the grain have the color that grain has when grain is growing in any winter which is any summer see thomas bring the rain and see that the thunder is not the thunder that any rain raining longer is having thunder when having thunder see thomas bring what thomas is bringing and the load is not lighter as thomas turns the shadow darker thomas has no spring of water thomas has the color brighter thomas is the time to stay thomas hears what any source can supply thomas not darkly not lightly thomas does the chamber over the ruling of the pencil and the farm the ruling of a shadow and the grain the ruling of the woman who gave away what was not there to stay any ruling is the same and the line is there and has that prospect so closely was it passed that there was not more space than there was and so sweet are the pleasures of the rest that a quarrel with a cousin has the same result pass it on to the bottle houses in the corner have shutters a little tree is not lonesome because the leaves are not bright the presence of the necessary question does not mean that a kiss is to be given the sweetening of chicken is not all that is remembered when the form was such that buttons were plentiful and the surroundings were there that was not any way to say that the change was the same all the long expression that means a longer state of natural example is not so pardonable as everything that is in some instant the back and the waist and the presence of not any splinter the sundown and the kitchen and a table with a window and a napkin ring in winter all the presence of the most all the longing of that summer a pleasure and a sign and there is no chance to refuse any chair to the rug that has that hole and that color to the wood that has that color and that white to the table that has that carpet and that erection to the bed that has that shade and that carving to the lantern that has that light and that cover to the shapes that have that decoration and that derivation to the floor that has that surface and that meaning to that light that has that look and that garden to that wall that has that line and that concentration to the best that has that choice and that color to all and there is something sounding to that and there is no witness signing to more and the explanation is not a mistake to less and the time is when there is that to pass to all the length and there is more of that then there is not any refusal to resist a smell this is not the compliance of the teeth and there is no more force than that out loud a plain paper is often used pasting nothing in a little book is the way to use the paper and nothing is then lost and that is such a collection the season that weather is colder is that when there has been that change if all that is full has that liquor then the time to drink is in the beginning and the beginning has the complete return of the use of handling that is the kindness of september and october all the months that are the same have this in common to desert the red beard and to have no change of color means that the beard is all the same age there can be more shaving than illumination this does not change every red color if the shape is the same and the use of the evening is not much then a dress has that meaning and closing it is not music something is not quiet then all right where the well is shining and the waves are never higher than the water cover the slipping ocean and do not mingle more smell see the remaining accentuation and explain more and more and not more so see the rattle that was not eaten and use a penwiper soon too the patent that was taken did mean more than all the work that was spent every day in the morning no grief means time and no change means divorce and no pleasure means all eaten and no birthday has meaning this which has a pain in that nose means the left when the right is mentioned all is not darkness when the lights which are out are burning the tall cat has so much particular face that the garment is not more beautiful than a great number pain and particular pleasing pleasure and more than particular plain explaining weather all this is more than told and a past violin is not remaining and yet the last little monday is not every sunday and the whole cheese is not frightened and the question is not all considered and more aid engagements were not special all this and no more is so much more and the language and all the kernel was the time that solitude changed in going to another dinner lunch was often to be the article of the wound and to have no purser is not any more of a delight than is mutton this was so fully eaten that every day there was cooking not that startling sagebrush not that mortal melodrama not any fluent symptom not more simple feather sofa not more cloud than most of the members of the breathing place not a joiner and not a retroactive syndicate none of all the powder was more blue than a yellow plant this was not that memento this was not that parallel syncope this was the half curve of the splinter this was not every mounting this was the perfect parliament this was no dope show the place where the reproduction has that ease and drowning has a figure the lovely lane is not in sight where the hair is yellow if the change comes sooner and there is no stroke then the time of day has that to recommend it quite so then the platform which is not raised is occupied and that means that if there is a meeting a delay is offered and surely the use of that is not long when there is no question if there is a little quality and any quality is that then the whole hope is so arranged that a cloth has that short length and so there is no excuse there is every mistake there is every position an earnest protection has some meaning and the same thing has the charge of the place of no exchange and still it does happen it has happened and there is more of that there is no such expression a tomb and the time is not christmas the time and the way is not a carpet cover the leather and it is not water and the window and it is not a silk mixture the bright season and there is a composition all the moon has not pain in a conglomeration there is none there is no preceeding catastrophe there is no period and there is no preparation there is not much when all is not the same and the change has not been indicated why is a sour peartree in a blossom bee because it is so pleasant to remain in the summer detachment that is not the excuse for the box and the opening that is not the way to refuse that gesture so then the union has a widow and the mother has a father and littler and there is no length much longer jumping is not anything if a little way is behind the elbow and the knee this is the season of rejoicing and the moment to have a denial of advice if it is a pity it is not the same pity as more toast it can be so warm that there is sunshine and it can not be what is helped by appetite telling the last time that a green and mixed repeater was not lost and bought for more did not pass as it was not told so the beginning was made and there was some use they would not leave the thoughts together this did not make enough separation there was still more to behold and the time that was so frequent was any afternoon this came to silence any day and the single attention was such that any candy was the same as eaten this was not the whole school there was more copying of drawing so the tune and the light was not the light of any moon the rain was the same and the stairs were cleaner there was an exchange and this did not borrow trouble settle and there will be dinner ready settle and return the cake today serve the chicken and have cream all ready season everything and pour the oil away have the salad and the cheese between see the cream and love the candy there pass the day and eat the rest away stay away and do not shed the tear if a duty is so done that there is a chance let no one who passes any way engage a room let them do so show them that direction have the language and do not distribute more than all of that selection this makes knowledge all increasing and makes the return of patient splendor show the shadow that there is in that intention this is not a dream this has the same thing as the pleasant conversation and request a song is not more than necessary if the message is sent and received and if the tunes have words then certainly there will be soon the center piece which has not been removed every little flower has a number there is that way to question a regret with more comes when the tickets which are not serious were written and the same time was stated then there comes to be not a surprise but a result there is no more than any enquiry a walk is not where the door shows a light a walk is where there is a request to describe a description a walk is when a place is not to be exchanged there is a respect in every walk there is a result in every walk and the turn is there the foot and the boot have that union that there can be slippers talking of the return of that shows that there will not be an opening there is no reason to exchange the joke no mending no mining no motto no mine no pin no purchase no salad no oyster no practice no more no thought no happy day and the best is there and there is everywhere say it all in the morning put it off in the day have it come in the evening use the tune every day say it and please the organ laugh and remain the same coughing goes by favor and coming has a day to stay any way some way that way full and the tune a shaking of the ends is not paling in the more and then if there is no exercise there must be that and anyhow why should there be an implacable substitute there is no exaggeration all and one and any place to make a gold color show on paper that is not the evening that is what is heard any pleasure is the one and every evening is no matter all this does not make that weigh more than again there is no patient perfume this is not the sign of release blame no more than the mouth and this makes that regulation there is that use and there is no way and there must be that and there shall be a disposition that is the sign any language cannot be foreign lumber is not brick and brick is redder the path of a rug is that which is not returned enough has been put that way pile on more potatoes than cornmeal and more sausage than chicken and a little more tender oil than egg and all the eggs are fresh so fresh and fair is no behaviour when the whole thing has disappeared a taste and a branch and a sucking of the day and the calm and the man and the noise so wettingly this which sees that which mourns that which colors any moon all the paste is so straight and a scissors has a pleasing line to measure and there is no hidden treasure see that painful delivery of a portion of more that has squares see it and emphasize more than any afternoon emphasize a special rate please all trembling when there is a time to rise please it all and do nothing nicely so serene so much a moon so white and always plain a sensation is not altered by more being mentioned a time to stay is when there is the feeling in it and it has been done why should no hope be more why should it it does show faces and if there are there one is smaller there is no reason why a beard should be there it is mostly in sight and blindness is satisfying there is no blindness where the talk is cheap laugh the basket into a little glass and all the point is painted so soon is the jewel and so dirty the splinter that any march is a distinction there is that way if and there is no accusing if the sight means that surely the illumination is incandescent then surely something is expected of the direction which is opposite there is that union and the face is there so soon does a cork mean closing and the belt open this is no time to stay a time for splashing is not ever with a brick color no shaking is too great for a head this does not mean coming after it means that that is never over it means more and it has no splinter it does not mean samples a pale rose is a smell that has no fountain that has upside down the same distinction elegance is not coloured the pain is there it is so clearly pleased that which is benumbed and articulate and if in replying there is the indication of a sentence then surely the whole thing is hurled the house has that patience the story is in the evening a single recital makes a hat more makes no more cloth than pleating all the same there is silence there is uneasiness there is an appetite all the same there is silence there is the tune there is the birthday all the same any christmas is nearer all the same more talk is solemn all the same there is a special way all the same there is left a pint all the same the fruit is quince all there is is that shape the return is extinguished a lifelong dismissal means an admission to each one this passes more places and not any more faces this does show the joint when there is chicken the salad has cheese and there is no more added table it is so large that there is a window seat so much persistance so much elbow place so much single authority and able china so much more and a cold bigger that means that there is thieves staining anything is not underwear so soon there is more motion plead the use of a magazine and send more card paper this is so tiring and reading a letter is the same as writing an answer something was handed to some one a dark tunnel has no open shelter and to be dark is to be left lighter this does not mean that there was a shadow it does not mean that a shadow has a painting or a passage it simply means that it is unique and that there is an explanation keep a pint which is not fuller keep it and throw away everything a little gain means that wood is not burning a little gain means that there is no answer a little gain is a little gain to see a sample of cheese means that the authority which mingles excellence with scratching is such that a new beginning has no swelling all the tunes are played and the voice is louder there is no repair plunder and an appetite seasoning and sensitive singing all this makes that come back there is a solemn winter there is that to fit a car to the same stand as the pressing of every button means that there is a decision so much unity does show friendship a tangle is no less there are no narratives a plain pet does know how to draw drawing is a sin there is no picture there is a comparison all round is the collection there are parts anyway no part and no more no part and never nicely and the shape and all that section that is the time to use a weeding a precise desolation is so distracted all the curtain of river is running to be green and yellow all the lifting is by sitting all the time is on the bricks there is no seat there there is no church there there is no church there is nowhere there there is no crying there is no next butter there is there is more shape to leave lower a lame stool is one that has three lengths and a suspender there is a collar there is no disorder if the precious sand is rich and there is union then there is something if the precious sand is poor then there is poverty if there is more then there is anywhere what is choosing it is the predicate when there is illness there is no sickness there is a package are the eyes finer they are there yesterday they enter the weather lightning has no meaning gleaning has choosing descending bread has origin a taste is spreading there was once a made ready lifter there was once a birthday there was a saleable afternoon there was no deceiver there was none a little thing to send in and have a pain from singing a little thing and no person who is willing is signalling no person needs a shoe every one says what they do this does not mean that hopping is swinging it does that in the mean time it does that there heartily heartiness is the same principle it is no challenge it is not more a church it is not most a circle it is not a vestibule it is a single place of growing grass grass is not deserving it has all that to show it shows a marked meadow it is not by the baker fishing is sudden there is a decision all yesterday is passed a page of no addresses does not mean a mistake it means that there are places where the whole family is glad to eat together this is not a sign of anger it is the necessary sunshine of the country and to be pleasant is so close that there is no change the last time that there was an address there was no change if the ones turned away they ate in a little place and ate there if they did not show that they were enjoying it they did please that most and they collected that there and it was a hope and a silent time was not present there was no explanation there was the hope of the remains being recently for that and best taken nearer and not passed into the same time this did make the change stationary and really any authority is in the language and singing is not a victim there is no joke the time is the same and the place is not let there is a little square center and no center there is a simple dessert any cheese is darker any fish is lighter the same thing is the place unset the same time is tomorrow there is no date to marry if marrying is replaced by having that having been done there is no doubt of the mention of that and there is a taste of the meaning which is not a waste there was an exchange in decision all the way is plenty if there is the time to choose a pope there is no choice there then there is no sense in a waiter if the time has that note then certainly the choice of a seat means that two are not taken the time is given and the invitation is not pink when there is water the little bunch is not known and more is mentioned all of it a dark net is not a veil and a veil is not long it is not longer than following repetition granted that there is an hour that is half after six granted that does that mean that there is any use in being willing to have no other meeting and yet it must mean something and almost anything is that and it is very likely it is most likely that there is the time and the place it is most likely not often it is most likely that there is a longer daylight it is most likely ham and celery and chicken a roast is frying the ham if it is thickening is squeezing roast beef into a mayonnaise dressing there is oil there is cake there is chicken no absence is fonder all right to discuss that matter all right and the nature is fonder when there is no choice of kissing it is fonder and saturday evening is mingling borrowing some one not borrowing some one that is to say there is an offering all like a thing all like winking all like thinking all like sinking all like that all like a thing all like massaging all like thinking all like that all like a vision all like that all like distinguishing all like that all like that thing all like that all like thinking no old jerks no old news all is wet and there is no time in a day every day is not away the morning is sooner if the morning is sooner then the habit is spread it is spread and there is a whole row every row has an earthquake every ring has a color every piece there is is as different as it is when there is a comparison by putting them all together to be so particular shows that there is a difference in copying and copying is copying a picture and copying is copying a piece of sugar and copying is copying china all copying is so arranged that there is no trembling when joy is filling all the time that sadness has is the time that sadness is all the temper is in place darkness is not looking like this no sorrow is loaned for the succession of friendly business intervention a research means more there is a cause in extreme recognition no place is taken time for bells is ringing and breaking nothing is disturbing urging there is a piece a room a paper a fig a chase a poison cup a trace of a hat all this together is no disappearance the joy prevails and the season is sunday the end is beyond that if there is no question and an answer is not a toilet if there is no question is there any strangeness in a garden certainly not the danger is not any color it has the bloom and the sign of an early summer there is no necessity to deface anything an escape is not needed there is one question in not asking a question the permission which is continued is so courteous that there is no moonlight the time does keep the rain from startling more than a diary this shows that there is no question and an answer is no meeting the point then consists in there coming to be so much recent relief that the advance is simultaneous and surely if the same step is there there is no treachery the interchange is worshipped with a boat there is no time in the use of money a little means more of that same multiplication and in any case there came that time there is no worry and this does not mean that there is that absence it does not even mean more it does mean that a change is enveloping it does not mean that it exists a tune is splendor and a turn is that which a mark on the floor does not chasten so much sun is not a sunbeam so much clarity is not stifling surely the representation of an uncherished filling is not more odious than mankind the thought which determines a flight is the firmness of the plant that is not boiling all the time which is of use is that which when the change has the same resemblance as some origin shows no mixture of more capping the necessity is not ungainly and gaining that is what is the obstacle in staging it is no place when the basket is there and baskets have no pink ribbon they have glass a piece of the same is cheaper all the same there is an exceptional use of the point of a resprinkler it does not mean the same as the future there is that quality a pink and that is a flower and smelling a pink and the name is different and has some when there is intonation a pink and the rumor has not spread it is ordinary if so and the opposition is astonishing then surely there is that destruction and no suspicion is more there is a report all the same there is more nervousness than retraction and more in sight than outside and in any case a name is there two of them are the same was the explosion that authority did it succeed more than yesterday was there tomorrow before these are not questions asking they are not existing missing they are so applied that there is no joke there is no pleasure all the same the standard is there and the separation has a position it has no repudiation it has no hurrying centralization it has nothing there if to be there is mentioned then the whole response is the occasion it is and there is more there is no answer there is turning turning is not a victim it has no protection it has no authority it has a receipt time to state and to circle the whole thing to be an island and not water this is the season of fishing and in and by circling there is no surface there is all there is and the time to rain is not the time to station swimming this is no disgrace all the same there is a splendid piece of special soft sour and silk lining there is and there is a mistake an object is not more used than a mixture and surely if the time was chosen it was not there beside the swift selling mother of colored clothing and yet there is no sale and there is a reason there is the reason that anything is the sign of a use and using nothing is not a pointed selection it is more than that it is collecting this does not mean that antiquity is more antiquity it means that the origin of eating is eating and the renewal of the wading is not swimming it does not mean that it means that the time and place and more is so satisfied that there is no place and any place is no vacation and yet that is not so narrow and actual not at all if it were and it is if it were then certainly they would celebrate the result they do not that is to say one does if there is nothing the other does if there is nothing there is that establishment when there is no land and any land that shows the line is that and is one any extra way is the way of speaking there is no use in no more the king or something the public is invited to dance letting me see come together when you can have it higher you mean that lake what was that funny thing you said i am learning to say a break i am learning to say a clutch i am

the answer in the house is that talking is not the same thing as a lamb so that was the way it came to be and the second answer came before the first all the part was distributed and the selection of more was not made before the sight was so particular that any letter had a signature this which is even is not the whole page there is more that is even very much more and any size is larger to beam is not to seem to have an eye that is there and a hair that is colored to beam is not so disturbed that any afternoon is not sooner than the next morning this was so useful and the excuse was not placed in between the hotels it was not placed anywhere this is the date of some days in every week and the morning is before noon so simply and so strangely so much the more advanced so much the more interior and so much more coughing than learning so very much more and yet there is no disappointment not any disappointment the cute way that a certain place is open on sunday and not on tuesday does not mean that an invitation will not be coming not at all there is more chair than standing exhausts so then the whole spring is earlier than february this was so much the tail of the previous setting of the sun and the moon and some of the stars electric lighting is so usual and more weddings are celebrated in the place of thanksgiving a target and a round face a beard that is not whiter the center of it all is that resemblance and surely there is that to pass away and have the same decision surely there is that resemblance and surely the ones standing alone have that copy surely there is the safe persuasion surely there is danger so to move and to faint and to separate the lists together so to lengthen and to shorten and to curve the same direction so to measure every daughter and to lessen every sister and to manage every mother and to sever every brother and to undertake a father and to beam upon a lover so to sing and so to talk and so to change the line together all of this and any show is the way to season nature and to have it all together means the same in every letter this which is not so strange is the more used and in there kindly being a face there is more resemblance than if it were written and then comes the time to look and there it is there is the writing so astonishing is it not when there has been preservation the noise which comes has not any decisive obligation and yet the whole date is just the same so sweet are the singular pleasures of recognition the strength of the place does not mean more than all some have no distaste link the hat and the coat and the collar have the hair and the eyes and the color see the time and the tea and altogether and do not be singular enough and so there is that to view and the single planter has the rest as history he did not tell it in giving it more room than cloth so early is it not saddle the simple sore without a touch of lame despair and do not touch the hair because there is the use of all that pause so sweetly is it true that neatness does not mean the curls are true and yet there is absolutely none absolutely no powder so the place is not used for the tea and the last water is not more boiling than is touchy frown nowhere and do not change that space that is the way to use the time to purchase mining pictures the little darkness and no large lamp all the light being together does not make everything strange please the daylight show the ruins that there is water do not disturb the lamp make more noise than resting and more that is changed is changed and an agreement shows the pink not to be redder all that partial resemblance to a disagreement and a reunion is not more questioned than no answer not any more choice is so determined and yet why is the season so ingrained in the early morning when noon is no later there is always a return of any answer peace and the morning and a show of any evening a reflection and the pleasant state of nature this does make so much debt that there is no name anywhere so pleasing is disaster so ancient is being old enough in the matter bestow a curve in the collapse and there is no withdrawal and that which is secure has some way of preserving any walking all the time has a finished undertrimming and so there has the approach to a lingering printing to place an eye to set the corner to make a blessing and to search a mansion to persuade the noon and to establish harmony the cause that is the mention is not more pained than anything so then there is a memory there is a stone home there is no weakness clearly and a gem singly and all four the stem the stone the happy way the single blessing of the longing soon the patent habit of the leaving of the room all this and no white light is not more dim than every candle and many of them make the illumination gentler they dwindle in large they season the sun they blossom the churn they bestow in a plant this was no sprain this was the regal pin a broom and a window both of them uttered are so plain that there is more space and very much more hurry and yet there is a change of address this is written so clannily there will not be when the envelope is larger the same union is stronger an afternoon is weaker that was the time and then in the evening there is dinner and later any time later there is more than one corner there is a fire there is that there is no pleasant place in more fire then came that which pushed away a piano then came that and there was a whole collection the question was not detained there was that to do and arranging is done by separation this is yellow and brown is a color peace is rested when it is occupied if the three are one they do not have voices that means no more than that all of them are four more is not regulated and yet there is an introduction there are degrees there is past pressing there is the change of a pudding all is not any meddling of a mess and the keen lump is not shadowed by any sun plant the union of a question later all the time has that change the pink length and the satin fixture this does not make any question uncertain a question if there is no answer is a question where there is no answer to place more is always a way put the partial pleasure in place and do not see more than the town if the town escapes and sees a building it will be satisfied it is when the speed is there and there is pink color there is a pale pink there is a color all the two baskets and the little apples and any that are the same size in measure have so much hidden that is not paper so very much and they think out of sight they do so plaintive and so careful and so many little spaces and so largely all the time and so pointed and so half and the whole which is there has the other side of pinning and the time to have the rest is not what there is to leave a vacation is not needed a bundle is not needed a precise result of more than an example is not so different when the division is the same kindle the blame when the refuge is in water express that excitement when the paint is there to fade see no more and love the rest all the tender part is running all the liquid taste is temperate all the time and there is that all the time has only water this is not the only haste there is so much of it lonely water never has so much that a little more is water no kind lady has the time no sweet trough is lingering longer any two who see the same time are the ones who do not expectorate and this does not mean it is habit it means no more than that sometime is included when there is no time to place pottery certainly there is a trifle any one knows what there is when there is all the table that does not mean that there is a collection that does not mean more than the place pounded not any single little piece of the red makes a yellow color and yellow is more so than anything so reasoning are they and they conclude a bottle not so sweetly as a bottle not so sweetly anywhere to see longingly and sharply indicates a predisposition if there is a memory there is no use suggesting offending pleasant and an interval which is empty and there is no empty way to begin again this which makes an appetite larger does make travelling easy all the account and most of the account is not kept where there is more lightness than there is home it says more and it does mean that it certainly does so then there is a shade of the pleasure of sensible exclamation there is there is the beaming oak and the spending of more money and then the answer the whole answer does that mean that the occasion is furnished or does it mean that no auction has any circle what is it like it is like the whole reliable point which has no measure it is the pressed leaf and there is not anything that shows what is obliging nothing at all and more organs and a little light and so much blending of an industry all that does not lead to a margin it does it has the practice and the music it has no more bent wood than any train that is not burning it has not it does make a joy looking in the face of eyes means the strangest elephant looking in the same set teeth means the presence of a seat all the talk and all the light means the same result of voice and a solid substance then means a tear and then a tear choose the money when there is more result and all the plainer staying for the evening this means that what is curious has more shortness than speech and more hope than dangling surely the section is mended and the change has not been made surely the name has been mentioned he has it he is the son and the mother he has it there is no darker brother he has it he has it and the length is not poisoned he is the ample special principal protector he sells it cheaper he does not deny a shorter letter he does see the revival of unison he does decline a match he does entitle that he which is the sense man in the timely story he and the weaker is fonder he is the praised and the praiser he does not speak the waiting the weaker he does speak when there is a specimen rejoinder he does play more pastry than the teatime he is there for dinner he does not steam anyway he has the state he has the craning care to endure he is not more particular he is so tender he is the link and left light the same season makes the moon strange the same sun light is october the same piling of the single glass stamp makes no monotony there is no rejoinder the end is in the great division between the counting and the bloom of passing a glass covering if it were left and in a way it was left if it were left then the meaning would be that there was hope and hope which is active does direct that there is some one to stay there and say it and doing so why should it determine a passage it should when it should and there is more there then certainly all of them are the same that is to say there is a difference any difference is greater roche was one who certainly was one really being living was this one a complete one did that one completely have it to do very well something that that one certainly would be doing if that one could be doing something yes that one was in a way a complete one certainly he was one completely listening was that one one completely listening was that one completely listening and certainly it was a pleasant thing if this one was one completely listening and certainly this one was completely listening and certainly it was a pleasant thing having this one listening and certainly if this one were one being one really completely listening it would then certainly be a completely pleasant thing was this one a complete one certainly this one was one being living this one was one certainly going to be quite beautifully doing something if this one really did this thing and certainly this one would be sometime doing this completely beautiful thing if this one is really a complete one this one certainly is not one who is weakening who is not continuing well in working this one certainly is not at all a weak one that is certain this one is certainly feeling in being one being living this one is certainly an honest one and it is certainly a pleasant thing to have this one listening certainly this one does not do very much talking certainly this one is liking very well to be knowing what any one doing anything is doing in what way any one doing anything is doing that thing this one is one certainly loving doing a good deal of loving certainly this one has been completely excited by such a thing certainly this one had been completely dreaming about such a thing certainly this one is one who would be very pleasant to very many in loving this one is perhaps one who is perhaps to be sometime a complete one this one is perhaps one who is perhaps not to be ever a complete one this one certainly was often listening and this was then certainly a very pleasant thing this one was perhaps one completely listening certainly this one was one who was listening and it was then a very pleasant thing certainly if this one were one completely listening it would be then a completely pleasant thing this one certainly would be doing a very beautiful thing if this one did do that beautiful thing this one would certainly be steadily working to be doing that beautiful thing this one would certainly not be slackening not be stopping going on working not be weakening in working in making that beautiful thing this one would be making that beautiful thing if this one were making that beautiful thing it would be a very satisfying thing this one would certainly be one completely making a beautiful thing if this one did make a beautiful thing this one was not a weak man this man was not an unsteady man this man was not an aspiring man this man was one certainly going to be making a beautiful thing if he did make a beautiful thing this one certainly was listening and this was a very pleasant thing this one was certainly one going to be doing a beautiful thing if this one is one who is a complete one this one is certainly one to be doing a beautiful thing if this one is going to be doing that thing it is not disturbing to be wondering about this one going to be doing the beautiful thing not really disturbing to that one not really disturbing to any one this one is steadily working this one is listening and that is a pleasant thing if this one were complete in listening that would be a completely pleasant thing this one certainly is one steadily working to be doing a beautiful thing this one certainly will be doing a beautiful thing if this one does that beautiful thing this one is very nearly completely needing to be knowing what any one is doing who is doing something how any one who is doing something is doing that thing certainly if this one is one really completely listening and certainly perhaps this one is one completely listening then that is a completely pleasant thing braque cap and corn auditor interest and exertion aim and audience interest and earnest and outset inside in inside alarm no sun alarm is thinking alarming is determination an earth wide moth is something price in curving is weeding there is an undetermined super division there is the percolating bread stuff the window is thickening alarm no alarm is standing and holding something no alarm has a perpendicular position no alarm is in that position an alarm which is not a choice shows the necessity of good nature it shows and the tune which is on any wind the same that tune is the organization it has a place it is a circle and this which is not guarded is not soft it is softening it being soft breaking is something and what is round is not widening it is particular and so much more than the saving of an elimination practice is particular it is recognition silence is not hurt by attending to taking more reflection than a whole sentence and it is said and the quotation is reasoning it gives the whole preceding if there is time enough then appearances are considerable there are in a circle they are tendering a circle they are a tender circle they are tenderly a circle this was not past a future if the speck is plain and the tail is there tail is made of hair that makes that any one is no tailor the curtain is not made of wood and a candle is placed in a candlestick and the whole the very whole there is no robbery if the pet is whole and the juice is so serene then the salt is pure and there is pepper in between the harness which is on the stake is used to rubbing on a wheel there is the complete absence of all reason for an excuse the time has the wealth of a separation the season is not that of baking brack and neuresthenia and lean talk with a marvel and make a spittoon clear with a mixing in a mustache the sense is in that pie is not peeling and the date and the poison and the cake when the pan is a shape is not minus all the practice the time is not filling brack brack is the one who put up the hooks and held the things up and ate his dinner he is the one who did more he used his time and felt more much more and came before when he came after he did not resemble anything more the time and place of a corner is no convenience if it has not been filled none at all and if it is filled then there is a resemblance there is some resemblance do not celebrate what is hearty and surely there is no danger in expecting a strong summer if the place is shown to be damp there is no use in that excuse anyway there is no time to rise together they cannot sit in a seat the time came when there was no occasion for geography this did not mean that there was a change of place it meant that there was a change of influence this change was understood it was no wonder in understanding the whole thing of precomposition there was no more light than sweetness there was no more size than bulk there was no more load than a caravan there was no mingling of unison the time did not come any more and then the simple way was celebrated by causation and the charge was sweetening that is to say there was a round mass powder is not brown the color does not show in the mixture in curving and not lengthening the disposition there is no meeker feather to show the wave to be cultivated and to show the suspension of a razor the light does shine directly it shines and it darkens another it does not shine and destroy the connector it does not shine in a color it does not make a brown tender brown is tender that is no trouble and no appetite it follows that when the time is separated that the sacrifice is not the same as when the conversation is sensible and it is sensible to discuss carving and oaktrees and the season and to be disturbed by a mountain and to argue when there is no desertion it is sensible and to be present is enough to separate the future if it comes to happen that there is no eraser then certainly there is no cause why there should be this is the reason the best shape is that which is pasted without paper at any rate the paper is not white and brown it is brown and it is black and white and colored the time is not replaced by indicating the reason it will there be resplendent travelling this is not a question because that is not an answer the time which was put to some place was that is so well placed the question is is there travelling there is no question as to if there is travelling where which showed solemnity in not turning in turning this was so put that certainly not any more reception could be astonishing to pass away to choose some away to object to abhor that and to be not triumphant this is not the splendor of a single standard this is the solemn reverberation of an enlarged and of a small masterpiece the way of the man and the way of the lamp and the way of shining and the way of settling all this is in accord with the devastation and destruction which resembling is not disturbing motion this comes so soon that talking is ennobling this which is is what comes that coming is what is come and can come coming it comes and is come and there is some mingling and there is more willing than there was when the coming came to suggest and disturb and reassure reason a lane is not a hill and a hill is a descent to explain this it is necessary to practice mending and disturbing and relating the time to go is not more arranged than the roundness which makes for beauty and to be round is not what there is to height the time when selection is vacation is when the perfection is so replaced that there is a premonition this does make baking so easy and at the same time there is no separation and no disgrace not even desertion this comes to be so told that any appearance is regal so then there is no announcement a little seat which is not low is not more elevated than a little seat which is low and high there is no space for more than there is room for this makes no demand on conscience this makes no demand on anything this does not alter an exhibition the reason that there is no alteration is that in separating spaces they come to show that there is the same space between that there is there where there is the place which is it in it this shows that there is nothing so clearly shown by the whole exposition it does show it it shows the extension of the resemblance and the unification of the differentiation and the extension of the interval and the inhibition of the retention of acceleration this does show no more than is individual and yet there is no train that does not go in that direction and to return is not passing that way returning is not vagabonding it is a spacious interception the use of the spread of the arrangement between that and that is not so wide that there are no spaces there are spaces they can repose so they do call whiteness no wonder they do not shudder together there is no example in a relation there is none in saving spacing a capable curtain is not used and the meaning of this is that protection on both sides is protection everywhere the band played longer so much sorrow in winter and so much sadness in summer so much nervousness in the country and so much disturbance in the city so much counting with a letter and so much writing with no electrician so much piano color and so much musical permission so much steadiness in circling and so much singleness in searching so much bloom in labeling and so much secrecy in enlightening so much saving in abandoning and so much steadying in remaining all this and no more so much and not often all this and no moment when a monument is not mind and munificent no time and sweetness and no escape and separation all this and no obliging desperation all this and the same moment in particular and if it were in not passing all and no one never to be satisfied in signalling no more and the choice is absent there is a season in the right there is a sanction in the left there is a presence in the center there is an upheaval in the distant circumference there is a resonance in the special curve there is a susceptibility in the unperspiring relation all this nightly and some daily and weakly and more yearly and not certainly and not reducingly to be raised and to be so respected that there is no doubt that the lines that are turning are the lines that are turning to be so respected that talking is not continuous and the presence of nothing is more selected to be so raised is not an expectation it is capable of calming there has been no doubt there has not been any doubt there is not being any surface and there is not that there then the strong hold is the mildness of the salutation of the metropolitan this is not obligatory and it is not capable neither is it casual the mint is not where there is no building it is not any this is never a surprise it is never a surprise because when the whole thing is considered and the whole thing when it is considered has that beginning when it is put where there is no selection it is then not made noticeable to be noticeable is not declared in declaring it there is no speech in not keeping on talking there is no silence this is not heard louder and there is no doubt there will not be that doubt the capacity which makes the size that has that meaning have that meaning that is what has the sensitiveness which does not make anticipation there is reality in that there is touching morning and in touching morning there is no course there is all there inclines to be the freedom which has no ornament is not spilled and this does not mean anything not lively it certainly does not mean an extra the practice of no pronoun is not audacious there is no prize in a pocket there is none there and the circle having a separation makes all that which is not the same similar it does not make it a circle a circle has no pleasure it is not encircled and there is this to say that the white and black are brown portrait of prince b d a space is not spent it is not used it is similar it is represented this shows no more than a latitude which running through the center makes the surrounding the space is not placed it is presented that is the relation of the similar settlement to settle upon and to settle under shows more than the similar circle it shows the degree which makes more similarity than that it sinks higher and there is no roar the section and there is a section the section means that penetration resembles distance it supplies the drop and it selects no sightless system the incident that succumbs is the one that is early the lateness is not tending to define a definite darkness it does not shine and since that time there is a large light the western windless is not the same as the white wind the white wind has no poise there is a diamond a diamond is a treasure if a treasure is that color then there is a resemblance a trade between the one who has a hat and one who has a hat is such that there is no hiatus the one who has had a hat is the one who adds that the one who is the one that has that is that one adding that thing no neglecting and adding no single safety silent disturbing no neglect and no glass is there to pass away and stay it sees the solid sight and that which is not bright is white that which is single is resembling and so it comes that when there is a show a way to pass into the recent glow means more fire a fine color is red and green and purple and rose and yellow a fine color resembles the continuation any fine color is in a glass a glass to resist must be a glass to pass this shows no shadow this shows no scratch a change is measured a card is unmeasured there is a return of much more stupor is not in winning a climate it is lost in the remembrance of poisoning the list of a result in stretching a building does not make any mark the wheel is there the trend is not behind a back it is in the window of a fenestra the blending is distinct interspreading this is not the measure of wind the return is not so it is occupied the rest is arisen there is no height if there is there is wind there is wind height shrinks below and settlement is not soluble the erection of yellow is no violence the five are won single same purple blue circle the last which section has the reverse resemblance has no moment and there is a tendency which in the rising of the setting sun means new arising to shine and whine to shatter and shrink to collect and settle to stir and suck to lose violence and select simultaneity to see that the whole exception is not arrested and to satiate the lines of resemblance this and no more is underdone the public and pilot all the shining land and the wind and no neglect all this does not mean that there is no denial it has been there the same result of no intended excavation it has been there and that exception planted no resemblance has a moment none and the illustration is planted and the time is placed so then there is no secret a secret means that when there is a thing there is nothing and if there is nothing then there is no addition a sum is not sacrificed handing a lizard to any one is a green thing receiving a curtain the change is not present and the sensible way to have agony is not precautious then the shirting is extreme and there is a lilac smell and no ginger halt and suggest a leaf which has no circle and no singular center this has that show and does judge that there is a need of moving toward the equal height of a hot sinking center and surface then there is a space then there is exception then there is no reason why a pound should be smaller and all the time there is the courage and the mint and the repeating result that surely if there has been a change there has not been a fire surely a fire is famous and a famous fire is in the fire surely no more special spending shows anything and yet if there is no wind there is no haste and if there is no haste why is twenty older than thirty and thirty older than twentyeight why is it and why is there no mistake there is no mistake because there is the time and the accusation is indented and this makes enough so that clouding does not make a cemetery a surprise is not in sight this is the sentence present there is no danger and the silent height is so high that sound rises higher this does not make sound infamous it does not shatter a conclusion nothing is hollow in water nothing is high in air nothing is louder and nothing is perpendicular the establishment is thorough a chance shows a bright blue sound a chance is the same wind out of a window a persian kitten is a purring kitten the safety that comes is so gathered that there can be news one oak and more oaks and the training of water this means that a color attracts a signal it means that the result of a certain well is seen by there being no extra example of a kind of closet in the beginning when there is no rising and resisting and letting a singular section of the whole rise together in the beginning the imparting actual relation to a time of surfaces does show that there is an origin of originating in showing this there is no repair there is a whole half of a turtle and the presence of more is not rope it is not and certainly is so wise that fever is fainting this is this then there is that and the singular example is not predicted by resting in more contraction not very and what is then to be extending is the whole place with filling filling is not spreading the size is not that it is not proportioned to the moon and the lantern it is fully proportioned together and aroused and interested this made no measure and no misery and no murder there is no acute trimming nor trembling so then there is that thing this is not that silent thing this is not the thing that is anything this is the thing that is that thing a large moist blue and a paler color a large dust rose and no water nearer a small tall frame and no building finer this makes a prediction that necessity is work and then why is there no question there is no question because investigation is miraculous mrs whitehead but you like it they cant any of them be quite as bad because they learned french but i never did he doesnt look dead at all the wind might have blown him he comes from that direction thats the way they are not knotted have you smelt it what

family living and that that family living was one that any one could be one not have been having if they were to be one being one not thinking about being one having been having family living she was

feeling in thinking in being a full one if they move in the shoe there is everything to do they do not move in the shoe the language of education is not replacing the special position that is the expression of the emanation of evil there is an expression when contemplation is not connecting the object that is in position with the forehead that is returning looking it is not overpowering that is a cruel description the memory is the same and surely the one who is not older is not dead yet although if he has been blind he is seeing this has not any meaning oh the bells that are the same are not stirring and the languid grace is not out of place and the older fur is disappearing there is not such an end if it had happened that the little flower was larger and the white color was deeper and the silent light was darker and the passsage was rougher it would have been as it was and the triumph was in the place where the light was bright and the beauty was not losing having that possession that was not what was tenderly this was the piece of the health that was strange when there was the disappearance that had not any origin the darkness was not the same there was the writing and the preparation that was pleasing and succeeding and being enterprising it was not subdued when there was discussion it was done where there was the room that was not a dream this is all to prepare the way that is not the way to like anything that in speaking is telling what has come that like a swelling is inside when there is yellowing there is that liking that does not shape the way to say that there is not anywhere anything that is resembling perfection is not adulteration there is the substance that has not any defect if the program is not despondent and it has that substance then certainly the beginning is the tender blessing that unfolding is not subduing there is that presentment and the quiet is not so sound but that there can be a change of origin there can be that elevation this is not an argument there is the work that has that place and there is a garden a little taller bending does not haste the erection of the grotto that has a fountain that is so soon to pardon that is to have seen that there was a long way to stare when the heat was the same as there was when the voices were together this was the temptation and so solidly was there when there was there that the whole reception was not filled with more than all every day who had come anywhere and had heard that there was this did not mean more than all it meant all and the result of the precious and precise way was that there was that preparation and not the disintegration when there was that distinct evolution there could be the same if any one was certain that there is not any evolution this does not make the tedium that is eternal so particular that listening is a blessing this does not disguise a flower come in and that expression is not that one of waiting to use a name is not the time that seeing has not been this is discussion this is obligation this is the composition oh sadly has the oaktree not that sadness it has not the particular reason it has not that digression it has not that penetration it has that piece that is there where there is all that remains when everything remains nothing is all old that is not the redoubtable repudiation that has that precious meaning when the hindrance has not that little pain which is not the same as the passing out of what is not about when it is there where there is no care to say that anything is better everything has that description that is not reorganization the way to say that they went away is the way that the passage has come to be adhered this is not the token that shows the steering that is not broken the plea is not that the arabesque has that meaning when the whole thing is exposed the meaning is that the precious picture is the bargain that has not met the ancient day when there is everything to say the light is finer that is not that discrimination that is the way to have that to keep where there is not any interdiction she had that name that was the origin of the penguin that was not that bird and because the strong man is the warder when the little ones are sounder so the particular ticket is not limited when there is not the best establishment where all the black and white show that it is a blessing when there has been falling the heavy way to stay where the regard is what is not all that distance the breaking of the tame show is not the way to glow because the waste is not there it is not any where mark the data that tells the merit of having that time to state that not to wait is to say that the door has not been entered if to wait marks the place where the entrance if it is made comes to be approached then to do what is not done is to do all that and carefully that which is solid does not fill the space that is not a disclosure that is not the way for all of them who are looking to refuse to see that is not at all any such way it is not a pleasure to be the one when there is the whole of it all and when there where there is no separation there is weeping quite ostentation completion not any compensation where there is the softening of the published soap this is not that decree there is no failure there is no condition of incision particle of all the color is that which is not white and the black which is open is not older when the time has come back for black to be younger the meaning of this is that why the difference is always louder is that that which is above that which is all there is and there is much is that there is all that there has that reason to be which is the reason that is all certain and this which is not mentioned and which does not make that which is lost is the same and has the detail which does not make any escaping remain separate this does adjoin all and all is enough so that the whole which is not parted has not the place where sticking makes anything that is wet dry this has not that mistake when softness is union the first time winning distinction is discretion and all who are going are the three who have not that distraction they have not all the hardihood they are not separated the two who are not older are not remaining to be interesting they are not undertaking any beginning excellent is the same union breathless is not the shade when the opening is not limiting they did not seem in that place that was any end she if three are eager and plainer and having a full temper and if all of them unite in that happy way that makes a garden give the way to be there where there is a way if there is the last time and a young time is a stolen beauty then the way it has been said that the white flower has not been bled is the way to remember that decision is not the same as crumpling a parting she did not animate what was mechanical she has not this to do they they were the three and they were not employed in looking they had not every union when they had that education to be they and then not be away is not the time and place that makes the whole expression because after all when there is the time and the place and when they are they they are not away and that does not make any more if they were there they had the time to see which way was older and when they did not feel that stain they had the time to address what they did address when they would address one another they did not all listen no silence there was not that hesitation and this was not all there was when the sounds were not so loud but that they might be hearing they had the quiet and surely if they taught that they were each one not all of any other this was not the half of all the time it took a separate ticket all the time that there was all the winning of all the wonder that was not under the weather was not passing as the exchange was not lessening the older was not newer they had the same description this does not mean that if there are all three to learn that not any one is there but they have any way to say that not to go away is to stay they were equal to enough so that all the separation made them remain they had so much excess it was not the only smile the smile that did not come to face the pleasure of there being three and the three were not there to gather together one if the way to learn is to have that presence then certainly the changes did not balance the description she had that which was not alarming two if the habit of saying all the education is the development of that expression then certainly if there is being pleasant all can be there to not expect that measure of all who are together three the one who is a sun is the last flower that is not open when all the petals falling feel the whole of all intention so there are then what is not what will not have been when all the seeing that is and is not seen is had and has been having having and having had and meaning that is some intention and all is enough to complete all the whole the delay was not that which separated that separation from the time when all the ones who said something said every thing it was not so in place the change there was not any time and all there was was reason there was all that and if there were all there were there were the ones there were that which was pleasing was not all there was if there was all there was of that consideration certainly the time was not the present and past flavor and the time was not the future and the present presentation there was all there and sincerely did the biting that was not bit fill out the strength and explanation it did not furnish the intention it did not succeed when there was all that care this which did not escape was not the narrow connection that can make a larger blossom and make it take the sea where the ocean is larger and the ships are quicker the pleasure is the same to face that way to face the way that each one does say that they have any day which is clearly not away is to say that the time is not there when the color is not lighter and the hair is not redder this does not make all there is of any invitation there is not anything of any such suggestion if the practice of the present and the practice of the past and there is any practice and the practice of the future then latterly there is not any change if the way to say the turn is the turn the way that is the way to turn that way then all of the thing is in that thing there has been all of that painstaking awhile while there is no band awhile while the train is late awhile while the town is full awhile while the sounds have the tone awhile there is a settled waste and this is not to say that anything that is given away is given away nothing is wasted that is not given away and anything that is given away is wasted the appearance is not the only way to say that what is given away is wasted and nothing is given away it is so remained that which is not tiring and that which is not aiding any of that which is not needing tiring that was the sampler and there was not the sewing which was using any corner that did not need the same width as all that is solid is using which is not wider that which is solid is all that is wider and the rest is not that which has that passing odor which is not passing it does not pass anything it is not the only primrose it has the sentence that in placing what is not that care has all that is which is all there where any more care is most care there where the time is not cruel is the place where the time is what is filling the half and the whole and no passage that has that intention can be intended when that which is solid is not building every house all houses are open that is to say a door and a window and a table and the waiter make the shadow smaller and the shadow which is larger is not flickering a poem about waldberg what i am afraid of is that they

water would make desert and even prunes it would make nothing throw any shade because after all is there not more practical humor in a series of photographs and also in a treacherous scupture any

three two a cut a cut is not a slice what is the occasion for representing a cut and a slice what is the occasion for all that a cut is a slice a cut is the same slice the reason that a cut is a slice is that if there is no hurry any time is just as useful four a cut and a slice is there any question when a cut and a slice are just the same a cut and a slice has no particular exchange it has such a strange exception to all that which is different a cut and only slice only a cut and only a slice the remains of a taste may remain and tasting is accurate a cut and an occasion a slice and a substitute a single hurry and a circumstance that shows that all this is so reasonable when every thing is clear one all alone with the best reception all alone with more than the best reception all alone with a paragraph and something that is worth something worth almost anything worth the best example there is of a little occasional archbishop this which is so clean is precious little when

it were not for a delicate blue color would there be any reason for every one to differ the objection and the perfect central table the sorrow in borrowing and the hurry in a nervous feeling the question is it really a plague is it really an oleander is it really saffron in color the surmountable appetite which shows inclination to be warmer the safety in a match and the safety in a little

a single regret makes a door way what is a door way a door way is a photograph what is a photograph a photograph is a sight and a sight is always a sight of something very likely there is a photograph

the returning butter fly and the yellow weed and even tumbling the habit which made a well choose the bottom and refuses all chances to change the habit that cut in two whatever was for the use of the same number the habit which credited a long touch with raising the table and the hour glass and even eye glasses and plenty of milk the habit which made a little piece of cheese wholesome and darkness

successful in being living the younger one was successful in being living the older one came to be certain that she was not successful in being living that she was not succeeding in living she came to be certain that the younger one would have been successful in living if the older one had not been one protecting the younger one from knowing this thing the older one came to be certain that she had been successful in living that she would not be succeeding in living the older one came to be certain that the younger one would not really be succeeding in living the younger one came to be certain that the older one could have been succeeding in living the younger one came to be certain that the older one would not be succeeding in living the younger one came to be certain that she could be succeeding in living the younger one came to be certain that it would not be an easy thing to keep on being succeeding in living the younger came to be certain that the older one never had been

not ever married this is quite common not being married the older sister was one whom some were certain could have been married very often certainly if she had been a little different she might have been married again and again certainly she was never married certainly she was not needing that thing needing being married needing being married again and again she certainly was talking about any such thing talking very often about any such thing about any being married about any being married again and again she certainly was one knowing very many men certainly very many men liked this woman certainly she was talking about this thing about being married very often certainly she was very often talking about this thing certainly she was not ever completely needing this thing needing marrying she certainly was not ever completely needing marrying again and again she was never a married one she was not ever completely needing this thing certainly she could think again and again of this thing of marrying she certainly did think about this thing about marrying she certainly did talk about marrying again and again she certainly did feel something about this thing about marrying again and again the younger sister was never married and she might sometime have come to be married and she did not come at any time to be married she was never married she might talk about this thing about marrying she might feel something about this thing about marrying she might completely need this thing need being married she might have come to be a married one she did not come to be a married one her sister was not ever certain that she would come to be a married one that she would not come to be a married one her sister was not certain about either of them that they would never come to be married ones they were never married neither the one nor the other and certainly each one of them knew this thing that neither one of them had come to be a married one certainly the older one had done something and certainly every one was content to tell about this thing about her having done something and being one every one knowing her was remembering as having been one doing something she certainly had done something and certainly any one knowing her remembered that thing remembered that she was one having done something she was one going on doing that thing and certainly every one knowing her knew that thing knew that she was going on doing that thing she was one having done something and doing that thing and certainly any one knowing her remembered that thing it was a natural thing to remember that thing any one every one remembered that thing she was one doing something and certainly in a way she was not getting old in doing that thing and certainly in a way she was completely old in doing that thing she was not doing that thing she was so old in doing that thing in a way she was not old in doing that thing in doing anything and certainly then she was completely old and not really to any one doing that thing she was not old in doing that thing that is to say she was doing that thing that is to say if not anything had been changing she would not have been old in doing that thing in a way somethings are not changing and so in a way she was not old in doing that thing certainly to those being then doing that thing and not being old then anything is a changed thing and certainly then she was old in doing that thing she was not old in being living that is to say as not anything is changing she was completely not old in being living she was pretty nearly old in being living that is to say she was not young in being living that is to say some were old in being living and she was talking to them and they were understanding and some were young in being living and they were telling something and she was certain they were not telling any such thing she certainly was not old in being living she certainly was not young in being living the younger one was certainly not an old one she certainly was not such a young one in a way she was certainly a young one and certainly she was such a one in not hearing some things and in telling some things and certainly this did not astonish any one and was a natural thing and certainly she was not then a young one she was an older one and she was certain of this thing and this was not an astonishing thing to any one and not to her sister who was not astonished at her being a younger one at her being an older one but was certainly hoping to have had this thing happening that the younger one would have been going on being a younger one and being an older one and not be remembering anything of any such thing certainly the younger one came to be one almost liking to be remembering something and then again she certainly came to be quite tired of doing this thing of remembering anything of remembering being an older one and remembering being a younger one and then she came to going on being one remembering being an older one she was then remembering being a younger one certainly she came to be remembering pretty nearly everything and to going on in this thing keeping going on in this thing steadily enough going on in this thing they could both of them they did both of them they would either of them know that they were ones having been together and they were ones having been alone the older one certainly was one having been alone being alone going to be alone and certainly this thing was something that she was certain she was completely needing was something she was certain she was completely regretting was something that certainly she was one certain she could be feeling and certainly she was feeling this thing and certainly she would be one having been feeling this thing and certainly she could never be not feeling that this was something that was a thing she was needing she was regretting in which she was suffering in which she was glorying in which she was believing in which she was despairing in which and by which she was really being living the younger one was alone and not feeling about this thing that it was an important thing she was feeling about this thing that it was a thing that she was needing to be changing the older one was quite certain that the younger would never be changing anything the younger one was not certain whether she would or whether she would not be changing anything but this was not to be an important thing the important thing for her was to be one living where she wanted to be living and to be working if she needed to be working certainly her sister was one to whom any such thing was an important thing and so the younger one did not tell her sister anything about this thing until she had changed everything that is gone to where she wanted to and working because she had to so each of them were ones being not living with any one and certainly the older one had that then as an important thing in being one being living certainly any one could know that having been being living was an interesting thing in knowing the older one any one could know this thing could know that the older one had been one being

satisfied to live in belmont in a large house with a view and plenty of flowers and neighbors neighbors who were cousins and some friends who did not say anything this is what happened she expressed everything she is worthy of signing a will and mentioning what she wished she was brought up by her mother she had meaning and she was careful in reading she read marvelously she was pleased she was aged thirtynine she was flavored by reason of much memory and recollection this is everything foreword i cannot believe it i cannot realize it i cannot see it it is what happened first there was a wonder really wonder wonder by means of what wonder by means of measures measuring what heights how high a little this was not all there were well if you like there were wonderful spots such as were seen by a queen this came to be a system really it was just by a treasure what was a treasure apart from that surely rather in their beginning what was a delight not signing papers or anything or indeed in having a mother and two sisters not nearly enough were mentioned by telegraphing it was a choice i ramble when i mention it did she leave me any money i remember something i am not clear about what it was when did i settle that i settled it yesterday early life they were not miserably young they were older than another she was gliding it is by nearly weekly leaning that it comes to be exact it never was in dispute they were gayly not gaily gorgeous they were not gorgeous at all they were obliging if you think so if you think so glow if you believe in light boys they were never another it came to be seen that any beam of three rooms was not showy they were proud to sit at mother slowly walking makes walking quicker they have toys and not that in deceiving they do not deceive them no one is willing no one could be cool and mother and divided and necessary and climatical and of origin and beneath that mean and be a sun it was strange in her cheek not strange to them or that a young one not by mountains not by oysters not by hearing not by round ways not by circumference again not by leaving luncheon not by birth it doesnt make any difference when ten are born ten is never a number neither is six neither is four i will not mention it again early days of shading make a mouse in green make a single piece of sun and make a violet bloom early piece of swimming makes a sun on time and makes it shine and warm today and sun and sun and not to stay and not to stay or away not to stay satin out from the whole wide world he chose her out from the whole wide world and that is what is said family what is famine it is plenty of another what is famine it is eating what is famine it is carving why is carving a wonderful thing because supper is over this can happen again sums are seen please be polite for mother lives of them call it shall it clothe it boil it why not color it black and never red or green this is stubborn i dont say so no opposition if you had a little likeness and hoped for more terror if you had a refusal and were slender if you had cuffbuttons and jackets and really astonishing kinds of fever would you stop talking would you not consider it necessary to talk over affairs it was a chance that made them never miss tea they did not miss it because it was there they did not mean to be particular they invited their friends they were not aching it was noiseless and beside that they were clever who was clever the way they had of seeing mother mother was prepared they were caressing they had sound sense they were questioned they had likeness likeness to what likeness to loving who had likeness to loving they had likeness to loving why did they have a likeness to loving they had a likeness to loving because it was easily seen that they were immeasurable they were fixed by that they were fixed not licensed they were seen not treasured they were announced not restless they were reasoning not progressing i do not wish to imply that there is any remedy for any defect i cannot state that anyone was disappointed i cannot state that any one was ever disappointed by willingly heaping much confusion in particular places no confusion is reasonable anybody can be nervous they were nervous again this is wishing why is wishing related to a ridiculous pretence of changing opposition to analysis the answer to this is that nearly any one can faint i dont mean to say that they dont like tennis please be capable of sounds and shoulders please be capable of careful words please be capable of meaning to measure further they measured there they were heroes nobody believed papers everybody believed colors i cannot exercise obligation i cannot believe cheating i cannot sober mother i cannot shut my heart i cannot cherish vice i cannot deceive all i cannot be odious i cannot see between between what and most i cannot answer either do be left over suddenly this is not advice no one knows so well what widening means it means that yards are yards and so many of them are perfect by that i mean i know this is not so i am not telling the story i am repeating what i have been reading what effects tenderness not to remember the name say it the time comes when it is natural to realize that solid advantages connect themselves with pages of extreme expression this is never nervously pale it is finely and authentically swollen by the time there is any rapid shouting i do not like the word shouting i do not mean that it gives me any pleasure on the contrary i see that individual annoyances are increased by it but nevertheless i am earnestly persuasive concerning it why soothe why soothe each other this is not at all what is being said it happened very simply that they were married they were naturally married and really the place to see it was in the reflection every one had of not frightening not the least bit frightening enthusiasm they were so exact and by nearly every one it was encouraged soothed and lamented i do not say that they were interested any years are early years and all years are occasions for recalling that she promised me something this is the way to write an address when they were engaged she said we are happy when they were married she said we are happy they talked about everything they talked about individual feeling this is not what was said they did not talk about disinterested obligation they did not talk about pleasantness and circumstances i do not mean to say that there was conversation i do not organize a revision i declare that there was no need of criticism that there was no criticism that there was breathing by that i mean that lights have lanterns and are not huddled together when there is a low ceiling by that i mean that it was separate the ceiling was separated from the floor everywhere i could say that devotion was more merited than walking together what do you mean i mean that we all saw it when not by a beginning is there meadows and

near silk in times of peace in times of peace prepare meals this is what was said to us but we do not believe we wait we come in that way we feel and is it useless it is not useless saturday statuatory in that case in that case what are you satisfied certainly with me then we have the use of it indeed yes we are agreed in the case of mothers aunt pauline how did you pronounce it it was in doubt in this way we mention this this is the story of it he was her uncle and nervous in their way they had a black police dog in his way he had neither relief nor expeditions in this thing he was not patient if they gave him the money to clean the gutters need they shut the tobacco shops you dont understand that if they gave him money for the cleaning of city pipes need he have orders to close butchers we can understand the universal this is universal what is the difference between one order and a reading a great many read in a park words question it bakeries threaten it but really hotels receive it do we hear about books do we and catalogues and catalogues farmers for speech a great many vines are said to be sold in france and in wealthy homes too we do not understand the weather that astonishes me can you think of me confess it confess it weather burns and in that case there is plenty of sausage can you think of me at in all cases keep afraid and then what happens nothing are you sure nothing of course not you are not just saying it you know you have your wish thank you in smiles then we see very well you did not mean to say so no but i know i am right you always are this is a paragraph then it will be well yes and a fit you mean fitly yes slowly and then no worry not at all thank you for saying that many cases are fine in that way we wish we think we recover in that way we swim camelias finish when roses begin let me tell you about this we were disappointed in cards and yet we need not be we will have them in the beginning pinks you mean flowers yes smell and pansies too sacred heart pansies these are the best can we wonder about cookies not those that have no flour sacred heart doughnuts pansies i said camelias camelias i do not care to mention it again i do it

then they were please spell a dish i do not like called a flower repeat cuckoo she always makes a mistake in french castle anew and then the sister can you feel a home when i see it see it with them and then a pansy i did not ask for it it smells a sweet smell with acacia call it locusts call it me barrels in comparison what are horses compared with that again what are bells you mean horns no i mean noises in leaning can we encounter oil i meant this to be intelligible we were taking a trip we found the roads not noisy but pleasurable and the shade there was pleasant we found that the trees had been planted so as to make rows this is almost universal in coming to a village we ask them can they come to see us we mean near enough to talk and then we ask them how do we go there this is not fanciful in advance we have spoken of what can you imagine obedience as a subject it is it is laughable when there is no need of any backing can you understand that in two ways we mean to be lean lean to me and then what a girl no girl and emil we like fresh cooking so does anybody no everybody doesnt the right spirit there are difficulties and they must be met in the right spirit this is an illustration of the difficulties we have in many ways then we go on i have made up my mind not to be excited in speeding i speed in neglecting i do not offer anything in reason i reverse the car and in this way we are successful we have no worries what can you think of a bone it is useless to think digestion in that way we do not prey we write of fish and then i have been careful it is all imagination can you sing rightly a trunk locked up in perpignan in this way we pass the hay i have reasoned i am convinced i do not argue or play the piano as the daughters of the banker do this is now the book in which i write and receive can you guess beziers was i right you are indeed there are barrels tourty or tourtebattre a story of the great war tourtebattre came to visit us in the court he said he heard americans were in town and he came to see us and we said what is your name and what americans have you known and we said we would go to see him and we did not and we did not give him anything then when we went out to see the hospital we did not take him anything we asked to see him then when the new things came we did take a package to him and we did not see him but he came and called on us to thank us and we were out reflections if i must reflect i reflect upon ann veronica this is not what is intended mrs tourtebattre of this we know nothing can we reflect one for another profit and loss is three twenty five never two seventy five yes that is the very easy force decidedly not then tourtebattre used to come all the time and then he used to tell us how old he was when he was asked and he took sugar in his coffee as it was given to him he was not too old to be a father he was thirty seven and he had three children and he told us that he liked to turn a phrase china whenever he went to the colonies his sister was hurt in an automobile accident this did not mean that she suffered some one thought she was killed will you please put that in his fathers watch his wife gave all his most precious belongings to a man who did not belong to the town he said he belonged to we did not know the truth of this reflections we should not color our hero with his wifes misdeeds because you see he may be a religion instead of a talker little bones have to come out of his hand for action this was after his wound a good deal he was wounded in the attack in april right near where he was always going to visit his wife and he saw the church tower and then he was immediately evacuated to an american hospital where every one was very american and very kind and miss bell tried to talk french to him and amuse him but overcome with her difficulties with the french language she retired which made him say she was very nice and these stories that he told to us you told to sister cecile which did not please her and she said we must come and hear from every one else the stories they all told of the kindness they had received in the american hospital before they came to her and she said to them what did the major do and they said he played ball he did and you too and all of them said no sister but you were wounded in an attack we were both wounded said the soldier reflections reflections on sister cecile lead us to believe that she did not reflect about friday but about the book in which she often wrote we were curious she wrote this note this is it name life wife deed wound weather food devotion and expression what did he ask for why i dont know why dont you know i dont call that making literature at all what has he asked for i call literature telling a story as it happens facts of life make literature i can always feel rightly about that we obtained beads for him and our own pictures in it dear pictures of us we can tell anything over we gave him colored beads and he made them with paper that he bought himself of two different colors into frames that we sent with our pictures to our cousins and our papas in america can we say it we cannot now then he told us about his wife and his child he does not say anything about them now some immediate provision was necessary we said in english these are the facts which we are bringing to your memory what is capitol he told us of bead buttons and black and white he answered her back very brightly he is a man reflections what were the reflections have we undertaken too much what is the name of his wife they were lost we did not look forward we did not think much how long would he stay our reflections really came later the first thing we heard from her was that the woman was not staying and had left her new address how do you do we did not look her up her mother and her mother can you think why marguerite did not wish jenny picard to remain longer because she stole not really yes indeed little things this will never do and then i said we must go to see her and you said we will see one night no one day she called with her mother who was very good looking she was very good looking and the little boy can you think of the little boy they both said that they were not polite but they were reflections can come already we believed her reasons were real reasons who is always right not she nor her eleven sisters no one knew who was kind to her what is kindness kindness is being soft or good and has nothing to do with amiable albert is kind and good and their wives can you tell the difference between wives and children queen victoria and queen victoria they made you jump and i said the mother you said the mother i did not remember the mother was in paris but you did next life
