the sound of thunder by ray bradbury the sign on the wall seemed to quaver under a film of sliding warm water eckels felt his eyelids blink over his stare and the sign burned in this momentary darkness time safari inc safaris to any year in the past you name the animal we take you there you shoot it a warm phlegm gathered in eckels throat he swallowed and pushed it down the muscles around his mouth formed a smile as he put his hand slowly out upon the air and in that hand waved a check for ten thousand dollars to the man behind the desk does this safari guarantee i come back alive we guarantee nothing said the official except the dinosaurs he turned this is mr travis your safari guide in the past hell tell you what and where to shoot if he says no shooting no shooting if you disobey instructions theres a stiff penalty of another ten thousand dollars plus possible government action on your return eckels glanced across the vast office at a mass and tangle a snaking and humming of wires and steel boxes at an aurora that flickered now orange now silver now blue there was a sound like a gigantic bonfire burning all of time all the years and all the parchment calendars all the hours piled high and set aflame a touch of the hand and this burning would on the instant beautifully reverse itself eckels remembered the wording in the advertisements to the letter out of chars and ashes out of dust and coals like golden salamanders the old years the green years might leap roses sweeten the air white hair turn irishblack wrinkles vanish all everything fly back to seed flee death rush down to their beginnings suns rise in western skies and set in glorious easts moons eat themselves opposite to the custom all and everything cupping one in another like chinese boxes rabbits in hats all and everything returning to the fresh death the seed death the green death to the time before the beginning a touch of a hand might do it the merest touch of a hand hell and damn eckels breathed the light of the machine on his thin face a real time machine he shook his head makes you think if the election had gone badly yesterday i might be here now running away from the results thank god keith won hell make a fine president of the united states yes said the man behind the desk were lucky if deutscher had gotten in wed have the worst kind of dictatorship theres an antieverything man for you a militarist antichrist antihuman antiintellectual people called us up you know joking but not joking said if deutscher became president they wanted to go live in of course its not our business to conduct escapes but to form safaris anyway keiths president now all you got to worry about is shooting my dinosaur eckels finished it for him a tyrannosaurus rex the thunder lizard the damnedest monster in history sign this release anything happens to you were not responsible those dinosaurs are hungry eckels flushed angrily trying to scare me frankly yes we dont want anyone going wholl panic at the first shot six safari leaders were killed last year and a dozen hunters were here to give you the damnedest thrill a real hunter ever asked for travelling you back sixty million years to bag the biggest damned game in all time your personal checks still there tear it up mr eckels looked at the check for a long time his fingers twitched good luck said the man behind the desk mr travis hes all yours they moved silently across the room taking their guns with them toward the machine toward the silver metal and the roaring light first a day and then a night and then a day and then a night then it was daynightdaynightday a week a month a year a decade ad ad zoic gone the machine roared they put on their oxygen helmets and tested the intercoms eckels swayed on the padded seat his face pale his jaws stiff he felt the trembling in his arms and he looked down and found his hands tight on the new rifle there were four other men in the machine travis the safari leader his assistant lesperance and two other hunters billings and kramer they sat looking at each other and the years blazed around them can these guns get a dinosaur cold eckels felt his mouth saying if you hit them right said travis on the helmet radio some dinosaurs have two brains one in the head another far down the spinal column we stay away from those thats stretching luck put your first two shots into the eyes if you can blind them and go back into the brain the machine howled time was a film run backward suns fled and ten million moons fled after them good god said eckels every hunter that ever lived would envy us today this makes africa seem like illinois the machine slowed its scream fell to a murmur the machine stopped the sun stopped in the sky the fog that had enveloped the machine blew away and they were in an old time a very old time indeed three hunters and two safari heads with their blue metal guns across their knees christ isnt born yet said travis moses has not gone to the mountain to talk with god the pyramids are still in the earth waiting to be cut out and put up remember that alexander caesar napoleon hitler none of them exists the men nodded that mr travis pointed is the jungle of sixty million two thousand and fiftyfive years before president keith he indicated a metal path that struck off into green wilderness over steaming swamp among giant ferns and palms and that he said is the path laid by time safari for your use it floats six inches above the earth doesnt touch so much as one grass blade flower or tree its an anti gravity metal its purpose is to keep you from touching this world of the past in any way stay on the path dont go off it i repeat dont go off for any reason if you fall off theres a penalty and dont shoot any animal we dont okay why asked eckels they sat in the ancient wilderness far birds cries blew on a wind and the smell of tar and an old salt sea moist grasses and flowers the colour of blood we dont want to change the future we dont belong here in the past the government doesnt like us here we have to pay big graft to keep our franchise a time machine is damn finicky business not knowing it we might kill an important animal a small bird a roach a flower even thus destroying an important link in a growing species thats not clear said eckels all right travis continued say we accidentally kill one mouse here that means all the future families of this one particular mouse are destroyed right right and all the families of the families of that one mouse with a stamp of your foot you annihilate first one then a dozen then a thousand a million a billion possible mice so theyre dead said eckels so what so what travis snorted quietly well what about the foxes thatll need those mice to survive for want of ten mice a fox dies for want of ten foxes a lion starves for want of a lion all manner of insects vultures infinite billions of life forms are thrown into chaos and destruction eventually it all boils down to this fiftynine million years later a cave man one of a dozen on the entire world goes hunting wild boar or sabertooth tiger for food but you friend have stepped on all the tigers in that region by stepping on one single mouse so the cave man starves and the cave man please note is not just any expendable man no i he is an entire future nation from his loins would have sprung ten sons from their loins one hundred sons and thus onward to a civilisation destroy this one man and you destroy a race a people an entire history of life it is comparable to slaying some of adams grandchildren the stomp of your foot on one mouse could start an earthquake the effects of which could shake our earth and destinies down through time to their very foundations with the death of that one cave man a billion others yet unborn are throttled in the womb perhaps rome never rises on its seven hills perhaps europe is forever a dark forest and only asia waxes healthy and teeming step on a mouse and you crush the pyramids step on a mouse and you leave your print like a grand canyon across eternity queen elizabeth might never be born washington might not cross the delaware there might never be a united states at all so be careful stay on the path never step off i see said eckels then it wouldnt pay for us even to touch the grass correct crushing certain plants could add up infinitesimally a little error here would multiply in sixty million years all out of proportion of course maybe our theory is wrong maybe time cant be changed by us or maybe it can be changed only in little subtle ways a dead mouse here makes an insect imbalance there a population disproportion later a bad harvest further on a depression mass starvation and finally a change in social temperament in farflung countries something much more subtle like that perhaps only a soft breath a whisper a hair pollen on the air such a slight slight change that unless you looked close you wouldnt see it who knows who really can say he knows we dont know were guessing but until we do know for certain whether our messing around in time can make a big roar or a little rustle in history were being damned careful this machine this path your clothing and bodies were sterilised as you know before the journey we wear these oxygen helmets so we cant introduce our bacteria into an ancient atmosphere how do we know which animals to shoot theyre marked with red paint said travis today before our journey we sent lesperance here back with the machine he came to this particular era and followed certain animals studying them right said lesperance i track them through their entire existence noting which of them lives longest very few how many times they mate not often lifes short when i find one thats going to die when a tree falls on him or one that drowns in a tar pit i note the exact hour minute and second i shoot a paint bomb it leaves a red patch on his hide we cant miss it then i correlate our arrival in the past so that we meet the monster not more than two minutes before he would have died anyway this way we kill only animals with no future that are never going to mate again you see how careful we are but if you came back this morning in time said eckels eagerly you mustve bumped into us our safari how did it turn out was it successful did all of us get through alive travis and lesperance gave each other a look thatd be a paradox said the latter time doesnt permit that sort of mess a man meeting himself when such occasions threaten time steps aside like an airplane hitting an air pocket you felt the machine jump just before we stopped that was us passing ourselves on the way back to the future we saw nothing theres no way of telling if this expedition was a success if we got our monster or whether all of us meaning you mr eckels got out alive eckels smiled palely cut that said travis sharply everyone on his feet they were ready to leave the machine the jungle was high and the jungle was broad and the jungle was the entire world forever and forever sounds like music and sounds like flying tents filled the sky and those were pterodactyls soaring with cavernous grey wings gigantic bats out of a delirium and a night fever eckels balanced on the narrow path aimed his rifle playfully stop that said travis dont even aim for fun damn it if your gun should go off eckels flushed wheres our tyrannosaurus lesperance checked his wrist watch up ahead well bisect his trail in sixty seconds look for the red paint for christs sake dont shoot till we give the word stay on the path stay on the path they moved forward in the wind of morning strange murmured eckels up ahead sixty million years election day over keith made president everyone celebrating and here we are a million years lost and they dont exist the things we worried about for months a lifetime not even born or thought about yet safety catches off everyone ordered travis you first shot eckels second billings third kramer ive hunted tiger wild boar buffalo elephant but jesus this is it said eckels im shaking like a kid ah said travis everyone stopped travis raised his hand ahead he whispered in the mist there he is theres his royal majesty now the jungle was wide and full of twitterings rustlings murmurs and sighs suddenly it all ceased as if someone had shut a door silence a sound of thunder out of the mist one hundred yards away came tyrannosaurus rex jesus god whispered eckels shit it came on great oiled resilient striding legs it lowered thirty feet above half of the trees a great evil god folding its delicate watchmakers claws close to its oily reptilian chest each lower leg was a piston a thousand pounds of white bone sunk in thick ropes of muscle sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the mail of a terrible warrior each thigh was a ton of meat ivory and steel mesh and from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys while the snake neck coiled and the head itself a ton of sculptured stone lifted easily upon the sky its mouth gaped exposing a fence of teeth like daggers its eyes rolled ostrich eggs empty of all expression save hunger it closed its mouth in a death grin it ran its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes its taloned feet clawing damp earth leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight it ran with a gliding ballet step far too poised and balanced for its ten tons it moved into a sunlit arena warily its beautiful reptile hands feeling the air my god eckels twitched his mouth it could reach up and grab the moon shit travis jerked angrily he hasnt seen us yet it cant be killed eckels pronounced this verdict quietly as if there could be no argument he had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion the rifle in his hands seemed a cap gun we were fools to come this is impossible shut up hissed travis nightmare turn around commanded travis walk quietly to the machine well remit onehalf your fee i didnt realise it would be this big said eckels i miscalculated thats all and now i want out it sees us theres the red paint on its chest the thunder lizard raised itself its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins the coins crusted with slime steamed in the slime tiny insects wriggled so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate even while the monster itself did not move it exhaled the stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness get me out of here said eckels it was never like this before i was always sure id come through alive i had good guides good safaris and safety this time i figured wrong ive met my match and admit it this is too much for me to get hold of dont run said lesperance turn around hide in the machine yes eckels seemed to be numb he looked at his feet as if trying to make them move he gave a grunt of helplessness eckels he took a few steps blinking shuffling not that way the monster at the first motion lunged forward with a terrible scream it covered one hundred yards in four seconds the rifles jerked up and blazed fire a windstorm from the beasts mouth engulfed them in the stench of slime and old blood the monster roared teeth glittering with sun eckels not looking back walked blindly to the edge of the path his gun limp in his arms stepped off the path and walked not knowing it in the jungle his feet sank into green moss his legs moved him and he felt alone and remote from the events behind the rifles cracked again their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder the great lever of the reptiles tail swung up lashed sideways trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch the monster twitched its jewellers hands down to fondle at the men to twist them in half to crush them like berries to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat its boulderstone eyes levelled with the men they saw themselves mirrored they fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris like a stone idol like a mountain avalanche tyrannosaurs fell thundering it clutched trees pulled them with it it wrenched and tore the metal path the men flung themselves back and away the body hit ten tons of cold flesh and stone the guns fired the monster lashed its armoured tail twitched its snake jaws and lay still a fount of blood spurted from its throat somewhere inside a sac of fluids burst sickening gushes drenched the hunters they stood red and glistening the thunder faded the jungle was silent after the avalanche a green peace after the nightmare morning billings and kramer sat on the pathway and threw up travis and lesperance stood with smoking rifles cursing steadily in the time machine on his face eckels lay shivering he had found his way back to the path climbed into the machine travis came walking glanced at eckels took cotton gauze from a metal box and returned to the others who were sitting on the path clean up they wiped the blood from their helmets they began to curse too the monster lay a hill of solid flesh within you could hear the sighs and murmurs as the furthest chambers of it died the organs malfunctioning liquids running a final instant from pocket to sac to spleen everything shutting off closing up forever it was like standing by a wrecked locomotive or a steam shovel at quitting time all valves being released or levered tight bones cracked the tonnage of its own flesh off balance dead weight snapped the delicate forearms caught underneath the meat settled quivering another cracking sound overhead a gigantic tree branch broke from its heavy mooring fell it crashed upon the dead beast with finality there lesperance checked his watch right on time thats the giant tree that was scheduled to fall and kill this animal originally he glanced at the two hunters you want the trophy picture what we cant take a trophy back to the future the body has to stay right here where it would have died originally so the insects birds and bacteria can get at it as they were intended to everything in balance the body stays but we can take a picture of you standing near it the two men tried to think but gave up shaking their heads they let themselves be led along the metal path they sank wearily into the machine cushions they gazed back at the ruined monster the stagnating mound where already strange reptilian birds and golden insects were busy at the steaming armour a sound on the floor of the time machine stiffened them eckels sat there shivering im sorry he said at last get up cried travis eckels got up go out on that path alone said travis he had his rifle pointed youre not coming back in the machine were leaving you here lesperance seized travis arm wait stay out of this travis shook his hand away this son of a bitch nearly killed us but it isnt that so much hell no its his shoes look at them he ran off the path my god that ruins us i christ knows how much well forfeit tens of thousands of dollars of insurance we guarantee no one leaves the path he left it oh the damn fool ill have to report to the government they might revoke our license to travel god knows what hes done to time to history take it easy all he did was kick up some dirt how do we know cried travis we dont know anything its all a damn mystery get out there eckels eckels fumbled his shirt ill pay anything a hundred thousand dollars travis glared at eckels chequebook and spat go out there the monsters next to the path stick your arms up to your elbows in his mouth then you can come back with us thats unreasonable the monsters dead you yellow bastard the bullets the bullets cant be left behind they dont belong in the past they might change something heres my knife dig them out the jungle was alive again full of the old tremorings and bird cries eckels turned slowly to regard that primeval garbage dump that hill of nightmares and terror after a long time like a sleepwalker he shuffled out along the path he returned shuddering five minutes later his arms soaked and red to the elbows he held out his hands each held a number of steel bullets then he fell he lay where he fell not moving you didnt have to make him do that said lesperance didnt i its too early to tell travis nudged the still body hell live next time he wont go hunting game like this okay he jerked his thumb wearily at lesperance switch on lets go home they cleaned their hands and faces they changed their caking shirts and pants eckels was up and around again not speaking travis glared at him for a full ten minutes dont look at me cried eckels i havent done anything who can tell just ran off the path thats all a little mud on my shoes what do you want me to get down and pray we might need it im warning you eckels i might kill you yet ive got my gun ready im innocent ive done nothing the machine stopped get out said travis the room was there as they had left it but not the same as they had left it the same man sat behind the same desk but the same man did not quite sit behind the same desk travis looked around swiftly everything okay here he snapped fine welcome home travis did not relax he seemed to be looking at the very atoms of the air itself at the way the sun poured through the one high window okay eckels get out dont ever come back eckels could not move you heard me said travis whatre you staring at eckels stood smelling of the air and there was a thing to the air a chemical taint so subtle so slight that only a faint cry of his subliminal senses warned him it was there the colours white grey blue orange in the wall in the furniture in the sky beyond the window were were and there was a feel his flesh twitched his hands twitched he stood drinking the oddness with the pores of his body somewhere someone must have been screaming one of those whistles that only a dog can hear his body screamed silence in return beyond this room beyond this wall beyond this man who was not quite the same man seated at this desk that was not quite the same desk lay an entire world of streets and people what sort of world it was now there was no telling he could feel them moving there beyond the walls almost like so many chess pieces blown in a dry wind but the immediate thing was the sign painted on the office wall the same sign he had read earlier today on first entering somehow the sign had changed tyme sefari inc sefaris tu any yeeh en the past yu naim the animall wee taek you thair yu shoot itt eckels felt himself tall into a chair he fumbled crazily at the thick slime on his boots he held up a clod of dirt trembling no it cant be not a little thing like that no embedded in the mud glistening green and gold and black was a butterfly very beautiful and very dead not a little thing like that not a butterfly cried eckels it fell to the floor an exquisite thing a small thing that could upset balances and knock down a line of small dominoes and then big dominoes and then gigantic dominoes all down the years across time eckels mind whirled it couldnt change things killing one butterfly couldnt be that important could it his face was cold his mouth trembled asking who won the presidential election yesterday the man behind the desk laughed you joking you know damn well deutscher of course who else not that damn weakling keith we got an iron man now a man with guts by god the official stopped whats wrong eckels moaned he dropped to his knees he scrabbled at the golden butterfly with shaking fingers cant we he pleaded to the world to himself to the officials to the machine cant we take it back cant we make it alive again cant we start over cant we he did not move eyes shut he waited shivering he heard travis breathe loud in the room he heard travis shift his rifle click the safety catch and raise the weapon there was a sound of thunder
