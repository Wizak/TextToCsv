bygones will be bygones i did think mr garnet would have fainted when the best man said i cant find it old horse a letter with a postscript i mr jeremy garnet stood with his back to the empty grate for the time was summer watching with a jaundiced eye the removal of his breakfast things mrs medley he said sir would it bore you if i became autobiographical sir never mind i merely wish to sketch for your benefit a portion of my lifes history at eleven oclock last night i went to bed and at once sank into a dreamless sleep about four hours later there was a clattering on the stairs which shook the house like a jelly it was the gentleman in the top room i forget his name returning to roost he was humming a patriotic song a little while later there were a couple of loud crashes he had removed his boots all this while snatches of the patriotic song came to me through the ceiling of my bedroom at about fourthirty there was a lull and i managed to get to sleep again i wish when you see that gentleman mrs medley you would give him my compliments and ask him if he could shorten his program another night he might cut out the song for a start hes a very young gentleman sir said mrs medley in vague defense of her top room and its highly improbable said garnet that he will ever grow old if he repeats his last nights performance i have no wish to shed blood wantonly but there are moments when one must lay aside ones personal prejudices and act for the good of the race a man who hums patriotic songs at four oclock in the morning doesnt seem to me to fit into the scheme of universal happiness so you will mention it to him wont you very well sir said mrs medley placidly on the strength of the fact that he wrote for the newspapers and had published two novels mrs medley regarded mr garnet as an eccentric individual who had to be humored whatever he did or said filled her with a mild amusement she received his daily harangues in the same spirit as that in which a nurse listens to the outpourings of the family baby she was surprised when he said anything sensible enough for her to understand his table being clear of breakfast and his room free from disturbing influences the exhilaration caused by his chat with his landlady left mr garnet life seemed very gray to him he was a conscientious young man and he knew that he ought to sit down and do some work on the other hand his brain felt like a cauliflower and he could not think what to write about this is one of the things which sour the young author even more than do those long envelopes which so tastefully decorate his table of a morning he felt particularly unfitted for writing at that moment the morning is not the time for inventive work an article may be polished then or a halffinished story completed but am is not the hour at which to invent jerry garnet wandered restlessly about his sitting room rarely had it seemed so dull and depressing to him as it did then the photographs on the mantelpiece irritated him there was no change in them they struck him as the concrete expression of monotony his eye was caught by a picture hanging out of the straight he jerked it to one side and the effect became worse he jerked it back again and the thing looked as if it had been hung in a dim light by an astigmatic drunkard five minutes pulling and hauling brought it back to a position only a shade less crooked than that in which he had found it and by that time his restlessness had grown like a mushroom he looked out of the window the sunlight was playing on the house opposite he looked at his boots at this point conscience prodded him sharply i wont he muttered fiercely i will work ill turn out something even if its the worst rot ever written with which admirable sentiment he tracked his blotting pad to its hiding place mrs medley found a fresh one every day collected ink and pens and sat down there was a distant thud from above and shortly afterwards a thin tenor voice made itself heard above a vigorous splashing the young gentleman on the top floor was starting another day oill er sing thee sawongs brief pause then in a triumphant burst as if the singer had just remembered the name ovarraby mr garnet breathed a prayer and glared at the ceiling the voice continued ahnd er taales of faarr cahshmeerer sudden and grewsome pause the splashing ceased the singer could hardly have been drowned in a hip bath but mr garnet hoped for the best his hopes were shattered come resumed the young gentleman persuasively into the garden maud for ther black batter naheet hath er florn jerry garnet sprang from his seat and paced the room this is getting perfectly impossible he said to himself i must get out of this a fellow cant work in london ill go down to some farmhouse in the country i cant think here you might just as well try to work at a musical at home here followed certain remarks about the young man upstairs who was now in lighter vein putting in a spell at a popular melody from the gaiety theater he resumed his seat and set himself resolutely to hammer out something which though it might not be literature would at least be capable of being printed a search through his commonplace book brought no balm a commonplace book is the authors rag bag in it he places all the insane ideas that come to him in the groundless hope that some day he will be able to convert them with magic touch into marketable plots this was the luminous item which first met mr garnets eye mem dead body found in railway carriage under seat only one living occupant of carriage he is suspected of being the murderer but proves that he only entered carriage at twelve oclock in the morning while the body has been dead since the previous night to this bright scheme were appended the words this will want some working up j g it will thought jerry garnet grimly but it will have to go on wanting as far as im concerned the next entry he found was a perfectly inscrutable lyric outburst there are moments of annoyance void of every kind of joyance in the complicated course of mans affairs but the very worst of any he experiences when he meets a young but active lion on the stairs sentiment unexceptionable but as to the reason for the existence of the fragment his mind was a blank he shut the book impatiently it was plain that no assistance was to be derived from it his thoughts wandered back to the idea of leaving london london might have suited dr johnson but he had come to the conclusion that what he wanted to enable him to give the public of his best as the reviewer of the academy dealing with his last work had expressed a polite hope that he would continue to do was country air a farmhouse by the sea somewhere cows spreading boughs rooks brooks cream in london the day stretches before a man if he has no regular and appointed work to do like a long white dusty road it seems impossible to get to the end of it without vast effort but in the country every hour has its amusements up with the lark morning dip cheery greetings local color huge breakfast long walks flannels the ungirt loin good steady spell of work from dinner till bedtime the prospect fascinated him his third novel was already in a nebulous state in his brain a quiet week or two in the country would enable him to get it into shape he took from the pocket of his blazer a letter which had arrived some days before from an artist friend of his who was on a sketching tour in devonshire and somerset there was a penciled memorandum on the envelope in his own handwriting mem might work k ls story about m and the w ss into comic yarn for one of the weeklies he gazed at this for a while with a last hope that in it might be contained the germ of something which would enable him to turn out a mornings work but having completely forgotten who k l was and especially what was his or her story about m whoever he or she might be he abandoned this hope and turned to the letter in the envelope the earlier portions of the letter dealt tantalizingly with the scenery bits come upon by accident at the end of disused lanes and transferred with speed to canvas were described concisely but with sufficient breadth to make garnet long to see them for himself there were brief rsums of dialogues between lickford the writer and weird rustics the whole letter breathed of the country and the open air the atmosphere of garnets sitting room seemed to him to become stuffier with every sentence he read the postscript interested him by the way at yeovil i came across an old friend of yours stanley featherstonhaugh ukridge of all people as large as life quite six foot two and tremendously filled out i thought he was abroad the last i heard of him was that he had started for buenos ayres in a cattleship it seems he has been in england sometime i met him in the refreshment room at yeovil station i was waiting for a down train he had changed on his way to town as i opened the door i heard a huge voice in a more or less violent altercation and there was s f u in a villainous old suit of gray flannels ill swear it was the same one that he had on last time i saw him and a mackintosh though it was a blazing hot day his pincenez were tacked onto his ears with wire as usual he greeted me with effusive shouts and drew me aside then after a few commonplaces of greeting he fumbled in his pockets looked pained and surprised look here licky he said you know i never borrow its against my principles but i must have a shilling or im a ruined man i seem to have had my pocket picked by some scoundrelly blackguard can you my dear fellow oblige me with a shilling until next tuesday afternoon at threethirty i never borrow so ill tell you what ill do ill let you have this producing a beastly little threepennybit with a hole in it until i can pay you back this is of more value to me than i can well express licky my boy a very very dear friend gave it to me when we parted years ago its a wrench to part with it but grim necessity i can hardly do it still no no you must take it you must take it licky old man shake hands shake hands my boy he then asked after you and said you were the noblest man except me on earth i gave him your address not being able to get out of it but if i were you i should fly while there is yet time that said jerry garnet is the soundest bit of advice ive heard i will mrs medley he said when that lady made her appearance sir im going away for a few weeks you can let the rooms if you like ill drop you a line when i think of coming back yes sir and your letters where shall i send them sir till further notice said jerry garnet pulling out a giant portmanteau from a corner of the room and flinging it open care of the dalai lama no younghusband terrace tibet yes sir said mrs medley placidly ill write you my address tonight i dont know where im going yet is that an a b c over there good give my love to that bright young spirit on the top floor and tell him that i hope my not being here to listen wont interfere in any way with his morning popular concerts yes sir and mrs medley if a man named mrs medley had drifted silently away during his last speech a thunderous knocking had begun on the front door jerry garnet stood and listened transfixed something seemed to tell him who was at the business end of that knocker he heard mrs medleys footsteps pass along the hall and pause at the door then there was the click of the latch then a volume of sound rushed up to him where he stood over his empty portmanteau is mr garnet in mrs medleys reply was inaudible but apparently in the affirmative where is he boomed the voice show me the old horse first floor thank you where is the man of wrath there followed a crashing on the stairs such as even the young gentleman of the top floor had been unable to produce in his nocturnal rovings the house shook and with the tramping came the thunderous voice as the visitor once more gave tongue garnet garnet garnet ukridges scheme ii mr stanley featherstonhaugh ukridge dashed into the room uttering a roar of welcome as he caught sight of garnet still standing petrified athwart his portmanteau my dear old man he shouted springing at him and seizing his hand in a clutch that effectually woke garnet from his stupor how are you old chap this is good by jove this is good this is fine what he dashed back to the door and looked out come on millie he shouted garnet was wondering who in the name of fortune millie could possibly be when there appeared on the further side of mr ukridge the figure of a young woman she paused in the doorway and smiled pleasantly garnet old horse said ukridge with some pride let me introduce you to my wife millie this is old garnet youve heard me talk about him oh yes said mrs ukridge garnet bowed awkwardly the idea of ukridge married was something too overpowering to be assimilated on the instant if ever there was a man designed by nature to be a bachelor stanley ukridge was that man garnet could feel that he himself was not looking his best he knew in a vague impersonal way that his eyebrows were still somewhere in the middle of his forehead whither they had sprung in the first moment of surprise and that his jaw which had dropped had not yet resumed its normal posture before committing himself to speech he made a determined effort to revise his facial expression buck up old horse said ukridge he had a painful habit of addressing all and sundry by that title in his schoolmaster days he had made use of it while interviewing the parents of new pupils and the latter had gone away as a rule with a feeling that this must be either the easy manner of genius or spirits and hoping for the best later he had used it to perfect strangers in the streets on one occasion he had been heard to address a bishop by that title surprised to find me married what garny old boy sinking his voice to what was intended to be a whisper take my tip you go and do the same you feel another man give up this bachelor business its a mugs game go and get married my boy go and get married by gad ive forgotten to pay the cabby half a moment he was out of the door and on his way downstairs before the echoes of his last remark had ceased to shake the window of the sitting room garnet was left to entertain mrs ukridge so far her share in the conversation had been small nobody talked very much when ukridge was on the scene she sat on the edge of garnets big basket chair looking very small and quiet she smiled pleasantly as she had done during the whole of the preceding dialogue it was apparently her chief form of expression jerry garnet felt very friendly toward her he could not help pitying her ukridge he thought was a very good person to know casually but a little of him as his former headmaster had once said in a moody reflective voice went a very long way to be bound to him for life was not the ideal state for a girl if he had been a girl he felt he would as soon have married a volcano and shes so young he thought as he looked across at the basket chair quite a kid you and stanley have known each other a long time havent you said the object of his pity breaking the silence yes oh yes said garnet several years we were masters at the same school together mrs ukridge leaned forward with round shining eyes isnt he a wonderful man mr garnet she said ecstatically not yet to judge from her expression and the tone of her voice had she had experience of the disadvantages attached to the position of mrs stanley ukridge garnet could agree with her there yes he is certainly wonderful he said i believe he could do anything yes said garnet he believed that ukridge was at least capable of anything he has done so many things have you ever kept fowls she broke off with apparent irrelevance no said garnet you see i spend so much of my time in town i should find it difficult mrs ukridge looked disappointed i was hoping you might have had some experience stanley of course can turn his hand to anything but i think experience is such a good thing dont you it is said garnet mystified but i have bought a shilling book called fowls and all about them but it is very hard to understand you see we but here is stanley he will explain it all well garnet old horse said ukridge rentering the room after another energetic passage of the stairs settle down and lets talk business found cabby gibbering on doorstep wouldnt believe i didnt want to bilk him had to give him an extra shilling but now about business lucky to find you in because ive got a scheme for you garny old boy yes sir the idea of a thousand years now listen to me for a moment he sat down on the table and dragged a chair up as a leg rest then he took off his pincenez wiped them readjusted the wire behind his ears and having hit a brown patch on the knee of his gray flannel trousers several times in the apparent hope of removing it began to speak about fowls he said what about them asked garnet the subject was beginning to interest him it showed a curious tendency to creep into the conversation i want you to give me your undivided attention for a moment said ukridge i was saying to my wife only the other day garnets the man clever man garnet full of ideas didnt i millie yes dear said mrs ukridge smiling well said garnet the fact is said ukridge with a micawberlike burst of candor we are going to keep fowls he stopped and looked at garnet in order to see the effect of the information garnet bore it with fortitude yes he said ukridge shifted himself farther on to the table and upset the inkpot never mind he said itll soak in dont you worry about that you keep listening to me when i said we meant to keep fowls i didnt mean in a small sort of way two cocks and a couple of hens and a pingpong ball for a nest egg we are going to do it on a large scale we are going to keep he concluded impressively a chicken farm a chicken farm echoed mrs ukridge with an affectionate and admiring glance at her husband ah said garnet who felt his responsibilities as chorus ive thought it all out continued ukridge and its as clear as mud no expenses large profits quick returns chickens eggs and no work by jove old man its the idea of a lifetime just listen to me for a moment you buy your hen one hen inquired garnet call it one for the sake of argument it makes my calculations clearer very well then you buy your hen it lays an egg every day of the week you sell the eggs say six for fivepence keep of hen costs nothing profit at least fourpence three farthings on every halfdozen eggs what do you think of that bartholomew garnet admitted that it sounded like an attractive scheme but expressed a wish to overhaul the figures in case of error error shouted ukridge pounding the table with such energy that it groaned beneath him error not a bit of it cant you follow a simple calculation like that the thing is you see you get your original hen for next to nothing thats to say on tick anybody will let you have a hen on tick now listen to me for a moment you let your hen set and hatch chickens suppose you have a dozen hens very well then when each of the dozen has a dozen chickens you send the old hens back with thanks for the kind loan and there you are starting business with a hundred and fortyfour free chickens to your name and after a bit when the chickens grow up and begin to lay all you have to do is to sit back in your chair and gather in the big checks isnt that so millie yes dear said mrs ukridge with shining eyes weve fixed it all up do you know lyme regis in dorsetshire on the borders of devon quiet little fishing village bathing sea air splendid scenery just the place for a chicken farm ive been looking after that a friend of my wifes has lent us a jolly old house with large grounds all weve got to do is to get in the fowls thats all right ive ordered the first lot we shall find them waiting for us when we arrive well said garnet im sure i wish you luck mind you let me know how you get on let you know roared ukridge why old horse youve got to come too we shall take no refusal shall we millie no dear murmured mrs ukridge of course not said ukridge no refusal of any sort pack up tonight and meet us at waterloo tomorrow its awfully good of you began garnet a little blankly not a bit of it not a bit of it this is pure business i was saying to my wife when we came in that you were the very man for us if old garnets in town i said well have him a man with his flow of ideas will be invaluable on a chicken farm didnt i millie mrs ukridge murmured the response you see im one of these practical men i go straight ahead following my nose what you want in a business of this sort is a touch of the dreamer to help out the practical mind we look to you for suggestions montmorency timely suggestions with respect to the comfort and upbringing of the fowls and you can work ive seen you of course you take your share of the profits thats understood yes yes i must insist strict business between friends we must arrange it all when we get down there my wife is the secretary of the firm she has been writing letters to people asking for fowls so you see its a thoroughly organized concern theres money in it old horse dont you forget that we should be so disappointed if you did not come said mrs ukridge lifting her childlike eyes to garnets face garnet stood against the mantelpiece and pondered in after years he recognized that that moment marked an epoch in his life if he had refused the invitation he would not have but to quote the old novelists we anticipate at any rate he would have missed a remarkable experience it is not given to everyone to see mr stanley ukridge manage a chicken farm the fact is he said at last i was thinking of going somewhere where i could get some golf ukridge leaped on the table triumphantly lyme regis is just the place for you then perfect hotbed of golf fine links at the top of the hill not half a mile from the farm bring your clubs youll be able to have a round or two in the afternoons get through serious work by lunch time you know said garnet i am absolutely inexperienced as regards fowls excellent said ukridge then youre just the man you will bring to the work a mind entirely unclouded by theories you will act solely by the light of your intelligence er yes said garnet i wouldnt have a professional chicken farmer about the place if he paid to come natural intelligence is what we want then we can rely on you very well said garnet slowly its very kind of you to ask me its business cuthbert business very well then we shall catch the eleventwenty at waterloo dont miss it you book to axminster look out for me on the platform if i see you first ill shout garnet felt that that promise rang true then goodby for the present millie we must be off till tomorrow garnet goodby mr garnet said mrs ukridge looking back at the affair after the lapse of years garnet was accustomed to come to the conclusion that she was the one pathetic figure in the farce under what circumstances she had married ukridge he did not learn till later he was also uncertain whether at any moment in her career she regretted it but it was certainly pathetic to witness her growing bewilderment during the weeks that followed as the working of ukridges giant mind was unfolded to her little by little life as ukridge understood the word must have struck her as a shade too full of incident to be really comfortable garnet was wont to console himself by the hope that her very genuine love for her husband and his equally genuine love for her was sufficient to smooth out the rough places of life as he returned to his room after showing his visitors to the door the young man upstairs who had apparently just finished breakfast burst once more into song well never come back no more boys well never come back no more garnet could hear him wedding appropriate dance to the music not for a few weeks at any rate he said to himself as he started his packing at the point where he had left off a girl with brown hair iii waterloo station is one of the things which no fellow can understand thousands come to it thousands go from it porters grow grayheaded beneath its roof buns once fresh and tender become hard and misanthropic in its refreshment rooms and look as if they had seen the littleness of existence and were disillusioned but there the station stands year after year wrapped in a discreet gloom always the same always baffling and inscrutable not even the porters understand it i couldnt say sir is the civil but unsatisfying reply with which research is met now and then one more gifted than his colleagues will inform the traveler that his train starts from no or no but a moments reflection and he hedges with no waterloo is the home of imperfect knowledge the booking clerks cannot state in a few words where tickets may be bought for any station they are only certain that they themselves cannot sell them the gloom of the station was lightened on the following morning at ten minutes to eleven when mr garnet arrived to catch the train to axminster by several gleams of sunshine and a great deal of bustle and movement on the various platforms a cheery activity pervaded the place porters on every hand were giving their celebrated imitations of the car of juggernaut throwing as a sop to the wounded a crisp by your leave agitated ladies were pouring forth questions with the rapidity of machine guns long queues surged at the mouths of the booking offices inside which soured clerks sending lost sheep empty away were learning once more their lesson of the innate folly of mankind other crowds collected at the bookstalls and the bookstall keeper was eying with dislike men who were under the impression that they were in a free library an optimistic porter had relieved garnet of his portmanteau and golf clubs as he stepped out of his cab and had arranged to meet him on no platform from which he asserted with the quiet confidence which has made englishmen what they are the eleventwenty would start on its journey to axminster unless he added it went from no garnet having bought a ticket after drawing blank at two booking offices made his way to the bookstall here he inquired in a loud penetrating voice if they had got mr jeremy garnets last novel the maneuvers of arthur being informed that they had not he clicked his tongue cynically advised the man in charge to order that work as the demand for it might be expected shortly to be large and spent a shilling on a magazine and some weekly papers then with ten minutes to spare he went off in search of ukridge he found him on platform no the porters first choice was it seemed correct the eleventwenty was already alongside the platform and presently garnet observed his porter cleaving a path toward him with the portmanteau and golf clubs here you are shouted ukridge good for you thought you were going to miss it garnet shook hands with the smiling mrs ukridge ive got a carriage said ukridge and collared two corner seats my wife goes down in another she dislikes the smell of smoke when shes traveling lets pray that we get the carriage to ourselves but all london seems to be here this morning get in old horse ill just see her ladyship into her carriage and come back to you garnet entered the compartment and stood at the door looking out in order after the friendly manner of the traveling briton to thwart an invasion of fellowtravelers then he withdrew his head suddenly and sat down an elderly gentleman accompanied by a girl was coming toward him it was not this type of fellowtraveler whom he hoped to keep out he had noticed the girl at the booking office she had waited by the side of the line while the elderly gentleman struggled gamely for the tickets and he had plenty of opportunity of observing her appearance for five minutes he had debated with himself as to whether her hair should rightly be described as brown or golden he had decided finally on brown it then became imperative that he should ascertain the color of her eyes once only had he met them and then only for a second they might be blue they might be gray he could not be certain the elderly gentleman came to the door of the compartment and looked in this seems tolerably empty my dear phyllis he said garnet his glance fixed on his magazine made a note of the name it harmonized admirably with the hair and the eyes of elusive color you are sure you do not object to a smoking carriage my dear oh no father not at all garnet told himself that the voice was just the right sort of voice to go with the hair the eyes and the name then i think said the elderly gentleman getting in the inflection of his voice suggested the irishman it was not a brogue there were no strange words but the general effect was irish garnet congratulated himself irishmen are generally good company an irishman with a pretty daughter should be unusually good company the bustle on the platform had increased momently until now when from the snorting of the engine it seemed likely that the train might start at any minute the crowds excitement was extreme shrill cries echoed down the platform lost sheep singly and in companies rushed to and fro peering eagerly into carriages in the search for seats piercing cries ordered unknown tommies and ernies to keep by aunty now just as ukridge returned the dreaded get in anywhere began to be heard and the next moment an avalanche of warm humanity poured into the carriage a silent but bitter curse framed itself on garnets lips his chance of pleasant conversation with the lady of the brown hair and the eyes that were either gray or blue was at an end the newcomers consisted of a middleaged lady addressed as aunty a youth called albert subsequently described by garnet as the rudest boy on earth a proud title honestly won lastly a niece of some twenty years stolid and seemingly without interest in life ukridge slipped into his corner adroitly foiling albert who had made a dive in that direction albert regarded him fixedly for a space then sank into the seat beside garnet and began to chew something grewsome that smelled of aniseed aunty meanwhile was distributing her weight evenly between the toes of the irish gentleman and those of his daughter as she leaned out of the window to converse with a lady friend in a straw hat and hair curlers phyllis he noticed was bearing it with angelic calm her profile when he caught sight of it round aunty struck him as a little cold even haughty that however might be due to what she was suffering it is unfair to judge a ladys character from her face at a moment when she is in a position of physical discomfort the train moved off with a jerk in the middle of a request on the part of the strawhatted lady that her friend would remember that you know about him and aunty staggering back sat down on a bag of food which albert had placed on the seat beside him clumsy observed albert tersely albert you mustnt speak to aunty so wodyer want sit on my bag for then inquired albert they argued the point garnet who should have been busy studying character for a novel of the lower classes took up his magazine and began to read the odor of aniseed became more and more painful ukridge had lighted a cigar and garnet understood why mrs ukridge preferred to travel in another compartment for in his hand he bore the brand which none but he might smoke garnet looked stealthily across the carriage to see how his lady of the hair and eyes was enduring this combination of evils and noticed that she too had begun to read and as she put down the book to look out of the window at the last view of london he saw with a thrill that it was the maneuvers of arthur never before had he come upon a stranger reading his work and if the maneuvers of arthur could make the reader oblivious to surroundings such as these then felt garnet it was no common book a fact which he had long since suspected the train raced on toward the sea it was a warm day and a torpid peace began to settle down on the carriage soon only garnet the irishman and the lady were awake whats your book me dear asked the irishman the maneuvers of arthur father said phyllis by jeremy garnet garnet would not have believed without the evidence of his ears that his name could possibly have sounded so well dolly strange gave it to me when i left the abbey continued phyllis she keeps a shelf of books for her guests when they are going away books that she considers rubbish and doesnt want you know garnet hated dolly strange without further evidence and what do you think of it me dear i like it said phyllis decidedly the carriage swam before garnets eyes i think it is very clever i shall keep it bless you thought garnet and i will write my precious autograph on every page if you want it i wonder who jeremy garnet is said phyllis i imagine him rather an old young man probably with an eyeglass and conceited he must be conceited i can tell that from the style and i should think he didnt know many girls at least if he thinks pamela grant an ordinary sort of girl is she not asked her father shes a crrreature said phyllis emphatically this was a blow to garnet and demolished the selfsatisfaction which her earlier criticisms had caused to grow within him he had always looked on pamela as something very much out of the ordinary run of feminine character studies that scene between her and the curate in the conservatory and when she finds arthur at the meet of the blankshire he was sorry she did not like pamela somehow it lowered pamela in his estimation but i like arthur said phyllis and she smiled the first time garnet had seen her do so garnet also smiled to himself arthur was the hero he was a young writer ergo arthur was himself the train was beginning to slow down signs of returning animation began to be noticeable among the sleepers a whistle from the engine and the train drew up in a station looking out of the window garnet saw that it was yeovil there was a general exodus aunty became instantly a thing of dash and electricity collected parcels shook albert replied to his thrusts with repartee and finally headed a stampede out of the door to garnets chagrin the irish gentleman and his daughter also rose apparently this was to be the end of their brief acquaintanceship they alighted and walked down the platform where are we said ukridge sleepily opening his eyes yeovil not far now old horse with which remark he closed his eyes again and returned to his slumbers garnets eye roving disconsolately over the carriage was caught by something lying in the far corner it was the criticized maneuvers of arthur the girl had left it behind what follows shows the vanity that obsesses our young and rising authors it did not enter into his mind that the book might have been left behind of set purpose as being of no further use to the owner it only occurred to him that if he did not act swiftly the lady of the hair and eyes would suffer a loss beside which the loss of a purse or a hand bag were trivial he acted swiftly five seconds later he was at the end of the platform flushed but courteous excuse me he said i think thank you said the girl garnet made his way back to his carriage they are blue he said the arrival iv from axminster to lyme regis the line runs through country as pretty as any that can be found in the island and the train as if in appreciation of this fact does not hurry over the journey it was late afternoon by the time the chicken farmers reached their destination the arrangements for the carrying of luggage at lyme regis border on the primitive boxes are left on the platform and later when he thinks of it a carrier looks in and conveys them down into the valley and up the hill on the opposite side to the address written on the labels the owner walks lyme regis is not a place for the halt and maimed ukridge led his band in the direction of the farm which lay across the valley looking through woods to the sea the place was visible from the station from which indeed standing as it did on the top of a hill the view was extensive halfway up the slope on the other side of the valley the party left the road and made their way across a spongy field ukridge explaining that this was a short cut they climbed through a hedge crossed a stream and another field and after negotiating a difficult bank topped with barbed wire found themselves in a kitchen garden ukridge mopped his forehead and restored his pincenez to their original position from which the passage of the barbed wire had dislodged them this is the place he said we have come in by the back way it saves time tired millie no dear thank you without being tired said garnet i am distinctly ready for tea what are the prospects thatll be all right said ukridge dont you worry a most competent man of the name of beale and his wife are in charge at present i wrote to them telling them that we were coming today they will be ready for us they were at the front door by this time ukridge rang the bell the noise rechoed through the house but there were no answering footsteps he rang again there is no mistaking the note of a bell in an empty house it was plain that the most competent man and his wife were out now what are you going to do said garnet mrs ukridge looked at her husband with quiet confidence ukridge fell back on reminiscence this he said leaning against the door and endeavoring to button his collar at the back reminds me of an afternoon in the argentine two other men and myself tried for three quarters of an hour to get into an empty house where there looked as if there might be something to eat and wed just got the door open when the owner turned up from behind a tree with a shotgun it was a little difficult to explain there was a dog too we were glad to say goodby at this moment history partially repeated itself from the other side of the door came a dissatisfied whine followed by a short bark halloo said ukridge beale has a dog and the dog said garnet will have us if were not careful what are you going to do lets try the back said ukridge we must get in what right he added with pathos has a beastly mongrel belonging to a man i employ to keep me out of my own house its a little hard here am i slaving to support beale and when i try to get into my house his infernal dog barks at me but we will try kindness first let me get to the keyhole i will parley with the animal he put his mouth to the keyhole and roared the soothing words goo dog through it instantly the door shook as some heavy object hurled itself against it the barking rang through the house kindness seems to be a drug in the market said garnet do you see your way to trying a little force ill tell you what well do said ukridge rising well go round and get in at the kitchen window and how long are we to stay there till the dog dies i never saw such a man as you protested ukridge you have a perfect mania for looking on the dark side the dog wont guard the kitchen door we shall manage to shut him up somewhere oh said garnet and now lets get in and have something to eat for goodness sake the kitchen window proved to be insecurely latched ukridge flung it open and they climbed in the dog hearing the sound of voices raced back along the passage and flung himself at the door he then proceeded to scratch at the panels in the persevering way of one who feels that he is engaged upon a business at which he is a specialist inside the kitchen ukridge took command never mind the dog he said let it scratch i thought said garnet we were going to shut it up somewhere go out and shut it into the dining room then personally i mean to have some tea millie you know how to light a fire garnet and i will be collecting cups and things when that scoundrel beale arrives i shall tear him limb from limb deserting us like this the man must be a thorough fraud he told me he was an old soldier if this was the sort of discipline they used to keep in his regiment i dont wonder that the service is going to the dogs there goes a plate how is the fire getting on millie ill chop beale into little bits whats that youve got there garny old horse tea good wheres the bread there another plate look here ill give that dog three minutes and if it doesnt stop scratching that door by then ill take the bread knife and go out and have a soultosoul talk with it its a little hard my own house and the first thing i find in it when i arrive is somebody elses beastly dog scratching holes in the doors stop it you beast the dogs reply was to continue his operations piu mosso ukridges eyes gleamed behind their glasses give me a good large jug he said with ominous calm he took the largest of the jugs from the dresser and strode with it into the scullery whence came the sound of running water he returned carrying the jug in both hands his mien was that of a general who sees his way to a master stroke of strategy garny old horse he said tack on to the handle and when i give the word fling wide the gates then watch that beast beyond the door get the surprise of its lifetime garnet attached himself to the handle as directed ukridge gave the word they had a momentary vision of an excited dog of the mongrel class framed in the open doorway all eyes and teeth then the passage was occupied by a spreading pool and indignant barks from the distance told that the mongrel was thinking the thing over in some safe retreat settled his hash said ukridge complacently nothing like resource garnet my boy some men would have gone on letting a good door be ruined and spoiled the dog for a haporth of water said garnet i suppose we shall have to clean up that mess some time there you go said ukridge looking on the dark side be an optimist my boy be an optimist beale and mrs beale shall clean that passage as a penance how is the fire millie the kettle is just boiling dear over a cup of tea ukridge became the man of business illustration they had a momentary vision of an excited dog framed in the doorway i wonder when those fowls are going to arrive they should have been here today if they dont come tomorrow i shall lodge a complaint there must be no slackness they must bustle about after tea ill show you the garden and we will choose a place for a fowl run tomorrow we must buckle to serious work will begin immediately after breakfast suppose said garnet the fowls arrive before we are ready for them why then they must wait but you cant keep fowls cooped up indefinitely in a crate i suppose they will come in a crate i dont know much about these things oh thatll be all right theres a basement to this house well let em run about there till were ready for them theres always a way of doing things if you look for it i hope you are going to let the hens hatch some of the eggs stanley dear said mrs ukridge i should so love to have some dear little chickens of course said ukridge my idea was this these people will send us fifty fowls of sorts that means call it forty eggs a day let em hatch out thirty a day and we will use the other ten for the table we shall want at least ten well im hanged that dog again wheres that jug but this time an unforeseen interruption prevented the maneuver from being the success it had been before garnet had turned the handle and was just about to pull the door open while ukridge looking like some modern and dilapidated version of discobolus stood beside him with his jug poised when a hoarse voice spoke from the window stand still said the voice or ill corpse you garnet dropped the handle ukridge dropped the jug mrs ukridge screamed at the window with a doublebarreled gun in his hands stood a short square redheaded man the muzzle of his gun which rested on the sill was pointing in a straight line at the third button of garnets waistcoat with a distant recollection of the deadwood dick literature of his childhood garnet flung both hands above his head ukridge emitted a roar like that of a hungry lion beale he shouted you scoundrelly unprincipled blackguard what are you doing with that gun why were you out what have you been doing why did you shout like that look what youve made me do he pointed to the floor broken crockery spreading water his own shoes exceedingly old tennis shoes well soaked attested the fact that damage had been done lor mr ukridge sir is that you said the redheaded man calmly i thought you was burglars a sharp bark from the other side of the kitchen door followed by a renewal of the scratching drew mr beales attention to his faithful hound thats bob he said i dont know what you call the brute said ukridge come in and tie him up ow am i to get in mr ukridge sir come in through the window and mind what youre doing with that gun after youve finished with the dog i should like a brief chat with you if you can spare the time and have no other engagements mr beale having carefully deposited his gun against the wall of the kitchen and dropped a pair of very limp rabbits with a thud to the floor proceeded to climb through the window this operation performed he stood on one side while the besieged garrison passed out by the same road you will find me in the garden beale said ukridge i have one or two little things to say to you mr beale grinned affably the cool air of the garden was grateful after the warmth of the kitchen it was a pretty garden or would have been if it had not been so neglected garnet seemed to see himself sitting in a deck chair on the lawn looking through the leaves of the trees at the harbor below it was a spot he felt in which it would be an easy and pleasant task to shape the plot of his novel he was glad he had come about now outside his lodgings in town a particularly lethal barrel organ would be striking up the latest revolting air with which the halls had inflicted london here you are beale said ukridge as the redheaded man approached now then what have you to say the hired man looked thoughtful for a while then observed that it was a fine evening garnet felt that he was begging the question he was a strong healthy man and should have scorned to beg fine evening shouted ukridge what on earth has that got to do with it i want to know why you and mrs beale were both out when we arrived the missus went to axminster mr ukridge sir she had no right to go to axminster i dont pay her large sums to go to axminster you knew i was coming this evening no mr ukridge sir you didnt no mr ukridge sir beale said ukridge with studied calm one of us two is a fool i noticed that sir let us sift this matter to the bottom you got my letter no mr ukridge sir my letter saying that i should arrive tonight you did not get it no sir now look here beale said ukridge i am certain that that letter was posted i remember placing it in my pocket for that purpose it is not there now see these are all the contents of my well im hanged he stood looking at the envelope he had produced from his breast pocket mr beale coughed beale said ukridge you er there seems to have been a mistake yes sir you are not so much to blame as i thought no sir anyhow said ukridge in inspired tones ill go and slay that infernal dog wheres your gun beale but better counsels prevailed and the proceedings closed with a cold but pleasant little dinner at which the spared mongrel came out unexpectedly strong with brainy and diverting tricks buckling to v sunshine streaming into his bedroom through the open window woke garnet next day as distant clocks were striking eight it was a lovely morning cool and fresh the grass of the lawn wet with dew sparkled in the sun a thrush who knew all about early birds and their perquisites was filling in the time before the arrival of the worm with a song or two as he sat in the bushes in the ivy a colony of sparrows were opening the day well with a little brisk fighting on the gravel in front of the house lay the mongrel bob blinking lazily the gleam of the sea through the trees turned garnets thoughts to bathing he dressed quickly and went out bob rose to meet him waving an absurdly long tail the hatchet was definitely buried now that little matter of the jug of water was forgotten well bob said garnet coming down to watch me bathe bob uttered a bark of approval and ran before him to the gate a walk of five minutes brought garnet to the sleepy little town he passed through the narrow street and turned on to the beach walking in the direction of the cob that combination of pier and breakwater which the misadventures of one of jane austens young misses have made known to the outside public the tide was high and garnet leaving his clothes to the care of bob dived into twelve feet of clear cold water as he swam he compared it with the morning tub of town and felt that he had done well to come with ukridge to this pleasant spot but he could not rely on unbroken calm during the whole of his visit he did not know a great deal about chicken farming but he was certain that ukridge knew less there would be some strenuous moments before that farm became a profitable commercial speculation at the thought of ukridge toiling on a hot afternoon to manage an undisciplined mob of fowls and becoming more and more heated and voluble in the struggle he laughed and promptly swallowed a generous mouthful of salt water there are few things which depress the swimmer more than an involuntary draught of water garnet turned and swam back to bob and the clothes as he strolled back along the beach he came upon a small elderly gentleman toweling his head in a vigorous manner hearing garnets footsteps he suspended this operation for a moment and peered out at him from beneath a turban of towel it was the elderly irishman of the journey the father of the blueeyed phyllis then they had come on to lyme regis after all garnet stopped with some idea of going back and speaking to him but realizing that they were perfect strangers he postponed this action and followed bob up the hill in a small place like lyme regis it would surely not be difficult to find somebody who would introduce them he cursed the custom which made such a thing necessary in a properly constituted country everybody would know everybody else without fuss or trouble he found ukridge in his shirt sleeves and minus a collar assailing a large ham mrs ukridge looking younger and more childlike than ever in brown holland smiled at him over the teapot here he is shouted ukridge catching sight of him where have you been old horse i went to your room but you werent there bathing hope its made you feel fit for work because weve got to buckle to this morning the fowls have arrived mr garnet said mrs ukridge opening her eyes till she looked like an astonished kitten such a lot of them theyre making such a noise and to support her statement there floated through the window a cackling which for volume and variety of key beat anything that garnet had ever heard judging from the noise it seemed as if england had been drained of fowls and the entire tribe of them dumped into the yard of the ukridges farm there seems to have been no stint he said sitting down did you order a million or only nine hundred thousand good many arent there said ukridge complacently but thats what we want no good starting on a small scale the more you have the bigger the profits what sort have you got mostly oh all sorts bless you people dont mind what breed a fowl is so long as it is a fowl these dealer chaps were so infernally particular any dorkings they said all right i said bring on your dorkings or perhaps you want a few minorcas very well i said show minorcas they were going on theyd have gone on for hours but i stopped em look here maximilian i said to the manager johnny decent old chap with the manners of a marquis look here i said life is short and were neither of us as young as we used to be dont let us waste the golden hours playing guessing games i want fowls you sell fowls so give me some of all sorts and he has by jove there must be one of every breed ever invented where are you going to put them that spot we chose by the paddock thats the place plenty of mud for them to scratch about in and they can go into the field when they want to and pick up worms or whatever they feed on we must rig them up some sort of a shanty i suppose this morning well go and tell em to send up some wire netting and stuff from the town then we shall want hencoops we shall have to make those of course so we shall millie didnt i tell you that old garnet was the man to think of things i forgot the coops we cant buy some i suppose on tick cheaper to make them suppose we get a lot of boxes soap boxes are as good as any it wont take long to knock up a few coops ukridge thumped the table with enthusiasm garny old horse youre a marvel you think of everything well buckle to right away what a noise those fowls are making i suppose they dont feel at home in the yard wait till they see the a residential mansions were going to put up for them finished breakfast then lets go out come along millie the redheaded beale discovered leaning in an attitude of thought on the yard gate and observing the feathered mob below was roused from his reflections and dispatched to the town for the wire and soap boxes ukridge taking his place at the gate gazed at the fowls with the affectionate eye of a proprietor well they have certainly taken you at your word said garnet as far as variety is concerned the man with the manners of a marquis seemed to have been at great pains to send a really representative supply of fowls there were blue ones black ones white gray yellow brown big little dorkings minorcas cochin chinas bantams orpingtons wyandottes and a host more it was an imposing spectacle the hired man returned toward the end of the morning preceded by a cart containing the necessary wire and boxes and ukridge whose enthusiasm brooked no delay started immediately the task of fashioning the coops while garnet assisted by beale draped the wire netting about the chosen spot next to the paddock there were little unpleasantnesses once a roar of anguish told that ukridges hammer had found the wrong billet and on another occasion garnets flannel trousers suffered on the wire but the work proceeded steadily by the middle of the afternoon things were in a sufficiently advanced state to suggest to ukridge the advisability of a halt for refreshments thats the way to do it said he at this rate we shall have the place in a condition before bedtime what do you think of those for coops beale the hired man examined them gravely ive seen worse sir he continued his examination but not many he added beales passion for truth had made him unpopular in three regiments they arent so bad said garnet but im glad im not a fowl so you ought to be said ukridge considering the way youve put up that wire youll have them strangling themselves in spite of earnest labor the housing arrangements of the fowls were still in an incomplete state at the end of the day the details of the evenings work are preserved in a letter which garnet wrote that night to his friend lickford have you ever played a game called pigs in clover we have just finished a bout of it with hens instead of marbles which has lasted for an hour and a half we are all dead tired except the hired man who seems to be made of india rubber he has just gone for a stroll to the beach wants some exercise i suppose personally i feel as if i should never move again i have run faster and farther than i have done since i was at school you have no conception of the difficulty of rounding up fowls and getting them safely to bed having no proper place to put them we were obliged to stow some of them inside soap boxes and the rest in the basement it has only just occurred to me that they ought to have had perches to roost on it didnt strike me before i shall not mention it to ukridge or that indomitable man will start making some and drag me into it too after all a hen can rough it for one night and if i did a stroke more work i should collapse my idea was to do the thing on the slow but sure principle that is to say take each bird singly and carry it to bed it would have taken some time but there would have been no confusion but you can imagine that that sort of thing would not appeal to ukridge there is a touch of the napoleon about him he likes his maneuvers to be daring and on a large scale he said open the yard gate and let the fowls come out into the open then sail in and drive them in a mass through the back door into the basement it was a great idea but there was one fatal flaw in it it didnt allow for the hens scattering we opened the gate and out they all came like an audience coming out of a theater then we closed in on them to bring off the big drive for about three seconds it looked as if we might do it then bob the hired mans dog an animal who likes to be in whatevers going on rushed out of the house into the middle of them barking there was a perfect stampede and heaven only knows where some of those fowls are now there was one in particular a large yellow bird which i should imagine is nearing london by this time the last i saw of it it was navigating at the rate of knots so to speak in that direction with bob after it barking his hardest presently bob came back panting having evidently given up the job we in the meantime were chasing the rest of the birds all over the garden the thing had now resolved itself into the course of action i had suggested originally except that instead of collecting them quietly and at our leisure we had to run miles for each one we captured after a time we introduced some sort of system into it mrs ukridge fancy him married did you know stood at the door we chased the hens and brought them in then as we put each through into the basement she shut the door on it we also arranged ukridges soapbox coops in a row and when we caught a fowl we put it into the coop and stuck a board in front of it by these strenuous means we gathered in about two thirds of the lot the rest are all over england a few may be in dorsetshire but i should not like to bet on it so you see things are being managed on the uptodate chicken farm on good sound ukridge principles this is only the beginning i look with confidence for further exciting events i believe if ukridge kept white mice he would manage to knock some feverish excitement out of it he is at present lying on the sofa smoking one of his infernal brand of cigars from the basement i can hear faintly the murmur of innumerable fowls we are a happy family we are we are we are p s have you ever caught a fowl and carried it to roost you take it under the wings and the feel of it sets ones teeth on edge it is a grisly experience all the time you are carrying it it makes faint protesting noises and struggles feebly to escape p p s you know the opinion of pythagoras respecting fowls that the soul of our granddam might haply inhabit a bird i hope that yellow hen which bob chased into the purple night is not the grandmamma of any friend of mine a reunion vi the day was thursday the date july the twentysecond we had been chicken farmers for a whole week and things were beginning to settle down to a certain extent the coops were finished they were not masterpieces and i have seen chickens pause before them in deep thought as who should say now what in the world have we struck here but they were coops within the meaning of the act and we induced the hens to become tenants the hardest work had been the fixing of the wire netting this was the department of the hired man and myself beale and i worked ourselves into a fever in the sun while the senior partner of the firm sat in the house writing out plans and ideas and scribbling down his accounts which must have been complicated on giltedged correspondence cards from time to time he abused his creditors who were numerous ukridges financial methods were always puzzling to the ordinary mind we had hardly been at the farm a day before he began to order in a vast supply of necessary and unnecessary articles all on credit some he got from the village others from neighboring towns he has a way with him like father oflynn and the tradesmen behaved beautifully the things began to pour in from all sides suits groceries of the very best a piano a gramophone and pictures of all kinds he was not one of those men who want but little here below he wanted a great deal and of a superior quality if a tradesman suggested that a small check on account would not be taken amiss as one or two sordid fellows of the village did he became pathetic confound it sir he would say with tears in his voice laying a hand on the mans shoulder in an elder brotherly way its a trifle hard when a gentleman comes to settle here that you should dun him for things before he has settled the preliminary expenses about his house this sounded well and suggested the disbursement of huge sums for rent the fact that the house had been lent him rent free was kept with some care in the background having weakened the man with pathos he would strike a sterner note a little more of this he would go on and ill close my account as it is i think i will remove my patronage to a firm which will treat me civilly why sir ive never heard anything like it in all my experience upon which the man would knuckle under and go away forgiven with a large order for more goods once when ukridge and i were alone i ventured to expostulate high finance was always beyond my mental grasp pay he exclaimed of course we shall pay you dont seem to realize the possibilities of this business garny my boy we are on to a big thing the money isnt coming in yet we must give it time but soon we shall be turning over hundreds every week i am in touch with whiteleys and harrods and all the big places perfectly simple business matter here i am i said with a large chicken farm with all the modern improvements you want eggs i said i supply them i will let you have so many hundred eggs a week i said what will you give for them well their terms did not come up to my scheduled prices i admit but we mustnt sneer at small prices at first the upshot of it was that the firms mentioned supplied us with a quantity of goods agreeing to receive phantom eggs in exchange this satisfied ukridge he had a faith in the laying powers of his hens which would have flattered those birds if they could have known of it it might also have stimulated their efforts in that direction which up to date were feeble this however i attributed to the fact that the majority of our fowls perhaps through some sinister practical joke on the part of the manager who had the manners of a marquis were cocks it vexed ukridge here we are he said complainingly living well and drinking well in a newly furnished house having to keep a servant and maintain our position in life with expenses mounting and not a penny coming in its absurd weve got hundreds of hens most of them cocks its true but i forgot they didnt lay and getting not even enough eggs for our own table we must make some more arrangements come on in and let us think the thing out but this speech was the outcome of a rare moment of pessimism in his brighter moods he continued to express unbounded faith in the hens and was willing to leave the thing to time meanwhile we were creating quite a small sensation in the neighborhood the interest of the natives was aroused at first by the fact that nearly all of them received informal visits from our fowls which had strayed small boys would arrive in platoons each bearing his quota of stragglers be these your ens zur was the formula if they be weve got twentyfower mower in our yard could ee coom over and fetch em however after the hired retainer and i had completed our work with the wire netting desertions became less frequent people poured in from villages for miles around to look at the uptodate chicken farm it was a pleasing and instructive spectacle to see ukridge in a pink shirt without a collar and very dirty flannel trousers lecturing to the intelligent natives on the breeding of fowls they used to go away with the dazed air of men who have heard strange matters and ukridge unexhausted would turn to interview the next batch i fancy we gave lyme regis something to think about ukridge must have been in the nature of a staggerer to the rustic mind it was now as i have said thursday the twentysecond of july a memorable date to me a glorious sunny morning of the kind which nature provides occasionally in an ebullition of benevolence it is at times such as this that we dream our dreams and compose our masterpieces and a masterpiece i was indeed making the new novel was growing nobly striking scenes and freshets of scintillating dialogue rushed through my mind i had neglected my writing for the past week in favor of the tending of fowls but i was making up for lost time now another uninterrupted quarter of an hour and i firmly believe i should have completed the framework of a novel that would have placed me with the great in that select band whose members have no christian names another quarter of an hour and posterity would have known me as garnet but it was not to be i had just framed the most poignant searching conversation between my heroine and my hero and was about to proceed flushed with great thoughts to further triumphs when a distant shout brought me to earth stop her catch her garnet i was in the paddock at the time coming toward me at her best pace was a small hen behind the hen was bob doing as usual the thing that he ought not to have done behind bob some way behind was ukridge it was his shout that i had heard after her garny old horse he repeated a valuable bird must not be lost when not in a catalepsy of literary composition i am essentially the man of action i laid aside my novel for future reference and after a fruitless lunge at the hen as it passed joined bob in the chase we passed out of the paddock in the following order first the hen as fresh as paint and good for a fivemile spin next bob panting but fit for anything lastly myself determined but mistrustful of my powers of pedestrianism in the distance ukridge gesticulated and shouted advice after the first field bob gave up the chase and sauntered off to scratch at a rabbit hole he seemed to think that he had done all that could be expected of him in setting the thing going his air suggested that he knew the affair was in competent hands and relied on me to do the right thing the exertions of the past few days had left me in very fair condition but i could not help feeling that in competition with the hen i was overmatched neither in speed nor in staying power was i its equal but i pounded along doggedly whenever i find myself fairly started on any business i am reluctant to give it up i began to set an extravagant value on the capture of the small hen all the abstract desire for fame which had filled my mind five minutes before was concentrated now on that one feat in a calmer moment i might have realized that one bird more or less would not make a great deal of difference to the fortunes of the chicken farm but now my power of logical reasoning had left me all our fortunes seemed to me to center in the hen now half a field in front of me we had been traveling downhill all this time but at this point we crossed the road and the ground began to rise i was in that painful condition which occurs when one has lost ones first wind and has not yet got ones second i was hotter than i had ever been in my life whether the hen too was beginning to feel the effects of its run i do not know but it slowed down to a walk and even began to peck in a tentative manner at the grass this assumption on its part that the chase was at an end irritated me i felt that i should not be worthy of the name of englishman if i allowed myself to be treated as a cipher by a mere bird it should realize yet that it was no light matter to be pursued by j garnet author of the maneuvers of arthur etc a judicious increase of pace brought me within a yard or two of my quarry but it darted from me with a startled exclamation and moved off rapidly up the hill i followed distressed the pace was proving too much for me the sun blazed down it seemed to concentrate its rays on my back to the exclusion of the surrounding scenery in much the same way as the moon behaves to the heroine of a melodrama a student of the drama has put it on record that he has seen the moon follow the heroine round the stage and go off with her left the sun was just as attentive to me we were on level ground now the hen had again slowed to a walk and i was capable of no better pace very gradually i closed in on it there was a high boxwood hedge in front of us just as i came close enough to stake my all on a single grab the hen dived into this and struggled through in the mysterious way in which birds do get through hedges i was in the middle of the obstacle very hot tired and dirty when from the other side i heard a sudden shout of mark over bird to the right and the next moment i found myself emerging with a black face and tottering knees on to the gravel path of a private garden beyond the path was a croquet lawn on which i perceived as through a glass darkly three figures the mist cleared from my eyes and i recognized two of the trio one was my irish fellowtraveler the other was his daughter the third member of the party was a man a stranger to me by some miracle of adroitness he had captured the hen and was holding it protesting in a workmanlike manner behind the wings the entente cordiale vii it has been well observed that there are moments and moments the present as far as i was concerned belonged to the more painful variety even to my exhausted mind it was plain that there was need here for explanations an irishmans croquet lawn is his castle and strangers cannot plunge on to it unannounced through hedges without being prepared to give reasons unfortunately speech was beyond me i could have done many things at that moment i could have emptied a water butt lain down and gone to sleep or melted ice with a touch of the finger but i could not speak the conversation was opened by the other man in whose soothing hand the hen now lay apparently resigned to its fate come right in he said pleasantly dont knock your bird i think i stood there panting i must have presented a quaint appearance my hair was full of twigs and other foreign substances my face was moist and grimy my mouth hung open i wanted to sit down my legs felt as if they had ceased to belong to me i must apologize i began and ended the sentence with gasps conversation languished the elderly gentleman looked at me with what seemed to me indignant surprise his daughter looked through me the man regarded me with a friendly smile as if i were some old crony dropped in unexpectedly im afraid i said and stopped again hard work biggame hunting in this weather said the man take a long breath i took several and felt better i must apologize for this intrusion i said successfully unwarrantable would have rounded off the sentence nicely but instinct told me not to risk it it would have been mere bravado to have attempted unnecessary words of five syllables at that juncture i paused say on said the man with the hen encouragingly im a human being just like yourself the fact is i said i didnt didnt know there was a private garden beyond the hedge if you will give me my hen its hard to say goodby said the man stroking the birds head with the first finger of his disengaged hand she and i are just beginning to know and appreciate each other however if it must be he extended the hand which held the bird and at this point a hitch occurred he did his part of the business the letting go it was in my department the taking hold that the thing was bungled the hen slipped from my grasp like an eel stood for a moment overcome by the surprise of being at liberty once more then fled and intrenched itself in some bushes at the farther end of the lawn there are times when the most resolute man feels that he can battle no longer with fate when everything seems against him and the only course left is a dignified retreat but there is one thing essential to a dignified retreat one must know the way out it was that fact which kept me standing there looking more foolish than anyone has ever looked since the world began i could hardly ask to be conducted off the premises like the honored guest nor would it do to retire by the way i had come if i could have leaped the hedge with a single bound that would have made a sufficiently dashing and debonair exit but the hedge was high and i was incapable at the moment of achieving a debonair leap over a footstool the man saved the situation he seemed to possess that magnetic power over his fellows which marks the born leader under his command we became an organized army the common object the pursuit of the hen made us friends in the first minute of the proceedings the irishman was addressing me as me dear boy and the other man who had introduced himself rapidly as tom chase lieutenant in his majestys navy was shouting directions to me by name i have never assisted at any ceremony at which formality was so completely dispensed with the ice was not merely broken it was shivered into a million fragments go in and drive her out garnet shouted mr chase in my direction if you can look out on the left phyllis even in that disturbing moment i could not help noticing his use of the christian name it seemed to me sinister i did not like the idea of dashing young lieutenants in the royal navy calling a girl phyllis whose eyes had haunted me for just over a week since in fact i had first seen them nevertheless i crawled into the bushes and dislodged the hen she emerged at the spot where mr chase was waiting with his coat off and was promptly enveloped in that garment and captured the essence of strategy observed mr chase approvingly is surprise a devilish neat piece of work i thanked him he deprecated the thanks he had he said only done his duty as a man is bound to do he then introduced me to the elderly irishman who was it seemed a professor of what i do not know at dublin university by name derrick he informed me that he always spent the summer at lyme regis i was surprised to see you at lyme regis i said when you got out at yeovil i thought i had seen the last of you i think i am gifted beyond other men as regards the unfortunate turning of sentences i meant i added speedily i was afraid i had ah of course he said you were in our carriage coming down i was confident i had seen you before i never forget a face it would be a kindness said mr chase if you would forget garnets as now exhibited youll excuse the personality but you seem to have collected a good deal of the professors property coming through that hedge i was wondering i said with gratitude a wash if i might of course me boy of course said the professor tom take mr garnet off to your room and then well have some lunch youll stay to lunch mr garnet i thanked him for his kindness and went off with my friend the lieutenant to the house we imprisoned the hen in the stables to its profound indignation gave directions for lunch to be served to it and made our way to mr chases room so youve met the professor before he said hospitably laying out a change of raiment for me we were fortunately much of a height and build i have never spoken to him i said we traveled down together in a very full carriage and i saw him next day on the beach hes a dear old boy if you rub him the right way yes i said but im telling you this for your good and guidance he can cut up rough and when he does he goes off like a four point seven i think if i were you you dont mind my saying this i think if i were you i should not mention mr tim healy at lunch i promised that i would try to resist the temptation and if you could manage not to discuss home rule i will make an effort on any other topic he will be delighted to hear your views chatty remarks on bimetallism would meet with his earnest attention a lecture on what to do with the cold mutton would be welcomed but not ireland if you dont mind shall we go down we got to know one another very well at lunch do you hunt hens asked mr chase who was mixing the salad he was one of those men who seem to do everything a shade better than anyone else for amusement or by your doctors orders neither i said and particularly not for amusement the fact is i have been lured down here by a friend of mine who has started a chicken farm i was interrupted all three of them burst into laughter mr chase in his emotion allowed the vinegar to trickle on to the cloth missing the salad bowl by a clear two inches you dont mean to tell us he said that you really come from the one and only chicken farm i could not deny it why youre the man weve all been praying to meet for days past havent we professor youre right tom chuckled mr derrick we want to know all about it mr garnet said phyllis derrick do you know continued mr chase that you are the talk of the town everybody is discussing you your methods are quite new and original arent they probably i replied ukridge knows nothing about fowls i know less he considers it an advantage he said our minds ought to be unbiased by any previous experience ukridge said the professor that was the name old dawlish the grocer said i never forget a name he is the gentleman who lectures on the breeding of poultry is he not you do not i hastened to disclaim any such feat his lectures are very popular said phyllis with a little splutter of mirth he enjoys them i said look here garnet said mr chase i hope you wont consider all these questions impertinent but youve no notion of the thrilling interest we all take at a distance in your farm we have been talking of nothing else for a week i have dreamed of it three nights running is mr ukridge doing this as a commercial speculation or is he an eccentric millionaire hes not a millionaire i believe he intends to be though before long with the assistance of the fowls but i hope you wont look on me as in any way responsible for the arrangements at the farm i am merely a laborer the brain work of the business lies in ukridges department tell me mr garnet said phyllis do you use an incubator oh yes we have an incubator i suppose you find it very useful im afraid we use it chiefly for drying our boots when they get wet i said only that morning ukridges spare pair of tennis shoes had permanently spoiled the future of halfadozen eggs which were being hatched on the spot where the shoes happened to be placed ukridge had been quite annoyed i came down here principally i said in search of golf i was told there were links but up to the present my professional duties have monopolized me golf said professor derrick why yes we must have a round or two together i am very fond of golf i generally spend the summer down here improving my game i said i should be delighted there was croquet after lunch a game at which i am a poor performer miss derrick and i played the professor and chase chase was a little better than myself the professor by dint of extreme earnestness and care managed to play a fair game and phyllis was an expert i was reading a book said she as we stood together watching the professor shaping at his ball at the other end of the lawn by an author of the same surname as you mr garnet is he a relation of yours i am afraid i am the person miss derrick i said you wrote the book a man must live i said apologetically then you must have oh nothing i could not help it im afraid but your criticism was very kind did you know what i was going to say i guessed it was lucky i liked it she said with a smile lucky for me i said why it will encourage me to write another book so you see what you have to answer for i hope it will not trouble your conscience at the other end of the lawn the professor was still patting the balls about chase the while advising him to allow for windage and elevation and other mysterious things i should not have thought she said that an author cared a bit for the opinion of an amateur it all depends on the author on the amateur it was my turn to play at this point i missed as usual i didnt like your heroine mr garnet that was the one crumpled rose leaf i have been wondering why ever since i tried to make her nice three of the critics liked her really and the modern reviewer is an intelligent young man what is a creature miss derrick pamela in your book is a creature she replied unsatisfactorily with the slightest tilt of the chin my next heroine shall be a triumph i said she should be a portrait i resolved from life shortly after the game came somehow to an end i do not understand the intricacies of croquet but phyllis did something brilliant and remarkable with the balls and we adjourned for tea which had been made ready at the edge of the lawn while we played the sun was setting as i left to return to the farm with the hen stored neatly in a basket in my hand the air was deliciously cool and full of that strange quiet which follows soothingly on the skirts of a broiling midsummer afternoon far away the sound seemed almost to come from another world the tinkle of a sheep bell made itself heard deepening the silence alone in a sky of the palest blue there twinkled a small bright star i addressed this star she was certainly very nice to me i said very nice indeed the star said nothing on the other hand i went on i dont like that naval man he is a good chap but he overdoes it the star winked sympathetically he calls her phyllis i said charawk said the hen satirically from her basket a little dinner viii edwin comes today said mrs ukridge and the derricks said ukridge sawing at the bread in his energetic way dont forget the derricks millie no dear mrs beale is going to give us a very nice dinner we talked it over yesterday who is edwin i asked we were finishing breakfast on the second morning after my visit to the derricks i had related my adventures to the staff of the farm on my return laying stress on the merits of our neighbors and their interest in our doings and the hired retainer had been sent off next morning with a note from mrs ukridge inviting them to look over the farm and stay to dinner edwin said ukridge beast of a cat o stanley said mrs ukridge plaintively hes not hes such a dear mr garnet a beautiful purebred persian he has taken prizes hes always taking something generally food thats why he didnt come down with us a great horrid beast of a dog bit him mr garnet mrs ukridges eyes became round and shining and poor edwin had to go to a cats hospital and i hope said ukridge the experience will do him good sneaked a dogs bone garnet under his very nose if you please naturally the dog lodged a protest im so afraid that he will be frightened of bob he will be very timid and bobs so exceedingly boisterous isnt he mr garnet i owned that bobs manner was not that of a vere de vere thats all right said ukridge bob wont hurt him unless he tries to steal his bone in that case we will have edwin made into a rug stanley doesnt like edwin said mrs ukridge plaintively edwin arrived early in the afternoon and was shut into the kitchen he struck me as a handsome cat but nervous he had an excited eye the derricks followed two hours later mr chase was not of the party tom had to go to london explained the professor or he would have been delighted to come it was a disappointment to the boy for he wanted to see the farm he must come some other time said ukridge we invite inspection look here he broke off suddenly we were nearing the fowl run now mrs ukridge walking in front with phyllis derrick were you ever at bristol never sir said the professor because i knew just such another fat little buffer there a few years ago gay old bird he was he this is the fowl run professor i broke in with a moist tingling feeling across my forehead and up my spine i saw the professor stiffen as he walked while his face deepened in color ukridges breezy way of expressing himself is apt to electrify the stranger you will notice the able way ha ha in which the wire netting is arranged i continued feverishly took some doing that by jove yes it was hot work nice lot of fowls arent they rather a mixed lot of course ha ha thats the dealers fault though we are getting quite a number of eggs now hens wouldnt lay at first couldnt make them i babbled on till from the corner of my eye i saw the flush fade from the professors face and his back gradually relax its pokerlike attitude the situation was saved for the moment but there was no knowing what further excesses ukridge might indulge in i managed to draw him aside as we went through the fowl run and expostulated for goodness sake be careful i whispered youve no notion how touchy the professor is but i said nothing he replied amazed hang it you know nobody likes to be called a fat little buffer to his face what else could i call him nobody minds a little thing like that we cant be stilted and formal its ever so much more friendly to relax and be chummy here we rejoined the others and i was left with a leaden foreboding of grewsome things in store i knew what manner of man ukridge was when he relaxed and became chummy friendships of years standing had failed to survive the test for the time being however all went well in his rle of lecturer he offended no one and phyllis and her father behaved admirably they received the strangest theories without a twitch of the mouth ah the professor would say now is that really so very interesting indeed only once when ukridge was describing some more than usually original device for the furthering of the interests of his fowls did a slight spasm disturb phylliss look of attentive reverence and you have really had no previous experience in chicken farming she said none said ukridge beaming through his glasses not an atom but i can turn my hand to anything you know things seem to come naturally to me somehow i see said phyllis it was while matters were progressing with such beautiful smoothness that i observed the square form of the hired retainer approaching us somehow i cannot say why i had a feeling that he came with bad news perhaps it was his air of quiet satisfaction which struck me as ominous beg pardon mr ukridge sir ukridge was in the middle of a very eloquent excursus on the feeding of fowls the interruption annoyed him well beale he said what is it that there cat sir what came today o beale cried mrs ukridge in agitation what has happened having something to say to the missus what has happened o beale dont say that edwin has been hurt where is he oh poor edwin having something to say to the missus if bob has bitten him i hope he had his nose well scratched said mrs ukridge vindictively having something to say to the missus resumed the hired retainer tranquilly i went into the kitchen ten minutes back the cat was sitting on the mat beales narrative style closely resembled that of a certain book i had read in my infancy i wish i could remember its title it was a wellwritten book yes beale yes said mrs ukridge oh do go on halloo puss i says to him and ow are you sir be careful says the missus es that timid she says you wouldnt believe she says es only just settled down as you may say she says ho dont you fret i says to her im and me we understands each other im and me i says is old friends es me dear old pal corporal banks of the skrimshankers she grinned at that maam corporal banks being a man wed ad many a earty laugh at in the old days e was in a manner of speaking a joke between us oh do go on beale what has happened to edwin the hired retainer proceeded in calm even tones we was talking there maam when bob which had followed me unknown trotted in when the cat ketched sight of im sniffing about there was such a spitting and swearing as you never eard and blowed said mr beale amusedly as if the recollection tickled him blowed if the old cat didnt give one jump and move in quick time up the chimley where e now remains paying no eed to the missuss attempts to get him down again sensation as they say in the reports but hell be cooked cried phyllis openeyed ukridge uttered a roar of dismay no he wont nor will our dinner mrs beale always lets the kitchen fire out during the afternoon its a cold dinner well get tonight if that cat doesnt come down the professors face fell i had remarked on the occasion when i had lunched with him his evident fondness for the pleasures of the table cold impromptu dinners were plainly not to his taste we went to the kitchen in a body mrs beale was standing in front of the empty grate making seductive cat noises up the chimney whats all this mrs beale said ukridge he wont come down sir not while he thinks bobs about and how im to cook dinner for five with him up the chimney i dont see sir prod at him with a broom handle mrs beale urged ukridge i ave tried that sir but i cant reach him and ive only bin and drove im further up what must be added mrs beale philosophically must be he may come down of his own accord in the night bein ungry then what we must do said ukridge in a jovial manner which to me at least seemed out of place is to have a regular jolly picnic dinner what whack up whatever we have in the larder and eat that a regular jolly picnic dinner repeated the professor gloomily i could read what was passing in his mind that will be delightful said phyllis illustration ive only bin and drove im further up said mrs beale er i think my dear sir said her father it would be hardly fair of us to give any further trouble to mrs ukridge and yourself if you will allow me therefore i will ukridge became gushingly hospitable he refused to think of allowing his guests to go empty away he would be able to whack up something he said there was quite a good deal of the ham left he was sure he appealed to me to indorse his view that there was a tin of sardines and part of a cold fowl and plenty of bread and cheese and after all he said speaking for the whole company in the generous comprehensive way enthusiasts have what more do we want in weather like this a nice light cold dinner is ever so much better for us than a lot of hot things the professor said nothing he looked wan and unhappy we strolled out again into the garden but somehow things seemed to drag conversation was fitful except on the part of ukridge who continued to talk easily on all subjects unconscious of the fact that the party was depressed and at least one of his guests rapidly becoming irritable i watched the professor furtively as ukridge talked on and that ominous phrase of mr chases concerning fourpointseven guns kept coming into my mind if ukridge were to tread on any of his pet corns as he might at any minute there would be an explosion the snatching of the dinner from his very mouth as it were and the substitution of a breadandcheese and sardines menu had brought him to the frame of mind when men turn and rend their nearest and dearest the sight of the table when at length we filed into the dining room sent a chill through me it was a meal for the very young or the very hungry the uncompromising coldness and solidity of the viands was enough to appall a man conscious that his digestion needed humoring a huge cheese faced us in almost a swashbuckling way and i noticed that the professor shivered slightly as he saw it sardines looking more oily and uninviting than anything i had ever seen appeared in their native tin beyond the loaf of bread there was a ham in its third quarter and a chicken which had suffered heavily during a previous visit to the table we got through the meal somehow and did our best to delude ourselves into the idea that it was all great fun but it was a shallow pretense the professor was very silent by the time we had finished ukridge had been terrible when the professor began a story his stories would have been the better for a little more briskness and condensation ukridge interrupted him before he had got halfway through without a word of apology and began some anecdote of his own he disagreed with nearly every opinion he expressed it is true that he did it all in such a perfectly friendly way and was obviously so innocent of any intention of giving offense that another man might have overlooked the matter but the professor robbed of his good dinner was at the stage when he had to attack somebody every moment i had been expecting the storm to burst it burst after dinner we were strolling in the garden when some demon urged ukridge apropos of the professors mention of dublin to start upon the irish question my heart stood still ukridge had boomed forth some very positive opinions of his own on the subject of ireland before i could get near enough to him to stop him when i did i suppose i must have whispered louder than i had intended for the professor heard my words and they acted as the match to the powder hes touchy on the irish question is he he thundered drop it is it and why why sir im one of the besttempered men that ever came from ireland let me tell you and i will not stay here to be insulted by the insinuation that i cannot discuss irish affairs as calmly as anyone but professor take your hand off my arm mr garnet i will not be treated like a child i am as competent to discuss the affairs of ireland without heat as any man let me tell you father and let me tell you mr ukridge that i consider your opinions poisonous poisonous sir and you know nothing whatever about the subject sir i dont wish to see you or to speak to you again understand that sir our acquaintance began today and it will cease today good night to you come phyllis me dear mrs ukridge good night mr chase when he spoke of fourpointseven guns had known what he was talking about dies ir ix why is it i wonder that stories of retribution calling at the wrong address strike us as funny instead of pathetic i myself had been amused by them many a time in a book which i had just read a shop woman being vexed with an omnibus conductor had thrown a superannuated orange at him it had found its billet not on him but on a perfectly inoffensive spectator the missile we are told it a young copper full in the hyeball i had enjoyed this when i read it but now that fate had arranged a precisely similar situation with myself in the rle of the young copper the fun of the thing appealed to me not at all it was ukridge who was to blame for the professors regrettable explosion and departure and he ought by all laws of justice to have suffered for it as it was i was the only person materially affected it did not matter to ukridge he did not care twopence one way or the other if the professor were friendly he was willing to talk to him by the hour on any subject pleasant or unpleasant if on the other hand he wished to have nothing more to do with us it did not worry him he was content to let him go ukridge was a selfsufficing person but to me it was a serious matter more than serious if i have done my work as historian with any adequate degree of skill the reader should have gathered by this time the state of my feelings my love had grown with the days mr j holt schooling or somebody else with a taste for juggling with figures might write a very readable page or so of statistics in connection with the growth of love in the heart of a man in some cases it is i believe slow in my own i can only say that jacks beanstalk was a backward plant in comparison it is true that we had not seen a great deal of one another and that when we had met our interviews had been brief and our conversation conventional but it is the intervals between the meetings that do the real damage absence as the poet neatly remarks makes the heart grow fonder and now thanks to ukridges amazing idiocy a barrier had been thrust between us as if the business of fishing for a girls heart were not sufficiently difficult and delicate without the addition of needless obstacles it was terrible to have to restablish myself in the good graces of the professor before i could so much as begin to dream of phyllis ukridge gave me no balm well after all he said when i pointed out to him quietly but plainly my opinion of his tactlessness what does it matter there are other people in the world besides the old buffer and we havent time to waste making friends as a matter of fact the farm ought to keep us busy ive noticed garny old boy that you havent seemed such a whale for work lately as you might be you must buckle to old horse we are at a critical stage on our work now depends the success of the speculation look at those cocks theyre always fighting fling a stone at them whats the matter with you cant get the novel off your chest what you take my tip and give your mind a rest nothing like manual labor for clearing the brain all the doctors say so those coops ought to be painted today or tomorrow mind you i think old derrick would be all right if one persevered and didnt call him a fat old buffer and contradict everything he said and spoil all his stories by breaking in with chestnuts of your own in the middle i interrupted with bitterness oh rot old boy he didnt mind being called a fat old buffer you keep harping on that a man likes one to be chatty with him what was the matter with old derrick was a touch of liver you should have stopped him taking that cheese i say old man just fling another stone at those cocks will you theyll eat one another i had hoped fearing the while that there was not much chance of such a thing happening that the professor might get over his feeling of injury during the night and be as friendly as ever next day but he was evidently a man who had no objection whatever to letting the sun go down upon his wrath for when i met him on the beach the following morning he cut me in the most uncompromising fashion phyllis was with him at the time and also another girl who was i supposed from the strong likeness between them her sister she had the same soft mass of brown hair but to me she appeared almost commonplace in comparison it is never pleasant to be cut dead it produces the same sort of feeling as is experienced when one treads on nothing where one imagined a stair to be in the present instance the pang was mitigated to a certain extent not largely by the fact that phyllis looked at me she did not move her head and i could not have declared positively that she moved her eyes but nevertheless she certainly looked at me it was something she seemed to say that duty compelled her to follow her fathers lead and that the act must not be taken as evidence of any personal animus that at least was how i read off the message two days later i met mr chase in the village halloo so youre back i said youve discovered my secret said he will you have a cigar or a cocoanut there was a pause trouble i hear while i was away he said i nodded the man i live with ukridge did it touched on the irish question home rule he mentioned it among other things and the professor went off like a bomb he would its a pity i agreed i am glad to say that i suppressed the desire to ask him to use his influence if any with professor derrick to effect a reconciliation i felt that i must play the game i ought not to be speaking to you you know said mr chase youre under arrest hes still i stopped for a word very much so ill do what i can its very good of you but the time is not yet ripe he may be said at present to be simmering down i see thanks goodby so long and mr chase walked on with long strides to the cob the days passed slowly i saw nothing more of phyllis or her sister the professor i met once or twice on the links i had taken earnestly to golf in this time of stress golf it has been said is the game of disappointed lovers on the other hand it has further been pointed out that it does not follow that because a man is a failure as a lover he will be any good at all on the links my game was distinctly poor at first but a round or two put me back into my proper form which is fair the professors demeanor at these accidental meetings on the links was a faithful reproduction of his attitude on the beach only by a studied imitation of the absolute stranger did he show that he had observed my presence once or twice after dinner when ukridge was smoking one of his special cigars while mrs ukridge petted edwin now moving in society once more and in his right mind i walked out across the fields through the cool summer night till i came to the hedge that shut off the derricks grounds not the hedge through which i had made my first entrance but another lower and nearer the house standing there under the shade of a tree i could see the lighted windows of the drawingroom generally there was music inside and the windows being opened on account of the warmth of the night i was able to make myself a little more miserable by hearing phyllis sing it deepened the feeling of banishment i shall never forget those furtive visits the intense stillness of the night broken by an occasional rustling in the grass or the hedge the smell of the flowers in the garden beyond the distant drone of the sea god makes sech nights all white and still furz you can look and listen another day had generally begun before i moved from my hiding place and started for home surprised to find my limbs stiff and my clothes bathed with dew life seemed a poor institution during these days i enlist a minions services x it would be interesting to know to what extent the work of authors is influenced by their private affairs if life is flowing smoothly for them are the novels they write in that period of content colored with optimism and if things are running crosswise do they work off the resultant gloom on their faithful public if for instance mr w w jacobs had toothache would he write like mr hall caine if maxim gorky were invited to lunch by the czar would he sit down and dash off a trifle in the vein of mr dooley probably great authors have the power of detaching their writing self from their living workaday self for my own part the frame of mind in which i now found myself completely altered the scheme of my novel i had designed it as a lightcomedy effort here and there a page or two to steady the reader and show him what i could do in the way of pathos if i cared to try but in the main a thing of sunshine and laughter but now great slabs of gloom began to work themselves into the scheme of it characters whom i had hitherto looked upon as altogether robust developed fatal illnesses a magnificent despondency became the keynote of the book instead of marrying my hero and heroine had a big scene in the last chapter at the end of which she informed him that she was already secretly wedded to another a man with whom she had not even a sporting chance of being happy i could see myself correcting proofs made pulpy by the tears of emotional printers it would not do i felt that i must make a determined effort to shake off my depression more than ever the need for conciliating the professor was borne in upon me day and night i spurred my brain to think of some suitable means of engineering a reconciliation in the meantime i worked hard among the fowls drove furiously on the links and swam about the harbor when the affairs of the farm did not require my attention things were not going very well on our model chicken farm little accidents marred the harmony of life in the fowl run on one occasion a hen fell into a pot of tar and came out an unspeakable object chickens kept straying into the wrong coops and in accordance with fowl etiquette were promptly pecked to death by the resident edwin murdered a couple of wyandottes and was only saved from execution by the tears of mrs ukridge in spite of these occurrences however his buoyant optimism never deserted ukridge they were incidents annoying but in no way affecting the prosperity of the farm after all he said whats one bird more or less yes i know i was angry when that beast of a cat lunched off those two but that was more for the principle of the thing im not going to pay large sums for chickens so that a beastly cat can lunch well still weve plenty left and the eggs are coming in better now though weve a deal of leeway to make up yet in that line i got a letter from whiteleys this morning asking when my first consignment was to arrive you know these people make a mistake in hurrying a man it annoys him it irritates him when we really get going garny my boy i shall drop whiteleys i shall cut them out of my list and send my eggs to their trade rivals they shall have a sharp lesson its a little hard here am i worked to death looking after things down here and these men have the impertinence to bother me about their wretched business illustration things were not going very well on our model chicken farm it was on the morning after this that i heard him calling me in a voice in which i detected agitation i was strolling about the paddock as was my habit after breakfast thinking about phyllis and my wretched novel i had just framed a more than usually murky scene for use in the earlier part of the book when ukridge shouted to me from the fowl run garnet come here he cried i want you to see the most astounding thing i joined him whats the matter i asked blest if i know look at those chickens theyve been doing that for the last half hour i inspected the chickens there was certainly something the matter with them they were yawning broadly as if we bored them they stood about singly and in groups opening and shutting their beaks it was an uncanny spectacle whats the matter with them it looks to me i said as if they were tired of life they seem hipped oh do look at that poor little brown one by the coop said mrs ukridge sympathetically im sure its not well see its lying down what can be the matter with it can a chicken get a fit of the blues i asked because if so thats what theyve got i never saw a more boredlooking lot of birds ill tell you what well do said ukridge well ask beale he once lived with an aunt who kept fowls hell know all about it beale no answer beale a sturdy form in shirt sleeves appeared through the bushes carrying a boot we seemed to have interrupted him in the act of cleaning it beale you know about fowls whats the matter with these chickens the hired retainer examined the blas birds with a wooden expression on his face well said ukridge the ole thing ere said the hired retainer is these ere fowls have bin and got the roop i had never heard of the disease before but it sounded quite horrifying is that what makes them yawn like that said mrs ukridge yes maam poor things yes maam and have they all got it yes maam what ought we to do asked ukridge the hired retainer perpended well my aunt sir when er fowls ad the roop she give them snuff give them snuff she did he repeated with relish every morning snuff said mrs ukridge yes maam she give them snuff till their eyes bubbled mrs ukridge uttered a faint squeak at this vivid piece of word painting and did it cure them asked ukridge no sir responded the expert soothingly they died oh go away beale and clean your beastly boots said ukridge youre no use wait a minute who would know about this infernal roop thing one of those farmer chaps would i suppose beale go off to farmer leigh at up lyme and give him my compliments and ask him what he does when his fowls get the roop yes sir no ill go ukridge i said i want some exercise i whistled to bob who was investigating a mole heap in the paddock and set off to consult farmer leigh he had sold us some fowls shortly after our arrival so might be expected to feel a kindly interest in their ailing families the path to up lyme lies across deepgrassed meadows at intervals it passes over a stream by means of foot bridges the stream curls through the meadows like a snake and at the first of these bridges i met phyllis i came upon her quite suddenly the other end of the bridge was hidden from my view i could hear somebody coming through the grass but not till i was on the bridge did i see who it was we reached the bridge simultaneously she was alone she carried a sketching block all nice girls sketch a little there was room for one alone on the foot bridge and i drew back to let her pass as it is the privilege of woman to make the first sign of recognition i said nothing i merely lifted my hat in a noncommitting fashion are you going to cut me i wonder i said to myself she answered the unspoken question as i hoped it would be answered mr garnet she said stopping at the end of the bridge miss derrick i couldnt tell you so before but i am so sorry this has happened you are very kind i said realizing as i said it the miserable inadequacy of the english language at a crisis when i would have given a months income to have said something neat epigrammatic suggestive yet withal courteous and respectful i could only find a hackneyed unenthusiastic phrase which i should have used in accepting an invitation from a bore to lunch with him at his club of course you understand my friends must be my fathers friends yes i said gloomily i suppose so so you must not think me rude if i i cut me said i with masculine coarseness dont seem to see you said she with feminine delicacy when i am with my father you will understand i shall understand you see she smiled you are under arrest as tom says tom i see i said goodby goodby i watched her out of sight and went on to interview mr leigh we had a long and intensely uninteresting conversation about the maladies to which chickens are subject he was verbose and reminiscent he took me over his farm pointing out as he went dorkings and cochin chinas which he had cured of diseases generally fatal with as far as i could gather christian science principles i left at last with instructions to paint the throats of the stricken birds with turpentine a task imagination boggled at and one which i proposed to leave exclusively to ukridge and the hired retainer as i had a slight headache a visit to the cob would i thought do me good i had missed my bath that morning and was in need of a breath of sea air it was high tide and there was deep water on three sides of the cob in a small boat in the offing professor derrick appeared fishing i had seen him engaged in this pursuit once or twice before his only companion was a gigantic boatman by name harry hawk i sat on the seat at the end of the cob and watched the professor it was an instructive sight an object lesson to those who hold that optimism has died out of the race i had never seen him catch a fish he did not look to me as if he were at all likely to catch a fish yet he persevered there are few things more restful than to watch some one else busy under a warm sun as i sat there my mind ranged idly over large subjects and small i thought of love and chicken farming i mused on the immortality of the soul in the end i always returned to the professor sitting as i did with my back to the beach i could see nothing but his boat it had the ocean to itself i began to ponder over the professor i wondered dreamily if he were very hot i tried to picture his boyhood i speculated on his future and the pleasure he extracted from life it was only when i heard him call out to hawk to be careful when a movement on the part of that oarsman set the boat rocking that i began to weave romances round him in which i myself figured but once started i progressed rapidly i imagined a sudden upset professor struggling in water myself heroically courage im coming a few rapid strokes saved sequel a subdued professor dripping salt water and tears of gratitude urging me to become his soninlaw that sort of thing happened in fiction it was a shame that it should not happen in real life in my hot youth i once had seven stories in seven weekly penny papers in the same month all dealing with a situation of the kind only the details differed in not really a coward vincent devereux had rescued the earls daughter from a fire whereas in hildas hero it was the peppery old father whom tom slingsby saved singularly enough from drowning in other words i a very mediocre scribbler had effected seven times in a single month what the powers of the universe could not manage once even on the smallest scale i was a little annoyed with the powers of the universe it was at precisely three minutes to twelve for i had just consulted my watch that the great idea surged into my brain at four minutes to twelve i had been grumbling impotently at providence by two minutes to twelve i had determined upon a manly and independent course of action briefly it was this since dramatic accident and rescue would not happen of its own accord i would arrange one for myself hawk looked to me the sort of man who would do anything in a friendly way for a few shillings that afternoon i interviewed mr hawk at the net and mackerel hawk i said to him darkly over a mystic and conspiratorlike pot i want you the next time you take professor derrick out fishing here i glanced round to make sure that we were not overheard to upset him his astonished face rose slowly from the rim of the pot like a full moon what ud i do that for he gasped five shillings i hope said i but i am prepared to go to ten he gurgled i argued with the man i was eloquent but at the same time concise my choice of words was superb i crystallized my ideas into pithy sentences which a child could have understood at the end of half an hour he had grasped all the salient points of the scheme also he imagined that i wished the professor upset by way of a practical joke he gave me to understand that this was the type of humor which was to be expected from a gentleman from london i am afraid he must at one period of his career have lived at one of those watering places to which trippers congregate he did not seem to think highly of the londoner i let it rest at that i could not give my true reason and this served as well as any at the last moment he recollected that he too would get wet when the accident took place and raised his price to a sovereign a mercenary man it is painful to see how rapidly the old simple spirit is dying out in rural districts twenty years ago a fisherman would have been charmed to do a little job like that for a shilling the brave preserver xi i could have wished during the next few days that mr harry hawks attitude toward myself had not been so unctuously confidential and mysterious it was unnecessary in my opinion for him to grin meaningly whenever he met me in the street his sly wink when we passed each other on the cob struck me as in indifferent taste the thing had been definitely arranged half down and half when it was over and there was no need for any cloak and darklantern effects i objected strongly to being treated as the villain of a melodrama i was merely an ordinary wellmeaning man forced by circumstances into doing the work of providence mr hawks demeanor seemed to say we are two reckless scoundrels but bless you i wont give away your guilty secret the climax came one morning as i was going along the street toward the beach i was passing a dark doorway when out shimmered mr hawk as if he had been a specter instead of the most substantial man within a radius of ten miles st he whispered now look here hawk i said wrathfully for the start he had given me had made me bite my tongue this has got to stop i refuse to be haunted in this way what is it now mr derrick goes out this morning zur thank goodness for that i said get it over this morning then without fail i couldnt stand another day of this i went on to the cob where i sat down i was excited deeds of great import must shortly be done i felt a little nervous it would never do to bungle the thing suppose by some accident i were to drown the professor or suppose that after all he contented himself with a mere formal expression of thanks and refused to let bygones be bygones these things did not bear thinking of i got up and began to pace restlessly to and fro presently from the farther end of the harbor there put off mr hawks boat bearing its precious cargo my mouth became dry with excitement very slowly mr hawk pulled round the end of the cob coming to a standstill some dozen yards from where i was performing my beat it was evidently here that the scene of the gallant rescue had been fixed my eyes were glued upon mr hawks broad back the boat lay almost motionless on the water i had never seen the sea smoother it seemed as if this perfect calm might continue for ever mr hawk made no movement then suddenly the whole scene changed to one of vast activity i heard mr hawk utter a hoarse cry and saw him plunge violently in his seat the professor turned half round and i caught sight of his indignant face pink with emotion then the scene changed again with the rapidity of a dissolving view i saw mr hawk give another plunge and the next moment the boat was upside down in the water and i was shooting head foremost to the bottom oppressed with the indescribably clammy sensation which comes when ones clothes are thoroughly wet i rose to the surface close to the upturned boat the first sight i saw was the spluttering face of mr hawk i ignored him and swam to where the professors head bobbed on the waters keep cool i said a silly remark in the circumstances he was swimming energetically but unskillfully in his shore clothes it would have taken him at least a week to struggle to land i knew all about saving people from drowning we used to practice it with a dummy in the swimming bath at school i attacked him from the rear and got a good grip of him by the shoulders i then swam on my back in the direction of land and beached him at the feet of an admiring crowd i had thought of putting him under once or twice just to show him he was being rescued but decided against such a course as needlessly realistic as it was i fancy he had swallowed two or three hearty draughts of sea water the crowd was enthusiastic brave young feller said somebody i blushed this was fame jumped in he did sure enough an saved the gentleman be the old soul drownded that girt fule arry awk i was sorry for mr hawk popular opinion in which the professor wrathfully joined was against him i could not help thinking that my fellowconspirator did well to keep out of it all he was now sitting in the boat which he had restored to its normal position baling pensively with an old tin can to satire from the shore he paid no attention the professor stood up and stretched out his hand to me i grasped it mr garnet he said for all the world as if he had been the father of the heroine of hildas hero we parted recently in anger let me thank you for your gallant conduct and hope that bygones will be bygones illustration mr garnet he said we parted recently in anger i hope that bygones will be bygones like mr samuel weller i liked his conversation much it was werry pretty i came out strong i continued to hold his hand the crowd raised a sympathetic cheer i said professor the fault was mine show that you have forgiven me by coming up to the farm and putting on something dry an excellent idea me boy i am a little wet we walked briskly up the hill to the farm ukridge met us at the gate he diagnosed the situation rapidly youre all wet he said i admitted it professor derrick has had an unfortunate boating accident i explained and mr garnet heroically dived in in all his clothes and saved me life broke in the professor a hero sir achoo youre catching cold old horse said ukridge all friendliness and concern his little differences with the professor having vanished like thawed snow thisll never do come upstairs and get into something of garnets my own toggery wouldnt fit what come along come along ill get you some hot water mrs beale mrs beale we want a large can of hot water at once what yes immediately what very well then as soon as you can now then garny my boy out with the duds what do you think of this now professor a sweetly pretty thing in gray flannel heres a shirt get out of that wet toggery and mrs beale shall dry it dont attempt to tell me about it till youve changed socks socks forward show socks here you are coat try this blazer thats right thats right he bustled about till the professor was clothed then marched him downstairs and gave him a cigar now whats all this what happened the professor explained he was severe in his narration upon the unlucky mr hawk i was fishing mr ukridge with me back turned when i felt the boat rock violently from one side to the other to such an extent that i nearly lost me equilibrium and then the boat upset the mans a fool sir i could not see what had happened my back being turned as i say garnet must have seen what happened marmaduke i tried to smooth things over for mr hawk it was very sudden i said it seemed to me as if the man had got an attack of cramp that would account for it he has the reputation of being a most sober and trustworthy fellow never trust that sort of man said ukridge they are always the worst its plain to me that this man was beastly drunk and upset the boat while trying to do a dance the professor was in the best of tempers and i worked strenuously to keep him so my scheme had been so successful that its iniquity did not worry me i have noticed that this is usually the case in matters of this kind it is the bungled crime that brings remorse we must go round the links together one of these days mr garnet said the professor i have noticed you there on several occasions playing a strong game i have lately taken to using a schenectady putter it is wonderful what a difference it makes golf is a great bond of union we wandered about the grounds discussing the game the entente cordiale growing more firmly established every moment we must certainly arrange a meeting concluded the professor i shall be interested to see how we stand with regard to one another i have improved my game considerably since i have been down here considerably my only feat worthy of mention since i started the game i said has been to halve a round with angus mclurkin at st andrews the mclurkin asked the professor impressed yes but it was one of his very off days i fancy he must have had gout or something and i have certainly never played so well since still said the professor yes we must really arrange to meet with ukridge who was in one of his less tactless moods he became very friendly ukridges ready agreement with his strictures on the erring hawk had a great deal to do with this when a man has a grievance he feels drawn to those who will hear him patiently and sympathize ukridge was all sympathy the man is an unprincipled scoundrel he said and should be torn limb from limb take my advice cholmondeley and dont go out with him again show him that you are not a man to be trifled with the spilled child dreads the water what human life isnt safe with such men as hawk roaming about you are perfectly right sir the man can have no defense i shall not employ him again i felt more than a little guilty while listening to this duet on the subject of the man whom i had lured from the straight and narrow path but my attempts at excusing him were ill received indeed the professor showed such distinct signs of becoming heated that i abandoned my fellowconspirator to his fate with extreme promptness after all an addition to the stipulated reward one of these days would compensate him for any loss which he might sustain from the withdrawal of the professors custom mr harry hawk was in good enough case i would see that he did not suffer filled with these philanthropic feelings i turned once more to talk with the professor of niblicks and approach shots and holes done in three without a brassy we were a merry party at lunch a lunch fortunately in mrs beales best vein consisting of a roast chicken and sweets chicken had figured somewhat frequently of late on our daily bill of fare we saw the professor off the premises in his dried clothes and i turned back to put the fowls to bed in a happier frame of mind than i had known for a long time i whistled ragtime airs as i worked rum old buffer said ukridge meditatively my goodness i should have liked to see him in the water why do i miss these good things some emotions xii the fame which came to me through that gallant rescue was a little embarrassing i was a marked man did i walk through the village heads emerged from windows and eyes followed me out of sight did i sit on the beach groups formed behind me and watched in silent admiration i was the man of the moment if wed wanted an advertisement for the farm said ukridge on one of these occasions we couldnt have had a better one than you garny my boy you have brought us three distinct orders for eggs during the last week and ill tell you what it is we need all the orders we can get thatll bring us in ready money the farm is in a critical condition marmaduke the coffers are low decidedly low and ill tell you another thing im getting precious tired of living on nothing but chicken and eggs sos millie though she doesnt say so so am i i said and i dont feel like imitating your wifes proud reserve i never want to see a chicken again except alive for the last week monotony had been the keynote of our commissariat we had cold chicken and eggs for breakfast boiled chicken and eggs for lunch and roast chicken and eggs for dinner meals became a nuisance and mrs beale complained bitterly that we did not give her a chance she was a cook who would have graced an aldermans house and served up noble dinners for gourmets and here she was in this remote corner of the world ringing the changes on boiled chicken and roast chicken and boiled eggs and poached eggs mr whistler set to paint signboards for public houses might have felt the same restless discontent as for her husband the hired retainer he took life as tranquilly as ever and seemed to regard the whole thing as the most exhilarating farce he had ever been in i think he looked on ukridge as an amiable lunatic and was content to rough it a little in order to enjoy the privilege of observing his movements he made no complaints of the food when a man has supported life for a number of years on incessant army beef the monotony of daily chicken and eggs scarcely strikes him the fact is said ukridge these tradesmen round here seem to be a sordid suspicious lot they clamor for money he mentioned a few examples vickers the butcher had been the first to strike with the remark that he would like to see the color of mr ukridges money before supplying further joints dawlish the grocer had expressed almost exactly similar sentiments two days later and the ranks of these passive resisters had been receiving fresh recruits ever since to a man the tradesmen of lyme regis seemed as deficient in simple faith as they were in norman blood cant you pay some of them a little on account i suggested it would set them going again my dear old man said ukridge impressively we need every penny of ready money we can raise for the farm the place simply eats money that infernal roop let us in for i dont know what that insidious epidemic had indeed proved costly we had painted the throats of the chickens with the best turpentine at least ukridge and beale had but in spite of their efforts dozens had died and we had been obliged to sink much more money than was pleasant in restocking the run no said ukridge summing up these men must wait we cant help their troubles why good gracious it isnt as if theyd been waiting for the money long weve not been down here much over a month i never heard such a scandalous thing pon my word ive a good mind to go round and have a straight talk with one or two of them i come and settle down here and stimulate trade and give them large orders and they worry me with bills when they know im up to my eyes in work looking after the fowls one cant attend to everything this business is just now at its most crucial point it would be fatal to pay any attention to anything else with things as they are these scoundrels will get paid all in good time it is a peculiarity of situations of this kind that the ideas of debtor and creditor as to what constitutes good time never coincide i am afraid that despite the urgent need for strict attention to business i was inclined to neglect my duties about this time i had got into the habit of wandering off either to the links where i generally found the professor and sometimes phyllis or on long walks by myself there was one particular walk along the ware cliff through some of the most beautiful scenery i have ever set eyes on which more than any other suited my mood i would work my way through the woods till i came to a small clearing on the very edge of the cliff there i would sit by the hour somehow i found that my ideas flowed more readily in that spot than in any other my novel was taking shape it was to be called by the way if it ever won through to the goal of a title the brownhaired girl i had not been inside the professors grounds since the occasion when i had gone in through the boxwood hedge but on the afternoon following my financial conversation with ukridge i made my way thither after a toilet which from its length should have produced better results than it did not for four whole days had i caught so much as a glimpse of phyllis i had been to the links three times and had met the professor twice but on both occasions she had been absent i had not had the courage to ask after her i had an absurd idea that my voice or my manner would betray me in some way the professor was not at home nor was mr chase nor was miss norah derrick the lady i had met on the beach with the professor miss phyllis said the maid was in the garden i went into the garden she was sitting under the cedar by the tennis lawn reading she looked up as i approached to walk any distance under observation is one of the most trying things i know i advanced in bad order hoping that my hands did not really look as big as they felt the same remark applied to my feet in emergencies of this kind a diffident man could very well dispense with extremities i should have liked to be wheeled up in a bath chair i said it was a lovely afternoon after which there was a lull in the conversation i was filled with a horrid fear that i was boring her i had probably arrived at the very moment when she was most interested in her book she must i thought even now be regarding me as a nuisance and was probably rehearsing bitter things to say to the servant for not having had the sense to explain that she was out i er called in the hope of seeing professor derrick i said you would find him on the links she replied it seemed to me that she spoke wistfully oh it it doesnt matter i said it wasnt anything important this was true if the professor had appeared then and there i should have found it difficult to think of anything to say to him which would have accounted for my anxiety to see him we paused again how are the chickens mr garnet said she the situation was saved conversationally i am like a clockwork toy i have to be set going on the affairs of the farm i could speak fluently i sketched for her the progress we had made since her visit i was humorous concerning roop epigrammatic on the subject of the hired retainer and edwin then the cat did come down from the chimney said phyllis we both laughed and i can answer for myself felt the better for it he came down next day i said and made an excellent lunch off one of our best fowls he also killed another and only just escaped death himself at the hands of ukridge mr ukridge doesnt like him does he if he does he dissembles his love edwin is mrs ukridges pet he is the only subject on which they disagree edwin is certainly in the way on a chicken farm he has got over his fear of bob and is now perfectly lawless we have to keep a constant eye on him and have you had any success with the incubator i love incubators i have always wanted to have one of my own but we have never kept fowls the incubator has not done all that it should have done i said ukridge looks after it and i fancy his methods are not the right methods i dont know if i have got the figures absolutely correct but ukridge reasons on these lines he says you are supposed to keep the temperature up to a hundred and five degrees i think he said a hundred and five then the eggs are supposed to hatch out in a week or so he argues that you may just as well keep the temperature at seventytwo and wait a fortnight for your chickens i am certain theres a fallacy in the system somewhere because we never seem to get as far as the chickens but ukridge says his theory is mathematically sound and he sticks to it are you quite sure that the way you are doing it is the best way to manage a chicken farm i should very much doubt it i am a child in these matters i had only seen a chicken in its wild state once or twice before we came down here i had never dreamed of being an active assistant on a real farm the whole thing began like mr george ades fable of the author an author myself was sitting at his desk trying to turn out something that could be converted into breakfast food when a friend came in and sat down on the table and told him to go right on and not mind him did mr ukridge do that very nearly that he called at my rooms one beautiful morning when i was feeling desperately tired of london and overworked and dying for a holiday and suggested that i should come to lyme regis with him and help him farm chickens i have not regretted it it is a lovely place isnt it the loveliest i have ever seen how charming your garden is shall we go and look at it you have not seen the whole of it as she rose i saw her book which she had laid face downward on the grass beside her it was that same muchenduring copy of the maneuvers of arthur i was thrilled this patient perseverance must surely mean something she saw me looking at it did you draw pamela from anybody she asked suddenly i was glad now that i had not done so the wretched pamela once my pride was for some reason unpopular with the only critic about whose opinion i cared and had fallen accordingly from her pedestal as we wandered down the gravel paths she gave me her opinion of the book in the main it was appreciative i shall always associate the scent of yellow lubin with the higher criticism of course i dont know anything about writing books she said yes my tone implied or i hoped it did that she was an expert on books and that if she was not it didnt matter but i dont think you do your heroines well i have got the outsider my other novel bastable kirby six shillings satirical all about society of which i know less than i know about chicken farming slated by times and spectator well received by the pelican and continued phyllis lady maud is exactly the same as pamela in the maneuvers of arthur i thought you must have drawn both characters from some one you knew no i said no i am so glad said phyllis and then neither of us seemed to have anything to say my knees began to tremble i realized that the moment had arrived when my fate must be put to the touch and i feared that the moment was premature we cannot arrange these things to suit ourselves i knew that the time was not yet ripe but the magic scent of the yellow lubin was too much for me miss derrick i said hoarsely phyllis was looking with more intentness than the attractions of the flower justified at a rose she held in her hand the bees hummed in the lubin miss derrick i said and stopped again i say you people said a cheerful voice tea is ready halloo garnet how are you that medal arrived yet from the humane society i spun round mr tom chase was standing at the end of the path i grinned a sickly grin well tom said phyllis and there was i thought just the faintest trace of annoyance in her voice ive been bathing said mr chase oh i replied and i wish i added that youd drowned yourself but i added it silently to myself tea and tennis xiii met the professors late boatman on the cob said mr chase dissecting a chocolate cake clumsy man said phyllis i hope he was ashamed of himself i shall never forgive him for trying to drown papa my heart bled for mr henry hawk that modern martyr when i met him said tom chase he looked as if he had been trying to drown his sorrow as well i knew he drank said phyllis severely the very first time i saw him you might have warned the professor murmured mr chase he couldnt have upset the boat if he had been sober you never know he may have done it on purpose how absurd rather rough on the man arent you i said merely a suggestion continued mr chase airily ive been reading sensational novels lately and it seems to me that hawks cut out to be a minion probably some secret foe of the professors bribed him my heart stood still did he know i wondered and was this all a roundabout way of telling me that he knew the professor may be a member of an anarchist league or something and this is his punishment for refusing to assassinate the kaiser have another cup of tea tom and stop talking nonsense mr chase handed in his cup what gave me the idea that the upset was done on purpose was this i saw the whole thing from the ware cliff the spill looked to me just like dozens i had seen at malta why do they upset themselves on purpose at malta particularly inquired phyllis listen carefully my dear and youll know more about the ways of the navy that guards your coasts than you did before when men are allowed on shore at malta the owner has a fancy to see them snugly on board again at a certain reasonable hour after that hour any maltese policeman who brings them aboard gets one sovereign cash but he has to do all the bringing part of it on his own consequence is you see boats rowing out to the ship carrying men who have overstayed their leave and when they get near enough the ablebodied gentleman in custody jumps to his feet upsets the boat and swims to the gangway the policemen if they arent drowned they sometimes are race him and whichever gets there first wins if its the policeman he gets his sovereign if its the sailor he is considered to have arrived not in a state of custody and gets off easier what a judicious remark that was of the governor of north carolina to the governor of south carolina just one more cup please phyllis but how does all that apply i asked drymouthed why hawk upset the professor just as those maltese were upset theres a patent way of doing it furthermore by judicious questioning i found that hawk was once in the navy and stationed at malta now whos going to drag in sherlock holmes you dont really think i said feeling like a criminal in the dock when the case is going against him i think friend hawk has been renacting the joys of his vanished youth so to speak he ought to be prosecuted said phyllis blazing with indignation alas poor hawk nobodys safe with a man of that sort hiring out a boat oh miserable hawk but why on earth i asked as calmly as possible should he play a trick like that on professor derrick chase pure animal spirits probably or he may as i say be a minion i was hot all over i shall tell father that said phyllis in her most decided voice and see what he says i dont wonder at the man taking to drink after doing such a thing i i think youre making a mistake i said i never make mistakes mr chase replied i am called archibald the all right for i am infallible i propose to keep a reflective eye upon the jovial hawk he helped himself to another section of the chocolate cake havent you finished yet tom inquired phyllis im sure mr garnets getting tired of sitting talking here i shot out a polite negative mr chase explained with his mouth full that he had by no means finished chocolate cake it appeared was the dream of his life when at sea he was accustomed to lie awake o nights thinking of it you dont seem to realize he said that i have just come from a cruise on a torpedo boat there was such a sea on as a rule that cooking operations were entirely suspended and we lived on ham and sardines without bread how horrible on the other hand added mr chase philosophically it didnt matter much because we were all ill most of the time dont be nasty tom i was merely defending myself i hope mr hawk will be able to do as well when his turn comes my aim my dear phyllis is to show you in a series of impressionist pictures the sort of thing i have to go through when im not here then perhaps you wont rend me so savagely over a matter of five minutes lateness for breakfast five minutes it was three quarters of an hour and everything was simply frozen quite right too in weather like this youre a slave to convention phyllis you think breakfast ought to be hot so you always have it hot on occasion i prefer mine cold mine is the truer wisdom i have scoffed the better part as the good kipling has it you can give the cook my compliments phyllis and tell her gently for i dont wish the glad news to overwhelm her that i enjoyed that cake say that i shall be glad to hear from her again care for a game of tennis garnet what a pity norah isnt here said phyllis we could have had a four but she is at present wasting her sweetness on the desert air of yeovil you had better sit out and watch us phyllis tennis in this sort of weather is no job for the delicately nurtured feminine i will explain the finer points of my play as we go on look out particularly for the doherty backhanded slosh a winning stroke every time we proceeded to the tennis court i played with the sun in my eyes i might if i chose emphasize that fact and attribute my subsequent rout to it adding by way of solidifying the excuse that i was playing in a strange court with a borrowed racket and that my mind was preoccupied firstly with laffaire hawk secondly and chiefly with the gloomy thought that phyllis and my opponent seemed to be on fiendishly good terms with each other their manner at tea had been almost that of an engaged couple there was a thorough understanding between them i will not however take refuge behind excuses i admit without qualifying the statement that mr chase was too good for me i had always been under the impression that lieutenants in the royal navy were not brilliant at tennis i had met them at various houses but they had never shone conspicuously they had played an earnest unobtrusive game and generally seemed glad when it was over mr chase was not of this sort his service was bottled lightning his returns behaved like jumping crackers he won the first game in precisely four strokes he served i know now how soldiers feel under fire the balls whistled at me like live things only once did i take the service with the full face of the racket and then i seemed to be stopping a bullet i returned it into the net game said mr chase i felt a worm and no man phyllis i thought would probably judge my entire character from this exhibition a man she would reflect who could be so feeble and miserable a failure at tennis could not be good for much in any department of life she would compare me instructively with my opponent and contrast his dash and brilliance with my own inefficiency somehow the massacre was beginning to have a bad effect on my character my selfrespect was ebbing a little more of this and i should become crushed a mere human jelly it was my turn to serve service is my strong point at tennis i am inaccurate but vigorous and occasionally send in a quite unplayable shot one or two of these even at the expense of a fault or so and i might be permitted to retain at least a portion of my selfrespect i opened with two faults the sight of phyllis sitting calm and cool in her chair under the cedar unnerved me i served another fault and yet another here i say garnet observed mr chase plaintively do put me out of this hideous suspense im becoming a mere bundle of quivering ganglions i loath facetiousness in moments of stress i frowned austerely made no reply and served another fault my fifth matters had reached a crisis even if i had to lob it under hand i must send the ball over the net with this next stroke i restrained myself this time eschewing the careless vigor which had marked my previous efforts the ball flew in a slow semicircle and pitched inside the correct court at least i told myself i had not served a fault what happened then i cannot exactly say i saw my opponent spring forward like a panther and whirl his racket the next moment the back net was shaking violently and the ball was rolling swiftly along the ground on a return journey to the other court love forty said mr chase phyllis yes that was the doherty slosh i thought it must be said phyllis the game ended with another brace of faults in the third game i managed to score fifteen by the merest chance i returned one of his redhot serves and probably through surprise he failed to send it back again in the fourth and fifth games i omitted to score we began the sixth game and now for some reason i played really well i struck a little vein of brilliance i was serving and this time a proportion of my serves went over the net instead of trying to get through the score went from fifteen all to fortyfifteen hope began to surge through my veins if i could keep this up i might win yet the doherty slosh diminished my lead by fifteen the renshaw slam brought the score to deuce then i got in a really fine serve which beat him vantage in another slosh deuce another slam vantage out it was an awesome moment there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood i served fault i served again a beauty he returned it like a flash into the corner of the court with a supreme effort i got to it we rallied i was playing like a professor then whizz the doherty slosh had beaten me on the post game and said mr chase twirling his racket into the air and catching it by the handle good game that last one i turned to see what phyllis thought of it at the eleventh hour i had shown her of what stuff i was made she had disappeared looking for miss derrick said chase jumping the net and joining me in my court shes gone into the house when did she go at the end of the fifth game said chase gone to dress for dinner i suppose he continued it must be getting late i think i ought to be going too if you dont mind the professor gets a little restive if i keep him waiting for his daily bread great scott that watch cant be right what do you make it yes so do i i really think i must run you wont mind good night then see you tomorrow i hope i walked slowly out across the fields that same star in which i had confided on a former occasion was at its post it looked placid and cheerful it never got beaten by six games to love under the eyes of its particular lady star it was never cut out ignominiously by infernally capable lieutenants in his majestys navy no wonder it was cheerful it must be pleasant to be a star a council of war xiv the fact is said ukridge if things go on as they are now old horse we shall be in the cart this business wants bucking up we dont seem to be making headway what we want is time if only these scoundrels of tradesmen would leave us alone for a spell we might get things going properly but were hampered and worried and rattled all the time arent we millie yes dear you dont let me see the financial side of the thing i said except at intervals i didnt know we were in such a bad way the fowls look fit enough and edwin hasnt had one for a week edwin knows as well as possible when hes done wrong mr garnet said mrs ukridge he was so sorry after he had killed those other two yes said ukridge i saw to that as far as i can see i continued were going strong chicken for breakfast lunch and dinner is a shade monotonous but look at the business were doing we sold a whole heap of eggs last week its not enough garny my boy we sell a dozen eggs where we ought to be selling a hundred carting them off in trucks for the london market harrods and whiteleys and the rest of them are beginning to get on their hind legs and talk thats what theyre doing you see marmaduke theres no denying it we did touch them for a lot of things on account and they agreed to take it out in eggs they seem to be getting tired of waiting their last letter was quite pathetic said mrs ukridge i had a vision of an eggless london i seemed to see homes rendered desolate and lives embittered by the slump and millionaires bidding against one another for the few specimens ukridge had actually managed to dispatch to brompton and bayswater i told them in my last letter but three continued ukridge complainingly that i proposed to let them have the eggs on the times installment system and they said i was frivolous they said that to send thirteen eggs as payment for goods supplied to the value of twentyfive pounds one shilling and sixpence was mere trifling trifling when those thirteen eggs were absolutely all we had over that week after mrs beale had taken what she wanted for the kitchen i tell you what it is old boy that woman literally eats eggs the habit is not confined to her i said what i mean to say is she seems to bathe in them an impressive picture to one who knew mrs beale she says she needs so many for puddings dear said mrs ukridge i spoke to her about it yesterday and of course we often have omelets she cant make omelets without breakings eggs i urged she cant make them without breaking us said ukridge one or two more omelets and were done for another thing he continued that incubator thing wont work i dont know whats wrong with it perhaps its your dodge of letting down the temperature i had touched upon a tender point my dear fellow he said earnestly theres nothing the matter with my figures its a mathematical certainty whats the good of mathematics if not to help you work out that sort of thing no theres something wrong with the machine itself and i shall probably make a complaint to the people i got it from where did we get the incubator millie harrods i think dear yes it was harrods it came down with the first lot of things from there then said ukridge banging the table with his fist while his glasses flashed triumph weve got em write and answer that letter of theirs tonight millie sit on them yes dear and tell em that wed have sent em their confounded eggs weeks ago if only their rotten twopennyhapenny incubator had worked with any approach to decency or words to that effect i suggested add in a postscript that i consider that the manufacturer of the thing ought to rent a padded cell at earlswood and that they are scoundrels for palming off a groggy machine of that sort on me ill teach them yes dear the ceremony of opening the mornings letters at harrods ought to be full of interest and excitement tomorrow i said this dashing counter stroke served to relieve ukridges pessimistic mood he seldom looked on the dark side of things for long at a time he began now to speak hopefully of the future he planned out ingenious if somewhat impracticable improvements in the farm our fowls were to multiply so rapidly and consistently that within a short space of time dorsetshire would be paved with them our eggs were to increase in size till they broke records and got threeline notices in the items of interest column of the daily mail briefly each hen was to become a happy combination of rabbit and ostrich there is certainly a good time coming i said may it be soon meanwhile there remain the local tradesmen what of them ukridge relapsed once more into pessimism they are the worst of the lot he said i dont mind about the london men so much they only write and a letter or two hurts nobody but when it comes to butchers and bakers and grocers and fishmongers and fruiterers and what not coming up to ones house and dunning one in ones own garden well its a little hard what it may be wondered why before things came to such a crisis i had not placed my balance at the bank at the disposal of the senior partner for use on behalf of the firm the fact was that my balance was at the moment small i have not yet in the course of this narrative gone into my pecuniary position but i may state here that it was an inconvenient one it was big with possibilities but of ready cash there was but a meager supply my parents had been poor but i had a wealthy uncle uncles are notoriously careless of the comfort of their nephews mine was no exception he had views he was a great believer in matrimony as having married three wives not i should add simultaneously he had every right to be he was also of opinion that the less money the young bachelor possessed the better the consequence was that he announced his intention of giving me a handsome allowance from the day that i married but not an instant before till that glad day i would have to shift for myself and i am bound to admit that for an uncle it was a remarkably sensible idea i am also of opinion that it is greatly to my credit and a proof of my pure and unmercenary nature that i did not instantly put myself up to be raffled for or rush out into the streets and propose marriage to the first lady i met i was making enough with my pen to support myself and be it ever so humble there is something pleasant in a bachelor existence or so i had thought until very recently i had thus no great stake in ukridges chicken farm i had contributed a modest five pounds to the preliminary expenses and another five pounds after the roop incident but further i could not go with safety when his income is dependent on the whims of editors and publishers the prudent man keeps something up his sleeve against a sudden slump in his particular wares i did not wish to have to make a hurried choice between matrimony and the workhouse having exhausted the subject of finance or rather when i began to feel that it was exhausting me i took my clubs and strolled up the hill to the links to play off a match with a sportsman from the village i had entered some days previously a competition for a trophy i quote the printed notice presented by a local supporter of the game in which up to the present i was getting on nicely i had survived two rounds and expected to beat my present opponent which would bring me into the semifinal unless i had bad luck i felt that i ought to get into the final and win it as far as i could gather from watching the play of my rivals the professor was the best of them and i was convinced that i should have no difficulty with him but he had the most extraordinary luck at golf though he never admitted it he also exercised quite an uncanny influence on his opponent i have seen men put completely off their stroke by his good fortune i disposed of my man without difficulty we parted a little coldly he decapitated his brassy on the occasion of his striking dorsetshire instead of his ball and he was slow in recovering from the complex emotions which such an episode induces in the clubhouse i met the professor whose demeanor was a welcome contrast to that of my late antagonist the professor had just routed his opponent and so won through to the semifinal he was warm but jubilant i congratulated him and left the place phyllis was waiting outside she often went round the course with him good afternoon i said have you been round with the professor yes we must have been in front of you father won his match so he was telling me i was very glad to hear it did you win mr garnet yes pretty easily my opponent had bad luck all through bunkers seemed to have a magnetic attraction for him so you and father are both in the semifinal i hope you will play very badly thank you miss derrick i said yes it does sound rude doesnt it but father has set his heart on winning this year do you know that he has played in the final round two years running now really both times he was beaten by the same man who was that mr derrick plays a much better game than anybody i have seen on these links it was nobody who is here now it was a colonel jervis he has not come to lyme regis this year that is why father is hopeful logically i said he ought to be certain to win yes but you see you were not playing last year mr garnet oh the professor can make rings round me i said what did you go round in today we were playing match play and only did the first dozen holes but my average round is somewhere in the late eighties the best father has ever done is ninety and that was only once so you see mr garnet theres going to be another tragedy this year you make me feel a perfect brute but its more than likely you must remember that i shall fail miserably if i ever do play your father in the final there are days when i play golf very badly phyllis smiled do you really have your off days nearly always there are days when i slice with my driver as if it were a bread knife really and when i couldnt putt to hit a haystack then i hope it will be on one of those days that you play father i hope so too i said you hope so yes but dont you want to win i should prefer to please you mr lewis waller could not have said it better really how very unselfish of you mr garnet she replied with a laugh i had no idea that such chivalry existed i thought a golfer would sacrifice anything to win a game most things and trample on the feelings of anybody not everybody i said at this point the professor joined us xv the arrival of nemesis some people do not believe in presentiments they attribute that curious feeling that something unpleasant is going to happen to such mundane causes as liver or a chill or the weather for my own part i think there is more in the matter than the casual observer might imagine i awoke three days after my meeting with the professor at the clubhouse filled with a dull foreboding somehow i seemed to know that that day was going to turn out badly for me it may have been liver or a chill but it was certainly not the weather the morning was perfect the most glorious of a glorious summer there was a haze over the valley and out to sea which suggested a warm noon when the sun should have begun the serious duties of the day the birds were singing in the trees and breakfasting on the lawn while edwin seated on one of the flower beds watched them with the eye of a connoisseur occasionally when a sparrow hopped in his direction he would make a sudden spring and the bird would fly away to the other side of the lawn i had never seen edwin catch a sparrow i believe they looked on him as a bit of a crank and humored him by coming within springing distance just to keep him amused dashing young cock sparrows would show off before their particular hen sparrows and earn a cheap reputation for daredeviltry by going within so many yards of edwins lair and then darting away bob was in his favorite place on the gravel i took him with me down to the cob to watch me bathe whats the matter with me today robert old man i asked him as i dried myself he blinked lazily but contributed no suggestion its no good looking bored i went on because im going to talk about myself however much it bores you here am i as fit as a prize fighter living in the open air for i dont know how long eating good plain food bathing every morning sea bathing mind you and yet whats the result i feel beastly bob yawned and gave a little whine yes i said i know im in love but that cant be it because i was in love just as much a week ago and i felt all right then but isnt she an angel bob eh isnt she but how about tom chase dont you think hes a dangerous man he calls her by her christian name you know and behaves generally as if she belonged to him and then he sees her every day while i have to trust to meeting her at odd times and then i generally feel like such a fool i cant think of anything to talk about except golf and the weather he probably sings duets with her after dinner and you know what comes of duets after dinner here bob who had been trying for some time to find a decent excuse for getting away pretended to see something of importance at the other end of the cob and trotted off to investigate it leaving me to finish dressing by myself of course i said to myself it may be merely hunger i may be all right after breakfast but at present i seem to be working up for a really fine fit of the blues i whistled for bob and started for home on the beach i saw the professor some little distance away and waved my towel in a friendly manner he made no reply of course it was possible that he had not seen me but for some reason his attitude struck me as ominous as far as i could see he was looking straight at me and he was not a shortsighted man i could think of no reason why he should cut me we had met on the links on the previous morning and he had been friendliness itself he had called me me dear boy supplied me with ginger beer at the clubhouse and generally behaved as if he had been david and i jonathan yet in certain moods we are inclined to make mountains out of molehills and i went on my way puzzled and uneasy with a distinct impression that i had received the cut direct i felt hurt what had i done that providence should make things so unpleasant for me it would be a little hard as ukridge would have said if after all my trouble the professor had discovered some fresh crow to pluck with me perhaps ukridge had been irritating him again i wished he would not identify me so completely with ukridge i could not be expected to control the man then i reflected that they could hardly have met in the few hours between my parting from the professor at the clubhouse and my meeting with him on the beach ukridge rarely left the farm when he was not working among the fowls he was lying on his back in the paddock resting his massive mind i came to the conclusion that after all the professor had not seen me im an idiot bob i said as we turned in at the farm gate and i let my imagination run away with me bob wagged his tail in approval of the sentiment breakfast was ready when i got in there was a cold chicken on the sideboard deviled chicken on the table and a trio of boiled eggs and a dish of scrambled eggs i helped myself to the latter and sat down ukridge was sorting the letters morning garny he said one for you millie its from aunt elizabeth said mrs ukridge looking at the envelope wish shed inclose a check she could spare it i think she would dear if she knew how much it was needed but i dont like to ask her shes so curious and says such horrid things she does said ukridge gloomily he probably spoke from experience two for you sebastian all the rest for me eighteen of them and all bills he spread them out on the table like a pack of cards and drew one at a venture whiteleys he said getting jumpy are in receipt of my favor of the th inst and are at a loss to understand all sorts of things would like something on account grasping of them i said they seem to think im doing it for fun how can i let them have their money when there isnt any sounds difficult heres one from dorchester smith the man i got the gramophone from wants to know when im going to settle up for sixteen records sordid man i wanted to get on with my own correspondence but ukridge was one of those men who compel ones attention when they are talking the chicken men the dealer people you know want me to pay up for the first lot of hens considering that they all died of roop and that i was going to send them back anyhow after id got them to hatch out a few chickens i call that cool i cant afford to pay heavy sums for birds which die off quicker than i can get them in it isnt business it was not my business at any rate so i switched off my attention from ukridges troubles and was opening the first of my two letters when an exclamation from mrs ukridge made me look up she had dropped the letter she had been reading and was staring indignantly in front of her there were two little red spots on her cheeks i shall never speak to aunt elizabeth again she said whats the matter old chap inquired ukridge affectionately glancing up from his pile of bills aunt elizabeth been getting on your nerves again whats she been saying this time mrs ukridge left the room with a sob ukridge sprang at the letter if that demon doesnt stop writing letters and upsetting millie i shall lynch her he said i had never seen him so genuinely angry he turned over the pages till he came to the passage which had caused the trouble listen to this garnet im sorry but not surprised to hear that the chicken farm is not proving a great success i think you know my opinion of your husband he is perfectly helpless in any matter requiring the exercise of a little common sense and business capability i like that pon my soul i like that youve known me longer than she has garny and you know that its just in matters requiring common sense that i come out strong what of course old man i replied dutifully the woman must be a fool thats what she calls me two lines farther on no wonder millie was upset why cant these cats leave people alone o woman woman i threw in helpfully always interfering beastly and backbiting awful i shant stand it i shouldnt look here on the next page she calls me a gaby its time you took a strong hand and in the very next sentence refers to me as a perfect guffin whats a guffin garny old boy it sounds indecent i believe its actionable i shouldnt wonder ukridge rushed to the door millie he shouted no answer he slammed the door and i heard him dashing upstairs i turned with a sense of relief to my letters one was from lickford it bore a cornish postmark i glanced through it and laid it aside for a more exhaustive perusal later on the other was in a strange handwriting i looked at the signature patrick derrick this was queer what had the professor to say to me the next moment my heart seemed to spring to my throat sir the letter began a pleasant cheery beginning then it got off the mark so to speak like lightning there was no sparring for an opening no dignified parade of set phrases leading up to the main point it was the letter of a man who was almost too furious to write it gave me the impression that if he had not written it he would have been obliged to have taken some very violent form of exercise by way of relief to his soul you will be good enough he wrote to look on our acquaintance as closed i have no wish to associate with persons of your stamp if we should happen to meet you will be good enough to treat me as a total stranger as i shall treat you and if i may be allowed to give you a word of advice i should recommend you in future when you wish to exercise your humor to do so in some less practical manner than by bribing boatmen to upset your friends crossed out thickly and acquaintances substituted if you require further enlightenment in this matter the inclosed letter may be of service to you with which he remained mine faithfully patrick derrick the inclosed letter was from one jane muspratt it was bright and interesting dear sir my harry mr hawk sas to me how it was him upseting the boat and you not because he is not steddy in a boat which he is no man more so in lyme regis but because one of the gentmen what keeps chikkens up the hill the little one mr garnick his name is says to him hawk ill give you a sovrin to upset mr derrick in your boat and my harry being esily led was took in and did but hes sory now and wishes he hadnt and he sas hell niver do a prackticle joke again for anyone even for a bank note yours obedly jane muspratt o woman woman at the bottom of everything history is full of cruel tragedies caused by the lethal sex who lost mark antony the world a woman who let samson in so atrociously woman again why did bill bailey leave home once more because of a woman and here was i jerry garnet harmless wellmeaning writer of minor novels going through the same old mill i cursed jane muspratt what chance had i with phyllis now could i hope to win over the professor again i cursed jane muspratt for the second time my thoughts wandered to mr harry hawk the villain the scoundrel what business had he to betray me well i could settle with him the man who lays a hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness is justly disliked by society so the woman muspratt culpable as she was was safe from me but what of the man hawk there no such considerations swayed me i would interview the man hawk i would give him the most hectic ten minutes of his career i would say things to him the recollection of which would make him start up shrieking in his bed in the small hours of the night i would arise and be a man and slay him take him grossly full of bread with all his crimes broadblown as flush as may at gaming swearing or about some act that had no relish of salvation in it the demon my life ruined my future gray and blank my heart shattered and why because of the scoundrel hawk phyllis would meet me in the village on the cob on the links and pass by as if i were the invisible man and why because of the reptile hawk the worm hawk the varlet hawk i crammed my hat on and hurried out of the house toward the village a chance meeting xvi i roamed the place in search of the varlet for the space of half an hour and after having drawn all his familiar haunts found him at length leaning over the sea wall near the church gazing thoughtfully into the waters below i confronted him well i said youre a beauty arent you he eyed me owlishly even at this early hour i was grieved to see he showed signs of having looked on the bitter while it was brown beauty he echoed what have you got to say for yourself it was plain that he was engaged in pulling his faculties together by some laborious process known only to himself at present my words conveyed no meaning to him he was trying to identify me he had seen me before somewhere he was certain but he could not say where or who i was i want to know i said what induced you to be such an abject idiot as to let our arrangement get known i spoke quietly i was not going to waste the choicer flowers of speech on a man who was incapable of understanding them later on when he had awakened to a sense of his position i would begin really to talk to him he continued to stare at me then a sudden flash of intelligence lit up his features mr garnick he said youve got it at last he stretched out a huge hand i want to know i said distinctly what youve got to say for yourself after letting our affair with the professor become public property he paused a while in thought dear sir he said at last as if he were dictating a letter dear sir i owe you ex exp you do said i grimly i should like to hear it dear sir listen me go on then you came me you said hawk hawk ol fren listen me you tip this ol bufflehead into sea you said an gormed if i dont give ee a gould savrin thats what you said me isnt that what you said me i did not deny it ve well i said you right i said i tipped the ol soul into sea and i got the gould savrin yes you took care of that all this is quite true but its beside the point we are not disputing about what happened what i want to know for the third time is what made you let the cat out of the bag why couldnt you keep quiet about it he waved his hand dear sir he replied this way listen me it was a tragic story that he unfolded my wrath ebbed as i listened after all the fellow was not so greatly to blame i felt that in his place i should have acted as he had done fate was culpable and fate alone it appeared that he had not come well out of the matter of the accident i had not looked at it hitherto from his point of view while the rescue had left me the popular hero it had had quite the opposite result for him he had upset his boat and would have drowned his passenger said public opinion if the young hero from london myself had not plunged in and at the risk of his life brought the professor to shore consequently he was despised by all as an inefficient boatman he became a laughing stock the local wags made laborious jests when he passed they offered him fabulous sums to take their worst enemies out for a row with him they wanted to know when he was going to school to learn his business in fact they behaved as wags do and always have done at all times all the world over now all this mr hawk it seemed would have borne cheerfully and patiently for my sake or at any rate for the sake of the good golden sovereign i had given him but a fresh factor appeared in the problem complicating it grievously to wit miss jane muspratt she said me explained mr hawk with pathos harry awk she said yeoum a girt fule an i dont marry noone as is aint to be trusted in a boat by hisself and what has jokes made about him by that tom leigh i punched tom leigh observed mr hawk parenthetically so she said me yeou can go away an i dont want to see yeou again this heartless conduct on the part of miss muspratt had had the natural result of making him confess all in selfdefense and she had written to the professor the same night i forgave mr hawk i think he was hardly sober enough to understand for he betrayed no emotion it is fate hawk i said simply fate there is a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will and its no good grumbling yiss said mr hawk after chewing this sentiment for a while in silence so she said me hawk she said like that youre a girt fule thats all right i replied i quite understand as i say its simply fate goodby and i left him as i was going back i met the professor and phyllis they passed me without a look i wandered on in quite a fervor of selfpity i was in one of those moods when life suddenly seems to become irksome when the future stretches blank and gray in front of one in such a mood it is imperative that one should seek distraction the shining example of mr harry hawk did not lure me taking to drink would be a nuisance work was what i wanted i would toil like a navvy all day among the fowls separating them when they fought gathering in the eggs when they laid chasing them across country when they got away and even if necessity arose painting their throats with turpentine when they were stricken with roop then after dinner when the lamps were lit and mrs ukridge petted edwin and sewed and ukridge smoked cigars and incited the gramophone to murder mumbling mose i would steal away to my bedroom and write and write and write and go on writing till my fingers were numb and my eyes refused to do their duty and when time had passed i might come to feel that it was all for the best a man must go through the fire before he can write his masterpiece we learn in suffering what we teach in song what we lose on the swings we make up on the roundabouts jerry garnet the man might become a depressed hopeless wreck with the iron planted irremovably in his soul but jeremy garnet the author should turn out such a novel of gloom that strong critics would weep and the public jostle for copies till mudies doorways became a shambles thus might i some day feel that all this anguish was really a blessing effectively disguised but i doubted it we were none of us very cheerful now at the farm even ukridges spirit was a little daunted by the bills which poured in by every post it was as if the tradesmen of the neighborhood had formed a league and were working in concert or it may have been due to thought waves little accounts came not in single spies but in battalions the popular demand for a sight of the color of his money grew daily every morning at breakfast he would give us fresh bulletins of the state of mind of each of our creditors and thrill us with the announcement that whiteleys were getting cross and harrods jumpy or that the bearings of dawlish the grocer were becoming overheated we lived in a continual atmosphere of worry chicken and nothing but chicken at meals and chicken and nothing but chicken between meals had frayed our nerves an air of defeat hung over the place we were a beaten side and we realized it we had been playing an uphill game for nearly two months and the strain was beginning to tell ukridge became uncannily silent mrs ukridge though she did not understand i fancy the details of the matter was worried because ukridge was mrs beale had long since been turned into a soured cynic by the lack of chances vouchsafed her for the exercise of her art and as for me i have never since spent so profoundly miserable a week i was not even permitted the anodyne of work there seemed to be nothing to do on the farm the chickens were quite happy and only asked to be let alone and allowed to have their meals at regular intervals and every day one or more of their number would vanish into the kitchen and mrs beale would serve up the corpse in some cunning disguise and we would try to delude ourselves into the idea that it was something altogether different there was one solitary gleam of variety in our menu an editor sent me a check for a guinea for a set of verses we cashed that check and trooped round the town in a body laying out the money we bought a leg of mutton and a tongue and sardines and pineapple chunks and potted meat and many other noble things and had a perfect banquet after that we relapsed into routine again deprived of physical labor with the exception of golf and bathing trivial sports compared with work in the fowl runs at its hardest i tried to make up for it by working at my novel it refused to materialize i felt like the man in the fable as if some one had played a mean trick on me and substituted for my brain a side order of cauliflower by no manner of means could i get the plot to shape itself i could not detach my mind from my own painful case instead of thinking of my characters i sat in my chair and thought miserably of phyllis the only progress i achieved was with my villain i drew him from the professor and made him a blackmailer he had several other social defects but that was his profession that was the thing he did really well it was on one of the many occasions on which i had sat in my room pen in hand through the whole of a lovely afternoon with no better result than a slight headache that i bethought me of that little paradise on the ware cliff hung over the sea and backed by green woods i had not been there for sometime owing principally to an entirely erroneous idea that i could do more solid work sitting in a straight hard chair at a table than lying on soft turf with the sea wind in my eyes but now the desire to visit that little clearing again drove me from my room in the drawingroom below the gramophone was dealing brassily with mister blackman outside the sun was just thinking of setting the ware cliff was the best medicine for me what does kipling say and soon you will find that the sun and the wind and the djinn of the garden too have lightened the hump cameelious hump the hump that is black and blue his instructions include digging with a hoe and a shovel also but i could omit that the sun and wind were what i needed i took the upper road in certain moods i preferred it to the path along the cliff i walked fast the exercise was soothing to reach my favorite clearing i had to take to the fields on the left and strike down hill in the direction of the sea i hurried down the narrow path i broke into the clearing at a jog trot and stood panting and at the same moment looking cool and beautiful in her white dress phyllis entered it from the other side phyllis without the professor of a sentimental nature xvii she was wearing a panama and she carried a sketching block and camp stool good evening i said good evening said she it is curious how different the same words can sound when spoken by different people my good evening might have been that of a man with a particularly guilty conscience caught in the act of doing something more than usually ignoble she spoke like a somewhat offended angel its a lovely evening i went on pluckily very the sunset yes er she raised a pair of blue eyes devoid of all expression save a faint suggestion of surprise gazed through me for a moment at some object a couple of thousand miles away and lowered them again leaving me with a vague feeling that there was something wrong with my personal appearance very calmly she moved to the edge of the cliff arranged her camp stool and sat down neither of us spoke a word i watched her while she filled a little mug with water from a little bottle opened her paint box selected a brush and placed her sketching block in position she began to paint now by all the laws of good taste i should before this have made a dignified exit when a lady shows a gentleman that his presence is unwelcome it is up to him as an american friend of mine pithily observed to me on one occasion to get busy and chase himself and see if he can make the tall timber in two jumps in other words to retire it was plain that i was not regarded as an essential ornament of this portion of the ware cliff by now if i had been the perfect gentleman i ought to have been a quarter of a mile away but there is a definite limit to what a man can do i remained the sinking sun flung a carpet of gold across the sea phylliss hair was tinged with it little waves tumbled lazily on the beach below except for the song of a distant blackbird running through its repertory before retiring for the night everything was silent especially phyllis she sat there dipping and painting and dipping again with never a word for me standing patiently and humbly behind her miss derrick i said she half turned her head yes one of the most valuable things which a lifetime devoted to sport teaches a man is never play the goose game bold attack is the safest rule in nine cases out of ten wherever you are and whatever you may be doing if you are batting attack the ball if you are boxing get after your man if you are talking go to the point why wont you speak to me i said i dont understand you why wont you speak to me i think you know mr garnet it is because of that boat accident accident episode i amended she went on painting in silence from where i stood i could see her profile her chin was tilted her expression was determined is it i said need we discuss it not if you do not wish i paused but i added i should have liked a chance to defend myself what glorious sunsets there have been these last few days i believe we shall have this sort of weather for another month i should not have thought that possible the glass is going up i said i was not talking about the weather it was dull of me to introduce such a wornout topic you said you could defend yourself i said i should like the chance to do so then you shall have it that is very kind of you thank you is there any reason for gratitude every reason go on mr garnet i can listen while i paint but please sit down i dont like being talked to from a height i sat down on the grass in front of her feeling as i did so that the change of position in a manner clipped my wings it is difficult to speak movingly while sitting on the ground instinctively i avoided eloquence standing up i might have been pathetic and pleading sitting down i was compelled to be matter of fact you remember of course the night you and professor derrick dined with us when i say dined i use the word in a loose sense for a moment i thought she was going to smile we were both thinking of edwin but it was only for a moment and then her face grew cold once more and the chin resumed its angle of determination yes she said you remember the unfortunate ending of the festivities well i naturally wished to mend matters it occurred to me that an excellent way would be by doing your father a service it was seeing him fishing that put the idea of a boat accident into my head i hoped for a genuine boat accident but those things only happen when one does not want them so i determined to engineer one you didnt think of the shock to my father i did it worried me very much but you upset him all the same reluctantly she looked up and our eyes met i could detect no trace of forgiveness in hers you behaved abominably she said i played a risky game and i lost and i shall now take the consequences with luck i should have won i did not have luck and i am not going to grumble about it but i am grateful to you for letting me explain i should not have liked you to go on thinking that i played practical jokes on my friends that is all i have to say i think it was kind of you to listen goodby miss derrick i got up are you going why not please sit down again but you wish to be alone please sit down there was a flush on the fair cheek turned toward me and the chin was tilted higher i sat down to westward the sky had changed to the hue of a bruised cherry the sun had sunk below the horizon and the sea looked cold and leaden the blackbird had long since gone to bed i am glad you told me mr garnet she dipped her brush in the water because i dont like to think badly of people she bent her head over her painting though i still think you behaved very wrongly and i am afraid my father will never forgive you for what you did her father as if he counted but you do i said eagerly i think you are less to blame than i thought you were at first no more than that you cant expect to escape all consequences you did a very stupid thing consider the temptation the sky was a dull gray now it was growing dusk the grass on which i sat was wet with dew i stood up isnt it getting a little dark for painting i said are you sure you wont catch cold its very damp perhaps it is and it is late too she shut her paint box and emptied the little mug on the grass you will let me carry your things i said i think she hesitated but only for a moment i possessed myself of the camp stool and we started on our homeward journey we were both silent the spell of the quiet summer evening was on us and all the air a solemn stillness holds she said softly i love this cliff mr garnet its the most soothing place in the world i have found it so this evening she glanced at me quickly youre not looking well she said are you sure you are not overworking yourself no its not that somehow we had stopped as if by agreement and were facing each other there was a look in her eyes i had never seen there before the twilight hung like a curtain between us and the world we were alone together in a world of our own it is because i had displeased you i said she laughed nervously i have loved you ever since i first saw you i said doggedly ukridge gives me advice xviii hours after or so it seemed to me we reached the spot at which our ways divided we stopped and i felt as if i had been suddenly cast back into the workaday world from some distant and pleasanter planet i think phyllis must have had something of the same sensation for we both became on the instant intensely practical and businesslike but about your father i said briskly i was not even holding her hand thats the difficulty he wont give his consent im afraid he wouldnt dream of it you cant persuade him i can in most things but not in this you see even if nothing had happened he wouldnt like to lose me just yet because of norah norah my sister shes going to be married in october i wonder if we shall ever be as happy as they will i laughed scornfully happy they will be miserable compared with us not that i know who the man is why tom of course do you mean to say you really didnt know tom tom chase of course i gasped well im hanged i said when i think of the torments ive been through because of that wretched man and all for nothing i dont know what to say dont you like tom very much i always did but i was awfully jealous of him you werent how silly of you of course i was he was always about with you and called you phyllis and generally behaved as if you and he were the heroine and hero of a musical comedy so what else could i think i heard you singing duets after dinner once i drew the worst conclusions when was that it was shortly after ukridge had got on your fathers nerves and nipped our acquaintance in the bud i used to come every night to the hedge opposite your drawingroom window and brood there by the hour poor old boy hoping to hear you sing and when you did sing and he joined in all flat i used to scold youll probably find most of the bark worn off the tree i leaned against poor old man still its all over now isnt it and when i was doing my very best to show off before you at tennis you went away just as i got into form im very sorry but i couldnt know could i i thought you always played like that i know i knew you would it nearly turned my hair white i didnt see how a girl could ever care for a man who was so bad at tennis one doesnt love a man because hes good at tennis what does a girl see to love in a man i inquired abruptly and paused on the verge of a great discovery oh i dont know she replied most unsatisfactorily and i could draw no views from her but about father said she what are we to do he objects to me hes perfectly furious with you blow blow i said thou winter wind thou art not so unkind hell never forgive you as mans ingratitude i saved his life at the risk of my own why i believe ive got a legal claim on him whoever heard of a man having his life saved and not being delighted when his preserver wanted to marry his daughter your father is striking at the very root of the shortstory writers little earnings he mustnt be allowed to do it jerry i started again i said what say it again do please now very well jerry it was the first time you had called me by my christian name i dont suppose youve the remotest notion how splendid it sounds when you say it there is something poetical something almost holy about it jerry please say on do be sensible dont you see how serious this is we must think how we can make father consent all right i said well tackle the point im sorry to be frivolous but im so happy i cant keep it all in ive got you and i cant think of anything else try ill pull myself together now say on once more we cant marry without fathers consent why not i said not having a marked respect for the professors whims gretna green is out of date but there are registrars i hate the very idea of a registrar she said with decision besides well poor father would never get over it weve always been such friends if i married against his wishes he would oh you know not let me come near him again and not write to me and he would hate it all the time he was doing it he would be bored to death without me anybody would i said because you see norah has never been quite the same she has spent such a lot of her time on visits to people that she and father dont understand each other so well as he and i do she would try and be nice to him but she wouldnt know him as i do and besides she will be with him such a little now shes going to be married but look here i said this is absurd you say your father would never see you again and so on if you married me why its nonsense it isnt as if i were a sort of social outcast we were the best of friends till that man hawk gave me away like that i know but hes very obstinate about some things you see he thinks the whole thing has made him look ridiculous and it will take him a long time to forgive you for that i realized the truth of this one can pardon any injury to oneself unless it hurts ones vanity moreover even in a genuine case of rescue the rescued man must always feel a little aggrieved with his rescuer when he thinks the matter over in cold blood he must regard him unconsciously as the super regards the actor manager indebted to him for the means of supporting existence but grudging him the lime light and the center of the stage and the applause besides everyone instinctively dislikes being under an obligation which he can never wholly repay and when a man discovers that he has experienced all these mixed sensations for nothing as the professor had done his wrath is likely to be no slight thing taking everything into consideration i could not but feel that it would require more than a little persuasion to make the professor bestow his blessing with that genial warmth which we like to see in our fathersinlaw elect you dont think i said that time the great healer and so on he wont feel kindlier disposed toward me say in a months time of course he might said phyllis but she spoke doubtfully he strikes me from what i have seen of him as a man of moods i might do something one of these days which would completely alter his views we will hope for the best about telling father need we tell him i asked yes we must i couldnt bear to think that i was keeping it from him i dont think ive ever kept anything from him in my life nothing bad i mean you count this among your darker crimes then i was looking at it from fathers point of view he will be awfully angry i dont know how i shall begin telling him good heavens i cried you surely dont think im going to let you do that keep safely out of the way while you tell him not much im coming back with you now and well break the bad news together no not tonight he may be tired and rather cross we had better wait till tomorrow you might speak to him in the morning where shall i find him he is certain to go to the beach before breakfast to bathe good tomorrow do thy worst for i have lived today ill be there ukridge i said when i got back can you give me audience for a brief space i want your advice this stirred him like a trumpet blast when a man is in the habit of giving unsolicited counsel to everyone he meets it is as invigorating as an electric shock to him to be asked for it spontaneously whats up old horse he asked eagerly ill tell you what to do get on to it bang it out here lets go into the garden i approved of this i can always talk more readily in the dark and i did not wish to be interrupted by the sudden entrance of the hired retainer or mrs beale we walked down to the paddock ukridge lit a cigar im in love ukridge i said what more im engaged a huge hand whistled through the darkness and smote me heavily between the shoulder blades thanks i said that felt congratulatory by jove old boy i wish you luck pon my word i do fancy you engaged best thing in the world for you never knew what happiness was till i married a man wants a helpmeet and this man i said seems likely to go on wanting thats where i need your advice im engaged to miss derrick miss derrick he spoke as if he hardly knew whom i meant you cant have forgotten her good heavens what eyes some men have why if id only seen her once i should have remembered her all my life i know now she came to dinner here with her father that fat little buffer as you were careful to call him at the time thereby starting all the trouble you fished him out of the water afterwards quite right why its a perfect romance old horse its like the stories you read and write but they all end happily there is none my brave young preserver to whom i would more willingly intrust my daughters happiness unfortunately in my little drama the heavy father seems likely to forget his cue the old man wont give his consent probably not but why whats the matter with you if you marry youll come into your uncles money and all that true affluence stares me in the face and you fished him out of the water after previously chucking him in what at any rate by proxy i explained ukridge i regret to say laughed you vagabond he said pon my word old horse to look at you one would never have thought youd have had it in you i cant help looking respectable what are you going to do about it the old mans got it up against you good and strong theres no doubt of that thats where i wanted your advice youre a man of resource what would you do if you were in my place ukridge tapped me impressively on the shoulder marmaduke he said theres one thing thatll carry you through any mess and that is cheek my boy cheek gall why take my case i never told you how i came to marry did i i thought not well it was this way youve heard us mention millies aunt elizabeth what well then when i tell you that she was millies nearest relative and it was her consent i had to gather youll see that it wasnt a walkover well i said first time i saw millie was in a firstclass carriage on the underground id got a thirdclass ticket by the way we werent alone it was five a side but she sat opposite me and i fell in love with her there and then we both got out at south kensington i followed her she went to a house in thurloe square i waited outside and thought it over i had got to get into that house and make her acquaintance so i rang the bell is lady lichenhall at home i asked you note the artfulness my asking for lady lichenhall made em think i was one of the upper ten what how were you dressed i could not help asking oh it was one of my frockcoat days id been to see a man about tutoring his son there was nothing the matter with my appearance no said the servant nobody of that name lives here this is lady lakenheaths house so you see i had luck at the start because the two names were a bit alike well i got the servant to show me in somehow and once in you can wager i talked for all i was worth kept up a flow of conversation about being misdirected and coming to the wrong house and so on went away and called a few days later called regularly met em at every theater they went to and bowed and finally got away with millie before her aunt could tell what was happening or who i was or what i was doing or anything and whats the moral i said why go in hard rush em bustle em dont give em a moments rest dont play the goose game i said with that curious thrill we feel when somebodys independent view of a matter coincides with ones own thats it dont play the goose game dont give em time to think why if id given millies aunt time to think where should we have been not at lyme regis together ill bet ukridge i said you inspire me you would inspire a caterpillar i will go to the professor i was going anyhow but now i shall go aggressively and bustle him i will surprise a fathers blessing out of him if i have to do it with a crowbar i ask papa xix reviewing the matter later i see that i made a poor choice of time and place but at the moment this did not strike me it is a simple thing i reflected for a man to pass another by haughtily and without recognition when they meet on dry land but when the said man being an indifferent swimmer is accosted in the water and out of his depth the feat becomes a hard one when therefore having undressed on the cob on the following morning i spied in the distance as i was about to dive the gray head of the professor bobbing on the face of the waters i did not hesitate i plunged in and swam rapidly toward him his face was turned in the opposite direction when i came up with him and it was soon evident that he had not observed my approach for when treading water easily in his immediate rear i wished him good morning in my most conciliatory tones he stood not upon the order of his sinking but went under like so much pig iron i waited courteously until he rose to the surface once more when i repeated my remark he expelled the last remnant of water from his mouth with a wrathful splutter and cleared his eyes with the back of his hand the water is delightfully warm i said oh its you said he and i could not cheat myself into believing that he spoke cordially you are swimming splendidly this morning i said feeling that an ounce of flattery is often worth a pound of rhetoric if i added you will allow me to say so i will not he snapped i here a small wave noticing that his mouth was open walked in i wish he resumed warmly as i said in me letter to have nothing to do with you i consider yeve behaved in a manner that can only be described as abominable and i will thank ye to leave me alone but allow me i will not allow ye sir i will allow ye nothing is it not enough to make me the laughingstock the butt sir of this town without pursuing me in this manner when i wish to enjoy a quiet swim his remarks which i have placed on paper as if they were continuous and uninterrupted were punctuated in reality by a series of gasps and puffings as he received and ejected the successors of the wave he had swallowed at the beginning of our little chat the art of conducting bright conversation while in the water is not given to every swimmer this he seemed to realize for as if to close the interview he proceeded to make his way as quickly as he could toward the shore using my best stroke i shot beyond him and turned treading water as before but professor i said one moment i was growing annoyed with the man i could have ducked him but for the reflection that my prospects of obtaining his consent to my engagement with phyllis would hardly have been enhanced thereby no more convincing proof of my devotion can be given than this that i did not seize that little man by the top of his head thrust him under water and keep him there i restrained myself i was suave soothing even but professor i said one moment not one he spluttered go away sir i will have nothing to say to you i shant keep you a minute he had been trying all this while to pass me and escape to the shore but i kept always directly in front of him he now gave up the attempt and came to standstill well he said without preamble i gave out the text of the address i was about to deliver to him i love your daughter phyllis mr derrick she loves me in fact we are engaged i said he went under as if he had been seized with cramp it was a little trying having to argue with a man of whom one could not predict with certainty that at any given moment he would not be under water it tended to spoil ones flow of eloquence the best of arguments is useless if the listener suddenly disappears in the middle of it however i persevered mr derrick i said as his head emerged you are naturally surprised you you you so far from cooling him liberal doses of water seemed to make him more heated you impudent scoundrel he said that not i what i said was more gentlemanly more courteous on a higher plane altogether i said winningly mr derrick cannot we let bygones be bygones from his expression i gathered that we could not i continued i was under the unfortunate necessity of having to condense my remarks i was not able to let myself go as i could have wished for time was an important consideration erelong swallowing water at his present rate the professor must inevitably become waterlogged it behooved me to be succinct i have loved your daughter i said rapidly ever since i first saw her i learned last night that she loved me but she will not marry me without your consent stretch your arms out straight from the shoulders and fill your lungs well and you cant sink so i have come this morning to ask for your consent i know we have not been on the best of terms lately you for heavens sake dont try to talk your one chance of remaining on the surface is to keep your lungs well filled the fault i said generously was mine but when you have heard my explanation i am sure you will forgive me there i told you so he reappeared some few feet to the left i swam up and resumed when you left us so abruptly after our little dinner party you put me in a very awkward position i was desperately in love with your daughter and as long as you were in the frame of mind in which you left i could not hope to find an opportunity of telling her so you see what a fix i was in dont you i thought for hours and hours to try and find some means of bringing about a reconciliation you wouldnt believe how hard i thought at last seeing you fishing one morning when i was on the cob it struck me all of a sudden that the very best way would be to arrange a little boating accident i was confident that i could rescue you all right you young blackguard he managed to slip past me and made for the shore again strike out but hear me i said swimming by his side look at the thing from the standpoint of a philosopher the fact that the rescue was arranged oughtnt really to influence you in the least you didnt know it at the time therefore relatively it was not and you were genuinely saved from a watery grave i felt that i was becoming a shade too metaphysical but i could not help it what i wanted to point out was that i had certainly pulled him out of the water and that the fact that i had caused him to be pushed in had nothing to do with the case either a man is a gallant rescuer or he is not a gallant rescuer there is no middle course i had saved his life for he would have drowned if he had been left to himself and was consequently entitled to his gratitude and that was all that there was to be said about it these things i endeavored to make plain to him as we swam along but whether it was that the salt water he had swallowed dulled his intelligence or that my power of stating a case neatly was to seek the fact remains that he reached the beach an unconvinced man we faced one another dripping then may i consider i said that your objections are removed we have your consent he stamped angrily and his bare foot came down on a small but singularly sharp pebble with a brief exclamation he seized the foot with one hand and hopped while hopping he delivered his ultimatum probably this is the only instance on record of a father adopting this attitude in dismissing a suitor you may not he said you may not consider any such thing my objections were never more absolute you detain me in the water till i am blue sir blue with cold in order to listen to the most preposterous and impudent nonsense i ever heard this was unjust if he had heard me attentively from the first and avoided interruptions and not behaved like a submarine we should have got through our little business in half the time we might both have been dry and clothed by now i endeavored to point this out to him dont talk to me sir he roared hobbling off across the beach to his dressing tent i will not listen to you i will have nothing to do with you i consider you impudent sir i am sure it was unintentional mr derrick isch he said being the first occasion and the last on which i ever heard that remarkable word proceed from the mouth of man and he vanished into his tent while i wading in once more swam back to the cob and put on my clothes and so home as pepys would have said to breakfast feeling depressed scientific golf xx as i stood with ukridge in the fowl run on the morning following my maritime conversation with the professor regarding a hen that had posed before us obviously with a view to inspection there appeared a man carrying an envelope ukridge who by this time saw as calverley almost said under every hat a dun and imagined that no envelope could contain anything but a small account softly and silently vanished away leaving me to interview the enemy mr garnet sir said the foe i recognized him he was professor derricks gardener what did this portend had the merits of my pleadings come home to the professor when he thought them over and was there a fathers blessing inclosed in the envelope which was being held out to me i opened the envelope no fathers blessings were absent the letter was in the third person professor derrick begged to inform mr garnet that by defeating mr saul potter he had qualified for the final round of the lyme regis golf tournament in which he understood mr garnet was to be his opponent if it would be convenient for mr garnet to play off the match on the present afternoon professor derrick would be obliged if he would be at the clubhouse at halfpast two if this hour and day were unsuitable would he kindly arrange others the bearer would wait the bearer did wait and then trudged off with a note beautifully written in the third person in which mr garnet after numerous compliments and thanks begged to inform professor derrick that he would be at the clubhouse at the hour mentioned and i added to myself not in the note i will give him such a licking that hell brain himself with a cleek for i was not pleased with the professor i was conscious of a malicious joy at the prospect of snatching the prize from him i knew he had set his heart on winning the tournament this year to be runnerup two years in succession stimulates the desire for the first place it would be doubly bitter to him to be beaten by a newcomer after the absence of his rival the colonel had awakened hope in him and i knew i could do it even allowing for bad luck and i am never a very unlucky golfer i could rely almost with certainty on crushing the man and ill do it i said to bob who had trotted up i often make bob the recipient of my confidences he listens appreciatively and never interrupts and he never has grievances of his own if there is one person i dislike it is the man who tries to air his grievances when i wish to air mine bob i said running his tail through my fingers listen to me if i am in form this afternoon and i feel in my bones that i shall be i shall nurse the professor i shall play with him do you understand the principles of match play at golf robert you score by holes not strokes there are eighteen holes i shall toy with the professor bob i shall let him get ahead and then catch him up i shall go ahead myself and let him catch me up i shall race him neck and neck till the very end then when his hair has turned white with the strain and hes lost a couple of stone in weight and his eyes are starting out of his head i shall go ahead and beat him by a hole ill teach him robert he shall taste of my despair and learn by proof in some wild hour how much the wretched dare and when its all over and hes torn all his hair out and smashed all his clubs i shall go and commit suicide off the cob because you see if i cant marry phyllis i shant have any use for life bob wagged his tail cheerfully i mean it i said rolling him on his back and punching him on the chest till his breathing became stertorous you dont see the sense of it i know but then youve got none of the finer feelings youre a jolly good dog robert but youre a rank materialist bones and cheese and potatoes with gravy over them make you happy you dont know what it is to be in love youd better get right side up now or youll have apoplexy it has been my aim in the course of this narrative to extenuate nothing nor set down aught in malice like the gentleman who played euchre with the heathen chinee i state but the facts i do not therefore slur over my scheme for disturbing the professors peace of mind i am not always good and noble i am the hero of this story but i have my off moments i felt ruthless toward the professor i cannot plead ignorance of the golfers point of view as an excuse for my plottings i knew that to one whose soul is in the game as the professors was the agony of being just beaten in an important match exceeds in bitterness all other agonies i knew that if i scraped through by the smallest possible margin his appetite would be destroyed his sleep o nights broken he would wake from fitful slumber moaning that if he had only used his iron at the tenth hole all would have been well that if he had aimed more carefully on the seventh green life would not be drear and blank that a more judicious manipulation of his brassy throughout might have given him something to live for all these things i knew and they did not touch me i was adamant the professor was waiting for me at the clubhouse and greeted me with a cold and stately inclination of the head beautiful day for golf i observed in my gay chatty manner he bowed in silence very well i thought wait just wait miss derrick is well i hope i added aloud that drew him he started his aspect became doubly forbidding miss derrick is perfectly well sir i thank you and you no bad effect i hope from your dip yesterday mr garnet i came here for golf not conversation he said we made it so i drove off from the first tee it was a splendid drive i should not say so if there were anyone else to say so for me modesty would forbid but as there is no one i must repeat the statement it was one of the best drives of my experience the ball flashed through the air took the bunker with a dozen feet to spare and rolled onto the green i had felt all along that i should be in form unless my opponent was equally above himself he was a lost man the excellence of my drive had not been without its effect on the professor i could see that he was not confident he addressed his ball more strangely and at greater length than anyone i had ever seen he waggled his club over it as if he were going to perform a conjuring trick then he struck and topped it the ball rolled two yards he looked at it in silence then he looked at me also in silence i was gazing seaward when i looked round he was getting to work with a brassy this time he hit the bunker and rolled back he repeated this maneuver twice hard luck i murmured sympathetically on the third occasion thereby going as near to being slain with an iron as it has ever been my lot to go your true golfer is easily roused in times of misfortune and there was a red gleam in the eye the professor turned to me i shall pick my ball up he growled we walked on in silence to the second tee he did the second hole in four which was good i won it in three which unfortunately for him was better i won the third hole i won the fourth hole i won the fifth hole i glanced at my opponent out of the corner of my eyes the man was suffering beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead his play had become wilder and wilder at each hole in arithmetical progression if he had been a plow he could hardly have turned up more soil the imagination recoiled from the thought of what he would be doing in another half hour if he deteriorated at his present speed a feeling of calm and content stole over me i was not sorry for him all the viciousness of my nature was uppermost in me once when he missed the ball clean at the fifth tee his eye met mine and we stood staring at each other for a full half minute without moving i believe if i had smiled then he would have attacked me without hesitation there is a type of golfer who really almost ceases to be human under stress of the wild agony of a series of foozles the sixth hole involves the player in a somewhat tricky piece of crosscountry work there is a nasty ditch to be negotiated many an optimist has been reduced to blank pessimism by that ditch all hope abandon ye who enter here might be written on a notice board over it the professor entered there the unhappy man sent his ball into its very jaws and then madness seized him the merciful laws of golf framed by kindly men who do not wish to see the asylums of great britain overcrowded enact that in such a case the player may take his ball and throw it over his shoulder the same to count as one stroke but vaulting ambition is apt to try and drive out from the ditch thinking thereby to win through without losing a stroke this way madness lies it was a grisly sight to see the professor head and shoulders above the ditch hewing at his obstinate haskell sixteen said the professor at last between his teeth then having made one or two further comments he stooped and picked up his ball i give you this hole he said we walked on i won the seventh hole i won the eighth hole the ninth we halved for in the black depth of my soul i had formed a plan of fiendish subtlety i intended to allow him to win with extreme labor eight holes in succession then when hope was once more strong in him i would win the last and he would go mad i watched him carefully as we trudged on emotions chased one another across his face when he won the tenth hole he merely refrained from oaths when he won the eleventh a sort of sullen pleasure showed in his face it was at the thirteenth that i detected the first dawning of hope from then onward it grew when with a sequence of shocking shots he took the seventeenth hole in eight he was in a parlous condition his run of success had engendered within him a desire for conversation he wanted as it were to flap his wings and crow i could see dignity wrestling with talkativeness i gave him a lead you have got back your form now i said talkativeness had it dignity retired hurt speech came from him with a rush when he brought off an excellent drive from the eighteenth tee he seemed to forget everything me dear boy he began and stopped abruptly in some confusion silence once more brooded over us as we played ourselves up the fairway and on to the green he was on the green in four i reached it in three his sixth stroke took him out i putted carefully to the very mouth of the hole i walked up to my ball and paused i looked at the professor he looked at me go on he said hoarsely suddenly a wave of compassion flooded over me what right had i to torture the man like this he had not behaved well to me but in the main it was my fault in his place i should have acted in precisely the same way in a flash i made up my mind professor i said go on he repeated that looks a simple shot i said eyeing him steadily but i might easily miss it he started and then you would win the championship he dabbed at his forehead with a wet ball of a handkerchief it would be very pleasant for you after getting so near it the last two years go on he said for the third time but there was a note of hesitation in his voice sudden joy i said would almost certainly make me miss it we looked at each other he had the golf fever in his eyes if i said slowly lifting my putter you were to give your consent to my marriage with phyllis he looked from me to the ball from the ball to me and back again to the ball it was very very near the hole i love her i said and i have discovered she loves me i shall be a rich man from the day i marry his eyes were still fixed on the ball why not i said he looked up and burst into a roar of laughter you young divil said he smiting his thigh you young divil youve beaten me i swung my putter and drove the ball far beyond the green on the contrary i said you have beaten me i left the professor at the clubhouse and raced back to the farm i wanted to pour my joys into a sympathetic ear ukridge i knew would offer that same sympathetic ear a good fellow ukridge always interested in what you had to tell him never bored ukridge i shouted no answer i flung open the diningroom door nobody i went into the drawingroom it was empty i searched through the garden and looked into his bedroom he was not in either he must have gone for a stroll i said i rang the bell the hired retainer appeared calm and imperturbable as ever sir oh where is mr ukridge beale mr ukridge sir said the hired retainer nonchalantly has gone gone yes sir mr ukridge and mrs ukridge went away together by the three oclock train the calm before the storm xxi beale i said what do you mean where have they gone dont know sir london i expect when did they go oh you told me that didnt they say why they were going no sir didnt you ask when you saw them packing up and going to the station didnt you do anything no sir why on earth not i didnt see them sir i only found out as theyd gone after theyd been and went sir walking down by the net and mackerel met one of them coastguards oh says he so youre moving whos amoving i says to him well he says to me i seen your mr ukridge and his missus get into the three oclock train for axminster i thought as you was all amoving ho i says ho wondering and i goes on when i gets back i asks the missus did she see them packing their boxes and she says no she says they didnt pack no boxes as she knowed of and blowed if they had mr garnet sir what they didnt pack no sir we looked at one another beale i said sir do you know what i think yes sir theyve bolted so i says to the missus sir it struck me right off in a manner of speaking this is awful i said yes sir his face betrayed no emotion but he was one of those men whose expression never varies its a way they have in the army this wants thinking out beale i said yes sir youd better ask mrs beale to give me some dinner and then ill think it out yes sir i was in an unpleasant position ukridge by his defection had left me in charge of the farm i could dissolve the concern i supposed if i wished and return to london but i particularly desired to remain in lyme regis to complete the victory i had won on the links it was necessary for me to continue as i had begun i was in the position of a general who has conquered a hostile country and is obliged to soothe the feelings of the conquered people before his labors can be considered at an end i had rushed the professor it must now be my aim to keep him from regretting that he had been rushed i must therefore stick to my post with the tenacity of a boy on a burning deck there would be trouble of that i was certain as soon as the news got about that ukridge had gone the deluge would begin his creditors would abandon their passive tactics and take active steps the siege of port arthur would be nothing to it there was a chance that aggressive measures would be confined to the enemy at our gates the tradesmen of lyme regis but the probability was that the news would spread and the injured merchants of dorchester and axminster rush to the scene of hostilities i foresaw unpleasantness i summoned beale after dinner and held a council of war it was no time for airy persiflage i said beale were in the cart sir mr ukridge going away like this has left me in a most unpleasant position i would like to talk it over with you i dare say you know that we that mr ukridge owes a considerable amount of money roundabout here to tradesmen yes sir well when they find out that he has er shot the moon sir suggested the hired retainer helpfully gone up to town i said when they find that he has gone up to town they are likely to come bothering us a good deal yes sir i fancy that we shall have them all round here by the day after tomorrow at the latest probably earlier news of this sort always spreads quickly the point is then what are we to do he propounded no scheme but stood in an easy attitude of attention waiting for me to continue i continued lets see exactly how we stand i said my point is that i particularly wish to go on living down here for at least another fortnight of course my position is simple i am mr ukridges guest i shall go on living as i have been doing up to the present he asked me down here to help him look after the fowls so i shall go on looking after them i shall want a chicken a day i suppose or perhaps two for my meals and there the thing ends as far i am concerned complications set in when we come to consider you and mrs beale i suppose you wont care to stop on after this the hired retainer scratched his chin and glanced out of the window the moon was up and the garden looked cool and mysterious in the dim light its a pretty place mr garnet sir he said it is i said but about other considerations theres the matter of wages are yours in arrears yes sir a month and mrs beales the same i suppose yes sir a month hm well it seems to me beale you cant lose anything by stopping on i cant be paid any less than i have been sir he agreed exactly and as you say its a pretty place you might just as well stop on and help me in the fowl run what do you think very well sir and mrs beale will do the same yes sir thats excellent youre a hero beale i shant forget you theres a check coming to me from a magazine in another week for a short story when it arrives ill look into that matter of back wages tell mrs beale im much obliged to her will you yes sir having concluded that delicate business i strolled out into the garden with bob it was abominable of ukridge to desert me in this way even if i had not been his friend it would have been bad the fact that we had known each other for years made it doubly discreditable he might at least have warned me and given me the option of leaving the sinking ship with him but i reflected i ought not to be surprised his whole career as long as i had known him had been dotted with little eccentricities of a type which an unfeeling world generally stigmatizes as shady they were small things it was true but they ought to have warned me we are most of us wise after the event when the wind has blown we generally discover a multitude of straws which should have shown us which way it was blowing once i remembered in our schoolmaster days when guineas though regular were few he had had occasion to increase his wardrobe if i recollect rightly he thought he had a chance of a good position in the tutoring line and only needed good clothes to make it his he took four pounds of his salary in advance he was in the habit of doing this he never had any of his salary left by the end of term it having vanished in advance loans beforehand with this he was to buy two suits a hat new boots and collars when it came to making the purchases he found what he had overlooked previously in his optimistic way that four pounds did not go very far at the time i remember i thought his method of grappling with the situation humorous he bought a hat for three and sixpence and got the suits and the boots on the installment system paying a small sum in advance as earnest of more to come he then pawned one suit to pay the first few installments and finally departed to be known no more his address he had given with a false name at an empty house and when the tailor arrived with the minions of the law all he found was an annoyed caretaker and a pile of letters written by himself containing his bill in its various stages of evolution or again there was a bicycle and photograph shop near the school he blew into this one day and his roving eye fell on a tandem bicycle he did not want a tandem bicycle but that influenced him not at all he ordered it provisionally he also ordered an enlarging camera a kodak and a magic lantern the order was booked and the goods were to be delivered when he had made up his mind concerning them after a week the shopman sent round to ask if there were any further particulars which mr ukridge would like to learn before definitely ordering them mr ukridge sent word back that he was considering the matter and that in the meantime would he be so good as to let him have that little clockwork man in his window which walked when wound up having got this and not paid for it ukridge thought that he had done handsomely by the bicycle and photograph man and that things were square between them the latter met him a few days afterwards and expostulated plaintively ukridge explained my good man he said you know i really think we need say no more about the matter really youve come out of it very well now look here which would you rather be owed for a clockwork man which is broken and you can have it back or a tandem bicycle an enlarging camera a kodak and a magic lantern what his reasoning was too subtle for the uneducated mind the man retired puzzled and unpaid and ukridge kept the clockwork toy a remarkable financier ukridge i sometimes think that he would have done well in the city i did not go to bed till late that night there was something so peaceful in the silence that brooded over everything that i stayed on enjoying it perhaps it struck me as all the more peaceful because i could not help thinking of the troublous times that were to come already i seemed to hear the horrid roar of a herd of infuriated creditors i seemed to see fierce brawlings and sackings in progress in this very garden it will be a coarse brutal spectacle robert i said bob uttered a little whine as if he too were endowed with powers of prophecy the storm breaks xxii rather to my surprise the next morning passed off uneventfully by lunch time i had come to the conclusion that the expected trouble would not occur that day and i felt that i might well leave my post for the afternoon while i went to the professors to pay my respects the professor was out when i arrived phyllis was in and as we had a good many things of no importance to say to each other it was not till the evening that i started for the farm again as i approached the sound of voices smote my ears i stopped i could hear beale speaking then came the rich notes of vickers the butcher then beale again then dawlish the grocer then a chorus the storm had burst and in my absence i blushed for myself i was in command and i had deserted the fort in time of need what must the faithful hired man be thinking of me probably he placed me as he had placed ukridge in the ragged ranks of those who have shot the moon fortunately having just come from the professors i was in the costume which of all my wardrobe was most calculated to impress to a casual observer i should probably suggest wealth and respectability i stopped for a moment to cool myself for as is my habit when pleased with life i had been walking fast then i opened the gate and strode in trying to look as opulent as possible it was an animated scene that met my eyes in the middle of the lawn stood the devoted beale a little more flushed than i had seen him hitherto parleying with a burly and excited young man without a coat grouped round the pair were some dozen men young middleaged and old all talking their hardest i could distinguish nothing of what they were saying i noticed that beales left cheek bone was a little discolored and there was a hard dogged expression on his face he too was in his shirt sleeves my entry created no sensation nobody apparently had heard the latch click and nobody had caught sight of me their eyes were fixed on the young man and beale i stood at the gate and watched them there seemed to have been trouble already looking more closely i perceived sitting on the grass apart a second young man his face was obscured by a dirty pocket handkerchief with which he dabbed tenderly at his features every now and then the shirtsleeved young man flung his hand toward him with an indignant gesture talking hard the while it did not need a preternaturally keen observer to deduce what had happened beale must have fallen out with the young man who was sitting on the grass and smitten him and now his friend had taken up the quarrel now this i said to myself is rather interesting here in this one farm we have the only three known methods of dealing with duns beale is evidently an exponent of the violent method ukridge is an apostle of evasion i shall try conciliation i wonder which of us will be the most successful meanwhile not to spoil beales efforts by allowing him too little scope for experiment i refrained from making my presence known and continued to stand by the gate an interested spectator things were evidently moving now the young mans gestures became more vigorous the dogged look on beales face deepened the comments of the ring increased in point and pungency what did you hit him for then this question was put always in the same words and with the same air of quiet triumph at intervals of thirty seconds by a little man in a snuffcolored suit with a purple tie nobody ever answered him or appeared to listen to him but he seemed each time to think that he had clinched the matter and cornered his opponent other voices chimed in you hit him charlie go on you hit him well have the law go on charlie flushed with the favor of the manyheaded charlie now proceeded from threats to action his right fist swung round suddenly but beale was on the alert he ducked sharply and the next minute charlie was sitting on the ground beside his fallen friend a hush fell on the ring and the little man in the purple tie was left repeating his formula without support i advanced it seemed to me that the time had come to be conciliatory charlie was struggling to his feet obviously anxious for a second round and beale was getting into position once more in another five minutes conciliation would be out of the question whats all this i said my advent caused a stir excited men left beale and rallied round me charlie rising to his feet found himself dethroned from his position of man of the moment and stood blinking at the setting sun and opening and shutting his mouth there was a buzz of conversation dont all speak at once please i said i cant possibly follow what you say perhaps you will tell me what you want i singled out a short stout man in gray he wore the largest whiskers ever seen on human face its like this sir we all of us want to know where we are i can tell you that i said youre on our lawn and i should be much obliged if you would stop digging your heels into it this was not i suppose conciliation in the strictest and best sense of the word but the thing had to be said you dont understand me sir he said excitedly when i said we didnt know where we were it was a manner of speaking we want to know how we stand on your heels i replied gently as i pointed out before i am brass sir of axminster my account with mr ukridge is ten pounds eight shillings and fourpence i want to know the whole strength of the company now joined in you know me mr garnet appleby in the high voice lost in the general roar and eightpence my account with mr uk settle i represent bodger a diversion occurred at this point charlie who had long been eyeing beale sourly dashed at him with swinging fists and was knocked down again the whole trend of the meeting altered once more conciliation became a drug violence was what the public wanted beale had three fights in rapid succession i was helpless instinct prompted me to join the fray but prudence told me that such a course would be fatal at last in a lull i managed to catch the hired retainer by the arm as he drew back from the prostrate form of his latest victim drop it beale i whispered hotly drop it we shall never manage these people if you knock them about go indoors and stay there while i talk to them mr garnet sir said he the light of battle dying out of his eyes its ard its cruel ard i aint ad a turnup not to call a turnup since ive bin a timeexpired man i aint hitting of em mr garnet sir not hard i aint that there first one of em he played me dirty hittin at me when i wasnt looking they cant say as i started it thats all right beale i said soothingly i know it wasnt your fault and i know its hard on you to have to stop but i wish you would go indoors i must talk to these men and we shant have a moments peace while youre here cut along very well sir but its ard maynt i ave just one go at that charlie mr garnet he asked wistfully no no go in and if they goes for you sir and tries to wipe the face off you they wont they wont if they do ill shout for you he went reluctantly into the house and i turned again to my audience if you will kindly be quiet for a moment i said i am appleby mr garnet in the high street mr ukridge eighteen pounds fourteen shillings kindly glance i waved my hands wildly above my head stop stop stop i shouted the babble continued but diminished gradually in volume through the trees as i waited i caught a glimpse of the sea i wished i was out on the cob where beyond these voices there was peace my head was beginning to ache and i felt faint for want of food gentlemen i cried as the noise died away the latch of the gate clicked i looked up and saw a tall thin young man in a frock coat and silk hat enter the garden it was the first time i had seen the costume in the country he approached me mr ukridge sir he said my name is garnet mr ukridge is away at the moment i come from whiteleys mr garnet our mr blenkinsop having written on several occasions to mr ukridge calling his attention to the fact that his account has been allowed to mount to a considerable figure and having received no satisfactory reply desired me to visit him i am sorry that he is not at home so am i i said with feeling do you expect him to return shortly no i said i do not he was looking curiously at the expectant band of duns i forestalled his question those are some of mr ukridges creditors i said i am just about to address them perhaps you will take a seat the grass is quite dry my remarks will embrace you as well as them comprehension came into his eyes and the natural man in him peeped through the polish great scott has he done a bunk he cried to the best of my knowledge yes i said he whistled i turned again to the local talent gentlemen i shouted hear hear said some idiot gentlemen i intend to be quite frank with you we must decide just how matters stand between us a voice wheres ukridge mr ukridge left for london suddenly bitter laughter yesterday afternoon personally i think he will come back very shortly hoots of derision greeted this prophecy i resumed i fail to see your object in coming here i have nothing for you i couldnt pay your bills if i wanted to it began to be borne in upon me that i was becoming unpopular i am here simply as mr ukridges guest i proceeded after all why should i spare the man i have nothing whatever to do with his business affairs i refuse absolutely to be regarded as in any way indebted to you i am sorry for you you have my sympathy that is all i can give you sympathy and good advice dissatisfaction i was getting myself disliked and i had meant to be so conciliatory to speak to these unfortunates words of cheer which should be as olive oil poured into a wound for i really did sympathize with them i considered that ukridge had used them disgracefully but i was irritated my head ached abominably then am i to tell our mr blenkinsop asked the frockcoated one that the money is not and will not be forthcoming when next you smoke a quiet cigar with your mr blenkinsop i replied courteously and find conversation flagging i rather think i should say something of the sort we shall of course instruct our solicitors at once to institute legal proceedings against your mr ukridge dont call him my mr ukridge you can do whatever you please that is your last word on the subject i hope so wheres our money demanded a discontented voice from the crowd then charlie filled with the lust of revenge proposed that the company should sack the place we cant see the color of our money he said pithily but we can have our own back that settled it the battle was over the most skillful general must sometimes recognize defeat i could do nothing further with them i had done my best for the farm i could do no more i lit my pipe and strolled into the paddock chaos followed indoors and out of doors they raged without check even beale gave the thing up he knocked charlie into a flower bed and then disappeared in the direction of the kitchen it was growing dusk from inside the house came faint sounds of mirth as the sacking party emptied the rooms of their contents in the fowl run a hen was crooning sleepily in its coop it was a very soft liquid soothing sound presently out came the invaders with their loot one with a picture another with a vase another bearing the gramophone upside down then i heard somebody charlie again it seemed to me propose a raid on the fowl run the fowls had had their moments of unrest since they had been our property but what they had gone through with us was peace compared with what befell them then not even on that second evening of our visit when we had run unmeasured miles in pursuit of them had there been such confusion roused abruptly from their beauty sleep they fled in all directions the summer evening was made hideous with the noise of them disgraceful sir is it not disgraceful said a voice at my ear the young man from whiteleys stood beside me he did not look happy his forehead was damp somebody seemed to have stepped on his hat and his coat was smeared with mold i was turning to answer him when from the dusk in the direction of the house came a sudden roar a passionate appeal to the world in general to tell the speaker what all this meant there was only one man of my acquaintance with a voice like that i walked without hurry toward him good evening ukridge i said after the storm xxiii a yell of welcome drowned the tumult of the looters is that you garny old horse whats up whats the matter has everybody gone mad who are those blackguardly scoundrels in the fowl run what are they doing whats been happening i have been entertaining a little meeting of your creditors i said and now they are entertaining themselves but what did you let them do it for what is one among so many i said oh moaned ukridge as a hen flashed past us pursued by a criminal its a little hard i cant go away for a day you cant i said youre right there you cant go away without a word without a word what do you mean garny old boy pull yourself together youre overexcited do you mean to tell me you didnt get my note what note the one i left on the diningroom table there was no note there what i was reminded of the scene that had taken place on the first day of our visit feel in your pockets i said and history repeated itself one of the first things he pulled out was the note why here it is he said in amazement of course where did you expect it to be was it important why it explained the whole thing then i said i wish youd let me read it a note that can explain whats happened ought to be worth reading i took the envelope from his hand and opened it it was too dark to read so i lit a match a puff of wind extinguished it there is always just enough wind to extinguish a match i pocketed the note i cant read it now i said tell me what it was about it was telling you to sit tight and not to worry about us going away thats good about worrying youre a thoughtful chap ukridge because we should be back in a day or two and what sent you up to town why we went to touch millies aunt elizabeth a light began to shine on my darkness oh i said you remember aunt elizabeth we got a letter from her not so long ago i know whom you mean she called you a gaby and a guffin of course i remember thinking her a shrewd and discriminating old lady with a great gift of description so you went to touch her thats it i suddenly found that things were getting into an a tangle and that we must have more money so i naturally thought of aunt elizabeth she isnt what you might call an admirer of mine but shes very fond of millie and would do anything for her if shes allowed to chuck about a few hometruths before doing it so we went off together looked her up at her house stated our painful case and corralled the money millie and i shared the work she did the asking while i inquired after the rheumatism she mentioned the precise figure that would clear us i patted the toy pomeranian little beast got after me quick when i wasnt looking and chewed my ankle thank heaven for that i said in the end millie got the money and i got the home truths did she call you a gaby twice and a guffin three times but you got the money rather and ill tell you another thing i scored heavily at the end of the visit lady lakenheath was doing stunts with proverbs i beg your pardon quoting proverbs you know bearing on the situation ah my dear she said to millie marry in haste repent at leisure im afraid that proverb doesnt apply to us said millie because i havent repented what do you think of that old horse millies an angel i replied just then the angel joined us she had been exploring the house and noting the damage done her eyes were open to their fullest extent as she shook hands with me oh mr garnet she said couldnt you have stopped them i felt a cur had i done as much as i might have done to stem the tide im awfully sorry mrs ukridge i said i really dont think i could have done more we tried every method beale had seven fights and i made a speech on the lawn but it was all no good perhaps we can collect these men and explain things i added i dont believe any of them know youve come back send beale round said ukridge beale the hired retainer came running out at the sound of the wellknown voice lumme mr ukridge sir he gasped it was the first time beale had ever betrayed any real emotion in my presence to him i suppose the return of ukridge was as sensational and astounding an event as the reappearance of one from the tomb would have been he was not accustomed to find those who had shot the moon revisiting their old haunts go round the place and tell those blackguards that ive come back and would like to have a word with them on the lawn and if you find any of them stealing my fowls knock them down i ave knocked down one or two said beale with approval that charlie thats right beale youre an excellent man and i will pay you your back wages tonight before i go to bed those fellers sir said beale having expressed his gratification theyve been and scattered most of them birds already sir theyve been chasin of em for this hour back ukridge groaned demons he said demons beale went off the audience assembled on the lawn in the moonlight ukridge with his cap well over his eyes and his mackintosh hanging around him like a roman toga surveyed them stonily and finally began his speech you you you you blackguards he said i always like to think of ukridge as he appeared at that moment there have been times when his conduct did not recommend itself to me it has sometimes happened that i have seen flaws in him but on this occasion he was at his best he was eloquent he dominated his audience he poured scorn upon his hearers and they quailed he flung invective at them and they wilted it was hard he said it was a little hard that a gentleman could not run up to london for a couple of days on business without having his private grounds turned upside down he had intended to deal well by the tradesmen of the town to put business in their way to give them large orders but would he not much as soon as ever the sun had risen and another day begun their miserable accounts should be paid in full and their connection with him be cut off afterwards it was probable that he would institute legal proceedings against them for trespass and damage to property and if they didnt all go to prison they might consider themselves uncommonly lucky and if they didnt fly the spot within the brief space of two ticks he would get among them with a shotgun he was sick of them they were no gentlemen but cads scoundrels creatures that it would be rank flattery to describe as human beings thats the sort of things they were and now they might go quick the meeting then dispersed without the usual vote of thanks we were quiet at the farm that night ukridge sat like marius among the ruins of carthage and refused to speak eventually he took bob with him and went for a walk half an hour later i too wearied of the scene of desolation my errant steps took me in the direction of the sea as i approached i was aware of a figure standing in the moonlight gazing moodily out over the waters beside the figure was a dog i would not disturb his thoughts the dark moments of massive minds are sacred i forebore to speak to him as readily might one of the generals of the grand army have opened conversation with napoleon during the retreat from moscow i turned softly and walked the other way when i looked back he was still there illustration i did think mr garnet would have fainted when the best man said i cant find it old horse epilogue
