the old bachelor to the right honourable charles lord clifford of lanesborough etc my lord it is with a great deal of pleasure that i lay hold on this first occasion which the accidents of my life have given me of writing to your lordship for since at the same time i write to all the world it will be a means of publishing what i would have everybody know the respect and duty which i owe and pay to you i have so much inclination to be yours that i need no other engagement but the particular ties by which i am bound to your lordship and family have put it out of my power to make you any compliment since all offers of myself will amount to no more than an honest acknowledgment and only shew a willingness in me to be grateful i am very near wishing that it were not so much my interest to be your lordships servant that it might be more my merit not that i would avoid being obliged to you but i would have my own choice to run me into the debt that i might have it to boast i had distinguished a man to whom i would be glad to be obliged even without the hopes of having it in my power ever to make him a return it is impossible for me to come near your lordship in any kind and not to receive some favour and while in appearance i am only making an acknowledgment with the usual underhand dealing of the world i am at the same time insinuating my own interest i cannot give your lordship your due without tacking a bill of my own privileges tis true if a man never committed a folly he would never stand in need of a protection but then power would have nothing to do and good nature no occasion to show itself and where those qualities are tis pity they should want objects to shine upon i must confess this is no reason why a man should do an idle thing nor indeed any good excuse for it when done yet it reconciles the uses of such authority and goodness to the necessities of our follies and is a sort of poetical logic which at this time i would make use of to argue your lordship into a protection of this play it is the first offence i have committed in this kind or indeed in any kind of poetry though not the first made public and therefore i hope will the more easily be pardoned but had it been acted when it was first written more might have been said in its behalf ignorance of the town and stage would then have been excuses in a young writer which now almost four years experience will scarce allow of yet i must declare myself sensible of the good nature of the town in receiving this play so kindly with all its faults which i must own were for the most part very industriously covered by the care of the players for i think scarce a character but received all the advantage it would admit of from the justness of the action as for the critics my lord i have nothing to say to or against any of them of any kind from those who make just exceptions to those who find fault in the wrong place i will only make this general answer in behalf of my play an answer which epictetus advises every man to make for himself to his censurers viz that if they who find some faults in it were as intimate with it as i am they would find a great many more this is a confession which i needed not to have made but however i can draw this use from it to my own advantage that i think there are no faults in it but what i do know which as i take it is the first step to an amendment thus i may live in hopes sometime or other of making the town amends but you my lord i never can though i am ever your lordships most obedient and most humble servant will congreve to mr congreve when virtue in pursuit of fame appears and forward shoots the growth beyond the years we timely court the rising heros cause and on his side the poet wisely draws bespeaking him hereafter by applause the days will come when we shall all receive returning interest from what now we give instructed and supported by that praise and reputation which we strive to raise nature so coy so hardly to be wooed flies like a mistress but to be pursued o congreve boldly follow on the chase she looks behind and wants thy strong embrace she yields she yields surrenders all her charms do you but force her gently to your arms such nerves such graces in your lines appear as you were made to be her ravisher dryden has long extended his command by right divine quite through the muses land absolute lord and holding now from none but great apollo his undoubted crown that empire settled and grown old in power can wish for nothing but a successor not to enlarge his limits but maintain those provinces which he alone could gain his eldest wycherly in wise retreat thought it not worth his quiet to be great loose wandring etherege in wild pleasures tost and foreign intrests to his hopes long lost poor lee and otway dead congreve appears the darling and last comfort of his years mayst thou live long in thy great masters smiles and growing under him adorn these isles but when when part of him be that but late his body yielding must submit to fate leaving his deathless works and thee behind the natural successor of his mind then mayst thou finish what he has begun heir to his merit be in fame his son what thou hast done shews all is in thy powr and to write better only must write more tis something to be willing to commend but my best praise is that i am your friend tho southerne to mr congreve the dangers great in these censorious days when critics are so rife to venture praise when the infectious and illnatured brood behold and damn the work because tis good and with a proud ungenerous spirit try to pass an ostracism on poetry but you my friend your worth does safely bear above their spleen you have no cause for fear like a wellmettled hawk you took your flight quite out of reach and almost out of sight as the strong sun in a fair summers day you rise and drive the mists and clouds away the owls and bats and all the birds of prey each line of yours like polished steels so hard in beauty safe it wants no other guard nature herselfs beholden to your dress which though still like much fairer you express some vainly striving honour to obtain leave to their heirs the traffic of their brain like china under ground the ripening ware in a long time perhaps grows worth our care but you now reap the fame so well youve sown the planter tastes his fruit to ripeness grown as a fair orangetree at once is seen big with whats ripe yet springing still with green so at one time my worthy friend appears with all the sap of youth and weight of years accept my pious love as forward zeal which though it ruins me i cant conceal exposed to censure for my weak applause im pleased to suffer in so just a cause and though my offering may unworthy prove take as a friend the wishes of my love j marsh to mr congreve on his play called the old bachelor wit like true gold refined from all allay immortal is and never can decay tis in all times and languages the same nor can an ill translation quench the flame for though the form and fashion dont remain the intrinsic value still it will retain then let each studied scene be writ with art and judgment sweat to form the laboured part each character be just and nature seem without th ingredient wit tis all but phlegm for thats the soul which all the mass must move and wake our passions into grief or love but you too bounteous sow your wit so thick we are surprised and know not where to pick and while with clapping we are just to you ourselves we injure and lose something new what maynt we then great youth of thee presage whose art and wit so much transcend thy age how wilt thou shine at thy meridian height who at thy rising givst so vast a light when dryden dying shall the world deceive whom we immortal as his works believe thou shalt succeed the glory of the stage adorn and entertain the coming age bevil higgons prologue intended for the old bachelor written by the lord falkland most authors on the stage at first appear like widows bridegrooms full of doubt and fear they judge from the experience of the dame how hard a task it is to quench her flame and who falls short of furnishing a course up to his brawny predecessors force with utmost rage from her embraces thrown remains convicted as an empty drone thus often to his shame a pert beginner proves in the end a miserable sinner as for our youngster i am apt to doubt him with all the vigour of his youth about him but he more sanguine trusts in one and twenty and impudently hopes he shall content you for though his bachelor be worn and cold he thinks the young may club to help the old and what alone can be achieved by neither is often brought about by both together the briskest of you all have felt alarms finding the fair one prostitute her charms with broken sighs in her old fumblers arms but for our spark he swears hell neer be jealous of any rivals but young lusty fellows faith let him try his chance and if the slave after his bragging prove a washy knave may he be banished to some lonely den and never more have leave to dip his pen but if he be the champion he pretends both sexes sure will join to be his friends for all agree where all can have their ends and you must own him for a man of might if he holds out to please you the third night prologue spoken by mrs bracegirdle how this vile world is changed in former days prologues were serious speeches before plays grave solemn things as graces are to feasts where poets begged a blessing from their guests but now no more like suppliants we come a play makes war and prologue is the drum armed with keen satire and with pointed wit we threaten you who do for judges sit to save our plays or else well damn your pit but for your comfort it falls out today weve a young author and his firstborn play so standing only on his good behaviour hes very civil and entreats your favour not but the man has malice would he show it but on my conscience hes a bashful poet you think that strange no matter hell outgrow it well im his advocate by me he prays you i dont know whether i shall speak to please you he prays o bless me what shall i do now hang me if i know what he prays or how and twas the prettiest prologue as he wrote it well the deuce take me if i hant forgot it o lord for heavns sake excuse the play because you know if it be damned today i shall be hanged for wanting what to say for my sake then but im in such confusion i cannot stay to hear your resolution runs off dramatis personae men heartwell a surly old bachelor pretending to

act i scene i scene the street bellmour and vainlove meeting bell vainlove and abroad so early goodmorrow i thought a contemplative lover could no more have parted with his bed in a morning than he could have slept int vain bellmour goodmorrow why truth ont is these early sallies are not usual to me but business as you see sir showing letters and business must be followed or be lost bell business and so must time my friend be close pursued or lost business is the rub of life perverts our aim casts off the bias and leaves us wide and short of the intended mark vain pleasure i guess you mean bell ay what else has meaning vain oh the wise will tell you bell more than they believe or understand vain how how ned a wise man say more than he understands bell ay ay wisdoms nothing but a pretending to know and believe more than we really do you read of but one wise man and all that he knew was that he knew nothing come come leave business to idlers and wisdom to fools they have need of em wit be my faculty and pleasure my occupation and let father time shake his glass let low and earthly souls grovel till they have worked themselves six foot deep into a grave business is not my element i roll in a higher orb and dwell vain in castles i th air of thy own building thats thy element ned well as high a flier as you are i have a lure may make you stoop flings a letter bell i marry sir i have a hawks eye at a womans hand theres more elegancy in the false spelling of this superscription takes up the letter than in all cicero let me see how now dear perfidious vainlove reads vain hold hold slife thats the wrong bell nay lets see the name sylvia how canst thou be ungrateful to that creature shes extremely pretty and loves thee entirely i have heard her breathe such raptures about thee vain ay or anybody that shes about bell no faith frank you wrong her she has been just to you vain thats pleasant by my troth from thee who hast had her bell never her affections tis true by heaven she owned it to my face and blushing like the virgin morn when it disclosed the cheat which that trusty bawd of nature night had hid confessed her soul was true to you though i by treachery had stolen the bliss vain so was true as turtle in imagination ned ha preach this doctrine to husbands and the married women will adore thee bell why faith i think it will do well enough if the husband be out of the way for the wife to show her fondness and impatience of his absence by choosing a lover as like him as she can and what is unlike she may help out with her own fancy vain but is it not an abuse to the lover to be made a blind of bell as you say the abuse is to the lover not the husband for tis an argument of her great zeal towards him that she will enjoy him in effigy vain it must be a very superstitious country where such zeal passes for true devotion i doubt it will be damned by all our protestant husbands for flat idolatry but if you can make alderman fondlewife of your persuasion this letter will be needless bell what the old banker with the handsome wife vain ay bell let me see laetitia oh tis a delicious morsel dear frank thou art the truest friend in the world vain ay am i not to be continually starting of hares for you to course we were certainly cut out for one another for my temper quits an amour just where thine takes it up but read that it is an appointment for me this evening when fondlewife will be gone out of town to meet the master of a ship about the return of a venture which hes in danger of losing read read bell reads hum hum out of town this evening and talks of sending for mr spintext to keep me company but ill take care he shall not be at home good spintext oh the fanatic oneeyed parson vain ay bell reads hum hum that your conversation will be much more agreeable if you can counterfeit his habit to blind the servants very good then i must be disguised with all my heart it adds a gusto to an amour gives it the greater resemblance of theft and among us lewd mortals the deeper the sin the sweeter frank im amazed at thy good nature vain faith i hate love when tis forced upon a man as i do wine and this business is none of my seeking i only happened to be once or twice where laetitia was the handsomest woman in company so consequently applied myself to her and it seems she has taken me at my word had you been there or anybody t had been the same bell i wish i may succeed as the same vain never doubt it for if the spirit of cuckoldom be once raised up in a woman the devil cant lay it until she has donet bell prithee what sort of fellow is fondlewife vain a kind of mongrel zealot sometimes very precise and peevish but i have seen him pleasant enough in his way much addicted to jealousy but more to fondness so that as he is often jealous without a cause hes as often satisfied without reason bell a very even temper and fit for my purpose i must get your man setter to provide my disguise vain ay you may take him for good and all if you will for you have made him fit for nobody else well bell youre going to visit in return of sylvias letter poor rogue any hour of the day or night will serve her but do you know nothing of a new rival there vain yes heartwell that surly old pretended womanhater thinks her virtuous thats one reason why i fail her i would have her fret herself out of conceit with me that she may entertain some thoughts of him i know he visits her every day bell yet rails on still and thinks his love unknown to us a little time will swell him so he must be forced to give it birth and the discovery must needs be very pleasant from himself to see what pains he will take and how he will strain to be delivered of a secret when he has miscarried of it already vain well goodmorrow lets dine together ill meet at the old place bell with all my heart it lies convenient for us to pay our afternoon services to our mistresses i find i am damnably in love im so uneasy for not having seen belinda yesterday vain but i saw my araminta yet am as impatient scene ii bellmour alone bell why what a cormorant in love am i who not contented with the slavery of honourable love in one place and the pleasure of enjoying some half a score mistresses of my own acquiring must yet take vainloves business upon my hands because it lay too heavy upon his so am not only forced to lie with other mens wives for em but must also undertake the harder task of obliging their mistresses i must take up or i shall never hold out flesh and blood cannot bear it always scene iii to him sharper sharp im sorry to see this ned once a man comes to his soliloquies i give him for gone bell sharper im glad to see thee sharp what is belinda cruel that you are so thoughtful bell no faith not for that but theres a business of consequence fallen out today that requires some consideration sharp prithee what mighty business of consequence canst thou have bell why you must know tis a piece of work toward the finishing of an alderman it seems i must put the last hand to it and dub him cuckold that he may be of equal dignity with the rest of his brethren so i must beg belindas pardon sharp faith een give her over for good and all you can have no hopes of getting her for a mistress and she is too proud too inconstant too affected and too witty and too handsome for a wife bell but she cant have too much money theres twelve thousand pound tom tis true she is excessively foppish and affected but in my conscience i believe the baggage loves me for she never speaks well of me herself nor suffers anybody else to rail at me then as i told you theres twelve thousand pound hum why faith upon second thoughts she does not appear to be so very affected neither give her her due i think the womans a woman and thats all as such im sure i shall like her for the devil take me if i dont love all the sex sharp and here comes one who swears as heartily he hates all the sex scene iv to them heartwell bell who heartwell ay but he knows better things how now george where hast thou been snarling odious truths and entertaining company like a physician with discourse of their diseases and infirmities what fine lady hast thou been putting out of conceit with herself and persuading that the face she had been making all the morning was none of her own for i know thou art as unmannerly and as unwelcome to a woman as a lookingglass after the smallpox heart i confess i have not been sneering fulsome lies and nauseous flattery fawning upon a little tawdry whore that will fawn upon me again and entertain any puppy that comes like a tumbler with the same tricks over and over for such i guess may have been your late employment bell would thou hadst come a little sooner vainlove would have wrought thy conversion and been a champion for the cause heart what has he been here thats one of loves april fools is always upon some errand thats to no purpose ever embarking in adventures yet never comes to harbour sharp thats because he always sets out in foul weather loves to buffet with the winds meet the tide and sail in the teeth of opposition heart what has he not dropt anchor at araminta bell truth ont is she fits his temper best is a kind of floating island sometimes seems in reach then vanishes and keeps him busied in the search sharp she had need have a good share of sense to manage so capricious a lover bell faith i dont know hes of a temper the most easy to himself in the world he takes as much always of an amour as he cares for and quits it when it grows stale or unpleasant sharp an argument of very little passion very good understanding and very ill nature heart and proves that vainlove plays the fool with discretion sharp you bellmour are bound in gratitude to stickle for him you with pleasure reap that fruit which he takes pains to sow he does the drudgery in the mine and you stamp your image on the gold bell hes of another opinion and says i do the drudgery in the mine well we have each our share of sport and each that which he likes best tis his diversion to set tis mine to cover the partridge heart and it should be mine to let em go again sharp not till you had mouthed a little george i think thats all thou art fit for now heart good mr youngfellow youre mistaken as able as yourself and as nimble too though i maynt have so much mercury in my limbs tis true indeed i dont force appetite but wait the natural call of my lust and think it time enough to be lewd after i have had the temptation bell time enough ay too soon i should rather have expected from a person of your gravity heart yet it is oftentimes too late with some of you young termagant flashy sinners you have all the guilt of the intention and none of the pleasure of the practice tis true you are so eager in pursuit of the temptation that you save the devil the trouble of leading you into it nor is it out of discretion that you dont swallow that very hook yourselves have baited but you are cloyed with the preparative and what you mean for a whet turns the edge of your puny stomachs your love is like your courage which you show for the first year or two upon all occasions till in a little time being disabled or disarmed you abate of your vigour and that daring blade which was so often drawn is bound to the peace for ever after bell thou art an old fornicator of a singular good principle indeed and art for encouraging youth that they may be as wicked as thou art at thy years heart i am for having everybody be what they pretend to be a whoremaster be a whoremaster and not like vainlove kiss a lapdog with passion when it would disgust him from the ladys own lips bell that only happens sometimes where the dog has the sweeter breath for the more cleanly conveyance but george you must not quarrel with little gallantries of this nature women are often won by em who would refuse to kiss a lapdog if it were preliminary to the lips of his lady sharp or omit playing with her fan and cooling her if she were hot when it might entitle him to the office of warming her when she should be cold bell what is it to read a play in a rainy day though you should be now and then interrupted in a witty scene and she perhaps preserve her laughter till the jest were over even that may be borne with considering the reward in prospect heart i confess you that are womens asses bear greater burdens are forced to undergo dressing dancing singing sighing whining rhyming flattering lying grinning cringing and the drudgery of loving to boot bell o brute the drudgery of loving heart ay why to come to love through all these incumbrances is like coming to an estate overcharged with debts which by the time you have paid yields no further profit than what the bare tillage and manuring of the land will produce at the expense of your own sweat bell prithee how dost thou love sharp he he hates the sex heart so i hate physic too yet i may love to take it for my health bell well come off george if at any time you should be taken straying sharp he has need of such an excuse considering the present state of his body heart how dye mean sharp why if whoring be purging as you call it then i may say marriage is entering into a course of physic bell how george does the wind blow there heart it will as soon blow north and by south marry quotha i hope in heaven i have a greater portion of grace and i think i have baited too many of those traps to be caught in one myself bell who the devil would have thee unless twere an oysterwoman to propagate young fry for billingsgate thy talent will never recommend thee to anything of better quality heart my talent is chiefly that of speaking truth which i dont expect should ever recommend me to people of quality i thank heaven i have very honestly purchased the hatred of all the great families in town sharp and you in return of spleen hate them but could you hope to be received into the alliance of a noble family heart no i hope i shall never merit that affliction to be punished with a wife of birth be a stag of the first head and bear my horns aloft like one of the supporters of my wifes coat sdeath i would not be a cuckold to eer an illustrious whore in england bell what not to make your family man and provide for your children sharp for her children you mean heart ay there youve nicked it theres the devil upon devil oh the pride and joy of heart twould be to me to have my son and heir resemble such a duke to have a fleering coxcomb scoff and cry mr your sons mighty like his grace has just his smile and air ofs face then replies another methinks he has more of the marquess of such a place about his nose and eyes though he has my lord whatdyecalls mouth to a tittle then i to put it off as unconcerned come chuck the infant under the chin force a smile and cry ay the boy takes after his mothers relations when the devil and she knows tis a little compound of the whole body of nobility bellsharp ha ha ha bell well but george i have one question to ask you heart pshaw i have prattled away my time i hope you are in no haste for an answer for i shant stay now looking on his watch bell nay prithee george heart no besides my business i see a fool coming this way adieu scene v sharper bellmour bell what does he mean oh tis sir joseph wittoll with his friend but i see he has turned the corner and goes another way sharp what in the name of wonder is it bell why a fool sharp tis a tawdry outside bell and a very beggarly lining yet he may be worth your acquaintance a little of thy chymistry tom may extract gold from that dirt sharp say you so faith i am as poor as a chymist and would be as industrious but what was he that followed him is not he a dragon that watches those golden pippins bell hang him no he a dragon if he be tis a very peaceful one i can ensure his anger dormant or should he seem to rouse tis but well lashing him and he will sleep like a top sharp ay is he of that kidney bell yet is adored by that bigot sir joseph wittoll as the image of valour he calls him his back and indeed they are never asunder yet last night i know not by what mischance the knight was alone and had fallen into the hands of some nightwalkers who i suppose would have pillaged him but i chanced to come by and rescued him though i believe he was heartily frightened for as soon as ever he was loose he ran away without staying to see who had helped him sharp is that bully of his in the army bell no but is a pretender and wears the habit of a soldier which nowadays as often cloaks cowardice as a black gown does atheism you must know he has been abroad went purely to run away from a campaign enriched himself with the plunder of a few oaths and here vents them against the general who slighting men of merit and preferring only those of interest has made him quit the service sharp wherein no doubt he magnifies his own performance bell speaks miracles is the drum to his own praise the only implement of a soldier he resembles like that being full of blustering noise and emptiness sharp and like that of no use but to be beaten bell right but then the comparison breaks for he will take a drubbing with as little noise as a pulpit cushion sharp his name and i have done bell why that to pass it current too he has gilded with a title he is called capt bluffe sharp well ill endeavour his acquaintance you steer another course are bound for loves island i for the golden coast may each succeed in what he wishes most act ii scene i sir joseph wittoll sharper following sharp sure thats he and alone sir jo um ay this this is the very damned place the inhuman cannibals the bloodyminded villains would have butchered me last night no doubt they would have flayed me alive have sold my skin and devoured etc sharp hows this sir jo an it hadnt been for a civil gentleman as came by and frighted em away but agad i durst not stay to give him thanks sharp this must be bellmour he means ha i have a thought sir jo zooks would the captain would come the very remembrance makes me quake agad i shall never be reconciled to this place heartily sharp tis but trying and being where i am at worst now luck cursed fortune this must be the place this damned unlucky place sir jo agad and so tis why here has been more mischief done i perceive sharp no tis gone tis lost ten thousand devils on that chance which drew me hither ay here just here this spot to me is hell nothing to be found but the despair of what ive lost looking about as in search sir jo poor gentleman by the lord harry ill stay no longer for i have found too sharp ha whos that has found what have you found restore it quickly or by sir jo not i sir not i as ive a soul to be saved i have found nothing but what has been to my loss as i may say and as you were saying sir sharp oh your servant sir you are safe then it seems tis an ill wind that blows nobody good well you may rejoice over my ill fortune since it paid the price of your ransom sir jo i rejoice agad not i sir im very sorry for your loss with all my heart blood and guts sir and if you did but know me youd neer say i were so illnatured sharp know you why can you be so ungrateful to forget me sir jo o lord forget him no no sir i dont forget you because i never saw your face before agad ha ha ha sharp how angrily sir jo stay stay sir let me recollect hes a damned angry fellow i believe i had better remember him until i can get out of his sight but out of sight out of mind agad aside sharp methought the service i did you last night sir in preserving you from those ruffians might have taken better root in your shallow memory sir jo gadsdaggersbeltsblades and scabbards this is the very gentleman how shall i make him a return suitable to the greatness of his merit i had a pretty thing to that purpose if he hant frighted it out of my memory hem hem sir i most submissively implore your pardon for my transgression of ingratitude and omission having my entire dependence sir upon the superfluity of your goodness which like an inundation will i hope totally immerge the recollection of my error and leave me floating in your sight upon the fullblown bladders of repentance by the help of which i shall once more hope to swim into your favour bows sharp soh oh sir i am easily pacified the acknowledgment of a gentleman sir jo acknowledgment sir i am all over acknowledgment and will not stick to show it in the greatest extremity by night or by day in sickness or in health winter or summer all seasons and occasions shall testify the reality and gratitude of your superabundant humble servant sir joseph wittoll knight hem hem sharp sir joseph wittoll sir jo the same sir of wittoll hall in comitatu bucks sharp is it possible then i am happy to have obliged the mirror of knighthood and pink of courtesie in the age let me embrace you sir jo o lord sir sharp my loss i esteem as a trifle repaid with interest since it has purchased me the friendship and acquaintance of the person in the world whose character i admire sir jo you are only pleased to say so sir but pray if i may be so bold what is that loss you mention sharp oh term it no longer so sir in the scuffle last night i only dropt a bill of a hundred pound which i confess i came half despairing to recover but thanks to my better fortune sir jo you have found it sir then it seems i profess im heartily glad sharp sir your humble servant i dont question but you are that you have so cheap an opportunity of expressing your gratitude and generosity since the paying so trivial a sum will wholly acquit you and doubly engage me sir jo what a dickens does he mean by a trivial sum aside but hant you found it sir sharp no otherwise i vow to gad but in my hopes in you sir sir jo humh sharp but thats sufficient twere injustice to doubt the honour of sir joseph wittoll sir jo o lord sir sharp you are above im sure a thought so low to suffer me to lose what was ventured in your service nay twas in a manner paid down for your deliverance twas so much lent you and you scorn ill say that for you sir jo nay ill say that for myself with your leave sir i do scorn a dirty thing but agad im a little out of pocket at present sharp pshaw you cant want a hundred pound your word is sufficient anywhere tis but borrowing so much dirt you have large acres and can soon repay it money is but dirt sir joseph mere dirt sir jo but i profess tis a dirt i have washed my hands of at present i have laid it all out upon my back sharp are you so extravagant in clothes sir joseph sir jo ha ha ha a very good jest i profess ha ha ha a very good jest and i did not know that i had said it and thats a better jest than tother tis a sign you and i hant been long acquainted you have lost a good jest for want of knowing me i only mean a friend of mine whom i call my back he sticks as close to me and follows me through all dangers he is indeed back breast and headpiece as it were to me agad hes a brave fellow pauh i am quite another thing when i am with him i dont fear the devil bless us almost if he be by ah had he been with me last night sharp if he had sir what then he could have done no more nor perhaps have suffered so much had he a hundred pound to lose angrily sir jo o lord sir by no means but i might have saved a hundred pound i meant innocently as i hope to be saved sir a damned hot fellow only as i was saying i let him have all my ready money to redeem his great sword from limbo but sir i have a letter of credit to alderman fondlewife as far as two hundred pound and this afternoon you shall see i am a person such a one as you would wish to have met with sharp that you are ill be sworn aside why thats great and like yourself scene ii to them captain bluffe sir jo oh here a comes ay my hector of troy welcome my bully my back agad my heart has gone a pit pat for thee bluff how now my young knight not for fear i hope he that knows me must be a stranger to fear sir jo nay agad i hate fear ever since i had like to have died of a fright but bluff but look you here boy heres your antidote heres your jesuits powder for a shaking fit but who hast thou got with thee is he of mettle laying his hand upon his sword sir jo ay bully a devilish smart fellow a will fight like a cock bluff say you so then i honour him but has he been abroad for every cock will fight upon his own dunghill sir jo i dont know but ill present you bluff ill recommend myself sir i honour you i understand you love fighting i

in some very justifiable cause im not for it bluff o lord i beg your pardon sir i find you are not of my palate you cant relish a dish of fighting without sweet sauce now i think fighting for fighting sakes sufficient cause fighting to mes religion and the laws sir jo ah well said my hero was not that great sir by the lord harry he says true fighting is meat drink and cloth to him but back this gentleman is one of the best friends i have in the world and saved my life last night you know i told you bluff ay then i honour him again sir may i crave your name sharp ay sir my names sharper sir jo pray mr sharper embrace my back very well by the lord harry mr sharper hes as brave a fellow as cannibal are not you bullyback sharp hannibal i believe you mean sir joseph bluff undoubtedly he did sir faith hannibal was a very pretty fellow but sir joseph comparisons are odious hannibal was a very pretty fellow in those days it must be granted but alas sir were he alive now he would be nothing nothing in the earth sharp how sir i make a doubt if there be at this day a greater general breathing bluff oh excuse me sir have you served abroad sir sharp not i really sir bluff oh i thought so why then you can know nothing sir i am afraid you scarce know the history of the late war in flanders with all its particulars sharp not i sir no more than public letters or gazettes tell us bluff gazette

what youve said your fever has transported you aram if love be the fever which you mean kind heaven avert the cure let me have oil to feed that flame and never let it be extinct till i myself am ashes belin there was a whine o gad i hate your horrid fancy this love is the devil and sure to be in love is to be possessed tis in the head the heart the blood the all over o gad you are quite spoiled i shall loathe the sight of mankind for your sake aram fie this is gross affectation a little of bellmours company would change the scene belin filthy fellow i wonder cousin aram i wonder cousin you should imagine i dont perceive you love him belin oh i love your hideous fancy ha ha ha love a man aram love a man yes you would not love a beast belin of all beasts not an ass which is so like your vainlove lard i have seen an ass look so chagrin ha ha ha you must pardon me i cant help laughing that an absolute lover would have concluded the poor creature to have had darts and flames and altars and all that in his breast araminta come ill talk seriously to you now could you but see with my eyes the buffoonery of one scene of address a lover set out with all his equipage and appurtenances o gad i sure you would but you play the game and consequently cant see the miscarriages obvious to every stander by aram yes yes i can see something near it when you and bellmour meet you dont know that you dreamt of bellmour last night and called him aloud in your sleep belin pish i cant help dreaming of the devil sometimes would you from thence infer i love him aram but thats not all you caught me in your arms when you named him and pressed me to your bosom sure if i had not pinched you until you waked you had stifled me with kisses belin o barbarous aspersion aram no aspersion cousin we are alone nay i can tell you more belin i deny it all aram what before you hear it belin my denial is premeditated like your malice lard cousin you talk oddly whatever the matter is o my sol im afraid youll follow evil courses aram ha ha ha this is pleasant belin you may laugh but aram ha ha ha belin you think the malicious grin becomes you the devil take bellmour why do you tell me of him aram oh is it come out now you are angry i am sure you love him i tell nobody else cousin i have not betrayed you yet belin prithee tell it all the world its false aram come then kiss and friends belin pish aram prithee dont be so peevish belin prithee dont be so impertinent betty aram ha ha ha betty did your ladyship call madam belin get my hoods and tippet and bid the footman call a chair aram i hope

changed i wont go scene vi araminta belinda aram so this i expected you wont oblige me then cousin and let me have all the company to myself belin no upon deliberation i have too much charity to trust you to yourself the devil watches all opportunities and in this favourable disposition of your mind heaven knows how far you may be tempted i am tender of your reputation aram i am obliged to you but whos malicious now belinda belin not i witness my heart i stay out of pure affection aram in my conscience i believe you scene vii to them vainlove bellmour footman bell so fortune be praised to find you both within ladies is aram no miracle i hope bell not o your side madam i confess but my tyrant there and i are two buckets that can never come together belin nor are ever like yet we often meet and clash bell how never like marry hymen forbid but this it is to run so extravagantly in debt i have laid out such a world of love in your service that you think you can never be able to pay me all so shun me for the same reason that you would a dun belin ay on my conscience and the most impertinent and troublesome of duns a dun for money will be quiet when he sees his debtor has not wherewithal but a dun for love is an eternal torment that never rests bell until he has created love where there was none and then gets it for his pains for importunity in love like importunity at court first creates its own interest and then pursues it for the favour aram favours that are got by impudence and importunity are like discoveries from the rack when the afflicted person for his ease sometimes confesses secrets his heart knows nothing of vain i should rather think favours so gained to be due rewards to indefatigable devotion for as love is a deity he must be served by prayer belin o gad would you would all pray to love then and let us alone vain you are the temples of love and tis through you our devotion must be conveyed aram rather poor silly idols of your own making which upon the least displeasure you forsake and set up new every man now changes his mistress and his religion as his humour varies or his interest vain o madam aram nay come i find we are growing serious and then we are in great danger of being dull if my musicmaster be not gone ill entertain you with a new song which comes pretty near my own opinion of love and your sex whos there is mr gavot gone calls foot

hideous fancy you said that once before if you must talk impertinently for heavens sake let it be with variety dont come always like the devil wrapt in flames ill not hear a sentence more that begins with an i burn or an i beseech you madam bell but tell me how you would be adored i am very tractable belin then know i would be adored in silence bell humph i thought so that you might have all the talk to yourself you had better let me speak for if my thoughts fly to any pitch i shall make villainous signs belin what will you get by that to make such signs as i wont understand bell ay but if im tonguetied i must have all my actions free to quicken your apprehension and igad let me tell you my most prevailing argument is expressed in dumb show scene ix to them musicmaster aram oh i am glad we shall have a song to divert the discourse pray oblige us with the last new song song i thus to a ripe consenting maid poor old repenting delia said would you long preserve your lover would you still his goddess reign never let him all discover never let him much obtain ii men will admire adore and die while wishing at your feet they lie but admitting their embraces wakes em from the golden dream nothings new besides our faces every woman is the same aram so how dee like the song gentlemen bell oh very well performed but i dont much admire the words aram i expected it theres too much truth in em if mr gavot will walk with us in the garden well have it once again you may like it better at second hearing youll bring my cousin bell faith madam i dare not speak to her but ill make signs addresses belinda in dumb show belin oh foh your dumb rhetoric is more ridiculous than your talking impertinence as an ape is a much more troublesome animal than a parrot aram ay cousin and tis a sign the creatures mimic nature well for there are few men but do more silly things than they say bell well i find my apishness has paid the ransom for my speech and set it at liberty though i confess i could be well enough pleased to drive on a lovebargain in that silent manner twould save a man a world of lying and swearing at the years end besides i have had a little experience that brings to mind when wit and reason both have failed to move kind looks and actions from success do prove evn silence may be eloquent in love act iii scene i scene the street silvia and lucy silv will he not come

consuming fire a womans arms ha well recollected i will recover my reason and be gone bell now venus forbid vain hush heart well why do you not move feet do your office not one inch no fore gad im

levite and pampereth himself up with dainties that he may look lovely in the eyes of women sincerely i am afraid he hath already defiled the tabernacle of our sister comfort while her good husband is deluded by his godly appearance i say that even lust doth sparkle in his eyes and glow upon his cheeks and that i would as soon trust my wife with a lords highfed chaplain bar sir the hour draws nigh

fondlewife alone and in the meantime i will reason with myself tell me isaac why art thee jealous why art thee distrustful of the wife of thy bosom because she is young and vigorous and i am old and

which tempted thee also tempt others who will tempt her isaac i fear it much but does not thy wife love thee nay dote upon thee yes why then ay but to say truth shes fonder of me than she has reason to be and in the way of trade we still suspect the smoothest dealers of the deepest designs and that she has some designs deeper than thou canst reach thou hast experimented isaac but mum scene iv
