beware of the dog down below there was only a vast white undulating sea of cloud above there was the sun and the sun was white like the clouds because it is never yellow when one looks at it from high in the air he was still flying the spitfire his right hand was on the stick and he was working the rudder bar with his left leg alone it was quite easy the machine was flying well and he knew what he

because of all the blood and the mess i shall laugh and say for gods sake help me out he glanced down again at his right leg there was not much of it left the cannon shell had taken him on the thigh just above the knee and now there was nothing but a great mess and a lot of blood but there was no pain when he looked down he felt as though he were seeing something that did not belong to him it had nothing to do with him it was just a mess which happened to be there in the cockpit something strange and unusual and rather interesting it was like finding a dead cat on the sofa he really felt fine and because he still felt fine he felt excited and unafraid i wont even bother to call up on the radio for the blood wagon he thought it isnt necessary and when i land ill sit there quite normally and say some of you fellows come and help me out will you because ive lost one of my legs that will be funny ill laugh a little while im saying it ill say it calmly and slowly and theyll think im joking

in the bath and make the handle swell i chopped lots of wood last time i went home and i put the ax in the bath then he saw the sun shining on the engine cowling of his machine he saw the rivets in the metal and he remembered where he was he realized that he was no longer feeling good that he was sick and giddy his head kept falling forward onto his chest because his neck seemed no longer to have any strength but he knew that he was flying the spitfire and he could feel the handle of the stick between the fingers of his right hand im going to pass out he thought any moment now im going to pass out he looked at his altimeter twentyone thousand to test himself he tried to read the hundreds as well as the thousands twentyone thousand and what as he looked the dial became blurred and he could not even see the needle he knew then that he must bail out that there was not a second to lose otherwise he would become unconscious quickly frantically he tried to slide back the hood with his left hand but he had not the strength for a second he took his right hand off the stick and with both hands he managed to push the hood back the rush of cold air on his face seemed to help he had a moment of great clearness and his actions became orderly and precise that is what happens with a good pilot he took some quick deep breaths from his oxygen mask and as he did so he looked out over the side of the cockpit down below there was only a vast white sea of cloud and he realized that he did not know where he was itll be the channel he thought im sure to fall in the drink he throttled back pulled off his helmet undid his straps and pushed the stick hard over to the left the spitfire dripped its port wing and turned smoothly over onto its back the pilot fell out as he fell he opened his eyes because he knew that he must not pass out before he had pulled the cord on one side he saw the sun on the other he saw the whiteness of the clouds and as he fell as he somersaulted in the air the white clouds chased the sun and the sun chased the clouds they chased each other in a small circle they ran faster and faster and there was the sun and the clouds and the clouds and the sun and the clouds came nearer until suddenly there was no longer any sun but only a beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom great whiteness the whole world was white and there was nothing in it it was so white that sometimes it looked black and after a time it was either white or black but mostly it was white he watched it as it turned from white to black and then back to white again and the white stayed for a long time but the black lasted only for a few seconds he got into the habit of going to sleep during the white periods and of waking up just in time to see the world when it was black but the black was very quick sometimes it was only a flash like someone switching off the light and switching it on again at once and so whenever it was white he dozed off one day when it was white he put out a hand and he touched something he took it between his fingers and crumpled it for a time helay there idly letting the tips of his fingers play with the thing which they had touched then slowly he opened his eyes looked down at his hand and saw that he was holding something which was white it was the edge of a sheet he knew it was a sheet because he could see the texture of the material and the stitchings on the hem he screwed up his eyes and opened them again quickly this time he saw the room he saw the bed in which he was lying he saw the grey walls and the door and the green curtains over the window there were some roses on the table by his bed then he saw the basin on the table near the roses it was a white enamel basin and beside it there was a small medicine glass this is a hospital he thought i am in a hospital but he could remember nothing he lay back on his pillow looking at the ceiling and wondering what had happened he was gazing at the smooth greyness of the ceiling which was so clean and gray and then suddenly he saw a fly walking upon it the sight of this fly the suddenness of seeing this small black speck on a sea of gray brushed the surface of his brain and quickly in that second he remembered everything he remembered the spitfire and he remembered the altimeter showing twentyone thousand feet he remembered the pushing back of the hood with both hands and he remembered the bailing out he remembered his leg it seemed all right now he looked down at the end of the bed but he could not tell he put one hand underneath the bedclothes and felt for his knees he found one of them but when he felt for the other his hand touched something which was soft and covered in bandages just then the door opened and a nurse came in beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom hello she said so youve waked up at last she was not goodlooking but she was large and clean she was between thirty and forty and she had fair hair more than that he did not notice where am i youre a lucky fellow you landed in a wood near the beach youre in brighton they brought you in two days ago and now youre all fixed up you look fine ive lost a leg he said thats nothing well get you another one now you must go to sleep the doctor will be coming to see you in about an hour she picked up the basin and the medicine glass and went out but he did not sleep he wanted to keep his eyes open because he was frightened that if he shut them again everything would go away he lay looking at the ceiling the fly was still there it was very energetic it would run forward very fast for a few inches then it would stop then it would run forward again stop run forward stop and every now and then it would take off and buzz around viciously in small circles it always landed back in the same place on the ceiling and started running and stopping all over again he watched it for so long that after a while it was no longer a fly but only a black speck upon a sea of gray and he was still watching it when the nurse opened the door and stood aside while the doctor came in he was an army doctor a major and he had some last war ribbons on his chest he was bald and small but he had a cheerful face and kind eyes well well he said so youve decided to wake up at last how are you feeling i feel all right thats the stuff youll be up and about in no time the doctor took his wrist to feel his pulse by the way he said some of the lads from your squadron were ringing up and asking about you they wanted to come along beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom and see you but i said that theyd better wait a day or two told them you were all right and that they could come and see you a little later on just lie quiet and take it easy for a bit got something to read he glanced at the table with the roses no well nurse will look after you shell get you anything you want with that he waved his hand and went out followed by the large clean nurse when they had gone he lay back and looked at the ceiling again the fly was still there and as he lay watching it he heard the noise of an airplane in the distance he lay listening to the sound of its engines it was a long way away i wonder what it is he thought let me see if i can place it suddenly he jerked his head sharply to one side anyone who has been bombed can tell the noise of a junkers they can tell most other german bombers for that matter but especially a junkers the engines seem to sing a duet there is a deep vibrating bass voice and with it there is a high pitched tenor it is the singing of the tenor which makes the sound of a ju something which one cannot mistake he lay listening to the noise and he felt quite certain about what it was but where were the sirens and where the guns that german pilot certainly had a nerve coming near brighton alone in daylight the aircraft was always far away and soon the noise faded away into the distance later on there was another this one too was far away but there was the same deep undulating bass and the high singing tenor and there was no mistaking it he had heard that noise every day during the battle he was puzzled there was a bell on the table by the bed he reached out his hand and rang it he heard the noise of footsteps down the corridor and the nurse came in nurse what were those airplanes im sure i dont know i didnt hear them probably fighters or bombers i expect they were returning from france why whats the matter they were jus im sure they were jus i know the sound of the engines there were two of them what were they doing over here the nurse came up to the side of his bed and began to straighten out the sheets and tuck them in under the mattress beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom gracious me what things you imagine you mustnt worry about a thing like that would you like me to get you something to read no thank you she patted his pillow and brushed back the hair from his forehead with her hand they never come over in daylight any longer you know that they were probably lancasters or flying fortresses nurse yes could i have a cigarette why certainly you can she went out and came back almost at once with a packet of players and some matches she handed one to him and when he had put it in his mouth she struck a match and lit it if you want me again she said just ring the bell and she went out once toward evening he heard the noise of another aircraft it was far away but even so he knew that it was a singleengined machine but he could not place it it was going fast he could tell that but it wasnt a spit and it wasnt a hurricane it did not sound like an american engine either they make more noise he did not know what it was and it worried him greatly perhaps i am very ill he thought perhaps i am imagining things perhaps i am a little delirious i simply do not know what to think that evening the nurse came in with a basin of hot water and began to wash him well she said i hope you dont still think that were being bombed she had taken off his pajama top and was soaping his right arm with a flannel he did not answer she rinsed the flannel in the water rubbed more soap on it and began to wash his chest youre looking fine this evening she said they operated on you as soon as you came in they did a marvelous job youll be beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom all right ive got a brother in the raf she added flying bombers he said i went to school in brighton she looked up quickly well thats fine she said i expect youll know some people in the town yes he said i know quite a few she had finished washing his chest and arms and now she turned back the bedclothes so that his left leg was uncovered she did it in such a way that his bandaged stump remained under the sheets she undid the cord of his pajama trousers and took them off there was no trouble because they had cut off the right trouser leg so that it could not interfere with the bandages she began to wash his left leg and the rest of his body this was the first time he had had a bed bath and he was embarrassed she laid a towel under his leg and she was washing his foot with the flannel she said this wretched soap wont lather at all its the water its as hard as nails he said none of the soap is very good now and of course with hard water its hopeless as he said it he remembered something he remembered the baths which he used to take at school in brighton in the long stonefloored bathroom which had four baths in a room he remembered how the water was so soft that you had to take a shower afterwards to get all the soap off your body and he remembered how the foam used to float on the surface of the water so that you could not see your legs underneath he remembered that sometimes they were given calcium tablets because the school doctor used to say that soft water was bad for the teeth in brighton he said the water isnt he did not finish the sentence something had occurred to him something so fantastic and absurd that for a moment he felt like telling the nurse about it and having a good laugh she looked up the water isnt what she said nothing he answered i was dreaming she rinsed the flannel in the basin wiped the soap off his leg and dried him with a towel beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom its nice to be washed he said i feel better he was feeling his face with his hands i need a shave well do that tomorrow she said perhaps you can do it yourself then that night he could not sleep he lay awake thinking of the junkers s and of the hardness of the water he could think of nothing else they were jus he said to himself i know they were and yet it is not possible because they would not be flying around so low over here in broad daylight i know that it is true and yet i know that it is impossible perhaps i am ill perhaps i am behaving like a fool and do not know what i am doing or saying perhaps i am delirious for a long time he lay awake thinking these things and once he sat up in bed and said aloud i will prove that i am not crazy i will make a little speech about something complicated and intellectual i will talk about what to do with germany after the war but before he had time to begin he was asleep he woke just as the first light of day was showing through the slit in the curtains over the window the room was still dark but he could tell that it was already beginning to get light outside he lay looking at the grey light which was showing through the slit in the curtain and as he lay there he remembered the day before he remembered the junkers s and the hardness of the water he remembered the large pleasant nurse and the kind doctor and now the small grain of doubt took root in his mind and it began to grow he looked around the room the nurse had taken the roses out the night before and there was nothing except the table with a packet of cigarettes a box of matches and an ash tray otherwise it was bare it was no longer warm or friendly it was not even comfortable it was cold and empty and very quiet slowly the grain of doubt grew and with it came fear a light dancing fear that warned but did not frighten the kind of fear that one gets not because one is afraid but because one feels that there is something wrong quickly the doubt and the fear grew so that he became restless and angry and when he touched his forehead with his hand he found that it was damp with sweat he knew then that he must do something that he must find some way of proving to himself that he was either right or wrong and he looked up and saw again the window and the green curtains from where he lay that window was right in front of him but it beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom was fully ten yards away somehow he must reach it and look out the idea became an obsession with him and soon he could think of nothing except the window but what about his leg he put his hand underneath the bedclothes and felt the thick bandaged stump which was all that was left on the righthand side it seemed all right it didnt hurt but it would not be easy he sat up then he pushed the bedclothes aside and put his left leg on the floor slowly carefully he swung his body over until he had both hands on the floor as well and then he was out of bed kneeling on the carpet he looked at the stump it was very short and thick covered with bandages it was beginning to hurt and he could feel it throbbing he wanted to collapse lie down on the carpet and do nothing but he knew that he must go on with two arms and one leg he crawled over towards the window he would reach forward as far as he could with his arms then he would give a little jump and slide his left leg along after them each time he did it jarred his wound so that he gave a soft grunt of pain but he continued to crawl across the floor on two hands and one knee when he got to the window he reached up and one at a time he placed both hands on the sill slowly he raised himself up until he was standing on his left leg then quickly he pushed aside the curtains and looked out he saw a small house with a gray tiled roof standing alone beside a narrow lane and immediately behind it there was a plowed field in front of the house there was an untidy gar den and there was a green hedge separating the garden from the lane he was looking at the hedge when he saw the sign it was just a piece of board nailed to the top of a short pole and because the hedge had not been trimmed for a long time the branches had grown out around the sign so that it seemed almost as though it had been placed in the middle of the hedge there was something written on the board with white paint and he pressed his head against the glass of the window trying to read what it said the first letter was a g he could see that the second was an a and the third was an r one after another he man aged to see what the letters were there were three words and slowly he spelled the letters out aloud to himself as he managed to read them garde au chie n garde au chien that is what it said he stood there balancing on one leg and holding tightly to the edges of the window sill with his hands staring at the sign and at beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom the whitewashed lettering of the words for a moment he could think of nothing at all he stood there looking at the sign repeating the words over and over to himself and then slowly he began to realize the full meaning of the thing he looked up at the cottage and at the plowed field he looked at the small orchard on the left of the cottage and he looked at the green countryside beyond so this is france he said i am france now the throbbing in his right thigh was very great it felt as though someone was pounding the end of his stump with a hammer and suddenly the pain became so intense that it affected his head and for a moment he thought he was going to fall quickly he knelt down again crawled back to the bed and hoisted himself in he pulled the bedclothes over himself and lay back on the pillow exhausted he could still think of nothing at all except the small sign by the hedge and the plowed field and the orchard it was the words on the sign that he could not forget it was some time before the nurse came in she came carrying a basin of hot water and she said good morning how are you today he said good morning nurse the pain was still great under the bandages but he did not wish to tell this woman anything he looked at her as she busied herself with getting the washing things ready he looked at her more carefully now her hair was very fair she was tall and bigboned end her face seemed pleasant but there was something a little uneasy about her eyes they were never still they never looked at anything for more than a moment and they moved too quickly from one place to another in the room there was something about her movements also they were too sharp and nervous to go well with the casual manner in which she spoke she set down the basin took off his pajama top and began to wash him did you sleep well yes good she said she was washing his arms and his chest i believe theres someone coming down to see you from the air ministry after breakfast she went on they want a report or beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom something i expect you know all about it how you got shot down and all that i wont let him stay long so dont worry he did not answer she finished washing him and gave him a toothbrush and some tooth powder he brushed his teeth rinsed his mouth and spat the water out into the basin later she brought him his breakfast on a tray but he did not want to eat he was still feeling weak and sick and he wished only to lie still and think about what had happened and there was a sentence running through his head it was a sentence which johnny the intelligence officer of his squadron always repeated to the pilots every day before they went out he could see johnny now leaning against the wall of the dispersal hut with his pipe in his hand saying and if they get you dont forget just your name rank and number nothing else for gods sake say nothing else there you are she said as she put the tray on his lap ive got you an egg can you manage all right yes she stood beside the bed are you feeling all right yes good if you want another egg i might be able to get you one this is all right well just ring the bell if you want any more and she went out he had just finished eating when the nurse came in again she said wing commander roberts is here ive told him that he can only stay for a few minutes she beckoned with her hand and the wing commander came in sorry to bother you like this he said he was an ordinary raf officer dressed in a uniform which was a little shabby and he wore wings and a dfc he was fairly tall and thin with plenty of black hair his teeth which were irregular and widely spaced stuck out a little even when he closed beware of the dog get any book for free on wwwabikacom his mouth as he spoke he took a printed form and a pencil from his pocket and he pulled up a chair and sat down how are you feeling there was no answer tough luck about your leg i know how you feel i hear you put up a fine show before they got you the man in the bed was lying quite still watching the man in the chair the man in the chair said well lets get this stuff over im afraid youll have to answer a few questions so that i can fill in this combat report let me see now first of all what was your squadron the man in the bed did not move he looked straight at the wing commander and he said my name is peter williamson my rank is squadron leader and my number is nine seven two four five seven
