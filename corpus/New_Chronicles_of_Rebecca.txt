abijah the brave and the fair emma jane first chronicle jack olantern i miss miranda sawyers oldfashioned garden was the pleasantest spot in riverboro on a sunny july morning the rich color of the brick house gleamed and glowed through the shade of the elms and maples luxuriant hopvines clambered up the lightning rods and water spouts hanging their delicate clusters here and there in graceful profusion woodbine transformed the old shed and tool house to things of beauty and the flower beds themselves were the prettiest and most fragrant in all the countryside a row of dahlias ran directly around the garden spot dahlias scarlet gold and variegated in the very centre was a round plot where the upturned faces of a thousand pansies smiled amid their leaves and in the four corners were triangular blocks of sweet phlox over which the butterflies fluttered unceasingly in the spaces between ran a riot of portulaca and nasturtiums while in the more regular shellbordered beds grew spirea and gillyflowers mignonette marigolds and clove pinks back of the barn and encroaching on the edge of the hay field was a grove of sweet clover whose white feathery tips fairly bent under the assaults of the bees while banks of aromatic mint and thyme drank in the sunshine and sent it out again into the summer air warm and deliciously odorous the hollyhocks were miss sawyers pride and they grew in a stately line beneath the four kitchen windows their tapering tips set thickly with gay satin circlets of pink or lavender or crimson they grow something like steeples thought little rebecca randall who was weeding the bed and the flat round flowers are like rosettes but steeples wouldnt be studded with rosettes so if you were writing about them in a composition youd have to give up one or the other and i think ill give up the steeples gay little hollyhock lifting your head sweetly rosetted out from your bed its a pity the hollyhock isnt really little instead of steepling up to the window top but i cant say gay tall hollyhock i might have it lines to a hollyhock in may for then it would be small but oh no i forgot in may it wouldnt be blooming and its so pretty to say that its head is sweetly rosetted i wish the teacher wasnt away she would like sweetly rosetted and she would like to hear me recite roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll that i learned out of aunt janes byron the rolls come booming out of it just like the waves at the beach i could make nice compositions now everything is blooming so and its so warm and sunny and happy outdoors miss dearborn told me to write something in my thought book every single day and ill begin this very night when i go to bed rebecca rowena randall the little niece of the brickhouse ladies and at present sojourning there for purposes of board lodging education and incidentally such discipline and chastening as might ultimately produce moral excellence rebecca randall had a passion for the rhyme and rhythm of poetry from her earliest childhood words had always been to her what dolls and toys are to other children and now at twelve she amused herself with phrases and sentences and images as her schoolmates played with the pieces of their dissected puzzles if the heroine of a story took a cursory glance about her apartment rebecca would shortly ask her aunt jane to take a cursory glance at her oversewing or hemming if the villain aided and abetted someone in committing a crime she would before long request the pleasure of aiding and abetting in dishwashing or bedmaking sometimes she used the borrowed phrases unconsciously sometimes she brought them into the conversation with an intense sense of pleasure in their harmony or appropriateness for a beautiful word or sentence had the same effect upon her imagination as a fragrant nosegay a strain of music or a brilliant sunset how are you gettin on rebecca rowena called a peremptory voice from within pretty good aunt miranda only i wish flowers would ever come up as thick as this pigweed and plantain and sorrel what makes weeds be thick and flowers be thin i just happened to be stopping to think a minute when you looked out you think considerable more than you weed i guess by appearances how many times have you peeked into that humming birds nest why dont you work all to once and play all to once like other folks i dont know the child answered confounded by the question and still more by the apparent logic back of it i dont know aunt miranda but when im working outdoors such a saturday morning as this the whole creation just screams to me to stop it and come and play well you neednt go if it does responded her aunt sharply it dont scream to me when im rollin out these doughnuts and it wouldnt to you if your mind was on your duty rebeccas little brown hands flew in and out among the weeds as she thought rebelliously creation wouldnt scream to aunt miranda it would know she wouldnt come scream on thou bright and gay creation scream tis not miranda that will hear thy cry oh such funny nice things come into my head out here by myself i do wish i could run up and put them down in my thought book before i forget them but aunt miranda wouldnt like me to leave off weeding rebecca was weeding the hollyhock bed when wonderful thoughts came into her head her aunt was occupied with the rolling pin and the thoughts of her mind were common and thin that wouldnt do because its mean to aunt miranda and anyway it isnt good i must crawl under the syringa shade a minute its so hot and anybody has to stop working once in a while just to get their breath even if they werent making poetry rebecca was weeding the hollyhock bed when marvelous thoughts came into her head miranda was wielding the rolling pin and thoughts at such times seemed to her as a sin how pretty the hollyhock rosettes look from down here on the sweet smelly ground let me see what would go with rosetting aiding and abetting petting hensetting fretting theres nothing very nice but i can make fretting do cheered by rowenas petting the flowers are rosetting but aunt mirandas fretting doth somewhat cloud the day suddenly the sound of wagon wheels broke the silence and then a voice called out a voice that could not wait until the feet that belonged to it reached the spot miss sawyer fathers got to drive over to north riverboro on an errand and please can rebecca go too as its saturday morning and vacation besides rebecca sprang out from under the syringa bush eyes flashing with delight as only rebeccas eyes could flash her face one luminous circle of joyous anticipation she clapped her grubby hands and dancing up and down cried may i aunt miranda can i aunt jane can i aunt mirandajane im more than half through the bed if you finish your weeding tonight before sundown i spose you can go so long as mr perkins has been good enough to ask you responded miss sawyer reluctantly take off that gingham apron and wash your hands clean at the pump you aint ben out o bed but two hours an your head looks as rough as if youd slep in it that comes from layin on the ground same as a caterpillar smooth your hair down with your hands an praps emma jane can braid it as you go along the road run up and get your secondbest hair ribbon out o your upper drawer and put on your shade hat no you cant wear your coral chain jewelry aint appropriate in the morning how long do you callate to be gone emma jane i dont know fathers just been sent for to see about a sick woman over to north riverboro shes got to go to the poor farm this fragment of news speedily brought miss sawyer and her sister jane as well to the door which commanded a view of mr perkins and his wagon mr perkins the father of rebeccas bosom friend was primarily a blacksmith and secondarily a selectman and an overseer of the poor a man therefore possessed of wide and varied information who is it thats sick inquired miranda a woman over to north riverboro whats the trouble cant say stranger yes and no shes that wild daughter of old nate perry that used to live up towards moderation you remember she ran away to work in the factory at milltown and married a do nothin fellow by the name o john winslow yes well where is he why dont he take care of her they aint worked well in double harness theyve been rovin round the country livin a month here and a month there wherever they could get work and houseroom they quarreled a couple o weeks ago and he left her she and the little boy kind o camped out in an old loggin cabin back in the woods and she took in washin for a spell then she got terrible sick and aint expected to live whos been nursing her inquired miss jane lizy ann dennett that lives nearest neighbor to the cabin but i guess shes tired out bein good samaritan anyways she sent word this mornin that nobody cant seem to find john winslow that there aint no relations and the towns got to be responsible so im goin over to see how the land lays climb in rebecca you an emmy jane crowd back on the cushion an ill set forrard thats the trick now were off dear dear sighed jane sawyer as the sisters walked back into the brick house i remember once seeing sally perry at meeting she was a handsome girl and im sorry shes come to grief if shed kep on goin to meetin an hadnt looked at the men folks she might a ben earnin an honest livin this minute said miranda men folks are at the bottom of everything wrong in this world she continued unconsciously reversing the verdict of history then we ought to be a happy and contented community here in riverboro replied jane as theres six women to one man if t was sixteen to one wed be all the safer responded miranda grimly putting the doughnuts in a brown crock in the cellarway and slamming the door ii the perkins horse and wagon rumbled along over the dusty country road and after a discreet silence maintained as long as human flesh could endure rebecca remarked sedately its a sad errand for such a shiny morning isnt it mr perkins plenty o trouble in the world rebecky shiny mornins an all that good man replied if you want a bed to lay on a roof over your head an food to eat youve got to work for em if i hadnt a labored early an late learned my trade an denied myself when i was young i might a ben a pauper layin sick in a loggin cabin stead o bein an overseer o the poor an selectman drivin along to take the pauper to the poor farm people that are mortgaged dont have to go to the poor farm do they mr perkins asked rebecca with a shiver of fear as she remembered her home farm at sunnybrook and the debt upon it a debt which had lain like a shadow over her childhood bless your soul no not unless they fail to pay up but sal perry an her husband hadnt got fur enough along in life to be mortgaged you have to own something before you can mortgage it rebeccas heart bounded as she learned that a mortgage represented a certain stage in worldly prosperity well she said sniffing in the fragrance of the newmown hay and growing hopeful as she did so maybe the sick woman will be better such a beautiful day and maybe the husband will come back to make it up and say hes sorry and sweet content will reign in the humble habitation that was once the scene of poverty grief and despair thats how it came out in a story im reading i haint noticed that life comes out like stories very much responded the pessimistic blacksmith who as rebecca privately thought had read less than half a dozen books in his long and prosperous career a drive of three or four miles brought the party to a patch of woodland where many of the tall pines had been hewn the previous winter the roof of a ramshackle hut was outlined against a background of young birches and a rough path made in hauling the logs to the main road led directly to its door as they drew near the figure of a woman approached mrs lizy ann dennett in a gingham dress with a calico apron over her head good morning mr perkins said the woman who looked tired and irritable im real glad you come right over for she took worse after i sent you word and shes dead dead the word struck heavily and mysteriously on the childrens ears dead and their young lives just begun stretched on and on all decked like hope in living green dead and all the rest of the world reveling in strength dead with all the daisies and buttercups waving in the fields and the men heaping the mown grass into fragrant cocks or tossing it into heavily laden carts dead with the brooks tinkling after the summer showers with the potatoes and corn blossoming the birds singing for joy and every little insect humming and chirping adding its note to the blithe chorus of warm throbbing life i was all alone with her she passed away suddenly jest about break o day said lizy ann dennett her soul passed upward to its god just at the break of day these words came suddenly into rebeccas mind from a tiny chamber where such things were wont to lie quietly until something brought them to the surface she could not remember whether she had heard them at a funeral or read them in the hymn book or made them up out of her own head but she was so thrilled with the idea of dying just as the dawn was breaking that she scarcely heard mrs dennetts conversation i sent for aunt beulah day an shes ben here an laid her out continued the long suffering lizy ann she aint got any folks an john winslow aint never had any as far back as i can remember she belongs to your town and youll have to bury her and take care of jacky thats the boy hes seventeen months old a bright little feller the image o john but i cant keep him another day im all wore out my own babys sick mothers rheumatiz is extry bad and my husbands comin home tonight from his weeks work if he finds a child o john winslows under his roof i cant say what would happen youll have to take him back with you to the poor farm i cant take him up there this afternoon objected mr perkins well then keep him over sunday yourself hes good as a kitten john winslowll hear o sals death sooner or later unless hes gone out of the state altogether an when he knows the boys at the poor farm i kind o think hell come and claim him could you drive me over to the village to see about the coffin and would you children be afraid to stay here alone for a spell she asked turning to the girls afraid they both echoed uncomprehendingly lizy ann and mr perkins perceiving that the fear of a dead presence had not entered the minds of rebecca or emma jane said nothing but drove off together counseling them not to stray far away from the cabin and promising to be back in an hour there was not a house within sight either looking up or down the shady road and the two girls stood hand in hand watching the wagon out of sight then they sat down quietly under a tree feeling all at once a nameless depression hanging over their gay summermorning spirits it was very still in the woods just the chirp of a grasshopper now and then or the note of a bird or the click of a fardistant mowing machine were watching whispered emma jane they watched with granpa perkins and there was a great funeral and two ministers he left two thousand dollars in the bank and a store full of goods and a paper thing you could cut tickets off of twice a year and they were just like money they watched with my little sister mira too said rebecca you remember when she died and i went home to sunnybrook farm it was winter time but she was covered with evergreen and white pinks and there was singing there wont be any funeral or ministers or singing here will there isnt that awful i spose not and oh emma jane no flowers either we might get those for her if theres nobody else to do it would you dare put them on to her asked emma jane in a hushed voice i dont know i cant tell it makes me shiver but of course we could do it if we were the only friends she had lets look into the cabin first and be perfectly sure that there arent any are you afraid nno i guess not i looked at granpa perkins and he was just the same as ever at the door of the hut emma janes courage suddenly departed she held back shuddering and refused either to enter or look in rebecca shuddered too but kept on drawn by an insatiable curiosity about life and death an overmastering desire to know and feel and understand the mysteries of existence a hunger for knowledge and experience at all hazards and at any cost emma jane hurried softly away from the felt terrors of the cabin and after two or three minutes of utter silence rebecca issued from the open door her sensitive face pale and woebegone the everready tears raining down her cheeks she ran toward the edge of the wood sinking down by emma janes side and covering her eyes sobbed with excitement oh emma jane she hasnt got a flower and shes so tired and sadlooking as if shed been hurt and hurt and never had any good times and theres a weeny weeny baby side of her oh i wish i hadnt gone in emma jane blenched for an instant mrs dennett never said there was two dead ones isnt that dreadful but she continued her practical common sense coming to the rescue youve been in once and its all over it wont be so bad when you take in the flowers because youll be used to it the goldenrod hasnt begun to bud so theres nothing to pick but daisies shall i make a long rope of them as i did for the schoolroom yes said rebecca wiping her eyes and still sobbing yes thats the prettiest and if we put it all round her like a frame the undertaker couldnt be so cruel as to throw it away even if she is a pauper because it will look so beautiful from what the sunday school lessons say shes only asleep now and when she wakes up shell be in heaven theres another place said emma jane in an orthodox and sepulchral whisper as she took her everpresent ball of crochet cotton from her pocket and began to twine the whiteweed blossoms into a rope oh well rebecca replied with the easy theology that belonged to her temperament they simply couldnt send her down there with that little weeny baby whod take care of it you know page six of the catechism says the only companions of the wicked after death are their father the devil and all the other evil angels it wouldnt be any place to bring up a baby whenever and wherever she wakes up i hope she wont know that the big baby is going to the poor farm i wonder where he is perhaps over to mrs dennetts house she didnt seem sorry a bit did she no but i suppose shes tired sitting up and nursing a stranger mother wasnt sorry when granpa perkins died she couldnt be for he was cross all the time and had to be fed like a child why are you crying again rebecca oh i dont know i cant tell emma jane only i dont want to die and have no funeral or singing and nobody sorry for me i just couldnt bear it neither could i emma jane responded sympathetically but praps if were real good and die young before we have to be fed they will be sorry i do wish you could write some poetry for her as you did for alice robinsons canary bird only still better of course like that you read me out of your thought book i could easy enough exclaimed rebecca somewhat consoled by the idea that her rhyming faculty could be of any use in such an emergency though i dont know but it would be kind of bold to do it im all puzzled about how people get to heaven after theyre buried i cant understand it a bit but if the poetry is on her what if that should go too and how could i write anything good enough to be read out loud in heaven a little piece of paper couldnt get to heaven it just couldnt asserted emma jane decisively it would be all blown to pieces and dried up and nobody knows that the angels can read writing anyway they must be as educated as we are and more so too agreed rebecca they must be more than just dead people or else why should they have wings but ill go off and write something while you finish the rope its lucky you brought your crochet cotton and i my lead pencil in fifteen or twenty minutes she returned with some lines written on a scrap of brown wrapping paper standing soberly by emma jane she said preparing to read them aloud theyre not good i was afraid your fatherd come back before i finished and the first verse sounds exactly like the funeral hymns in the church book i couldnt call her sally winslow it didnt seem nice when i didnt know her and she is dead so i thought if i said friend it would show she had somebody to be sorry this friend of ours has died and gone from us to heaven to live if she has sinned against thee lord we pray thee lord forgive her husband runneth far away and knoweth not shes dead oh bring him back ere tis too late to mourn beside her bed and if perchance it cant be so be to the children kind the weeny one that goes with her the other left behind i think thats perfectly elegant exclaimed emma jane kissing rebecca fervently you are the smartest girl in the whole state of maine and it sounds like a ministers prayer i wish we could save up and buy a printing machine then i could learn to print what you write and wed be partners like father and bill moses shall you sign it with your name like we do our school compositions no said rebecca soberly i certainly shant sign it not knowing where its going or wholl read it i shall just hide it in the flowers and whoever finds it will guess that there wasnt any minister or singing or gravestone or anything so somebody just did the best they could iii the tired mother with the weeny baby on her arm lay on a long carpenters bench her earthly journey over and when rebecca stole in and placed the flowery garland all along the edge of the rude bier death suddenly took on a more gracious and benign aspect it was only a childs sympathy and intuition that softened the rigors of the sad moment but poor wild sal winslow in her frame of daisies looked as if she were missed a little by an unfriendly world while the weeny baby whose heart had fallen asleep almost as soon as it had learned to beat the weeny baby with emma janes nosegay of buttercups in its tiny wrinkled hand smiled as if it might have been loved and longed for and mourned weve done all we can now without a minister whispered rebecca we could sing god is ever good out of the sunday school song book but im afraid somebody would hear us and think we were gay and happy whats that a strange sound broke the stillness a gurgle a yawn a merry little call the two girls ran in the direction from which it came and there on an old coat in a clump of goldenrod bushes lay a child just waking from a refreshing nap its the other baby that lizy ann dennett told about cried emma jane isnt he beautiful exclaimed rebecca come straight to me and she stretched out her arms the child struggled to its feet and tottered wavering toward the warm welcome of the voice and eyes rebecca was all mother and her maternal instincts had been well developed in the large family in which she was next to the eldest she had always confessed that there were perhaps a trifle too many babies at sunnybrook farm but nevertheless had she ever heard it she would have stood loyally by the japanese proverb whether brought forth upon the mountain or in the field it matters nothing more than a treasure of one thousand ryo a baby precious is you darling thing she crooned as she caught and lifted the child you look just like a jackolantern the boy was clad in a yellow cotton dress very full and stiff his hair was of such a bright gold and so sleek and shiny that he looked like a fair smooth little pumpkin he had wide blue eyes full of laughter a neat little vertical nose a neat little horizontal mouth with his few neat little teeth showing very plainly and on the whole rebeccas figure of speech was not so wide of the mark oh emma jane isnt he too lovely to go to the poor farm if only we were married we could keep him and say nothing and nobody would know the difference now that the simpsons have gone away there isnt a single baby in riverboro and only one in edgewood its a perfect shame but i cant do anything you remember aunt miranda wouldnt let me have the simpson baby when i wanted to borrow her just for one rainy sunday my mother wont keep him so its no use to ask her she says most every day shes glad were grown up and she thanks the lord there wasnt but two of us and mrs peter meserve is too nervous rebecca went on taking the village houses in turn and mrs robinson is too neat people dont seem to like any but their own babies observed emma jane well i cant understand it rebecca answered a babys a baby i should think whose ever it is miss dearborn is coming back monday i wonder if shed like it she has nothing to do out of school and we could borrow it all the time i dont think it would seem very genteel for a young lady like miss dearborn who boards round to take a baby from place to place objected emma jane perhaps not agreed rebecca despondently but i think if we havent got any any private babies in riverboro we ought to have one for the town and all have a share in it weve got a town hall and a town lamp post and a town watering trough things are so uneven one house like mine at sunnybrook brimful of children and the very next one empty the only way to fix them right would be to let all the babies that ever are belong to all the grownup people that ever are just divide them up you know if theyd go round oh i have a thought dont you believe aunt sarah cobb would keep him she carries flowers to the graveyard every little while and once she took me with her theres a marble cross and it says sacred to the memory of sarah ellen beloved child of sarah and jeremiah cobb aged months why thats another reason mrs dennett says this one is seventeen months theres five of us left at the farm without me but if we were only nearer to riverboro how quick mother would let in one more we might see what father thinks and that would settle it said emma jane father doesnt think very sudden but he thinks awful strong if we dont bother him and find a place ourselves for the baby perhaps hell be willing hes coming now i hear the wheels lizy ann dennett volunteered to stay and perform the last rites with the undertaker and jackolantern with his slender wardrobe tied in a bandanna handkerchief was lifted into the wagon by the reluctant mr perkins and jubilantly held by rebecca in her lap mr perkins drove off as speedily as possible being heartily sick of the whole affair and thinking wisely that the little girls had already seen and heard more than enough of the seamy side of life that morning discussion concerning jackolanterns future was prudently deferred for a quarter of an hour and then mr perkins was mercilessly pelted with arguments against the choice of the poor farm as a place of residence for a baby his father is sure to come back some time mr perkins urged rebecca he couldnt leave this beautiful thing forever and if emma jane and i can persuade mrs cobb to keep him a little while would you care no on reflection mr perkins did not care he merely wanted a quiet life and enough time left over from the public service to attend to his blacksmiths shop so instead of going home over the same road by which they came he crossed the bridge into edgewood and dropped the children at the long lane which led to the cobb house mrs cobb aunt sarah to the whole village sat by the window looking for uncle jerry who would soon be seen driving the noon stage to the post office over the hill she always had an eye out for rebecca too for ever since the child had been a passenger on mr cobbs stagecoach making the eventful trip from her home farm to the brick house in riverboro in his company she had been a constant visitor and the joy of the quiet household emma jane too was a wellknown figure in the lane but the strange baby was in the nature of a surprise a surprise somewhat modified by the fact that rebecca was a dramatic personage and more liable to appear in conjunction with curious outriders comrades and retainers than the ordinary riverboro child she had run away from the too stern discipline of the brick house on one occasion and had been persuaded to return by uncle jerry she had escorted a wandering organ grinder to their door and begged a lodging for him on a rainy night so on the whole there was nothing amazing about the coming procession the little party toiled up to the hospitable door and mrs cobb came out to meet them rebecca was spokesman emma janes talent did not lie in eloquent speech but it would have been a valiant and a fluent child indeed who could have usurped rebeccas privileges and tendencies in this direction language being her native element and words of assorted sizes springing spontaneously to her lips aunt sarah dear she said plumping jackolantern down on the grass as she pulled his dress over his feet and smoothed his hair becomingly will you please not say a word till i get through as its very important you should know everything before you answer yes or no this is a baby named jacky winslow and i think he looks like a jackolantern his mother has just died over to north riverboro all alone excepting for mrs lizy ann dennett and there was another little weeny baby that died with her and emma jane and i put flowers around them and did the best we could the father thats john winslow quarreled with the mother that was sal perry on the moderation road and ran away and left her so he doesnt know his wife and the weeny baby are dead and the town has got to bury them because they cant find the father right off quick and jacky has got to go to the poor farm this afternoon and it seems an awful shame to take him up to that lonesome place with those old people that cant amuse him and if emma jane and alice robinson and i take most all the care of him we thought perhaps you and uncle jerry would keep him just for a little while youve got a cow and a turnup bedstead you know she hurried on insinuatingly and theres hardly any pleasure as cheap as more babies where theres ever been any before for baby carriages and trundle beds and cradles dont wear out and theres always clothes left over from the old baby to begin the new one on of course we can collect enough things to start jacky so he wont be much trouble or expense and anyway hes past the most troublesome age and you wont have to be up nights with him and he isnt afraid of anybody or anything as you can see by his just sitting there laughing and sucking his thumb though he doesnt know whats going to become of him and hes just seventeen months old like dear little sarah ellen in the graveyard and we thought we ought to give you the refusal of him before he goes to the poor farm and what do you think about it because its near my dinner time and aunt miranda will keep me in the whole afternoon if im late and ive got to finish weeding the hollyhock bed before sundown iv mrs cobb had enjoyed a considerable period of reflection during this monologue and jacky had not used the time unwisely offering several unconscious arguments and suggestions to the matter under discussion lurching over on the greensward and righting himself with a chuckle kicking his bare feet about in delight at the sunshine and groping for his toes with arms too short to reach them the movement involving an entire upsetting of equilibrium followed by more chuckles coming down the last of the stone steps sarah ellens mother regarded the baby with interest and sympathy poor little mite she said that doesnt know what hes lost and whats going to happen to him seems to me we might keep him a spell till were sure his fathers deserted him for good want to come to aunt sarah baby jackolantern turned from rebecca and emma jane and regarded the kind face gravely then he held out both his hands and mrs cobb stooping gathered him like a harvest being lifted into her arms he at once tore her spectacles from her nose and laughed aloud taking them from him gently she put them on again and set him in the cushioned rocking chair under the lilac bushes beside the steps then she took one of his soft hands in hers and patted it and fluttered her fingers like birds before his eyes and snapped them like castanets remembering all the arts she had lavished upon sarah ellen aged seventeen months years and years ago motherless baby and babyless mother bring them together to love one another rebecca knew nothing of this couplet but she saw clearly enough that her case was won the boy must be hungry when was he fed last asked mrs cobb just stay a second longer while i get him some mornings milk then you run home to your dinners and ill speak to mr cobb this afternoon of course we can keep the baby for a week or two till we see what happens land he aint goin to be any more trouble than a wax doll i guess he aint been used to much attention and that kinds always the easiest to take care of at six oclock that evening rebecca and emma jane flew up the hill and down the lane again waving their hands to the dear old couple who were waiting for them in the usual place the back piazza where they had sat so many summers in a blessed companionship never marred by an unloving word wheres jacky called rebecca breathlessly her voice always outrunning her feet go up to my chamber both of you if you want to see smiled mrs cobb only dont wake him up the girls went softly up the stairs into aunt sarahs room there in the turnup bedstead that had been so long empty slept jackolantern in blissful unconsciousness of the doom he had so lately escaped his nightgown and pillow case were clean and fragrant with lavender but they were both as yellow as saffron for they had belonged to sarah ellen i wish his mother could see him whispered emma jane you cant tell its all puzzly about heaven and perhaps she does said rebecca as they turned reluctantly from the fascinating scene and stole down to the piazza it was a beautiful and a happy summer that year and every day it was filled with blissful plays and still more blissful duties on the monday after jackolanterns arrival in edgewood rebecca founded the riverboro aunts association the aunts were rebecca emma jane alice robinson and minnie smellie and each of the first three promised to labor for and amuse the visiting baby for two days a week minnie smellie who lived at some distance from the cobbs making herself responsible for saturday afternoons minnie smellie was not a general favorite among the riverboro girls and it was only in an unprecedented burst of magnanimity that they admitted her into the rites of fellowship rebecca hugging herself secretly at the thought that as minnie gave only the leisure time of one day a week she could not be called a full aunt there had been long and bitter feuds between the two children during rebeccas first summer in riverboro but since mrs smellie had told her daughter that one more quarrel would invite a punishment so terrible that it could only be hinted at vaguely and miss miranda sawyer had remarked that any niece of hers who couldnt get along peaceable with the neighbors had better go back to the seclusion of a farm where there werent any hostilities had been veiled and a suave and diplomatic relationship had replaced the former one which had been wholly primitive direct and barbaric still whenever minnie smellie flaxenhaired pinknosed and ferreteyed indulged in fluent conversation rebecca remembering the old fairy story could always see toads hopping out of her mouth it was really very unpleasant because minnie could never see them herself and what was more amazing emma jane perceived nothing of the sort being almost as blind too to the diamonds that fell continually from rebeccas lips but emma janes strong point was not her imagination a shaky perambulator was found in mrs perkinss wonderful attic shoes and stockings were furnished by mrs robinson miss jane sawyer knitted a blanket and some shirts thirza meserve though too young for an aunt coaxed from her mother some dresses and nightgowns and was presented with a green paper certificate allowing her to wheel jacky up and down the road for an hour under the superintendence of a full aunt each girl under the constitution of the association could call jacky hers for two days in the week and great though friendly was the rivalry between them as they washed ironed and sewed for their adored nephew if mrs cobb had not been the most amiable woman in the world she might have had difficulty in managing the aunts but she always had jacky to herself the earlier part of the day and after dusk at night meanwhile jackolantern grew healthier and heartier and jollier as the weeks slipped away uncle jerry joined the little company of worshipers and slaves and one fear alone stirred in all their hearts not as a sensible and practical person might imagine the fear that the recreant father might never return to claim his child but on the contrary that he might do so october came at length with its cheery days and frosty nights its glory of crimson leaves and its golden harvest of pumpkins and ripened corn rebecca had been down by the edgewood side of the river and had come up across the pastures for a goodnight play with jacky her literary labors had been somewhat interrupted by the joys and responsibilities of vicemotherhood and the thought book was less frequently drawn from its hiding place under the old haymow in the barn chamber mrs cobb stood behind the screen door with her face pressed against the wire netting and rebecca could see that she was wiping her eyes all at once the childs heart gave one prophetic throb and then stood still she was like a harp that vibrated with every wind of emotion whether from anothers grief or her own she looked down the lane around the curve of the stone wall red with woodbine the lane that would meet the stage road to the station there just mounting the crown of the hill and about to disappear on the other side strode a stranger man big and tall with a crop of reddish curly hair showing from under his straw hat a woman walked by his side and perched on his shoulder wearing his most radiant and triumphant mien as joyous in leaving edgewood as he had been during every hour of his sojourn there rode jackolantern rebecca gave a cry in which maternal longing and helpless hopeless jealousy strove for supremacy then with an impetuous movement she started to run after the disappearing trio mrs cobb opened the door hastily calling after her rebecca rebecca come back here you mustnt follow where you havent any right to go if thered been anything to say or do id a done it hes mine hes mine stormed rebecca at least hes yours and mine hes his fathers first of all faltered mrs cobb dont lets forget that and wed ought to be glad and grateful that john winslows come to his senses an remembers hes brought a child into the world and ought to take care of it our loss is his gain and it may make a man of him come in and well put things away all neat before your uncle jerry gets home rebecca sank in a pitiful little heap on mrs cobbs bedroom floor and sobbed her heart out oh aunt sarah where shall we get another jackolantern and how shall i break it to emma jane what if his father doesnt love him and what if he forgets to strain the milk or lets him go without his nap thats the worst of babies that arent private you have to part with them sooner or later sometimes you have to part with your own too said mrs cobb sadly and though there were lines of sadness in her face there was neither rebellion nor repining as she folded up the sides of the turnup bedstead preparatory to banishing it a second time to the attic i shall miss sarah ellen now moren ever still rebecca we mustnt feel to complain its the lord that giveth and the lord that taketh away blessed be the name of the lord second chronicle daughters of zion i abijah flagg was driving over to wareham on an errand for old squire winship whose general choreboy and farmers assistant he had been for some years he passed emma jane perkinss house slowly as he always did she was only a little girl of thirteen and he a boy of fifteen or sixteen but somehow for no particular reason he liked to see the sun shine on her thick braids of reddishbrown hair he admired her chinablue eyes too and her amiable friendly expression he was quite alone in the world and he always thought that if he had anybody belonging to him he would rather have a sister like emma jane perkins than anything else within the power of providence to bestow when she herself suggested this relationship a few years later he cast it aside with scorn having changed his mind in the interval but that story belongs to another time and place emma jane was not to be seen in garden field or at the window and abijah turned his gaze to the large brick house that came next on the other side of the quiet village street it might have been closed for a funeral neither miss miranda nor miss jane sawyer sat at their respective windows knitting nor was rebecca randalls gypsy face to be discerned ordinarily that willothe wispish little person could be seen heard or felt wherever she was the village must be abed i guess mused abijah as he neared the robinsons yellow cottage where all the blinds were closed and no sign of life showed on porch or in shed no t aint neither he thought again as his horse crept cautiously down the hill for from the direction of the robinsons barn chamber there floated out into the air certain burning sentiments set to the tune of antioch the words to a lad brought up in the orthodox faith were quite distinguishable daughter of zion from the dust exalt thy fallen head even the most religious youth is stronger on first lines than others but abijah pulled up his horse and waited till he caught another familiar verse beginning rebuild thy walls thy bounds enlarge and send thy heralds forth thats rebecca carrying the air and i can hear emma janes alto say to the north give up thy charge and hold not back o south and hold not back o south etc land aint they smart seesawin up and down in that part they learnt in singin school i wonder what theyre actin out singin hymntunes up in the barn chamber some o rebeccas doins ill be bound git dap aleck aleck pursued his serene and steady trot up the hills on the edgewood side of the river till at length he approached the green common where the old tory hill meetinghouse stood its white paint and green blinds showing fair and pleasant in the afternoon sun both doors were open and as abijah turned into the wareham road the church melodeon pealed out the opening bars of the missionary hymn and presently a score of voices sent the good old tune from the choirloft out to the dusty road shall we whose souls are lighted with wisdom from on high shall we to men benighted the lamp of life deny land exclaimed abijah under his breath theyre at it up here too that explains it all theres a missionary meeting at the church and the girls want allowed to come so they held one of their own and i bate ye its the liveliest of the two abijah flaggs shrewd yankee guesses were not far from the truth though he was not in possession of all the facts it will be remembered by those who have been in the way of hearing rebeccas experiences in riverboro that the rev and mrs burch returned missionaries from the far east together with some of their children all born under syrian skies as they always explained to interested inquirers spent a day or two at the brick house and gave parlor meetings in native costume these visitors coming straight from foreign lands to the little maine village brought with them a nameless enchantment to the children and especially to rebecca whose imagination always kindled easily the romance of that visit had never died in her heart and among the many careers that dazzled her youthful vision was that of converting such syrian heathen as might continue in idol worship after the burches efforts in their behalf had ceased she thought at the age of eighteen she might be suitably equipped for storming some minor citadel of mohammedanism and mrs burch had encouraged her in the idea not it is to be feared because rebecca showed any surplus of virtue or christian grace but because her gift of language her tact and sympathy and her musical talent seemed to fit her for the work it chanced that the quarterly meeting of the maine missionary society had been appointed just at the time when a letter from mrs burch to miss jane sawyer suggested that rebecca should form a childrens branch in riverboro mrs burchs real idea was that the young people should save their pennies and divert a gentle stream of financial aid into the parent fund thus learning early in life to be useful in such work either at home or abroad the girls themselves however read into her letter no such modest participation in the conversion of the world and wishing to effect an organization without delay they chose an afternoon when every house in the village was vacant and seized upon the robinsons barn chamber as the place of meeting rebecca alice robinson emma jane perkins candace milliken and persis watson each with her hymn book had climbed the ladder leading to the haymow a half hour before abijah flagg had heard the strains of daughters of zion floating out to the road rebecca being an executive person had carried besides her hymn book a silver callbell and pencil and paper an animated discussion regarding one of two names for the society the junior heralds or the daughters of zion had resulted in a unanimous vote for the latter and rebecca had been elected president at an early stage of the meeting she had modestly suggested that alice robinson as the granddaughter of a missionary to china would be much more eligible no said alice with entire good nature whoever is elected president you will be rebecca youre that kind so you might as well have the honor id just as lieves be secretary anyway if you should want me to be treasurer i could be as well as not said persis watson suggestively for you know my father keeps china banks at his store ones that will hold as much as two dollars if you will let them i think hed give us one if i happen to be treasurer the three principal officers were thus elected at one fell swoop and with an entire absence of that red tape which commonly renders organization so tiresome candace milliken suggesting that perhaps shed better be vicepresident as emma jane perkins was always so bashful we ought to have more members she reminded the other girls but if we had invited them the first day theyd have all wanted to be officers especially minnie smellie so its just as well not to ask them till another time is thirza meserve too little to join i cant think why anybody named meserve should have called a baby thirza said rebecca somewhat out of order though the meeting was carried on with small recognition of parliamentary laws it always makes me want to say thirza meserver heaven preserve her thirza meserver do we deserve her shes little but shes sweet and absolutely without guile i think we ought to have her is guile the same as guilt inquired emma jane perkins yes the president answered exactly the same except one is written and the other spoken language rebecca was rather good at imbibing information and a master hand at imparting it written language is for poems and graduations and occasions like this kind of like a best sundaygotomeeting dress that you wouldnt like to go blueberrying in for fear of getting it spotted id just as lieves get guile spotted as not affirmed the unimaginative emma jane i think its an awful foolish word but now were all named and our officers elected what do we do first its easy enough for mary and martha burch they just play at missionarying because their folks work at it same as living and i used to make believe be blacksmiths when we were little it must be nicer missionarying in those foreign places said persis because on africs shores and indias plains and other spots where satan reigns thats fathers favorite hymn theres always a heathen bowing down to wood and stone you can take away his idols if hell let you and give him a bible and the beginnings all made but wholl we begin on jethro small oh hes entirely too dirty and foolish besides exclaimed candace why not ethan hunt he swears dreadfully he lives on nuts and is a hermit and its a mile to his camp through the thick woods my motherll never let me go there objected alice theres uncle tut judson hes too old hes most a hundred and deaf as a post complained emma jane besides his married daughter is a sabbathschool teacher why doesnt she teach him to behave i cant think of anybody just right to start on dont talk like that emma jane and rebeccas tone had a tinge of reproof in it we are a copperated body named the daughters of zion and of course weve got to find something to do foreigners are the easiest theres a scotch family at north riverboro an english one in edgewood and one cuban man at millkins mills havent foreigners got any religion of their own inquired persis curiously yees i spose so kind of a one but foreigners religions are never right ours is the only good one this was from candace the deacons daughter i do think it must be dreadful being born with a religion and growing up with it and then finding out its no use and all your time wasted here rebecca sighed chewed a straw and looked troubled well thats your punishment for being a heathen retorted candace who had been brought up strictly but i cant for the life of me see how you can help being a heathen if youre born in africa persisted persis who was well named you cant rebecca was clear on this point i had that all out with mrs burch when she was visiting aunt miranda she says they cant help being heathen but if theres a single mission station in the whole of africa theyre accountable if they dont go there and get saved are there plenty of stages and railroads asked alice because there must be dreadfully long distances and what if they couldnt pay the fare that part of it is so dreadfully puzzly we mustnt talk about it please said rebecca her sensitive face quivering with the force of the problem poor little soul she did not realize that her superiors in age and intellect had spent many a sleepless night over that same accountability of the heathen its too bad the simpsons have moved away said candace its so seldom you can find a real big wicked family like that to save with only clara belle and susan good in it and numbers count for so much continued alice my grandmother says if missionaries cant convert about so many in a year the board advises them to come back to america and take up some other work i know rebecca corroborated and its the same with revivalists at the centennial picnic at north riverboro a revivalist sat opposite to mr ladd and aunt jane and me and he was telling about his wonderful success in bangor last winter hed converted a hundred and thirty in a month he said or about four and a third a day i had just finished fractions so i asked mr ladd how the third of a man could be converted he laughed and said it was just the other way that the man was a third converted then he explained that if you were trying to convince a person of his sin on a monday and couldnt quite finish by sundown perhaps you wouldnt want to sit up all night with him and perhaps he wouldnt want you to so youd begin again on tuesday and you couldnt say just which day he was converted because it would be two thirds on monday and one third on tuesday mr ladd is always making fun and the board couldnt expect any great things of us girls new beginners suggested emma jane who was being constantly warned against tautology by her teacher i think its awful rude anyway to go right out and try to convert your neighbors but if you borrow a horse and go to edgewood lower corner or millikens mills i spose that makes it foreign missions would we each go alone or wait upon them with a committee as they did when they asked deacon tuttle for a contribution for the new hearse asked persis oh we must go alone decided rebecca it would be much more refined and delicate aunt miranda says that one man alone could never get a subscription from deacon tuttle and thats the reason they sent a committee but it seems to me mrs burch couldnt mean for us to try and convert people when were none of us even church members except candace i think all we can do is to persuade them to go to meeting and sabbath school or give money for the hearse or the new horse sheds now lets all think quietly for a minute or two whos the very most heathenish and reperrehensiblest person in riverboro after a very brief period of silence the words jacob moody fell from all lips with entire accord you are right said the president tersely and after singing hymn number two hundred seventy four to be found on the sixtysixth page we will take up the question of persuading mr moody to attend divine service or the ministers bible class he not having been in the meetinghouse for lo these many years daughter of zion the power that hath saved thee extolled with the harp and the timbrel should be sing without reading if you please omitting the second stanza hymn two seventy four to be found on the sixtysixth page of the new hymn book or on page thirty two of emma jane perkinss old one ii it is doubtful if the rev mr burch had ever found in syria a person more difficult to persuade than the already gospelhardened jacob moody of riverboro tall gaunt swarthy blackbearded his masses of grizzled uncombed hair and the red scar across his nose and cheek added to his sinister appearance his tumbledown house stood on a rocky bit of land back of the sawyer pasture and the acres of his farm stretched out on all sides of it he lived alone ate alone plowed planted sowed harvested alone and was more than willing to die alone unwept unhonored and unsung the road that bordered upon his fields was comparatively little used by any one and notwithstanding the fact that it was thickly set with chokecherry trees and blackberry bushes it had been for years practically deserted by the children jacobs red astrakhan and granny garland trees hung thick with apples but no riverboro or edgewood boy stole them for terrifying accounts of the fate that had overtaken one urchin in times agone had been handed along from boy to boy protecting the moody fruit far better than any police patrol perhaps no circumstances could have extenuated the old mans surly manners or his lack of all citizenly graces and virtues but his neighbors commonly rebuked his present way of living and forgot the troubled past that had brought it about the sharptongued wife the unloving and disloyal sons the daughters hapless fate and all the other sorry tricks that fortune had played upon him at least that was the way in which he had always regarded his disappointments and griefs this then was the personage whose moral rehabilitation was to be accomplished by the daughters of zion but how who will volunteer to visit mr moody blandly asked the president visit mr moody it was a wonder the roof of the barn chamber did not fall it did indeed echo the words and in some way make them sound more grim and satirical nobodyll volunteer rebecca rowena randall and you know it said emma jane why dont we draw lots when none of us wants to speak to him and yet one of us must this suggestion fell from persis watson who had been pale and thoughtful ever since the first mention of jacob moody she was fond of granny garlands she had once met jacob and as to what befell well we all have our secret tragedies wouldnt it be wicked to settle it that way its gamblers that draw lots people did it in the bible ever so often it doesnt seem nice for a missionary meeting these remarks fell all together upon the presidents bewildered ear the while as she always said in compositions the while she was trying to adjust the ethics of this unexpected and difficult dilemma it is a very puzzly question she said thoughtfully i could ask aunt jane if we had time but i suppose we havent it doesnt seem nice to draw lots and yet how can we settle it without we know we mean right and perhaps it will be alice take this paper and tear off five narrow pieces all different lengths at this moment a voice from a distance floated up to the haymow a voice saying plaintively will you let me play with you girls huldah has gone to ride and im all alone it was the voice of the absolutelywithoutguile thirza meserve and it came at an opportune moment if she is going to be a member said persis why not let her come up and hold the lots shed be real honest and not favor anybody it seemed an excellent idea and was followed up so quickly that scarcely three minutes ensued before the guileless one was holding the five scraps in her hot little palm laboriously changing their places again and again until they looked exactly alike and all rather soiled and wilted come girls draw commanded the president thirza you mustnt chew gum at a missionary meeting it isnt polite nor holy take it out and stick it somewhere till the exercises are over the five daughters of zion approached the spot so charged with fate and extended their trembling hands one by one then after a moments silent clutch of their papers they drew nearer to one another and compared them emma jane perkins had drawn the short one becoming thus the destined instrument for jacob moodys conversion to a more seemly manner of life she looked about her despairingly as if to seek some painless and respectable method of selfdestruction do lets draw over again she pleaded im the worst of all of us im sure to make a mess of it till i kind o get trained in rebeccas heart sank at this frank confession which only corroborated her own fears im sorry emmy dear she said but our only excuse for drawing lots at all would be to have it sacred we must think of it as a kind of a sign almost like god speaking to moses in the burning bush oh i wish there was a burning bush right here cried the distracted and recalcitrant missionary how quick id step into it without even stopping to take off my garnet ring dont be such a scarecat emma jane exclaimed candace bracingly jacob moody cant kill you even if he has an awful temper trot right along now before you get more frightened shall we go cross lots with her rebecca and wait at the pasture gate then whatever happens alice can put it down in the minutes of the meeting in these terrible crises of life time gallops with such incredible velocity that it seemed to emma jane only a breath before she was being dragged through the fields by the other daughters of zion the guileless little thirza panting in the rear at the entrance to the pasture rebecca gave her an impassioned embrace and whispering whatever you do be careful how you lead up lifted off the top rail and pushed her through the bars then the girls turned their backs reluctantly on the pathetic figure and each sought a tree under whose friendly shade she could watch and perhaps pray until the missionary should return from her field of labor alice robinson whose compositions were always marked or symbolizing such perfection as could be attained in the mortal world of riverboro alice not only daughter but scribe of zion sharpened her pencil and wrote a few wellchosen words of introduction to be used when the records of the afternoon had been made by emma jane perkins and jacob moody rebeccas heart beat tumultuously under her gingham dress she felt that a drama was being enacted and though unfortunately she was not the central figure she had at least a modest part in it the short lot had not fallen to the properest daughter that she quite realized yet would any one of them succeed in winning jacob moodys attention in engaging him in pleasant conversation and finally in bringing him to a realization of his mistaken way of life she doubted but at the same moment her spirits rose at the thought of the difficulties involved in the undertaking difficulties always spurred rebecca on but they daunted poor emma jane who had no little thrills of excitement and wonder and fear and longing to sustain her lagging soul that her interview was to be entered as minutes by a secretary seemed to her the last straw her blue eyes looked lighter than usual and had the glaze of china saucers her usually pink cheeks were pale but she pressed on determined to be a faithful daughter of zion and above all to be worthy of rebeccas admiration and respect rebecca can do anything she thought with enthusiastic loyalty and i mustnt be any stupider than i can help or shell choose one of the other girls for her most intimate friend so mustering all her courage she turned into jacob moodys dooryard where he was chopping wood its a pleasant afternoon mr moody she said in a polite but hoarse whisper rebeccas words lead up lead up ringing in clarion tones through her brain jacob moody looked at her curiously good enough i guess he growled but i dont never have time to look at afternoons emma jane seated herself timorously on the end of a large log near the chopping block supposing that jacob like other hosts would pause in his tasks and chat the block is kind of like an idol she thought i wish i could take it away from him and then perhaps hed talk at this moment jacob raised his axe and came down on the block with such a stunning blow that emma jane fairly leaped into the air youd better look out sissy or youll git chips in the eye said moody grimly going on with his work the daughter of zion sent up a silent prayer for inspiration but none came and she sat silent giving nervous jumps in spite of herself whenever the axe fell upon the log jacob was cutting finally the host became tired of his dumb visitor and leaning on his axe he said look here sis what have you come for whats your errant do you want apples or cider or what speak out or git out one or tother emma jane who had wrung her handkerchief into a clammy ball gave it a last despairing wrench and faltered wouldnt you like hadnt you better dont you think youd ought to be more constant at meeting and sabbath school jacobs axe almost dropped from his nerveless hand and he regarded the daughter of zion with unspeakable rage and disdain then the blood mounting in his face he gathered himself together and shouted you take yourself off that log and out o this dooryard doublequick you imperdent sanctomus young one you just let me ketch bill perkins child trying to teach me where i shall go at my age scuttle i tell ye and if i see your pious cantin little mug inside my fence agin on sech a business ill chase ye down the hill or set the dog on ye scoot i tell ye emma jane obeyed orders summarily taking herself off the log out the dooryard and otherwise scuttling and scooting down the hill at a pace never contemplated even by jacob moody who stood regarding her flying heels with a sardonic grin down she stumbled the tears coursing over her cheeks and mingling with the dust of her flight blighted hope shame fear rage all tearing her bosom in turn till with a hysterical shriek she fell over the bars and into rebeccas arms outstretched to receive her the other daughters wiped her eyes and supported her almost fainting form while thirza thoroughly frightened burst into sympathetic tears and refused to be comforted no questions were asked for it was felt by all parties that emma janes demeanor was answering them before they could be framed he threatened to set the dog on me she wailed presently when as they neared the sawyer pasture she was able to control her voice he called me a pious cantin young one and said hed chase me out o the dooryard if i ever came again and hell tell my father i know he will for he hates him like poison all at once the adult point of view dawned upon rebecca she never saw it until it was too obvious to be ignored had they done wrong in interviewing jacob moody would aunt miranda be angry as well as mr perkins why was he so dreadful emmy she questioned tenderly what did you say first how did you lead up to it emma jane sobbed more convulsively and wiped her nose and eyes impartially as she tried to think i guess i never led up at all not a mite i didnt know what you meant i was sent on an errant and i went and done it the best i could emma janes grammar always lapsed in moments of excitement and then jake roared at me like squire winships bull and he called my face a mug you shut up that secretary book alice robinson if you write down a single word ill never speak to you again and i dont want to be a member another minute for fear of drawing another short lot ive got enough of the daughters or zion to last me the rest o my life i dont care who goes to meetin and who dont the girls were at the perkinss gate by this time and emma jane went sadly into the empty house to remove all traces of the tragedy from her person before her mother should come home from the church the others wended their way slowly down the street feeling that their promising missionary branch had died almost as soon as it had budded goodby said rebecca swallowing lumps of disappointment and chagrin as she saw the whole inspiring plan break and vanish into thin air like an iridescent bubble its all over and we wont ever try it again im going in to do overcasting as hard as i can because i hate that the worst aunt jane must write to mrs burch that we dont want to be home missionaries perhaps were not big enough anyway im perfectly certain its nicer to convert people when theyre yellow or brown or any color but white and i believe it must be easier to save their souls than it is to make them go to meeting third chronicle rebeccas thought book i the sawyer girls barn still had its haymow in rebeccas time although the hay was a dozen years old or more and in the opinion of the occasional visiting horse sadly juiceless and wanting in flavor it still sheltered too old deacon israel sawyers carryall and mowingmachine with his pung his sleigh and a dozen other survivals of an earlier era when the broad acres of the brick house went to make one of the finest farms in riverboro there were no horses or cows in the stalls nowadays no pig grunting comfortably of future spare ribs in the sty no hens to peck the plants in the cherished garden patch the sawyer girls were getting on in years and mindful that care once killed a cat they ordered their lives with the view of escaping that particular doom at least and succeeded fairly well until rebeccas advent made existence a trifle more sensational once a month for years upon years miss miranda and miss jane had put towels over their heads and made a solemn visit to the barn taking off the enameled cloth coverings occasionally called emmanuel covers in riverboro dusting the ancient implements and sometimes sweeping the heaviest of the cobwebs from the corners or giving a brush to the floor deacon israels tottering ladder still stood in its accustomed place propped against the haymow and the heavenly stairway leading to eternal glory scarcely looked fairer to jacob of old than this to rebecca by means of its dusty rounds she mounted mounted mounted far away from time and care and maiden aunts far away from childish tasks and childish troubles to the barn chamber a place so full of golden dreams happy reveries and vague longings that as her little brown hands clung to the sides of the ladder and her feet trod the rounds cautiously in her ascent her heart almost stopped beating in the sheer joy of anticipation once having gained the heights the next thing was to unlatch the heavy doors and give them a gentle swing outward then oh ever new paradise then oh ever lovely green and growing world for rebecca had that something in her soul that gives to seas and sunset skies the unspent beauty of surprise at the top of guide board hill she could see alice robinsons barn with its shining weather vane a huge burnished fish that swam with the wind and foretold the day to all riverboro the meadow with its sunny slopes stretching up to the pine woods was sometimes a flowing sheet of shimmering grass sometimes when daisies and buttercups were blooming a vision of white and gold sometimes the shorn stubble would be dotted with the happy hills of hay and a little later the rock maple on the edge of the pines would stand out like a golden ball against the green its neighbor the sugar maple glowing beside it brave in scarlet it was on one of these autumn days with a wintry nip in the air that adam ladd rebeccas favorite mr aladdin after searching for her in field and garden suddenly noticed the open doors of the barn chamber and called to her at the sound of his vice she dropped her precious diary and flew to the edge of the haymow he never forgot the vision of the startled little poetess book in one mittened hand pencil in the other dark hair all ruffled with the picturesque addition of an occasional glade of straw her cheeks crimson her eyes shining a sappho in mittens he cried laughingly and at her eager question told her to look up the unknown lady in the school encyclopedia when she was admitted to the female seminary at wareham now all being ready rebecca went to a corner of the haymow and withdrew a thick blankbook with mottled covers out of her gingham apron pocket came a pencil a bit of rubber and some pieces of brown paper then she seated herself gravely on the floor and drew an inverted soapbox nearer to her for a table the book was reverently opened and there was a serious reading of the extracts already carefully copied therein most of them were apparently to the writers liking for dimples of pleasure showed themselves now and then and smiles of obvious delight played about her face but once in a while there was a knitting of the brows and a sigh of discouragement showing that the artist in the child was not wholly satisfied then came the crucial moment when the budding author was supposedly to be racked with the throes of composition but seemingly there were no throes other girls could wield the darning or crochet or knitting needle and send the tatting shuttle through loops of the finest cotton hemstitch oversew braid hair in thirteen strands but the pencil was never obedient in their fingers and the pen and inkpot were a horror from early childhood to the end of time not so with rebecca her pencil moved as easily as her tongue and no more striking simile could possibly be used her handwriting was not spencerian she had neither time nor patience it is to be feared for copybook methods and her unformed characters were frequently the despair of her teachers but write she could write she would write she must and did in season and out from the time she made pothooks at six till now writing was the easiest of all possible tasks to be indulged in as solace and balm when the terrors of examples in least common multiple threatened to dethrone the reason or the rules of grammar loomed huge and unconquerable in the near horizon as to spelling it came to her in the main by free grace and not by training and though she slipped at times from the beaten path her extraordinary ear and good visual memory kept her from many or flagrant mistakes it was her intention especially when saying her prayers at night to look up all doubtful words in her small dictionary before copying her thoughts into the sacred book for the inspiration of posterity but when genius burned with a brilliant flame and particularly when she was in the barn and the dictionary in the house impulse as usual carried the day there sits rebecca then in the open door of the sawyers barn chamber the sunset door how many a time had her grandfather the good deacon sat just underneath in his tippedback chair when mrs israels temper was uncertain and the serenity of the barn was in comforting contrast to his own fireside the open doors swinging out to the peaceful landscape the solace of the pipe not allowed in the settinroom how beautifully these simple agents have ministered to the family peace in days agone if i hadnt had my barn and my store both i couldnt never have lived in holy matrimony with maryliza once said mr watson feelingly but the deacon looking on his waving grass fields his tasseling corn and his timber lands bright and honest as were his eyes never saw such visions as rebecca the child transplanted from her home farm at sunnybrook from the care of the overworked but easygoing mother and the companionship of the scantily fed scantily clothed happygolucky brothers and sisters she had indeed fallen on shady days in riverboro the blinds were closed in every room of the house but two and the same might have been said of miss mirandas mind and heart though miss jane had a few windows opening to the sun and rebecca already had her unconscious hand on several others brickhouse rules were rigid and many for a little creature so full of life but rebeccas gay spirit could not be pinioned in a strait jacket for long at a time it escaped somehow and winged its merry way into the sunshine and free air if she were not allowed to sing in the orchard like the wild bird she was she could still sing in the cage like the canary ii if you had opened the carefully guarded volume with the mottled covers you would first have seen a wonderful title page constructed apparently on the same lines as an obituary or the inscription on a tombstone save for the quantity and variety of information contained in it much of the matter would seem to the captious critic better adapted to the body of the book than to the title page but rebecca was apparently anxious that the principal personages in her chronicle should be well described at the outset she seems to have had a conviction that heredity plays its part in the evolution of genius and her belief that the world will be inspired by the possession of her thoughts is too artless to be offensive she evidently has respect for rich material confided to her teacher and one can imagine miss dearborns woe had she been confronted by rebeccas chosen literary executor and bidden to deliver certain valuable poetry and thoughts the property of posterity unless carelessly destroyed thought book of rebecca rowena randall really of sunnybrook farm but temporily of the brick house riverboro own niece of miss miranda and jane sawyer second of seven children of her father mr l d m randall now at rest in temperance cemmetary and there will be a monument as soon as we pay off the mortgage on the farm also of her mother mrs aurelia randall in case of death the best of these thoughts may be printed in my remerniscences for the sunday school library at temperance maine which needs more books fearfully and i hereby will and testament them to mr adam ladd who bought cakes of soap from me and thus secured a premium a greatly needed banquet lamp for my friends the simpsons he is the only one that incourages my writing remerniscences and my teacher miss dearborn will have much valuable poetry and thoughts to give him unless carelessly destroyed the pictures are by the same hand that wrote the thoughts it is not now decided whether rebecca rowena randall will be a painter or an author but after her death it will be known which she has been if any finis from the title page with its wealth of detail and its unnecessary and irrelevant information the book ripples on like a brook and to the weary reader of problem novels it may have something of the brooks refreshing quality our diaries may all the girls are keeping a diary because miss dearborn was very much ashamed when the school trustees told her that most of the girls and all of the boys compositions were disgraceful and must be improved upon next term she asked the boys to write letters to her once a week instead of keeping a diary which they thought was girlish like playing with dolls the boys thought it was dreadful to have to write letters every seven days but she told them it was not half as bad for them as it was for her who had to read them to make my diary a little different i am going to call it a thought book written just like that with capitals i have thoughts that i never can use unless i write them down for aunt miranda always says keep your thoughts to yourself aunt jane lets me tell her some but does not like my queer ones and my true thoughts are mostly queer emma jane does not mind hearing them now and then and that is my only chance if miss dearborn does not like the name thought book i will call it remerniscences written just like that with a capital r remerniscences are things you remember about yourself and write down in case you should die aunt jane doesnt like to read any other kind of books but just lives of interesting dead people and she says that is what longfellow who was born in the state of maine and we should be very proud of it and try to write like him meant in his poem lives of great men all remind us we should make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time i know what this means because when emma jane and i went to the beach with uncle jerry cobb we ran along the wet sand and looked at the shapes our boots made just as if they were stamped in wax emma jane turns in her left foot splayfoot the boys call it which is not polite and seth strout had just patched one of my shoes and it all came out in the sand pictures when i learned the psalm of life for friday afternoon speaking i thought i shouldnt like to leave a patched footprint nor have emma janes look crooked on the sands of time and right away i thought oh what a splendid thought for my thought book when aunt jane buys me a fifteencent one over to watsons store remerniscences june i told aunt jane i was going to begin my remerniscences and she says i am full young but i reminded her that candace millikens sister died when she was ten leaving no footprints whatever and if i should die suddenly who would write down my remerniscences aunt miranda says the sun and moon would rise and set just the same and it was no matter if they didnt get written down and to go up attic and find her piecebag but i said it would as there was only one of everybody in the world and nobody else could do their remerniscensing for them if i should die tonight i know now who would describe me right miss dearborn would say one thing and brother john another emma jane would try to do me justice but has no words and i am glad aunt miranda never takes the pen in hand my dictionary is so small it has not many genteel words in it and i cannot find how to spell remerniscences but i remember from the cover of aunt janes book that there was an s and a c close together in the middle of it which i thought foolish and not needful all the girls like their dairies very much but minnie smellie got alice robinsons where she had hid it under the school wood pile and read it all through she said it was no worse than reading anybodys composition but we told her it was just like peeking through a keyhole or listening at a window or opening a bureau drawer she said she didnt look at it that way and i told her that unless her eyes got unscealed she would never leave any kind of a sublime footprint on the sands of time i told her a diary was very sacred as you generally poured your deepest feelings into it expecting nobody to look at it but yourself and your indulgent heavenly father who seeeth all things of course it would not hurt persis watson to show her diary because she has not a sacred plan and this is the way it goes for she reads it out loud to us arose at six this morning you always arise in a diary but you say get up when you talk about it ate breakfast at half past six had soda biscuits coffee fish hash and doughnuts wiped the dishes fed the hens and made my bed before school had a good arithmetic lesson but went down two in spelling at half past four played hide and coop in the sawyer pasture fed hens and went to bed at eight she says she cant put in what doesnt happen but as i dont think her diary is interesting she will ask her mother to have meat hash instead of fish with pie when the doughnuts give out and she will feed the hens before breakfast to make a change we are all going now to try and make something happen every single day so the diaries wont be so dull and the footprints so common an uncommon thought july we dug up our rosecakes today and that gave me a good remerniscence the way you make rose cakes is you take the leaves of full blown roses and mix them with a little cinnamon and as much brown sugar as they will give you which is never half enough except persis watson whose affectionate parents let her go to the barrel in their store then you do up little bits like sedlitz powders first in soft paper and then in brown and bury them in the ground and let them stay as long as you possibly can hold out then dig them up and eat them emma jane and i stick up little signs over the holes in the ground with the date we buried them and when theyll be done enough to dig up but we can never wait when aunt jane saw us she said it was the first thing for children to learn not to be impatient so when i went to the barn chamber i made a poem impatience we dug our rose cakes up oh all too soon twas in the orchard just at noon twas in a bright july forenoon twas in the sunny afternoon twas underneath the harvest moon it was not that way at all it was a foggy morning before school and i should think poets could never possibly get to heaven for it is so hard to stick to the truth when you are writing poetry emma jane thinks it is nobodys business when we dug the rosecakes up i like the line about the harvest moon best but it would give a wrong idea of our lives and characters to the people that read my thoughts for they would think we were up late nights so i have fixed it like this impatience we dug our rose cakes up oh all too soon we thought their sweetness would be such a boon we neer suspicioned they would not be done after three days of autumn wind and sun why did we from the earth our treasures draw twas not for fear that rat or mole might naw an aged aunt doth say impatience was the reason she says that youth is ever out of season that is just as aunt jane said it and it gave me the thought for the poem which is rather uncommon a dreadful question september which has been the most benefercent influence on character punishment or reward this truly dreadful question was given us by dr moses when he visited school today he is a school committee not a whole one but i do not know the singular number of him he told us we could ask our families what they thought though he would rather we wouldnt but we must write our own words and he would hear them next week after he went out and shut the door the scholars were all plunged in gloom and you could have heard a pin drop alice robinson cried and borrowed my handkerchief and the boys looked as if the schoolhouse had been struck by lightning the worst of all was poor miss dearborn who will lose her place if she does not make us better scholars soon for dr moses has a daughter all ready to put right in to the school and she can board at home and save all her wages libby moses is her name miss dearborn stared out the window and her mouth and chin shook like alice robinsons for she knew ah all to well what the coming week would bring forth then i raised my hand for permission to speak and stood up and said miss dearborn dont you mind just explain to us what benefercent means and well write something real interesting for all of us know what punishment is and have seen others get rewards and it is not so bad a subject as some and dick carter whispered good on your head rebecca which mean he was sorry for her too and would try his best but has no words then teacher smiled and said benefercent meant good or healthy for anybody and would all rise who thought punishment made the best scholars and men and women and everybody sat stock still and then she asked all to stand who believed that rewards produced the finest results and there was a mighty sound like unto the rushing of waters but really was our feet scraping the floor and the scholars stood up and it looked like an army though it was only nineteen because of the strong belief that was in them then miss dearborn laughed and said she was thankful for every whipping she had when she was a child and living perkins said perhaps we hadnt got to the thankful age or perhaps her father hadnt used a strap and she said oh no it was her mother with the open hand and dick carter said he wouldnt call that punishment and sam simpson said so too i am going to write about the subject in my thought book first and when i make it into a composition i can leave out anything about the family or not genteel as there is much to relate about punishment not pleasant or nice and hardly polite punishment punishment is a very puzzly thing but i believe in it when really deserved only when i punish myself it does not always turn out well when i leaned over the new bridge and got my dress all paint and aunt sarah cobb couldnt get it out i had to wear it spotted for six months which hurt my pride but was right i stayed at home from alice robinsons birthday party for a punishment and went to the circus next day instead but alices parties are very cold and stiff as mrs robinson makes the boys stand on newspapers if they come inside the door and the blinds are always shut and mrs robinson tells me how bad her liver complaint is this year so i thought to pay for the circus and a few other things i ought to get more punishment and i threw my pink parasol down the well as the mothers in the missionary books throw their infants to the crocodiles in the ganges river but it got stuck in the chain that holds the bucket and aunt miranda had to get abijah flagg to take out all the broken bits before we could ring up water i punished myself this way because aunt miranda said that unless i improved i would be nothing but a burden and a blight there was an old man used to go by our farm carrying a lot of broken chairs to bottom and mother used to say poor man his back is too weak for such a burden and i used to take him out a doughnut and this is the part i want to go into the remerniscences once i told him we were sorry the chairs were so heavy and he said they didnt seem so heavy when he had et the doughnut this does not mean that the doughnut was heavier than the chairs which is what brother john said but it is a beautiful thought and shows how the human race should have sympathy and help bear burdens i know about a blight for there was a dreadful east wind over at our farm that destroyed all the little young crops just out of the ground and the farmers called it the blight and i would rather be hail sleet frost or snow than a blight which is mean and secret and which is the reason i threw away the dearest thing on earth to me the pink parasol that miss ross brought me from paris france i have also wrapped up my bead purse in three papers and put it away marked not to be opened till after my death unless needed for a party i must not be burden i must not be blight the angels in heaven would weep at the sight rewards a good way to find out which has the most benefercent effect would be to try rewards on myself this next week and write my composition the very last day when i see how my character is it is hard to find rewards for yourself but perhaps aunt jane and some of the girls would each give me one to help out i could carry my bead purse to school every day or wear my coral chain a little while before i go to sleep at night i could read cora or the sorrows of a doctors wife a little oftener but thats all the rewards i can think of i fear aunt miranda would say they are wicked but oh if they should turn out benefercent how glad and joyful life would be to me a sweet and beautiful character beloved by my teacher and schoolmates admired and petted by my aunts and neighbors yet carrying my bead purse constantly with perhaps my best hat on wednesday afternoons as well as sundays a great shock the reason why alice robinson could not play was she was being punished for breaking her mothers blue platter just before supper my story being finished i went up guide board hill to see how she was bearing up and she spoke to me from her window she said she did not mind being punished because she hadnt been for a long time and she hoped it would help her with her composition she thought it would give her thoughts and tomorrows the last day for her to have any this gave me a good idea and i told her to call her father up and beg him to beat her violently it would hurt i said but perhaps none of the other girls would have a punishment like that and her composition would be all different and splendid i would borrow aunt mirandas witchhayzel and pour it on her wounds like the samaritan in the bible i went up again after supper with dick carter to see how it turned out alice came to the window and dick threw up a note tied to a stick i had written demand your punishment to the full be brave like dolores mother in the martyrs of spain she threw down an answer and it was you just be like dolores mother yourself if youre so smart then she stamped away from the window and my feelings were hurt but dick said perhaps she was hungry and that made her cross and as dick and i turned to go out of the yard we looked back and i saw something i can never forget the great shock mrs robinson was out behind the barn feeding the turkies mr robinson came softly out of the side door in the orchard and looking everywheres around he stepped to the wire closet and took out a saucer of cold beans with a pickled beet on top and a big piece of blueberry pie then he crept up the back stairs and we could see alice open her door and take in the supper oh what will become of her composition and how can she tell anything of the benefercent effects of punishment when she is locked up by one parent and fed by the other i have forgiven her for the way she snapped me up for of course you couldnt beg your father to beat you when he was bringing you blueberry pie mrs robinson makes a kind that leaks out a thick purple juice into the plate and needs a spoon and blacks your mouth but is heavenly a dream the week is almost up and very soon dr moses will drive up to the school house like elijah in the chariot and come in to hear us read there is a good deal of sickness among us some of the boys are not able to come to school just now but hope to be about again by monday when dr moses goes away to a convention it is a very hard composition to write somehow last night i dreamed that the river was ink and i kept dipping into it and writing with a penstalk made of a young pine tree i sliced great slabs of marble off the side of one of the white mountains the one you see when going to meeting and wrote on those then i threw them all into the falls not being good enough for dr moses dick carter had a splendid boy to stay over sunday he makes the real newspaper named the pilot published by the boys at wareham academy he says when he talks about himself in writing he calls himself we and it sounds much more like print besides conscealing him more example our hair was measured this morning and has grown two inches since last time we have a loose tooth that troubles us very much our inkspot that we made by negligence on our only white petticoat we have been able to remove with lemon and milk some of our petticoat came out with the spot i shall try it in my composition sometime for of course i shall write for the pilot when i go to wareham seminary uncle jerry cobb says that i shall and thinks that in four years i might rise to be editor if they ever have girls i have never been more good than since i have been rewarding myself steady even to asking aunt miranda kindly to offer me a company jelly tart not because i was hungry but for an experement i was trying and would explain to her sometime she said she never thought it was wise to experement with your stomach and i said with a queer thrilling look it was not my stomach but my soul that was being tried then she gave me the tart and walked away all puzzled and nervous the new minister has asked me to come and see him any saturday afternoon as he writes poetry himself but i would rather not ask him about this composition ministers never believe in rewards and it is useless to hope that they will we had the wrath of god four times in sermons this last summer but god cannot be angry all the time nobody could especially in summer mr baxter is different and calls his wife dear which is lovely and the first time i ever heard it in riverboro mrs baxter is another kind of people too from those that live in temperance i like to watch her in meeting and see her listen to her husband who is young and handsome for a minister it gives me very queer and uncommon feelings when they look at each other which they always do when not otherwise engaged she has different clothes from anybody else aunt miranda says you must think only of two things will your dress keep you warm and will it wear well and there is nobody in the world to know how i love pink and red and how i hate drab and green and how i never wear my hat with the black and yellow porkupine quills without wishing it would blow into the river wheneer i take my walks abroad how many quills i see but as they are not porkupines they never come to me composition which has the most benefercent effect on the character punishment or reward by rebecca rowena randall this copy not corrected by miss dearborn yet we find ourselves very puzzled in approaching this truly great and national question though we have tried very ernestly to understand it so as to show how wisely and wonderfully our dear teacher guides the youthful mind it being her wish that our composition class shall long be remembered in riverboro centre we would say first of all that punishment seems more benefercently needed by boys than girls boys sins are very violent like stealing fruit profane language playing truant fighting breaking windows and killing innocent little flies and bugs if these were not taken out of them early in life it would be impossible for them to become like our martyred president abraham lincoln although we have asked everybody on our street they think boys sins can only be whipped out of them with a switch or strap which makes us feel very sad as boys when not sinning the dreadful sins mentioned above seem just as good as girls and never cry when switched and say it does not hurt much we now approach girls which we know better being one girls seem better than boys because their sins are not so noisy and showy they can disobey their parents and aunts whisper in silent hour cheat in lessons say angry things to their schoolmates tell lies be sulky and lazy but all these can be conducted quite ladylike and genteel and nobody wants to strap girls because their skins are tender and get black and blue very easily punishments make one very unhappy and rewards very happy and one would think when one is happy one would behave the best we were acquainted with a girl who gave herself rewards every day for a week and it seemed to make her as lovely a character as one could wish but perhaps if one went on for years giving rewards to onesself one would become selfish one cannot tell one can only fear if a dog kills a sheep we should whip him straight away and on the very spot where he can see the sheep or he will not know what we mean and may forget and kill another the same is true of the human race we must be firm and patient in punishing no matter how much we love the one who has done wrong and how hungry she is it does no good to whip a person with one hand and offer her a pickled beet with the other this confuses her mind and she may grow up not knowing right from wrong the striking example of the pickled beet was removed from the essay by the refined but ruthless miss dearborn who strove patiently but vainly to keep such vulgar images out of her pupils literary efforts we now respectfully approach the holy bible and the people in the bible were punished the whole time and that would seem to make it right everybody says whom the lord loveth he chasteneth but we think ourself that the lord is a better punisher than we are and knows better how and when to do it having attended to it ever since the year bc while the human race could not know about it till ad which is when columbus discovered america we do not believe we can find out all about this truly great and national subject till we get to heaven where the human race strapped and unstrapped if any can meet together and laying down their harps discuss how they got there and we would gently advise boys to be more quiet and genteel in conduct and try rewards to see how they would work rewards are not all like the little rosebud merit cards we receive on fridays and which boys sometimes tear up and fling scornfully to the breeze when they get outside but girls preserve carefully in an envelope some rewards are great and glorious for boys can get to be governor or school trustee or road commissioner or president while girls can only be wife and mother but all of us can have the ornament of a meek and lowly spirit especially girls who have more use for it than boys rrr stories and people october there are people in books and people in riverboro and they are not the same kind they never talk of chargers and palfreys in the village nor say how oft and methinks and if a scotchman out of rob roy should come to riverboro and want to marry one of us girls we could not understand him unless he made motions though huldah meserve says if a nobleman of high degree should ask her to be his one of vast estates with serfs at his bidding she would be able to guess his meaning in any language uncle jerry cobb thinks that riverboro people would not make a story but i know that some of them would jackolantern though only a baby was just like a real story if anybody had written a piece about him how his mother was dead and his father ran away and emma jane and i got aunt sarah cobb to keep him so mr perkins wouldnt take him to the poor farm and about our lovely times with him that summer and our dreadful loss when his father remembered him in the fall and came to take him away and how aunt sarah carried the trundle bed up attic again and emma jane and i heard her crying and stole away mrs peter meserve says grandpa sawyer was a wonderful hand at stories before his spirit was broken by grandmother she says he was the life of the store and tavern when he was a young man though generally sober and she thinks i take after him because i like compositions better than all the other lessons but mother says i take after father who always could say everything nicely whether he had anything to say or not so methinks i should be grateful to both of them they are what is called ancestors and much depends upon whether you have them or not the simpsons have not any at all aunt miranda says the reason everybody is so prosperous around here is because their ancestors were all first settlers and raised on burnt ground this should make us very proud methinks and methought are splendid words for compositions miss dearborn likes them very much but alice and i never bring them in to suit her methought means the same as i thought but sounds better example if you are telling a dream you had about your aged aunt methought i heard her say my child you have so useful been you need not sew today this is a good example one way but too unlikely woe is me this afternoon i was walking over to the store to buy molasses and as i came off the bridge and turned up the hill i saw lots and lots of heelprints in the side of the road heelprints with little spike holes in them oh the river drivers have come from up country i thought and theyll be breaking the jam at our falls tomorrow i looked everywhere about and not a man did i see but still i knew i was not mistaken for the heelprints could not lie all the way over and back i thought about it though unfortunately forgetting the molasses and alice robinson not being able to come out i took playtime to write a story it is the first grownup one i ever did and is intended to be like cora the doctors wife not like a school composition it is written for mr adam ladd and people like him who live in boston and is the printed kind you get money for to pay off a mortgage lancelot or the parted lovers a beautiful village maiden was betrothed to a stallwart river driver but they had high and bitter words and parted he to weep into the crystal stream as he drove his logs and she to sigh and moan as she went about her round of household tasks at eventide the maiden was wont to lean over the bridge and her tears also fell into the foaming stream so though the two unhappy lovers did not know it the river was their friend the only one to whom they told their secrets and wept into the months crept on and it was the next july when the maiden was passing over the bridge and up the hill suddenly she spied footprints on the sands of time the river drivers have come again she cried putting her hand to her side for she had a slight heart trouble like cora and mrs peter meserve that doesnt kill they have come indeed especially one you know said a voice and out from the alder bushes sprung lancelot littlefield for that was the lovers name and it was none other than he his hair was curly and like living gold his shirt white of flannel was new and dry and of a handsome color and as the maiden looked at him she could think of nought but a fairy prince forgive she mermered stretching out her waisted hands nay sweet he replied tis i should say that to you and bending gracefully on one knee he kissed the hem of her dress it was a rich pink gingham check ellaborately ornamented with white tape trimming clasping each other to the heart like cora and the doctor they stood there for a long while till they heard the rumble of wheels on the bridge and knew they must disentangle the wheels came nearer and verily it was the maidens father can i wed with your fair daughter this very moon asked lancelot who will not be called his whole name again in this story you may said the father for lo she has been ready and waiting for many months this he said not noting how he was shaming the maiden whose name was linda rowenetta then and there the nuptial day was appointed and when it came the marriage knot was tied upon the river bank where first they met the river bank where they had parted in anger and where they had again scealeld their vows and clasped each other to the heart and it was very low water that summer and the river always thought it was because no tears dropped into it but so many smiles that like sunshine they dried it up rrr finis careers november long ago when i used to watch miss ross painting the old mill at sunnybrook i thought i would be a painter for miss ross went to paris france where she bought my bead purse and pink parasol and i thought i would like to see a street with beautiful brightcolored things sparkling and hanging in the store windows then when the missionaries from syria came to stay at the brick house mrs burch said that after i had experienced religion i must learn music and train my voice and go out to heathen lands and save souls so i thought that would be my career but we girls tried to have a branch and be home missionaries and it did not work well emma janes father would not let her have her birthday party when he found out what she had done and aunt jane sent me up to jake moodys to tell him we did not mean to be rude when we asked him to go to meeting more often he said all right but just let him catch that little doughfaced perkins young one in his yard once more and shed have reason to remember the call which was just as rude and impolite as our trying to lead him to a purer and a better life then uncle jerry and mr aladdin and miss dearborn liked my compositions and i thought id better be a writer for i must be something the minute im seventeen or how shall we ever get the mortgage off the farm but even that hope is taken away from me now for uncle jerry made fun of my story lancelot or the parted lovers and i have decided to be a teacher like miss dearborn the pathetic announcement of a change in the career and life purposes of rebecca was brought about by her reading the grownup story to mr and mrs jeremiah cobb after supper in the orchard uncle jerry was the person who had maintained all along that riverboro people would not make a story and lancelot or the parted lovers was intended to refute that assertion at once and forever an assertion which rebecca regarded quite truly as untenable though why she certainly never could have explained unfortunately lancelot was a poor missionary quite unfitted for the high achievements to which he was destined by the youthful novelist and uncle jerry though a stagedriver and no reading man at once perceived the flabbiness and transparency of the parted lovers the moment they were held up to his inspection you see riverboro people will make a story asserted rebecca triumphantly as she finished her reading and folded the paper and it all came from my noticing the river drivers tracks by the roadside and wondering about them and wondering always makes stories the minister says so yees allowed uncle jerry reflectively tipping his chair back against the apple tree and forcing his slow mind to violent and instantaneous action for rebecca was his pride and joy a person in his opinion of superhuman talent one therefore to be whittled into shape if occasion demanded its a riverboro story sure enough because youve got the river and the bridge and the hill and the drivers all right there in it but theres something awful queer bout it the folks dont act riverboro and dont talk riverboro cordin to my notions i call it a reglar book story but objected rebecca the people in cinderella didnt act like us and you thought that was a beautiful story when i told it to you i know replied uncle jerry gaining eloquence in the heat of argument they didnt act like us but t any rate they acted like emselves somehow they was all of a piece cinderella was a little too good mebbe and the sisters was most too thunderin bad to live on the face o the earth and that fayry old lady that kep the punkin coach up her sleeve well anyhow you jest believe that punkin coach rats mice and all when youre hearin bout it fore ever you stop to think it aint so i don know how tis but the folks in that cinderella story seem to match together somehow theyre all powful onlikely the prince feller with the glass slipper and the hull bunch but jest the same you kind o gulp em all down in a lump but land rebecky nobodyd swaller that there village maiden o yourn and as for whatshisname littlefield that come out o them bushes such a feller never d a ben in bushes no rebecky youre the smartest little critter there is in this township and you beat your uncle jerry all holler when it comes to usin a lead pencil but i say that aint no true riverboro story look at the way they talk what was that bout being betrothed betrothed is a genteel word for engaged to be married explained the crushed and chastened author and it was fortunate the doting old man did not notice her eyes in the twilight or he might have known that tears were not far away well thats all right then im as ignorant as coopers cow when it comes to the dictionary how about whatshisname callin the girl naysweet i thought myself that sounded foolish confessed rebecca but its what the doctor calls cora when he tries to persuade her not to quarrel with his mother who comes to live with them i know they dont say it in riverboro or temperance but i thought perhaps it was boston talk well it aint asserted mr cobb decisively ive druv boston men up in the stage from milltown manys the time and none of em ever said naysweet to me nor nothinlike it they talked like folks every mothers son of em if id a had that whatshisname on the harricane deck o the stage and he tried any naysweetin on me id a pitched him into the cornfield side o the road i guess you aint growed up enough for that kind of a story rebecky for your poetry cant be beat in york county thats sure and your compositions are good enough to read out loud in town meetin any day rebecca brightened up a little and bade the old couple her usual affectionate good night but she descended the hill in a saddened mood when she reached the bridge the sun a ball of red fire was setting behind squire beans woods as she looked it shone full on the broad still bosom of the river and for one perfect instant the trees on the shores were reflected all swimming in a sea of pink leaning over the rail she watched the light fade from crimson to carmine from carmine to rose from rose to amber and from amber to gray then withdrawing lancelot or the parted lovers from her apron pocket she tore the pages into bits and dropped them into the water below with a sigh uncle jerry never said a word about the ending she thought and that was so nice and she was right but while uncle jerry was an illuminating critic when it came to the actions and language of his riverboro neighbors he had no power to direct the young mariner when she followed the gleam and used her imagination our secret society november our secret society has just had a splendid picnic in candace millikens barn our name is the boss and not a single boy in the village has been able to guess it it means braid over shoulder society and that is the sign all the members wear one of their braids over the right shoulder in front the presidents tied with red ribbon i am the president and all the rest tied with blue to attract the attention of another member when in company or at a public place we take the braid between the thumb and little finger and stand carelessly on one leg this is the secret signal and the password is sobb boss spelled backwards which was my idea and is thought rather uncommon one of the rules of the boss is that any member may be required to tell her besetting sin at any meeting if asked to do so by a majority of the members this was candace millikens idea and much opposed by everybody but when it came to a vote so many of the girls were afraid of offending candace that they agreed because there was nobody elses father and mother who would let us picnic in their barn and use their plow harrow grindstone sleigh carryall pung sled and wheelbarrow which we did and injured hardly anything they asked me to tell my besetting sin at the very first meeting and it nearly killed me to do it because it is such a common greedy one it is that i cant bear to call the other girls when i have found a thick spot when we are out berrying in the summer time after i confessed which made me dreadfully ashamed every one of the girls seemed surprised and said they had never noticed that one but had each thought of something very different that i would be sure to think was my besetting sin then emma jane said that rather than tell hers she would resign from the society and miss the picnic so it made so much trouble that candace gave up we struck out the rule from the constitution and i had told my sin for nothing the reason we named ourselves the boss is that minnie smellie has had her head shaved after scarlet fever and has no braid so she cant be a member i dont want her for a member but i cant be happy thinking she will feel slighted and it takes away half the pleasure of belonging to the society myself and being president that i think is the principal trouble about doing mean and unkind things that you cant do wrong and feel right or be bad and feel good if you only could you could do anything that came into your mind yet always be happy minnie smellie spoils everything she comes into but i suppose we other girls must either have our hair shaved and call ourselves the baldheadians or let her be some kind of a special officer in the boss she might be the bitud member braid in the upper drawer for there is where mrs smellie keeps it now that it is cut off winter thoughts march it is not such a cold day for march and i am up in the barn chamber with my coat and hood on and aunt janes waterproof and my mittens after i do three pages i am going to hide away this book in the haymow till spring perhaps they get made into icicles on the way but i do not seem to have any thoughts in the winter time the barn chamber is full of thoughts in warm weather the sky gives them to me and the trees and flowers and the birds and the river but now it is always gray and nipping the branches are bare and the river is frozen it is too cold to write in my bedroom but while we still kept an open fire i had a few thoughts but now there is an airtight stove in the dining room where we sit and we seem so close together aunt miranda aunt jane and i that i dont like to write in my book for fear they will ask me to read out loud my secret thoughts i have just read over the first part of my thought book and i have outgrown it all just exactly as i have outgrown my last years drab cashmere it is very queer how anybody can change so fast in a few months but i remember that emma janes cat had kittens the day my book was bought at watsons store mrs perkins kept the prettiest white one abijah flagg drowning all the others it seems strange to me that cats will go on having kittens when they know what becomes of them we were very sad about it but mrs perkins said it was the way of the world and how things had to be i cannot help being glad that they do not do the same with children or john and jenny mira mark and me would all have had stones tied to our necks and been dropped into the deepest part of sunny brook for hannah and fanny are the only truly handsome ones in the family mrs perkins says i dress up well but never being dressed up it does not matter much at least they didnt wait to dress up the kittens to see how they would improve before drowning them but decided right away emma janes kitten that was born the same day this book was is now quite an old cat who knows the way of the world herself and how things have to be for she has had one batch of kittens drowned already so perhaps it is not strange that my thought book seems so babyish and foolish to me when i think of all i have gone through and the millions of things i have learned and how much better i spell than i did ten months ago my fingers are cold through the mittens so goodbye dear thought book friend of my childhood now so far far behind me i will hide you in the haymow where youll be warm and cosy all the long winter and where nobody can find you again in the summer time but your affectionate author rebecca rowena randall fourth chronicle a tragedy in millinery i emma jane perkinss new winter dress was a blue and green scotch plaid poplin trimmed with narrow green velvetribbon and steel nailheads she had a gray jacket of thick furry cloth with large steel buttons up the front a pair of green kid gloves and a gray felt hat with an encircling band of bright green feathers the band began in front with a birds head and ended behind with a birds tail and angels could have desired no more beautiful toilette that was her opinion and it was shared to the full by rebecca but emma jane as rebecca had once described her to mr adam ladd was a rich blacksmiths daughter and she rebecca was a little halforphan from a mortgaged farm up temperance way dependent upon her spinster aunts for board clothes and schooling scotch plaid poplins were manifestly not for her but darkcolored woolen stuffs were and mittens and last winters coats and furs and how about hats was there hope in store for her there she wondered as she walked home from the perkins house full of admiration for emma janes winter outfit and loyally trying to keep that admiration free from wicked envy her redwinged black hat was her second best and although it was shabby she still liked it but it would never do for church even in aunt mirandas strange and nevertobecomprehended views of suitable raiment there was a brown felt turban in existence if one could call it existence when it had been rained on snowed on and hailed on for two seasons but the trimmings had at any rate perished quite off the face of the earth that was one comfort emma jane had said rather indiscreetly that at the village milliners at millikens mills there was a perfectly elegant pink breast to be had a breast that began in a perfectly elegant solferino and terminated in a perfectly elegant magenta two colors much in vogue at that time if the old brown hat was to be her portion yet another winter would aunt miranda conceal its deficiencies from a carping world beneath the shaded solferino breast would she that was the question filled with these perplexing thoughts rebecca entered the brick house hung up her hood in the entry and went into the diningroom miss jane was not there but aunt miranda sat by the window with her lap full of sewing things and a chair piled with pasteboard boxes by her side in one hand was the ancient battered brown felt turban and in the other were the orange and black porcupine quills from rebeccas last summers hat from the hat of the summer before that and the summer before that and so on back to prehistoric ages of which her childish memory kept no specific record though she was sure that temperance and riverboro society did truly a sight to chill the blood of any eager young dreamer who had been looking at gayer plumage miss sawyer glanced up for a second with a satisfied expression and then bent her eyes again upon her work if i was going to buy a hat trimming she said i couldnt select anything better or more economical than these quills your mother had them when she was married and you wore them the day you come to the brick house from the farm and i said to myself then that they looked kind of outlandish but ive grown to like em now ive got used to em youve been here for goin on two years and theyve hardly ben out owear summer or winter moren a month to a time i declare they do beat all for service it dont seem as if your mother could a chose em aurelia was always such a poor buyer the black spills are bout as good as new but the orange ones are gittin a little mite faded and shabby i wonder if i couldnt dip all of em in shoe blackin it seems real queer to put a porcupine into hat trimmin though i declare i dont know jest what the animiles are like its ben so long sence i looked at the pictures of em in a geography i always thought their quills stood out straight and angry but these kind o curls round some at the ends and that makes em stand the wind better how do you like em on the brown felt she asked inclining her head in a discriminating attitude and poising them awkwardly on the hat with her workstained hand how did she like them on the brown felt indeed miss sawyer had not been looking at rebecca but the childs eyes were flashing her bosom heaving and her cheeks glowing with sudden rage and despair all at once something happened she forgot that she was speaking to an older person forgot that she was dependent forgot everything but her disappointment at losing the solferino breast remembering nothing but the enchanting dazzling beauty of emma jane perkinss winter outfit and suddenly quite without warning she burst into a torrent of protest i will not wear those hateful porcupine quills again this winter i will not its wicked wicked to expect me to oh how i wish there never had been any porcupines in the world or that all of them had died before silly hateful people ever thought of trimming hat with them they curl round and tickle my ear they blow against my cheek and sting it like needles they do look outlandish you said so yourself a minute ago nobody ever had any but only just me the only porcupine was made into the only quills for me and nobody else i wish instead of sticking out of the nasty beasts that they stuck into them same as they do into my cheek i suffer suffer suffer wearing them and hating them and they will last forever and forever and when im dead and cant help myself somebodyll rip them out of my last years hat and stick them on my head and ill be buried in them well when i am buried they will be thats one good thing oh if i ever have a child ill let her choose her own feathers and not make her wear ugly things like pigs bristles and porcupine quills with this lengthy tirade rebecca vanished like a meteor through the door and down the street while miranda sawyer gasped for breath and prayed to heaven to help her understand such human whirlwinds as this randall niece of hers this was at three oclock and at halfpast three rebecca was kneeling on the rag carpet with her head in her aunts apron sobbing her contrition oh aunt miranda do forgive me if you can its the only time ive been bad for months you know it is you know you said last week i hadnt been any trouble lately something broke inside of me and came tumbling out of my mouth in ugly words the porcupine quills make me feel just as a bull does when he sees a red cloth nobody understands how i suffer with them miranda sawyer had learned a few lessons in the last two years lessons which were making her at least on her good days a trifle kinder and at any rate a juster woman than she used to be when she alighted on the wrong side of her fourposter in the morning or felt an extra touch of rheumatism she was still grim and unyielding but sometimes a curious sort of melting process seemed to go on within her when her whole bony structure softened and her eyes grew less vitreous at such moments rebecca used to feel as if a superincumbent iron pot had been lifted off her head allowing her to breath freely and enjoy the sunshine well she said finally after staring first at rebecca and then at the porcupine quills as if to gain some insight into the situation well i never sence i was born int the world heerd such a speech as youve spoke an i guess there probably never was one youd better tell the minister what you said and see what he thinks of his prize sundayschool scholar but im too old and tired to scold and fuss and try to train you same as i did at first you can punish yourself this time like you used to go fire something down the well same as you did your pink parasol youve apologized and we wont say no more about it today but i expect you to show by extry good conduct how sorry you be you care altogether too much about your looks and your clothes for a child and youve got a temper thatll certainly land you in states prison some o these days rebecca wiped her eyes and laughed aloud no no aunt miranda it wont really that wasnt temper i dont get angry with people but only once in a long while with things like those cover them up quick before i begin again im all right showers over suns out miss miranda looked at her searchingly and uncomprehendingly rebeccas state of mind came perilously near to disease she thought have you seen me buyin any new bunnits or your aunt jane she asked cuttingly is there any particular reason why you should dress better than your elders you might as well know that were short of cash just now your aunt jane and me and have no intention of riggin you out like a milltown factry girl ohh cried rebecca the quick tears starting again to her eyes and the color fading out of her cheeks as she scrambled up from her knees to a seat on the sofa beside her aunt ohh how ashamed i am quick sew those quills on to the brown turban while im good if i cant stand them ill make a neat little gingham bag and slip over them and so the matter ended not as it customarily did with cold words on miss mirandas part and bitter feelings on rebeccas but with a gleam of mutual understanding mrs cobb who was a master hand at coloring dipped the offending quills in brown dye and left them to soak in it all night not only making them a nice warm color but somewhat weakening their rocky spines so that they were not quite as rampantly hideous as before in rebeccas opinion then mrs perkins went to her bandbox in the attic and gave miss dearborn some pale blue velvet with which she bound the brim of the brown turban and made a wonderful rosette out of which the porcupines defensive armor sprang buoyantly and gallantly like the plume of henry of navarre rebecca was resigned if not greatly comforted but she had grace enough to conceal her feelings now that she knew economy was at the root of some of her aunts decrees in matters of dress and she managed to forget the solferino breast save in sleep where a vision of it had a way of appearing to her dangling from the ceiling and dazzling her so with its rich color that she used to hope the milliner would sell it that she might never be tempted with it when she passed the shop window one day not long afterward miss miranda borrowed mr perkinss horse and wagon and took rebecca with her on a drive to union to see about some sausage meat and head cheese she intended to call on mrs cobb order a load of pine wood from mr strout on the way and leave some rags for a rug with old mrs pease so that the journey could be made as profitable as possible consistent with the loss of time and the wear and tear on her secondbest black dress the redwinged black hat was forcibly removed from rebeccas head just before starting and the nightmare turban substituted you might as well begin to wear it first as last remarked miranda while jane stood in the side door and sympathized secretly with rebecca i will said rebecca ramming the stiff turban down on her head with a vindictive grimace and snapping the elastic under her long braids but it makes me think of what mr robinson said when the minister told him his motherinlaw would ride in the same buggy with him at his wifes funeral i cant see how any speech of mr robinsons made years an years ago can have anything to do with wearin your turban down to union said miranda settling the lap robe over her knees well it can because he said have it that way then but itll spile the hull blamed trip for me jane closed the door suddenly partly because she experienced a desire to smile a desire she had not felt for years before rebecca came to the brick house to live and partly because she had no wish to overhear what her sister would say when she took in the full significance of rebeccas anecdote which was a favorite one with mr perkins it was a cold blustering day with a high wind that promised to bring an early fall of snow the trees were stripped bare of leaves the ground was hard and the wagon wheels rattled noisily over the thankyoumaams im glad i wore my paisley shawl over my cloak said miranda be you warm enough rebecca tie that white rigolette tighter round your neck the wind fairly blows through my bones i most wish t wed waited till a pleasanter day for this union road is all up hill or down and we shant get over the ground fast its so rough dont forget when you go into scotts to say i want all the trimmins when they send me the pork for mebbe i can try out a little mite o lard the last load o pines gone turrible quick i must see if bijah flagg cant get us some cutrounds at the mills when he hauls for squire bean next time keep your mind on your drivin rebecca and dont look at the trees and the sky so much its the same sky and same trees that have been here right along go awful slow down this hill and walk the hoss over cooks brook bridge for i always suspicion its goin to break down under me an i shouldnt want to be dropped into that fast runnin water this cold day itll be froze stiff by this time next week hadnt you better get out and lead the rest of the sentence was very possibly not vital but at any rate it was never completed for in the middle of the bridge a fierce gale of wind took miss mirandas paisley shawl and blew it over her head the long heavy ends whirled in opposite directions and wrapped themselves tightly about her wavering bonnet rebecca had the whip and the reins and in trying to rescue her struggling aunt could not steady her own hat which was suddenly torn from her head and tossed against the bridge rail where it trembled and flapped for an instant my hat oh aunt miranda my hateful hat cried rebecca never remembering at the instant how often she had prayed that the fretful porcupine might some time vanish in this violent manner since it refused to die a natural death she had already stopped the horse so giving her aunts shawl one last desperate twitch she slipped out between the wagon wheels and darted in the direction of the hated object the loss of which had dignified it with a temporary value and importance the stiff brown turban rose in the air then dropped and flew along the bridge rebecca pursued it danced along and stuck between two of the railings rebecca flew after it her long braids floating in the wind come back come back dont leave me alone with the team i wont have it come back and leave your hat miranda had at length extricated herself from the submerging shawl but she was so blinded by the wind and so confused that she did not measure the financial loss involved in her commands rebecca heard but her spirit being in arms she made one more mad scramble for the vagrant hat which now seemed possessed with an evil spirit for it flew back and forth and bounded here and there like a living thing finally distinguishing itself by blowing between the horses front and hind legs rebecca trying to circumvent it by going around the wagon and meeting it on the other side it was no use as she darted from behind the wheels the wind gave the hat an extra whirl and scurrying in the opposite direction it soared above the bridge rail and disappeared into the rapid water below get in again cried miranda holding on her bonnet you done your best and it cant be helped i only wisht id let you wear your black hat as you wanted to and i wisht wed never come such a day the shawl has broke the stems of the velvet geraniums in my bonnet and the wind has blowed away my shawl pin and my back comb id like to give up and turn right back this minute but i dont like to borrer perkinss hoss again this month when we get up in the woods you can smooth your hair down and tie the rigolette over your head and settle whats left of my bonnet itll be an expensive errant this will ii it was not till next morning that rebeccas heart really began its song of thanksgiving her aunt miranda announced at breakfast that as mrs perkins was going to millikens mills rebecca might go too and buy a serviceable hat you mustnt pay over two dollars and a half and you mustnt get the pink bird without mrs perkins says and the milliner says that it wont fade nor moult dont buy a lightcolored felt because youll get sick of it in two or three years same as you did the brown one i always liked the shape of the brown one and youll never get another trimmin thatll wear like them quills i hope not thought rebecca if you had put your elastic under your chin same as you used to and not worn it behind because you think its more grownup an fashonable the wind neverd a took the hat off your head and you wouldnt a lost it but the mischiefs done and you can go right over to mis perkins now so you wont miss her nor keep her waitin the two dollars and a half is in an envelope side o the clock rebecca swallowed the last spoonful of pickedup codfish on her plate wiped her lips and rose from her chair happier than the seraphs in paradise the porcupine quills had disappeared from her life and without any fault or violence on her part she was wholly innocent and virtuous but nevertheless she was going to have a new hat with the solferino breast should the adored object prove under rigorous examination to be practically indestructible wheneer i take my walks abroad how many hats ill see but if theyre trimmed with hedgehog quills theyll not belong to me so she improvised secretly and ecstatically as she went towards the side entry theres bijah flagg drivin in said miss miranda going to the window step out and see what hes got jane some passel from the squire i guess its a paper bag and it may be a punkin though he wouldnt wrop up a punkin come to think of it shet the dinin room door jane its turrible drafty make haste for the squires hoss never stans still a minute cept when hes goin abijah flagg alighted and approached the side door with a grin guess what ive got for ye rebecky no throb of prophetic soul warned rebecca of her approaching doom nodhead apples she sparkled looking as bright and rosy and satinskinned as an apple herself no guess again a flowering geranium guess again nuts oh i cant bijah im just going to millikens mills on an errand and im afraid of missing mrs perkins show me quick is it really for me or for aunt miranda reely for you i guess and he opened the large brown paper bag and drew from it the remains of a watersoaked hat they were remains but there was no doubt of their nature and substance they had clearly been a hat in the past and one could even suppose that when resuscitated they might again assume their original form in some near and happy future miss miranda full of curiosity joined the group in the side entry at this dramatic moment well i never she exclaimed where and how under the canopy did you ever i was working on the dam at union falls yesterday chuckled abijah with a pleased glance at each of the trio in turn an i seen this little bunnit skippin over the water jest as becky does over the road its shaped kind o like a boat an gorry ef it want sailin jest like a boat where hev i seen that kind of a bristlin plume thinks i where indeed thought rebecca stormily then it come to me that id drove that plume to school and drove it to meetin and drove it to the fair androve it most everywheres on becky so i reached out a pole an ketched it fore it got in amongst the logs an come to any damage an here it is the hats passed in its checks i guess looks kind as if a wet elephant had stepped on it but the plumes bouts good as new i reely fetched the hat beck for the sake o the plume it was real good of you bijah an were all of us obliged to you said miranda as she poised the hat on one hand and turned it slowly with the other well i do say she exclaimed and i guess ive said it before that of all the wearing plumes that ever i see that ones the wearinest seems though it just wouldnt give up look at the way its held mis cobbs dye its about as browns when it went int the water dyed but not a mite dead grinned abijah who was somewhat celebrated for his puns and i declare miranda continued when you think o the fuss they make about ostriches killin em off by hundreds for the sake o their feathers thatll string out and spoil in one hard rainstorm an all the time lettin useful porcupines run round with their quills on why i cant hardly understand it without milliners have found out jest how good they do last an so they wont use em for trimmin bijahs right the hat aint no more use rebecca but you can buy you another this mornin any color or shape you fancy an have miss morton sew these brown quills on to it with some kind of a buckle or a bow jest to hide the roots then youll be fixed for another season thanks to bijah uncle jerry and aunt sarah cobb were made acquainted before very long with the part that destiny or abijah flagg had played in rebeccas affairs for accompanied by the teacher she walked to the old stage drivers that same afternoon taking off her new hat with the venerable trimming she laid it somewhat ostentatiously upside down on the kitchen table and left the room dimpling a little more than usual uncle jerry rose from his seat and crossing the room looked curiously into the hat and found that a circular paper lining was neatly pinned in the crown and that it bore these lines which were read aloud with great effect by miss dearborn and with her approval were copied in the thought book for the benefit of posterity it was the bristling porcupine as he stood on his native heath he said ill pluck me some immortelles and make me up a wreath for tho i may not live myself to more than a hundred and ten my quills will last till crack of doom and maybe after then they can be colored blue or green or orange brown or red but often as they may be dyed they never will be dead and so the bristling porcupine as he stood on his native heath said i think ill pluck me some immmortelles and make me up a wreath rrr fifth chronicle the saving of the colors i even when rebecca had left school having attained the great age of seventeen and therefore able to look back over a past incredibly long and full she still reckoned time not by years but by certain important occurrences there was the year her father died the year she left sunnybrook farm to come to her aunts in riverboro the year sister hannah became engaged the year little mira died the year abijah flagg ceased to be squire beans choreboy and astounded riverboro by departing for limerick academy in search of an education and finally the year of her graduation which to the mind of seventeen seems rather the culmination than the beginning of existence between these epochmaking events certain other happenings stood out in bold relief against the gray of dull daily life there was the day she first met her friend of friends mr aladdin and the later even more radiant one when he gave her the coral necklace there was the day the simpson family moved away from riverboro under a cloud and she kissed clara belle fervently at the crossroads telling her that she would always be faithful there was the visit of the syrian missionaries to the brick house that was a bright romantic memory as strange and brilliant as the wonderful little birds wings and breasts that the strangers brought from the far east she remembered the moment they asked her to choose some for herself and the rapture with which she stroked the beautiful things as they lay on the black haircloth sofa then there was the coming of the new minister for though many were tried only one was chosen and finally there was the flagraising a festivity that thrilled riverboro and edgewood society from centre to circumference a festivity that took place just before she entered the female seminary at wareham and said goodby to kind miss dearborn and the village school there must have been other flagraisings in history even the persons most interested in this particular one would grudgingly have allowed that much but it would have seemed to them improbable that any such flagraising as theirs either in magnitude of conception or brilliancy of actual performance could twice glorify the same century of some pageants it is tacitly admitted that there can be no duplicates and the flagraising at riverboro centre was one of these so that it is small wonder if rebecca chose it as one of the important dates in her personal almanac the new ministers wife was the being under providence who had conceived the germinal idea of the flag at this time the parish had almost settled down to the trembling belief that they were united on a pastor in the earlier time a minister was chosen for life and if he had faults which was a probably enough contingency and if his congregation had any which is within the bounds of possibility each bore with the other not quite without friction as oldfashioned husbands and wives once did before the easy way out of the difficulty was discovered or at least before it was popularized the faithful old parson had died after thirty years preaching and perhaps the newer methods had begun to creep in for it seemed impossible to suit the two communities most interested in the choice the rev mr davis for example was a spirited preacher but persisted in keeping two horses in the parsonage stable and in exchanging them whenever he could get faster ones as a parochial visitor he was incomparable dashing from house to house with such speed that he could cover the parish in a single afternoon this sporting tendency which would never have been remarked in a british parson was frowned upon in a new england village and deacon milliken told mr davis when giving him what he alluded to as his walking papers that they didnt want the edgewood church run by hoss power the next candidate pleased edgewood where morning preaching was held but the other parish which had afternoon service declined to accept him because he wore a wig an illmatched crookedly applied wig number three was eloquent but given to gesticulation and mrs jere burbank the president of the dorcas society who sat in a front pew said she couldnt bear to see a preacher scramble round the pulpit hot sundays number four a genial handsome man gifted in prayer was found to be a democrat the congregation was overwhelmingly republican in its politics and perceived something ludicrous if not positively blasphemous in a democrat preaching the gospel ananias and beelzebubll be candidatin here first thing we know exclaimed the outraged republican nominee for district attorney number five had a feebleminded child which the hiring committee prophesied would always be standing in the parsonage front yard making talk for the other denominations number six was the rev judson baxter the present incumbent and he was voted to be as near perfection as a minister can be in this finite world his young wife had a small income of her own a distinct and unusual advantage and the subscription committee hoped that they might not be eternally driving over the country to get somebodys fifty cents that had been overdue for eight months but might take their onerous duties a little more easily it does seem as if our ministers were the poorest lot complained mrs robinson if their salary is two months behindhand they begin to be nervous seems as though they might lay up a little before they come here and not live from hand to mouth so the baxters seem quite different and i only hope they wont get wasteful and run into debt they say she keeps the parlor blinds open bout half the time and the room is lit up so often evenins that the neighbors think her and mr baxter must set in there it dont seem hardly as if it could be so but mrs buzzell says tis and she says we might as well say goodby to the parlor carpet which is church property for the baxters are living all over it this criticism was the only discordant note in the chorus of praise and the people gradually grew accustomed to the open blinds and the overused parlor carpet which was just completing its twentyfifth year of honest service mrs baxter communicated her patriotic idea of a new flag to the dorcas society proposing that the women should cut and make it themselves it may not be quite as good as those manufactured in the large cities she said but we shall be proud to see our homemade flag flying in the breeze and it will mean all the more to the young voters growing up to remember that their mothers made it with their own hands how would it do to let some of the girls help modestly asked miss dearborn the riverboro teacher we might choose the best sewers and let them put in at least a few stitches so that they can feel they have a share in it just the thing exclaimed mrs baxter we can cut the stripes and sew them together and after we have basted on the white stars the girls can apply them to the blue ground we must have it ready for the campaign rally and we couldnt christen it at a better time than in this presidential year ii in this way the great enterprise was started and day by day the preparations went forward in the two villages the boys as future voters and fighters demanded an active share in the proceedings and were organized by squire bean into a fife and drum corps so that by day and night martial but most inharmonious music woke the echoes and deafened mothers felt their patriotism oozing out at the soles of their shoes dick carter was made captain for his grandfather had a gold medal given him by queen victoria for rescuing three hundred and twentysix passengers from a sinking british vessel riverboro thought it high time to pay some graceful tribute to great britain in return for her handsome conduct to captain nahum carter and human imagination could contrive nothing more impressive than a vicarious share in the flag raising living perkins tried to be happy in the ranks for he was offered no official position principally mrs smellie observed because his fathers war record want clean oh yes jim perkins went to the war she continued he hid out behind the hencoop when they was draftin but they found him and took him along he got into one battle too somehow or nother but he run away from it he was allers cautious jim was if he ever see trouble of any kind comin towards him he was out o sight fore it got a chance to light he said eight dollars a month without bounty wouldnt pay him to stop bullets for he wouldnt fight a skeeter jim wouldnt but land we aint to war all the time and hes a good neighbor and a good blacksmith miss dearborn was to be columbia and the older girls of the two schools were to be the states such trade in muslins and red white and blue ribbons had never been known since watson kep store and the number of brief white petticoats hanging out to bleach would have caused the passing stranger to imagine riverboro a continual dancing school juvenile virtue both male and female reached an almost impossible height for parents had only to lift a finger and say you shant go to the flag raising and the refractory spirit at once armed itself for new struggles toward the perfect life mr jeremiah cobb had consented to impersonate uncle sam and was to drive columbia and the states to the raising on the top of his own stage meantime the boys were drilling the ladies were cutting and basting and stitching and the girls were sewing on stars for the starry part of the spangled banner was to remain with each of them in turn until she had performed her share of the work it was felt by one and all a fine and splendid service indeed to help in the making of the flag and if rebecca was proud to be of the chosen ones so was her aunt jane sawyer who had taught her all her delicate stitches on a longlookedfor afternoon in august the ministers wife drove up to the brick house door and handed out the great piece of bunting to rebecca who received it in her arms with as much solemnity as if it had been a child awaiting baptismal rites im so glad she sighed happily i thought it would never come my turn you should have had it a week ago but huldah meserve upset the ink bottle over her star and we had to baste on another one you are the last though and then we shall sew the stars and stripes together and seth strout will get the top ready for hanging just think it wont be many days before you children will be pulling the rope with all your strength the band will be playing the men will be cheering and the new flag will go higher and higher till the red white and blue shows against the sky rebeccas eyes fairly blazed shall i fell on my star or buttonhole it she asked look at all the others and make the most beautiful stitches you can thats all it is your star you know and you can even imagine it is your state and try and have it the best of all if everybody else is trying to do the same thing with her state that will make a great country wont it rebeccas eyes spoke glad confirmation of the idea my star my state she repeated joyously oh mrs baxter ill make such fine stitches youll think the white grew out of the blue the new ministers wife looked pleased to see her spark kindle a flame in the young heart you can sew so much of yourself into your star she went on in the glad voice that made her so winsome that when you are an old lady you can put on your specs and find it among all the others goodby come up to the parsonage saturday afternoon mr baxter wants to see you judson help that dear little genius of a rebecca all you can she said that night when they were cosily talking in their parlor and living all over the parish carpet i dont know what she may or may not come to some day i only wish she were ours if you could have seen her clasp the flag tight in her arms and put her cheek against it and watched the tears of feeling start in her eyes when i told her that her star was her state i kept whispering to myself covet not thy neighbors child daily at four oclock rebecca scrubbed her hands almost to the bone brushed her hair and otherwise prepared herself in body mind and spirit for the consecrated labor of sewing on her star all the time that her needle cautiously conscientiously formed the tiny stitches she was making rhymes in her head her favorite achievement being this your star my star all our stars together they make the dear old banner proud to float in the bright fall weather there was much discussion as to which of the girls should impersonate the state of maine for that was felt to be the highest honor in the gift of the committee alice robinson was the prettiest child in the village but she was very shy and by no means a general favorite minnie smellie possessed the handsomest dress and a pair of white slippers and openwork stockings that nearly carried the day still as miss delia weeks well said she was so stupid that if she should suck her thumb in the very middle of the exercises nobodyd be a dite surprised huldah meserve was next voted upon and the fact that if she were not chosen her father might withdraw his subscription to the brass band fund was a matter for grave consideration i kind o hate to have such a giggler for the state of maine let her be the goddess of liberty proposed mrs burbank whose patriotism was more local than national how would rebecca randall do for maine and let her speak some of her verses suggested the new ministers wife who could she have had her way would have given all the prominent parts to rebecca from uncle sam down so beauty fashion and wealth having been tried and found wanting the committee discussed the claims of talent and it transpired that to the awestricken rebecca fell the chief plum in the pudding it was a tribute to her gifts that there was no jealousy or envy among the other girls they readily conceded her special fitness for the role her life had not been pressed down full to the brim of pleasures and she had a sort of distrust of joy in the bud not until she saw it in full radiance of bloom did she dare embrace it she had never read any verse but byron felicia hemans bits of paradise lost and the selections in the school readers but she would have agreed heartily with the poet who said not by appointment do we meet delight and joy they heed not our expectancy but round some corner in the streets of life they on a sudden clasp us with a smile for many nights before the raising when she went to her bed she said to herself after she had finished her prayers it cant be true that im chosen for the state of maine it just cant be true nobody could be good enough but oh ill try to be as good as i can to be going to wareham seminary next week and to be the state of maine too oh i must pray hard to god to keep me meek and humble iii the flag was to be raised on a tuesday and on the previous sunday it became known to the children that clara belle simpson was coming back from acreville coming to live with mrs fogg and take care of the baby called by the neighborhood boys the fogg horn on account of his excellent voice production clara belle was one of miss dearborns original flock and if she were left wholly out of the festivities she would be the only girl of suitable age to be thus slighted it seemed clear to the juvenile mind therefore that neither she nor her descendants would ever recover from such a blow but under all the circumstances would she be allowed to join in the procession even rebecca the optimistic feared not and the committee confirmed her fears by saying that abner simpsons daughter certainly could not take any prominent part in the ceremony but they hoped that mrs fogg would allow her to witness it when abner simpson urged by the town authorities took his wife and seven children away from riverboro to acreville just over the border in the next county riverboro went to bed leaving its barn and shed doors unfastened and drew long breaths of gratitude to providence of most winning disposition and genial manners mr simpson had not that instinctive comprehension of property rights which renders a man a valuable citizen squire bean was his nearest neighbor and he conceived the novel idea of paying simpson five dollars a year not to steal from him a method occasionally used in the highlands in the early days the bargain was struck and adhered to religiously for a twelvemonth but on the second of january mr simpson announced the verbal contract as formally broken i didnt know what i was doin when i made it squire he urged in the first place its a slur on my reputation and an injury to my selfrespect secondly its a nervous strain on me and thirdly five dollars dont pay me squire bean was so struck with the unique and convincing nature of these arguments that he could scarcely restrain his admiration and he confessed to himself afterward that unless simpsons mental attitude could be changed he was perhaps a fitter subject for medical science than the state prison abner was a most unusual thief and conducted his operations with a tact and neighborly consideration none too common in the profession he would never steal a mans scythe in hayingtime nor his fur laprobe in the coldest of the winter the picking of a lock offered no attractions to him he want no burglar he would have scornfully asserted a strange horse and wagon hitched by the roadside was the most flagrant of his thefts but it was the small things the hatchet or axe on the choppingblock the tin pans sunning at the side door a stray garment bleaching on the grass a hoe rake shovel or a bag of early potatoes that tempted him most sorely and these appealed to him not so much for their intrinsic value as because they were so excellently adapted to swapping the swapping was really the enjoyable part of the procedure the theft was only a sad but necessary preliminary for if abner himself had been a man of sufficient property to carry on his business operations independently it is doubtful if he would have helped himself so freely to his neighbors goods riverboro regretted the loss of mrs simpson who was useful in scrubbing cleaning and washing and was thought to exercise some influence over her predatory spouse there was a story of their early married life when they had a farm a story to the effect that mrs simpson always rode on every load of hay that her husband took to milltown with the view of keeping him sober through the day after he turned out of the country road and approached the metropolis it was said that he used to bury the docile lady in the load he would then drive on to the scales have the weight of the hay entered in the buyers book take his horses to the stable for feed and water and when a favorable opportunity offered he would assist the hot and panting mrs simpson out of the side or back of the rack and gallantly brush the straw from her person for this reason it was always asserted that abner simpson sold his wife every time he went to milltown but the story was never fully substantiated and at all events it was the only suspected blot on meek mrs simpsons personal reputation as for the simpson children they were missed chiefly as familiar figures by the roadside but rebecca honestly loved clara belle notwithstanding her aunt mirandas opposition to the intimacy rebeccas taste for low company was a source of continual anxiety to her aunt anything thats human flesh is good enough for her miranda groaned to jane shell ride with the ragsackandbottle peddler just as quick as she would with the minister she always sets beside the st vitus dance young one at sabbath school and shes forever riggin and onriggin that dirty simpson baby she reminds me of a puppy thatll always go to everybody thatll have him it was thought very creditable to mrs fogg that she sent for clara belle to live with her and go to school part of the year shell be useful said mrs fogg and shell be out of her fathers way and so keep honest though shes no awful hombly ive no fears for her a girl with her red hair freckles and crosseyes cant fall into no kind of sin i dont believe mrs fogg requested that clara belle should be started on her journey from acreville by train and come the rest of the way by stage and she was disturbed to receive word on sunday that mr simpson had borrowed a good roader from a new acquaintance and would himself drive the girl from acreville to riverboro a distance of thirtyfive miles that he would arrive in their vicinity on the very night before the flagraising was thought by riverboro to be a public misfortune and several residents hastily determined to deny themselves a sight of the festivities and remain watchfully on their own premises on monday afternoon the children were rehearsing their songs at the meetinghouse as rebecca came out on the broad wooden steps she watched mrs peter meserves buggy out of sight for in front wrapped in a cotton sheet lay the previous flag after a few chattering goodbys and weather prophecies with the other girls she started on her homeward walk dropping in at the parsonage to read her verses to the minister he welcomed her gladly as she removed her white cotton gloves hastily slipped on outside the door for ceremony and pushed back the funny hat with the yellow and black porcupine quills the hat with which she made her first appearance in riverboro society youve heard the beginning mr baxter now will you please tell me if you like the last verse she asked taking out her paper ive only read it to alice robinson and i think perhaps she can never be a poet though shes a splendid writer last year when she was twelve she wrote a birthday poem to herself and she made natal rhyme with milton which of course it wouldnt i remember every verse ended this is my day so natal and i will follow milton another one of hers was written just because she couldnt help it she said this was it let me to the hills away give me pen and paper ill write until the earth will sway the story of my maker the minister could scarcely refrain from smiling but he controlled himself that he might lose none of rebeccas quaint observations when she was perfectly at ease unwatched and uncriticised she was a marvelous companion the name of the poem is going to be my star she continued and mrs baxter gave me all the ideas but somehow theres a kind of magicness when they get into poetry dont you think so rebecca always talked to grown people as if she were their age or a more subtle and truer distinction as if they were hers it has often been so remarked in different words agreed the minister mrs baxter said that each star was a state and if each state did its best we should have a splendid country then once she said that we ought to be glad the war is over and the states are all at peace together and i thought columbia must be glad too for miss dearborn says shes the mother of all the states so im going to have it end like this i didnt write it i just sewed it while i was working on my star for its your star my star all the stars together that make our countrys flag so proud to float in the bright fall weather northern starssouthern stars stars of the east and west side by side they lie at peace on the dear flags motherbreast oh many are the poets that are sown by nature thought the minister quoting wordsworth to himself and i wonder what becomes of them thats a pretty idea little rebecca and i dont know whether you or my wife ought to have the more praise what made you think of the stars lying on the flags motherbreast where did you get that word why and the young poet looked rather puzzled thats the way it is the flag is the whole country the mother and the stars are the states the stars had to lie somewhere lap nor arms wouldnt sound well with west so of course i said breast rebecca answered with some surprise at the question and the minister put his hand under her chin and kissed her softly on the forehead when he said goodby at the door iv rebecca walked rapidly along in the gathering twilight thinking of the eventful morrow as she approached the turning on the left called the old milltown road she saw a white horse and wagon driven by a man with a rakish flapping panama hat come rapidly around the turn and disappear over the long hills leading down to the falls there was no mistaking him there never was another abner simpson with his lean height his bushy reddish hair the gay cock of his hat and the long piratical upturned mustaches which the boys used to say were used as hatracks by the simpson children at night the old milltown road ran past mrs foggs house so he must have left clara belle there and rebeccas heart glowed to think that her poor little friend need not miss the raising she began to run now fearful of being late for supper and covered the ground to the falls in a brief time as she crossed the bridge she again saw abner simpsons team drawn up at the watering trough coming a little nearer with the view of inquiring for the family her quick eye caught sight of something unexpected a gust of wind blew up a corner of a linen laprobe in the back of the wagon and underneath it she distinctly saw the whitesheeted bundle that held the flag the bundle with a tiny tiny spot of red bunting peeping out at one corner it is true she had eaten slept dreamed red white and blue for weeks but there was no mistaking the evidence of her senses the idolized flag longed for worked for sewed for that flag was in the back of abner simpsons wagon and if so what would become of the raising acting on blind impulse she ran toward the wateringtrough calling out in her clear treble mr simpson oh mr simpson will you let me ride a piece with you and hear all about clara belle im going part way over to the centre on an errand so she was a most important errand to recover the flag of her country at present in the hands of the foe mr simpson turned round in his seat and cried heartily certain sure i will for he liked the fair sex young and old and rebecca had always been a prime favorite with him climb right in hows everybody glad to see ye the folks talk bout ye from sunup to sundown and clara belle cant hardly wait for a sight of ye rebecca scrambled up trembling and pale with excitement she did not in the least know what was going to happen but she was sure that the flag when in the enemys country must be at least a little safer with the state of maine sitting on top of it mr simpson began a long monologue about acreville the house he lived in the pond in front of it mrs simpsons health and various items of news about the children varied by reports of his personal misfortunes he put no questions and asked no replies so this gave the inexperienced soldier a few seconds to plan a campaign there were three houses to pass the browns at the corner the millikens and the robinsons on the brow of the hill if mr robinson were in the front yard she might tell mr simpson she wanted to call there and ask mr robinson to hold the horses head while she got out of the wagon then she might fly to the back before mr simpson could realize the situation and dragging out the precious bundle sit on it hard while mr robinson settled the matter of ownership with mr simpson this was feasible but it meant a quarrel between the two men who held an ancient grudge against each other and mr simpson was a valiant fighter as the various sheriffs who had attempted to arrest him could cordially testify it also meant that everybody in the village would hear of the incident and poor clara belle be branded again as the child of a thief another idea danced into her excited brain such a clever one she could hardly believe it hers she might call mr robinson to the wagon and when he came close to the wheels she might say all of a sudden please take the flag out of the back of the wagon mr robinson we have brought it here for you to keep overnight mr simpson might be so surprised that he would give up his prize rather than be suspected of stealing but as they neared the robinsons house there was not a sign of life to be seen so the last plan ingenious though it was was perforce abandoned the road now lay between thick pine woods with no dwelling in sight it was growing dusk and rebecca was driving along the lonely way with a person who was generally called slippery simpson not a thought of fear crossed her mind save the fear of bungling in her diplomacy and so losing the flag she knew mr simpson well and a pleasanter man was seldom to be met she recalled an afternoon when he came home and surprised the whole school playing the revolutionary war in his helterskelter dooryard and the way in which he had joined the british forces and impersonated general burgoyne had greatly endeared him to her the only difficulty was to find proper words for her delicate mission for of course if mr simpsons anger were aroused he would politely push her out of the wagon and drive away with the flag perhaps if she led the conversation in the right direction an opportunity would present itself she well remembered how emma jane perkins had failed to convert jacob moody simply because she failed to lead up to the delicate question of his manner of life clearing her throat nervously she began is it likely to be fair tomorrow guess so clear as a bell whats on foot a picnic no were to have a grand flagraising that is she thought if we have any flag to raise that so where the three villages are to club together and have a rally and raise the flag at the centre therell be a brass band and speakers and the mayor of portland and the man that will be governor if hes elected and a dinner in the grange hall and we girls are chosen to raise the flag i want to know thatll be grand wont it still not a sign of consciousness on the part of abner i hope mrs fogg will take clara belle for it will be splendid to look at mr cobb is going to be uncle sam and drive us on the stage miss dearborn clara belles old teacher you know is going to be columbia the girls will be the states of the union and oh mr simpson i am the one to be the state of maine this was not altogether to the point but a piece of information impossible to conceal mr simpson flourished the whipstock and gave a loud hearty laugh then he turned in his seat and regarded rebecca curiously youre kind of small haint ye for so big a state as this one he asked any of us would be too small replied rebecca with dignity but the committee asked me and i am going to try hard to do well the tragic thought that there might be no occasion for anybody to do anything well or ill suddenly overcame her here and putting her hand on mr simpsons sleeve she attacked the subject practically and courageously oh mr simpson dear mr simpson its such a mortifying subject i cant bear to say anything about it but please give us back our flag dont dont take it over to acreville mr simpson weve worked so long to make it and it was so hard getting the money for the bunting wait a minute please dont be angry and dont say no just yet till i explain more itll be so dreadful for everybody to get there tomorrow morning and find no flag to raise and the band and the mayor all disappointed and the children crying with their muslin dresses all bought for nothing o dear mr simpson please dont take our flag away from us the apparently astonished abner pulled his mustaches and exclaimed but i dont know what youre drivin at whos got yer flag i haint could duplicity deceit and infamy go any further rebecca wondered and her soul filling with righteous wrath she cast discretion to the winds and spoke a little more plainly bending her great swimming eyes on the now embarrassed abner who looked like an angleworm wriggling on a pin mr simpson how can you say that when i saw the flag in the back of your wagon myself when you stopped to water the horse its wicked of you to take it and i cannot bear it her voice broke now for a doubt of mr simpsons yielding suddenly darkened her mind if you keep it youll have to keep me for i wont be parted from it i cant fight like the boys but i can pinch and scratch and i will scratch just like a panther ill lie right down on my star and not move if i starve to death look here hold your hosses n dont cry till you git something to cry for grumbled the outraged abner to whom a clue had just come and leaning over the wagonback he caught hold of a corner of white sheet and dragged up the bundle scooping off rebeccas hat in the process and almost burying her in bunting she caught the treasure passionately to her heart and stifled her sobs in it while abner exclaimed i swan to man if that haint a flag well in that case youre good n welcome to it land i seen that bundle lyin in the middle o the road and i says to myself thats somebodys washin and id better pick it up and leave it at the postoffice to be claimed n all the time it was a flag this was a simpsonian version of the matter the fact being that a whitecovered bundle lying on the meserves front steps had attracted his practiced eye and slipping in at the open gate he had swiftly and deftly removed it to his wagon on general principles thinking if it were clean clothes it would be extremely useful and in any event there was no good in passing by something flung into your very arms so to speak he had had no leisure to examine the bundle and indeed took little interest in it probably he stole it simply from force of habit and because there was nothing else in sight to steal everybodys premises being preternaturally tidy and empty almost as if his visit had been expected rebecca was a practical child and it seemed to her almost impossible that so heavy a bundle should fall out of mrs meserves buggy and not be noticed but she hoped that mr simpson was telling the truth and she was too glad and grateful to doubt anyone at the moment thank you thank you ever so much mr simpson youre the nicest kindest politest man i ever knew and the girls will be so pleased you gave us back the flag and so will the dorcas society theyll be sure to write you a letter of thanks they always do tell em not to bother bout any thanks said simpson beaming virtuously but land im glad twas me that happened to see that bundle in the road and take the trouble to pick it up jest to think of its bein a flag he thought if ever there was a pesky wuthless thing to trade off twould be a great gormin flag like that can i get out now please asked rebecca i want to go back for mrs meserve will be dreadfully nervous when she finds out she dropped the flag and she has heart trouble no you dont objected mr simpson gallantly turning the horse do you think id let a little creeter like you lug that great heavy bundle i haint got time to go back to meserves but ill take you to the corner and dump you there flag n all and you can get some o the menfolks to carry it the rest o the way youll wear it out huggin it so i helped make it and i adore it said rebecca who was in a highpitched and grandiloquent mood why dont you like it its your countrys flag simpson smiled an indulgent smile and looked a trifle bored at these frequent appeals to his extremely rusty higher feelings i don knows ive got any particlar intrest in the country he remarked languidly i know i dont owe nothin to it nor own nothin in it you own a star on the flag same as everybody argued rebecca who had been feeding on patriotism for a month and you own a state too like all of us land i wisht i did or even a quarter section sighed mr simpson feeling somehow a little more povertystricken and discouraged than usual as they approached the corner and the wateringtrough where four crossroads met the whole neighborhood seemed to be in evidence and mr simpson suddenly regretted his chivalrous escort of rebecca especially when as he neared the group an excited lady wringing her hands turned out to be mrs peter meserve accompanied by huldah the browns mrs milliken abijah flagg and miss dearborn do you know anything about the new flag rebecca shrieked mrs meserve too agitated at the moment to notice the childs companion its right here in my lap all safe responded rebecca joyously you careless meddlesome young one to take it off my steps where i left it just long enough to go round to the back and hunt up my doorkey youve given me a fit of sickness with my weak heart and what business was it of yours i believe you think you own the flag hand it over to me this minute rebecca was climbing down during this torrent of language but as she turned she flashed one look of knowledge at the false simpson a look that went through him from head to foot as if it were carried by electricity he had not deceived her after all owing to the angry chatter of mrs meserve he had been handcuffed twice in his life but no sheriff had ever discomfited him so thoroughly as this child fury mounted to his brain and as soon as she was safely out from between the wheels he stood up in the wagon and flung the flag out in the road in the midst of the excited group take it you pious passimonious cheeseparin hairsplittin backbitin flagraisin crew he roared rebecca never took the flag i found it in the road i say you never no such a thing exclaimed mrs meserve you found it on the doorsteps in my garden mebbe twas your garden but it was so chock full o weeks i thought twas the road retorted abner i vow i wouldnt a given the old rag back to one o you not if you begged me on your bended knees but rebeccas a friend o my folks and can do with her flags shes a mind to and the rest o ye can go to thunder n stay there for all i care so saying he made a sharp turn gave the gaunt white horse a lash and disappeared in a cloud of dust before the astonished mr brown the only man in the party had a thought of detaining him im sorry i spoke so quick rebecca said mrs meserve greatly mortified at the situation but dont you believe a word that lyin critter said he did steal it off my doorstep and how did you come to be ridin and consortin with him i believe it would kill your aunt miranda if she should hear about it the little schoolteacher put a sheltering arm round rebecca as mr brown picked up the flag and dusted and folded it im willing she should hear about it rebecca answered i didnt do anything to be ashamed of i saw the flag in the back of mr simpsons wagon and i just followed it there werent any men or any dorcases to take care of it and so it fell to me you wouldnt have had me let it out of my sight would you and we going to raise it tomorrow morning rebeccas perfectly right mrs meserve said miss dearborn proudly and its lucky there was somebody quickwitted enough to ride and consort with mr simpson i dont know what the village will think but seems to me the town clerk might write down in his book this day the state of maine saved the flag sixth chronicle the state o maine girl i the foregoing episode if narrated in a romance would undoubtedly have been called the saving of the colors but at the nightly conversazione in watsons store it was alluded to as the way little becky randall got the flag away from slippery simpson dramatic as it was it passed into the limbo of halfforgotten things in rebeccas mind its brief importance submerged in the glories of the next day there was a painful prelude to these glories alice robinson came to spend the night with rebecca and when the bedroom door closed upon the two girls alice announced here intention of doing up rebeccas front hair in leads and rags and braiding the back in six tight wetted braids rebecca demurred alice persisted your hair is so long and thick and dark and straight she said that youll look like an injun i am the state of maine it all belonged to the indians once rebecca remarked gloomily for she was curiously shy about discussing her personal appearance and your wreath of little pinecones wont set decent without crimps continued alice rebecca glanced in the cracked lookingglass and met what she considered an accusing lack of beauty a sight that always either saddened or enraged her according to circumstances then she sat down resignedly and began to help alice in the philanthropic work of making the state of maine fit to be seen at the raising neither of the girls was an expert hairdresser and at the end of an hour when the sixth braid was tied and rebecca had given one last shuddering look in the mirror both were ready to weep with fatigue the candle was blown out and alice soon went to sleep but rebecca tossed on her pillow its goosefeathered softness all dented by the cruel lead knobs and the knots of twisted rags she slipped out of bed and walked to and fro holding her aching head with both hands finally she leaned on the windowsill watching the still weathervane on alices barn and breathing in the fragrance of the ripening apples until her restlessness subsided under the clear starry beauty of the night at six in the morning the girls were out of bed for alice could hardly wait until rebeccas hair was taken down she was so eager to see the result of her labors the leads and rags were painfully removed together with much hair the operation being punctuated by a series of squeaks squeals and shrieks on the part of rebecca and a series of warnings from alice who wished the preliminaries to be kept secret from the aunts that they might the more fully appreciate the radiant result then came the unbraiding and then dramatic moment the combing out a difficult not to say impossible process in which the hairs that had resisted the earlier stages almost gave up the ghost the long front strands had been wound up from various angles and by various methods so that when released they assumed the strangest most obstinate most unexpected attitudes when the comb was dragged through the last braid the wild tortured electric hairs following and then rebounding from it in a bristling snarling tangle massachusetts gave one encompassing glance at the state o maines head and announced her intention of going home to breakfast she was deeply grieved at the result of her attempted beautifying but she felt that meeting miss miranda sawyer at the morning meal would not mend matters in the least so slipping out of the side door she ran up guide board hill as fast as her legs could carry her the state o maine deserted and somewhat unnerved sat down before the glass and attacked her hair doggedly and with set lips working over it until miss jane called her to breakfast then with a boldness born of despair she entered the dining room where her aunts were already seated at table to draw fire she whistled a forbidden joy which only attracted more attention instead of diverting it there was a moment of silence after the grotesque figure was fully taken in then came a moan from jane and a groan from miranda what have you done to yourself asked miranda sternly made an effort to be beautiful and failed jauntily replied rebecca but she was too miserable to keep up the fiction oh aunt miranda dont scold im so unhappy alice and i rolled up my hair to curl it for the raising she said it was so straight i looked like an indian mebbe you did vigorously agreed miranda but t any rate you looked like a christian injun n now you look like a heathen injun thats all the difference i can see what can we do with her jane between this and nine oclock well all go out to the pump just as soon as were through breakfast answered jane soothingly we can accomplish considrable with water and force rebecca nibbled her corncake her tearful eyes cast on her plate and her chin quivering dont you cry and red your eyes up chided miranda quite kindly the minute youve eat enough run up and get your brush and comb and meet us at the back door i wouldnt care myself how bad i looked said rebecca but i cant bear to be so homely that i shame the state of maine oh what an hour followed this plaint did any aspirant for literary or dramatic honors ever pass to fame through such an antechamber of horrors did poet of the day ever have his head so maltreated to be dipped in the rainwater tub soused again and again to be held under the spout and pumped on to be rubbed furiously with rough roller towels to be dried with hot flannels and is it not wellnigh incredible that at the close of such an hour the ends of the long hair should still stand out straight the braids having been turned up two inches by alice and tied hard in that position with linen thread get out the skirtboard jane cried miranda to whom opposition served as a tonic and move that flatiron on to the front o the stove rebecca set down in that low chair beside the board and jane you spread out her hair on it and cover it up with brown paper dont cringe rebecca the worsts over and youve borne up real good ill be careful not to pull your hair nor scorch you and oh how id like to have alice robinson acrost my knee and a good strip o shingle in my right hand there youre all ironed out and your aunt jane can put on your white dress and braid your hair up again good and tight perhaps you wont be the hombliest of the states after all but when i see you comin in to breakfast i said to myself i guess if maine looked like that it wouldnt never a been admitted into the union when uncle sam and the stagecoach drew up to the brick house with a grand swing and a flourish the goddess of liberty and most of the states were already in their places on the harricane deck words fail to describe the gallant bearing of the horses their headstalls gayly trimmed and their harnesses dotted with little flags the stage windows were hung in bunting and from within beamed columbia looking out from the bright frame as if proud of her freight of loyal children patriotic streamers floated from whip from dashboard and from rumble and the effect of the whole was something to stimulate the most phlegmatic voter rebecca came out on the steps and aunt jane brought a chair to assist in the ascent miss dearborn peeped from the window and gave a despairing look at her favorite what had happened to her who had dressed her had her head been put through a wringingmachine why were her eyes red and swollen miss dearborn determined to take her behind the trees in the pine grove and give her some finishing touches touches that her skillful fingers fairly itched to bestow the stage started and as the roadside pageant grew gayer and gayer rebecca began to brighten and look prettier for most of her beautifying came from within the people walking driving or standing on their doorsteps cheered uncle sams coach with its freight of gossamermuslined flutteringribboned girls and just behind the gorgeously decorated haycart driven by abijah flagg bearing the jolly but inharmonious fifeanddrum corps was ever such a golden day such crystal air such mellow sunshine such a merry uncle sam the stage drew up at an appointed spot near a pine grove and while the crowd was gathering the children waited for the hour to arrive when they should march to the platform the hour toward which they seemed to have been moving since the dawn of creation as soon as possible miss dearborn whispered to rebecca come behind the trees with me i want to make you prettier rebecca thought she had suffered enough from that process already during the last twelve hours but she put out an obedient hand and the two withdrew now miss dearborn was i fear a very indifferent teacher dr moses always said so and libbie moses who wanted her school said it was a pity she hadnt enjoyed more social advantages in her youth libbie herself had taken music lessons in portland and spent a night at the profile house in the white mountains and had visited her sister in lowell massachusetts these experiences gave her in her own mind and in the mind of her intimate friends a horizon so boundless that her view of smaller humbler matters was a trifle distorted miss dearborns stock in trade was small her principal virtues being devotion to children and ability to gain their love and a power of evolving a schoolroom order so natural cheery serene and peaceful that it gave the beholder a certain sense of being in a district heaven she was poor in arithmetic and weak in geometry but if you gave her a rose a bit of ribbon and a sevenbynine lookingglass she could make herself as pretty as a pink in two minutes safely sheltered behind the pines miss dearborn began to practice mysterious feminine arts she flew at rebeccas tight braids opened the strands and rebraided them loosely bit and tore the red white and blue ribbon in two and tied the braids separately then with nimble fingers she pulled out little tendrils of hair behind the ears and around the nape of the neck after a glance of acute disapproval directed at the stiff balloon skirt she knelt on the ground and gave a strenuous embrace to rebeccas knees murmuring between her hugs starch must be cheap at the brick house this particular line of beauty attained there ensued great pinchings of ruffles her fingers that could never hold a ferrule nor snap childrens ears being incomparable flutingirons next the sash was scornfully untied and tightened to suggest something resembling a waist the chastened bows that had been squat dowdy spiritless were given tweaks flirts bracing little pokes and dabs till acknowledging a master hand they stood up piquant pert smart alert pride of bearing was now infused into the flattened lace at the neck and a pin removed at some sacrifice from her own toilette was darned in at the back to prevent any cowardly lapsing the short white cotton gloves that called attention to the tanned wrist and arms were stripped off and put in her own pocket then the wreath of pinecones was adjusted at a heretofore unimagined angle the hair was pulled softly into a fluffy frame and finally as she met rebeccas grateful eyes she gave her two approving triumphant kisses in a second the sensitive face lighted into happiness pleased dimples appeared in the cheeks the kissed mouth was as red as a rose and the little fright that had walked behind the pinetree stepped out on the other side rebecca the lovely as to the relative value of miss dearborns accomplishments the decision must be left to the gentle reader but though it is certain that children should be properly grounded in mathematics no heart of flesh could bear to hear miss dearborns methods vilified who had seen her patting pulling squeezing rebecca from ugliness into beauty the young superintendent of district schools was a witness of the scene and when later he noted the children surrounding columbia as bees a honeysuckle he observed to dr moses she may not be much of a teacher but i think shed be considerable of a wife and subsequent events proved that he meant what he said ii now all was ready the moment of fate was absolutely at hand the fifeanddrum corps led the way and the states followed but what actually happened rebecca never knew she lived through the hours in a waking dream every little detail was a facet of light that reflected sparkles and among them all she was fairly dazzled the brass band played inspiring strains the mayor spoke eloquently on great themes the people cheered then the rope on which so much depended was put into the childrens hands they applied superhuman strength to their task and the flag mounted mounted smoothly and slowly and slowly unwound and stretched itself until its splendid size and beauty were revealed against the maples and pines and blue new england sky then after cheers upon cheers and after a patriotic chorus by the church choirs the state of maine mounted the platform vaguely conscious that she was to recite a poem though for the life of her she could not remember a single word speak up loud and clear rebecky whispered uncle sam in the front row but she could scarcely hear her own voice when tremblingly she began her first line after that she gathered strength and the poem said itself while the dream went on she saw adam ladd leaning against a tree aunt jane and aunt miranda palpitating with nervousness clara belle simpson gazing crosseyed but adoring from a seat on the side and in the far far distance on the very outskirts of the crowd a tall man standing in a wagon a tall loosejointed man with red upturned mustaches and a gaunt white horse headed toward the acreville road loud applause greeted the state of maine the slender little whiteclad figure standing on the mossy boulder that had been used as the centre of the platform the sun came up from behind a great maple and shone full on the starspangled banner making it more dazzling than ever so that its beauty drew all eyes upward abner simpson lifted his vagrant shifting gaze to its softy fluttering folds and its splendid massing of colors thinking i dont knows anybodyd ought to steal a flag the thunderin idjuts seem to set such store by it and what is it anyway nothin but a sheet o buntin nothing but a sheet of bunting he looked curiously at the rapt faces of the mothers their babies asleep in their arms the parted lips and shining eyes of the whiteclad girls at capn lord who had been in libby prison and nat strout who had left an arm at bull run at the friendly jostling crowd of farmers happy eager absorbed their throats ready to burst with cheers then the breeze served and he heard rebeccas clear voice saying for its your star my star all the stars together that make our countrys flag so proud to float in the bright fall weather talk about stars shes got a couple of em right in her head thought simpson if i ever seen a young one like that lyin on anybodys doorstep id hook her quickern

out by the day as the folks want me to id make bouts much n i dont knows it would be any harder he could see rebecca stepping down from the platform while his own redheaded little girl stood up on her bench waving her hat with one hand her handkerchief with the other and stamping with both feet now a man sitting beside the mayor rose from his chair and abner heard him call three cheers for the women who made the flag hip hip hurrah three cheers for the state of maine hip hip hurrah three cheers for the girl that saved the flag from the hands of the enemy hip hip hurrah hip hip hurrah it was the edgewood minister whose full vibrant voice was of the sort to move a crowd his words rang out into the clear air and were carried from lip to lip hands clapped feet stamped hats swung while the loud huzzahs might almost have wakened the echoes on old mount ossipee the tall loosejointed man sat down in the wagon suddenly and took up the reins theyre gettin a little mite personal and i guess its bout time for you to be goin simpson the tone was jocular but the red mustaches drooped and the halfhearted cut he gave to start the white mare on her homeward journey showed that he was not in his usual devilmaycare mood durn his skin he burst out in a vindictive undertone as the mare swung into her long gait its a lie i thought twas somebodys wash i haint an enemy while the crowd at the raising dispersed in happy family groups to their picnics in the woods while the goddess of liberty uncle sam columbia and the proud states lunched grandly in the grange hall with distinguished guests and scarred veterans of two wars the lonely man drove and drove and drove through silent woods and dull sleepy villages never alighting to replenish his wardrobe or his stock of swapping material at dusk he reached a miserable tumbledown house on the edge of a pond the faithful wife with the sad mouth and the habitual look of anxiety in her faded eyes came to the door at the sound of wheels and went doggedly to the horseshed to help him unharness you didnt expect to see me back tonight did ye he asked satirically leastwise not with this same horse well im here you neednt be scairt to look under the wagon seat there haint nothin there not even my supper so i hope youre suited for once no i guess i haint goin to be an angel right away neither there want nothin but flags layin roun loose down riverboro way n whatever they say i haint sech a hound as to steal a flag it was natural that young riverboro should have red white and blue dreams on the night after the new flag was raised a stranger thing perhaps is the fact that abner simpson should lie down on his hard bed with the flutter of bunting before his eyes and a whirl of unaccustomed words in his mind for its your star my star all our stars together im sick of goin it alone he thought i guess ill try the other road for a spell and with that he fell asleep seventh chronicle the little prophet i i guess york county will never get red of that simpson crew exclaimed miranda sawyer to jane i thought when the family moved to acreville wed seen the last of em but we aint the big crosseyed stutterin boy has got a place at the mills in maplewood thats near enough to come over to riverboro once in a while of a sunday mornin and set in the meetin house starin at rebecca same as he used to do only its reskier now both of em are older then mrs fogg must go and bring back the biggest girl to help her take care of her baby as if there want plenty of help nearer home now i hear say that the youngest twin has come to stop the summer with the cames up to edgewood lower corner i thought two twins were always the same age said rebecca reflectively as she came into the kitchen with the milk pail so they be snapped miranda flushing and correcting herself but that pastyfaced simpson twin looks younger and is smaller than the other one hes meek as moses and the other one is as bold as a brass kettle i dont see how they come to be twins they aint a mite alike elijah was always called the fighting twin at school said rebecca and elishas other name was nimbipamby but i think hes a nice little boy and im glad he has come back he wont like living with mr came but hell be almost next door to the ministers and mrs baxter is sure to let him play in her garden i wonder why the boys stayin with cassius came said jane to be sure they havent got any of their own but the childs too young to be much use i know why remarked rebecca promptly for i heard all about it over to watsons when i was getting the milk mr came traded something with mr simpson two years ago and got the best of the bargain and uncle jerry says hes the only man that ever did and he ought to have a monument put up to him so mr came owes mr simpson money and wont pay it and mr simpson said hed send over a child and board part of it out and take the rest in stock a pig or a calf or something thats all stuff and nonsense exclaimed miranda nothin in the world but storetalk you git a clump o menfolks settin round watsons stove or out on the bench at the door an theyll make up stories as fast as their tongues can wag the man dont live thats smart enough to cheat abner simpson in a trade and who ever heard of anybodys owin him money taint supposable that a woman like mrs came would allow her husband to be in debt to a man like abner simpson its a sight likelier that she heard that mrs simpson was ailin and sent for the boy so as to help the family along she always had mrs simpson to wash for her once a month if you remember jane there are some facts so shrouded in obscurity that the most skillful and patient investigator cannot drag them into the light of day there are also but only occasionally certain motives acts speeches lines of conduct that can never be wholly and satisfactorily explained even in a village postoffice or on the loafers bench outside the tavern door cassius came was a close man close of mouth and close of purse and all that riverboro ever knew as to the three months visit of the simpson twin was that it actually occurred elisha otherwise nimbipamby came nimbipamby stayed and nimbipamby when he finally rejoined his own domestic circle did not go emptyhanded so to speak for he was accompanied on his homeward travels by a large red bony somewhat truculent cow who was tied on behind the wagon and who made the journey a lively and eventful one by her total lack of desire to proceed over the road from edgewood to acreville but that the cows tale belongs to another time and place and the cowards tale must come first for elisha simpson was held to be sadly lacking in the manly quality of courage it was the new ministers wife who called nimbipamby the little prophet his full name was elisha jeremiah simpson but one seldom heard it at full length since if he escaped the ignominy of nimbipamby lishe was quite enough for an urchin just in his first trousers and those assumed somewhat prematurely he was lishe therefore to the village but the little prophet to the young ministers wife rebecca could see the cames brown farmhouse from mrs baxters sittingroom window the littletraveled road with strips of tufted green between the wheel tracks curled dustily up to the very doorstep and inside the screen door of pink mosquito netting was a wonderful drawnin rug shaped like a half pie with welcome in saffron letters on a green ground rebecca liked mrs cassius came who was a friend of her aunt mirandas and one of the few persons who exchanged calls with that somewhat unsociable lady the came farm was not a long walk from the brick house for rebecca could go across the fields when hayingtime was over and her delight at being sent on an errand in that direction could not be measured now that the new minister and his wife had grown to be such a resource in her life she liked to see mrs came shake the welcome rug flinging the cheery word out into the summer sunshine like a bright greeting to the day she liked to see her go to the screen door a dozen times in a morning open it a crack and chase an imaginary fly from the sacred precincts within she liked to see her come up the cellar steps into the side garden appearing mysteriously as from the bowels of the earth carrying a shining pan of milk in both hands and disappearing through the beds of hollyhocks and sunflowers to the pigpen or the henhouse rebecca was not fond of mr came and neither was mrs baxter nor elisha for that matter in fact mr came was rather a difficult person to grow fond of with his fiery red beard his freckled skin and his gruff way of speaking for there were no children in the brown house to smooth the creases from his forehead or the roughness from his voice ii the new ministers wife was sitting under the shade of her great maple early one morning when she first saw the little prophet a tiny figure came down the grassgrown road leading a cow by a rope if it had been a small boy and a small cow a middlesized boy and an ordinary cow or a grown man and a big cow she might not have noticed them but it was the combination of an infinitesimal boy and a huge cow that attracted her attention she could not guess the childs years she only knew that he was small for his age whatever it was the cow was a dark red beast with a crumpled horn a white star on her forehead and a large surprised sort of eye she had of course two eyes and both were surprised but the left one had an added hint of amazement in it by virtue of a few white hairs lurking accidentally in the centre of the eyebrow the boy had a thin sensitive face and curtly brown hair short trousers patched on both knees and a ragged straw hat on the back of his head he pattered along behind the cow sometimes holding the rope with both hands and getting over the ground in a jerky way as the animal left him no time to think of a smooth path for bare feet the came pasture was a good halfmile distant and the cow seemed in no hurry to reach it accordingly she forsook the road now and then and rambled in the hollows where the grass was sweeter to her way of thinking she started on one of these exploring expeditions just as she passed the ministers great maple and gave mrs baxter time to call out to the little fellow is that your cow elisha blushed and smiled and tried to speak modestly but there was a quiver of pride in his voice as he answered suggestively its nearly my cow how is that asked mrs baxter why mr came says when i drive her twentynine more times to pasture thout her gettin her foot over the rope or thout my bein afraid shes goin to be my truly cow are you fraid of cows yeees mrs baxter confessed i am just a little you see i am nothing but a woman and boys cant understand how we feel about cows i can theyre awful big things arent they perfectly enormous ive always thought a cow coming towards you one of the biggest things in the world yes me too dont lets think about it do they hook people so very often no indeed in fact one scarcely ever hears of such a case if they stepped on your bare foot theyd scrunch it wouldnt they yes but you are the driver you mustnt let them do that you are a freewill boy and they are nothing but cows i know but praps there is freewill cows and if they just would do it you couldnt help being scrunched for you mustnt let go of the rope nor run mr came says no of course that would never do where you used to live did all the cows go down into the boggy places when you drove em to pasture or did some walk in the road there werent any cows or any pastures where i used to live thats what makes me so foolish why does your cow need a rope she dont like to go to pasture mr came says sometimes shed druther stay to home and so when she gets part way she turns round and comes backwards dear me thought mrs baxter what becomes of this boymite if the cow has a spell of going backwards do you like to drive her she asked nno not erzackly but you see itll be my cow if i drive her twentynine more times thout her gettin her foot over the rope and thout my bein afraid and a beaming smile gave a transient brightness to his harassed little face will she feed in the ditch much longer he asked shall i say hurrap thats what mr came says hurrap like that and it means to hurry up it was rather a feeble warning that he sounded and the cow fed on peacefully the little fellow looked up at the ministers wife confidingly and then glanced back at the farm to see if cassius came were watching the progress of events what shall we do next he asked mrs baxter delighted in that warm cosy little we it took her into the firm so pleasantly she was a weak prop indeed when it came to cows but all the courage in her soul rose to arms when elisha said what shall we do next she became alert ingenious strong on the instant what is the cows name she asked sitting up straight in the swingchair buttercup but she dont seem to know it very well she aint a mite like a buttercup never mind you must shout buttercup at the top of your voice and twitch the rope hard then ill call hurrap with all my might at the same moment and if she starts quickly we mustnt run nor seem frightened they did this it worked to a charm and mrs baxter looked affectionately after her little prophet as the cow pulled him down tory hill the lovely august days wore on rebecca was often at the parsonage and saw elisha frequently but buttercup was seldom present at their interviews as the boy now drove her to the pasture very early in the morning the journey thither being one of considerable length and her method of reaching the goal being exceedingly roundabout mr came had pointed out the necessity of getting her into the pasture at least a few minutes before she had to be taken out again at night and though rebecca didnt like mr came she saw the common sense of this remark sometimes mrs baxter and rebecca caught a glimpse of the two at sundown as they returned from the pasture to the twilight milking buttercup chewing her peaceful cud her soft white bag of milk hanging full her surprised eye rolling in its accustomed fine frenzy the frenzied roll did not mean anything they used to assure elisha but if it didnt it was an awful pity she had to do it rebecca thought and mrs baxter agreed to have an expression of eye that meant murder and yet to be a perfectly virtuous and wellmeaning animal this was a calamity indeed mrs baxter was looking at the sun one evening as it dropped like a ball of red fire into wilkinss woods when the little prophet passed its the twentyninth night he called joyously i am so glad she answered for she had often feared some accident might prevent his claiming the promised reward then tomorrow buttercup will be your own cow i guess so thats what mr came said hes off to acreville now but hell be home tonight and fathers going to send my new hat by him when buttercups my own cow i wish i could change her name and call her red rover but praps her mother wouldnt like it when she blongs to me mebbe i wont be so fraid of gettin hooked and scrunched because shell know shes mine and shell go better i havent let her get snarled up in the rope one single time and i dont show im afraid do i i should never suspect it for an instant said mrs baxter encouragingly ive often envied you your bold brave look elisha appeared distinctly pleased i havent cried either when shes dragged me over the pasture bars and peeled my legs bill petess little brother charlie says he aint afraid of anything not even bears he says he would walk right up close and cuff em if they dared to yip but i aint like that he aint scared of elephants or tigers or lions either he says theyre all the same as frogs or chickens to him rebecca told her aunt miranda that evening that it was the prophets twentyninth night and that the big red cow was to be his on the morrow well i hope itll turn out that way she said but i aint a mite sure that cassius came will give up that cow when it comes to the point it wont be the first time hes tried to crawl out of a bargain with folks a good deal bigger than lisha for hes terrible close cassius is to be sure hes stiff in his joints and hes glad enough to have a boy to take the cow to the pasture in summer time but he always has hired help when it comes harvestin so lishall be no use from this on and i dare say the cow is abner simpsons anyway if you want a walk tonight i wish youd go up there and ask mis came if shell lend me an your aunt jane half her yeastcake tell her well pay it back when we get ours a saturday dont you want to take thirza meserve with you shes alone as usual while huldys entertainin beaux on the side porch dont stay too long at the parsonage iii rebecca was used to this sort of errand for the whole village of riverboro would sometimes be rocked to the very centre of its being by simultaneous desire for a yeastcake as the nearest repository was a mile and a half distant as the yeastcake was valued at two cents and wouldnt keep as the demand was uncertain being dependent entirely on a fluctuating desire for riz bread the storekeeper refused to order more than three yeastcakes a day at his own risk sometimes they remained on his hands a dead loss sometimes eight or ten persons would hitch up and drive from distant farms for the coveted article only to be met with the flat no im all out o yeastcake mis simmons took the last mebbe you can borry half o hern she haint much of a breadeater so rebecca climbed the hills to mrs cames knowing that her daily bread depended on the successful issue of the call thirza was barefooted and tough as her little feet were the long walk over the stubble fields tired her when they came within sight of the came barn she coaxed rebecca to take a short cut through the turnips growing in long beautifully weeded rows you know mr came is awfully cross thirza and cant bear anybody to tread on his crops or touch a tree or a bush that belongs to him im kind of afraid but come along and mind you step softly in between the rows and hold up your petticoat so you cant possibly touch the turnip plants ill do the same skip along fast because then we wont leave any deep footprints the children passed safely and noiselessly along their pleasure a trifle enhanced by the felt dangers of their progress rebecca knew that they were doing no harm but that did not prevent her hoping to escape the gimlet eye of mr came as they neared the outer edge of the turnip patch they paused suddenly petticoats in air a great clump of elderberry bushes hid them from the barn but from the other side of the clump came the sound of conversation the timid voice of the little prophet and the gruff tones of cassius came rebecca was afraid to interrupt and too honest to wish to overhear she could only hope the man and the boy would pass on to the house as they talked so she motioned to the paralyzed thirza to take two more steps and stand with her behind the elderberry bushes but no in a moment they heard mr came drag a stool over beside the grindstone as he said well now elisha jeremiah well talk about the red cow you say youve drove her a month do ye and the trade between us was that if you could drive her a month without her getting the rope over her foot and without bein afraid you was to have her thats straight aint it the prophets face burned with excitement his gingham shirt rose and fell as if he were breathing hard but he only nodded assent and said nothing now continued mr came have you made out to keep the rope from under her feet she aint got tttangled up one ssingle time said elisha stuttering in his excitement but looking up with some courage from his bare toes with which he was assiduously threading the grass so far so good now bout bein afraid as you seem so certain of gettin the cow i suppose you haint been a speck scared hev you honor bright now i i not but just a little mite i hold up a minute of course you didnt say you was afraid and didnt show you was afraid and nobody knew you was afraid but that aint the way we fixed it up you was to call the cow yourn if you could drive her to the pasture for a month without bein afraid own up square now hev you ben afraid a long pause then a faint yes wheres your manners i mean yes sir how often if it haint ben too many times mebbe ill let ye off though youre a reglar girlboy andll be runnin away from the cat bimeby has it ben twice yes and the little prophets voice was very faint now and had a decided tear in it yes what yes sir has it ben four times yes sir more heaving of the gingham shirt well you air a thunderin coward how many times speak up now more digging of the bare toes in the earth and one premonitory tear drop stealing from under the downcast lids then a little most every day and you can keep the cow wailed the prophet as he turned abruptly and fled behind the shed where he flung himself into the green depths of a tansy bed and gave himself up to unmanly sobs cassius came gave a sort of shamefaced guffaw at the abrupt departure of the boy and went on into the house while rebecca and thirza made a stealthy circuit of the barn and a polite and circumspect entrance through the parsonage front gate rebecca told the ministers wife what she could remember of the interview between cassius came and elisha simpson and tenderhearted mrs baxter longed to seek and comfort her little prophet sobbing in the tansy bed the brand of coward on his forehead and what was much worse the fear in his heart that he deserved it rebecca could hardly be prevented from bearding mr came and openly espousing the cause of elisha for she was an impetuous reckless valiant creature when a weaker vessel was attacked or threatened unjustly mrs baxter acknowledged that mr came had been true in a way to his word and bargain but she confessed that she had never heard of so cruel and hard a bargain since the days of shylock and it was all the worse for being made with a child rebecca hurried home her visit quite spoiled and her errand quite forgotten till she reached the brick house door where she told her aunts with her customary picturesqueness of speech that she would rather eat buttermilk bread till she died than partake of food mixed with one of mr cames yeastcakes that it would choke her even in the shape of good raised bread thats all very fine rebecky said her aunt miranda who had a pinprick for almost every bubble but dont forget theres two other mouths to feed in this house and you might at least give your aunt and me the privilege of chokin if we feel to want to iv mrs baxter finally heard from mrs came through whom all information was sure to filter if you gave it time that her husband despised a coward that he considered elisha a regular mothersapronstring boy and that he was learnin him to be brave bill peters the hired man now drove buttercup to pasture though whenever mr came went to moderation or bonnie eagle as he often did mrs baxter noticed that elisha took the hired mans place she often joined him on these anxious expeditions and a like terror in both their souls they attempted to train the red cow and give her some idea of obedience if she only wouldnt look at us that way we would get along real nicely with her wouldnt we prattled the prophet straggling along by her side and she is a splendid cow she gives twentyone quarts a day and mr came says its moren half cream the ministers wife assented to all this thinking that if buttercup would give up her habit of turning completely round in the road to roll her eyes and elevate her whitetipped eyebrow she might indeed be an enjoyable companion but in her present state of development her society was not agreeable even did she give sixtyone quarts of milk a day furthermore when mrs baxter discovered that she never did any of these reprehensible things with bill peters she began to believe cows more intelligent creatures than she had supposed them to be and she was indignant to think buttercup could count so confidently on the weakness of a small boy and a timid woman one evening when buttercup was more than usually exasperating mrs baxter said to the prophet who was bracing himself to keep from being pulled into a wayside brook where buttercup loved to dabble elisha do you know anything about the superiority of mind over matter no he didnt though it was not a fair time to ask the question for he had sat down in the road to get a better purchase on the rope well it doesnt signify what i mean is that we can die but once and it is a glorious thing to die for a great principle give me that rope i can pull like an ox in my present frame of mind you run down on the opposite side of the brook take that big stick wade right in you are barefooted brandish the stick and if necessary do more than brandish i would go myself but it is better she should recognize you as her master and i am in as much danger as you are anyway she may try to hook you of course but you must keep waving the stick die brandishing prophet thats the idea she may turn and run for me in which case i shall run too but i shall die running and the minister can bury us under our favorite sweetapple tree the prophets soul was fired by the lovely ladys eloquence their spirits mounted simultaneously and they were flushed with a splendid courage in which death looked a mean and paltry thing compared with vanquishing that cow she had already stepped into the pool but the prophet waded in towards her moving the alder branch menacingly she looked up with the familiar roll of the eye that had done her such good service all summer but she quailed beneath the stern justice and the new valor of the prophets gaze in that moment perhaps she felt ashamed of the misery she had caused the helpless mite at any rate actuated by fear surprise or remorse she turned and walked back into the road without a sign of passion or indignation leaving the boy and the lady rather disappointed at their easy victory to be prepared for a violent death and receive not even a scratch made them fear that they might possibly have overestimated the danger they were better friends than ever after that the young ministers wife and the forlorn little boy from acreville sent away from home he knew not why unless it were that there was little to eat there and considerably more at the cash cames as they were called in edgewood cassius was familiarly known as uncle cash partly because there was a disposition in edgewood to abbreviate all christian names and partly because the old man paid cash and expected to be paid cash for everything the late summer grew into autumn and the ministers great maple flung a flaming bough of scarlet over mrs baxters swingchair uncle cash found elisha very useful at picking up potatoes and apples but the boy was going back to his family as soon as the harvesting was over one friday evening mrs baxter and rebecca wrapped in shawls and fascinators were sitting on mrs cames front steps enjoying the sunset rebecca was in a tremulous state of happiness for she had come directly from the seminary at wareham to the parsonage and as the minister was absent at a church conference she was to stay the night with mrs baxter and go with her to portland next day they were to go to the islands have ice cream for luncheon ride on a horsecar and walk by the longfellow house a programme that so unsettled rebeccas never very steady mind that she radiated flashes and sparkles of joy making mrs baxter wonder if flesh could be translucent enabling the spiritfires within to shine through buttercup was being milked on the grassy slope near the shed door as she walked to the barn after giving up her pailfuls of yellow milk she bent her neck and snatched a hasty bite from a pile of turnips lying temptingly near in her haste she took more of a mouthful than would be considered good manners even among cows and as she disappeared in the barn door they could see a forest of green tops hanging from her mouth while she painfully attempted to grind up the mass of stolen material without allowing a single turnip to escape it grew dark soon afterward and they went into the house to see mrs cames new lamp lighted for the first time to examine her last drawnin rug a wonderful achievement produced entirely from dyed flannel petticoats and to hear the doctors wife play oft in the still night on the dulcimer as they closed the sittingroom door opening on the piazza facing the barn the women heard the cow coughing and said to one another buttercup was too greedy and now she has indigestion elisha always went to bed at sundown and uncle cash had gone to the doctors to have his hand dressed for he had hurt it is some way in the threshingmachine bill peters the hired man came in presently and asked for him saying that the cow coughed more and more and it must be that something was wrong but he could not get her to open her mouth wide enough for him to see anything shed up an die ruther n obleege anybody that tarnal ugly cow would he said when uncle cash had driven into the yard he came in for a lantern and went directly out to the barn after a halfhour or so in which the little party had forgotten the whole occurrence he came in again im blamed if we aint goin to lose that cow he said come out will ye hannah and hold the lantern i cant do anything with my right hand in a sling and bill is the stupidest critter in the country everybody went out to the barn accordingly except the doctors wife who ran over to her house to see if her brother moses had come home from milltown and could come and take a hand in the exercises buttercup was in a bad way there was no doubt of it something one of the turnips presumably had lodged in her throat and would move neither way despite her attempts to dislodge it her breathing was labored and her eyes bloodshot from straining and choking once or twice they succeeded in getting her mouth partly open but before they could fairly discover the cause of trouble she had wrested her head away i can see a little tuft of green sticking straight up in the middle said uncle cash while bill peters and moses held a lantern on each side of buttercups head but land its so far down and such a mite of a thing i couldnt git it even if i could use my right hand spose you try bill bill hemmed and hawed and confessed he didnt care to try buttercups grinders were of good size and excellent quality and he had no fancy for leaving his hand within her jaws he said he was no good at that kind of work but that he would help uncle cash hold the cows head that was just as necessary and considerable safer moses was more inclined to the service of humanity and did his best wrapping his wrist in a cloth and making desperate but ineffectual dabs at the slippery green turniptops in the reluctantly opened throat but the cow tossed her head and stamped her feet and switched her tail and wriggled from under bills hands so that it seemed altogether impossible to reach the seat of the trouble uncle cash was in despair fuming and fretting the more because of his own crippled hand hitch up bill he said and hannah you drive over to millikens mills for the horsedoctor i know we can git out that turnip if we can hit on the right tools and somebody to manage em right but weve got to be quick about it or the critterll choke to death sure your hands so clumsy mose she thinks her times come when she feels it in her mouth and your fingers are so big you cant ketch holt o that green stuff thout its slippin mine aint big let me try said a timid voice and turning round they saw little elisha simpson his trousers pulled on over his nightshirt his curly hair ruffled his eyes vague with sleep uncle cash gave a laugh of goodhumored derision you thats afraid to drive a cow to pasture no sir you haint got sand enough for this job i guess buttercup just then gave a worse cough than ever and her eyes rolled in her head as if she were giving up the ghost id rather do it than see her choke to death cried the boy in despair then by ginger you can try it sonny said uncle cash now this time well tie her head up take it slow and make a good job of it accordingly they pried poor buttercups jaws open to put a wooden gag between them tied her head up and kept her as still as they could while the women held the lanterns now sonny strip up your sleeve and reach as fur downs you can wind your little fingers in among that green stuff stickin up there that aint hardly big enough to call green stuff give it a twist and pull for all youre worth land what a skinny little pipe stem the little prophet had stripped up his sleeve it was a slender thing his arm but he had driven the red cow all summer borne her tantrums protected her from the consequences of her own obstinacy taking as he thought a future owners pride in her splendid flow of milk grown fond of her in a word and now she was choking to death a skinny little pipe stem is capable of a deal at such a time and only a slender hand and arm could have done the work elisha trembled with nervousness but he made a dexterous and dashing entrance into the awful cavern of buttercups mouth descended upon the tiny clump of green spills or spikes wound his little fingers in among them as firmly as he could and then gave a long steady determined pull with all the strength in this body that was not so much in itself to be sure but he borrowed a good deal more from some reserve quarter the location of which nobody knows anything about but upon which everybody draws in time of need such a valiant pull you would never have expected of the little prophet such a pull it was that to his own utter amazement he suddenly found himself lying flat on his back on the barn floor with a very slippery something in his hand and a fairsized but rather dilapidated turnip at the end of it thats the business cried moses i could a done it as easy as nothin if my arm had been a leetle mite smaller said bill peters youre a trump sonny exclaimed uncle cash as he helped moses untie buttercups head and took the gag out youre a trump lisha and by ginger the cows yourn only dont you let your blessed pa drink none of her cream the welcome air rushed into buttercups lungs and cooled her parched torn throat she was pretty nearly spent poor thing and bent her head rather gently for her over the little prophets shoulder as he threw his arms joyfully about her neck and whispered youre my truly cow now aint you buttercup mrs baxter dear said rebecca as they walked home to the parsonage together under the young harvest moon there are all sorts of cowards arent there and dont you think elisha is one of the best kind i dont quite know what to think about cowards rebecca rowena said the ministers wife hesitatingly the little prophet is the third coward i have known in my short life who turned out to be a hero when the real testing time came meanwhile the heroes themselves or the ones that were taken for heroes were always busy doing something or being somewhere else eighth chronicle abner simpsons new leaf rebecca had now cut the bonds that bound her to the riverboro district school and had been for a week a fullfledged pupil at the wareham seminary towards which goal she had been speeding ever since the memorable day when she rode into riverboro on the top of uncle jerry cobbs stagecoach and told him that education was intended to be the making of her she went to and fro with emma jane and the other riverboro boys and girls on the morning and evening trains that ran between the academy town and millikens mills the six days had passed like a dream a dream in which she sat in corners with her eyes cast down flushed whenever she was addressed stammered whenever she answered a question and nearly died of heart failure when subjected to an examination of any sort she delighted the committee when reading at sight from king lear but somewhat discouraged them when she could not tell the capital of the united states she admitted that her former teacher miss dearborn might have mentioned it but if so she had not remembered it in these first weeks among strangers she passed for nothing but an interestinglooking timid innocent country child never revealing even to the farseeing emily maxwell a hint of her originality facility or power in any direction rebecca was fourteen but so slight and under the paralyzing new conditions so shy that she would have been mistaken for twelve had it not been for her general advancement in the school curriculum growing up in the solitude of a remote farm house transplanted to a tiny village where she lived with two elderly spinsters she was still the veriest child in all but the practical duties and responsibilities of life in those she had long been a woman it was saturday afternoon her lessons for monday were all learned and she burst into the brick house sittingroom with the flushed face and embarrassed mien that always foreshadowed a request requests were more commonly answered in the negative than in the affirmative at the brick house a fact that accounted for the slight confusion in her demeanor aunt miranda she began the fishman says that clara belle simpson wants to see me very much but mrs fogg cant spare her long at a time you know on account of the baby being no better but clara belle could walk a mile up and i a mile down the road and we could meet at the pink house half way then we could rest and talk an hour or so and both be back in time for our suppers ive fed the cat she had no appetite as its only two oclock and she had her dinner at noon but shell go back to her saucer and its off my mind i could go down cellar now and bring up the cookies and the pie and doughnuts for supper before i start aunt jane saw no objection but we thought id better ask you so as to run no risks miranda sawyer who had been patiently waiting for the end of this speech laid down her knitting and raised her eyes with a halfresigned expression that meant is there anything unusual in heaven or earth or the waters under the earth that this child does not want to do will she ever settle down to plain comprehensible sawyer ways or will she to the end make these sudden and radical propositions suggesting at every turn the irresponsible randall ancestry you know well enough rebecca that i dont like you to be intimate with abner simpsons young ones she said decisively they aint fit company for anybody thats got sawyer blood in their veins if its ever so little i dont know im sure how youre goin to turn out the fish peddler seems to be your best friend without its abijah flagg that youre everlastingly talkin to lately i should think youd rather read some improvin book than to be chatterin with squire beans choreboy he isnt always going to be a choreboy explained rebecca and thats what were considering its his career we talk about and he hasnt got any father or mother to advise him besides clara belle kind of belongs to the village now that she lives with mrs fogg and she was always the best behaved of all the girls either in school or sundayschool children cant help having fathers everybody says abner is turning over a new leaf and if so the familyd ought to be encouraged every possible way said miss jane entering the room with her mending basket in hand if abner simpson is turnin over a leaf or anythin else in creation its only to see whats on the under side remarked miss miranda promptly dont talk to me about new leaves you cant change that kind of a man he is what he is and you cant make him no different the grace of god can do considrable observed jane piously i aint sayin but it can if it sets out but it has to begin early and stay late on a man like simpson now mirandy abner aint moren forty i dont know what the average age for repentance is in menfolks but when you think of what an awful sight of em leaves it to their deathbeds forty seems real kind of young not that ive heard abner has experienced religion but everybodys surprised at the good way hes conductin this fall theyll be surprised the other way round when they come to miss their firewood and apples and potatoes again affirmed miranda clara belle dont seem to have inherited from her father jane ventured again timidly no wonder mrs fogg sets such store by the girl if it hadnt been for her the baby would have been dead by now perhaps tryin to save it was interferin with the lords will was mirandas retort folks cant stop to figure out just whats the lords will when a child has upset a kettle of scalding water on to himself and as she spoke jane darned more excitedly mrs fogg knows well enough she hadnt ought to have left that baby alone in the kitchen with the stove even if she did see clara belle comin across lots shed ought to have waited before drivin off but of course she was afraid of missing the train and shes too good a woman to be held accountable the ministers wife says clara belle is a real i cant think of the word chimed in rebecca whats the female of hero whatever it is thats what mrs baxter called her clara belles the female of simpson thats what she is miss miranda asserted but shes been brought up to use her wits and i aint sayin but she used em i should say she did exclaimed miss jane to put that screaming suffering child in the babycarriage and run all the way to the doctors when there wasnt a soul on hand to advise her two or three more such actions would make the simpson name sound considrable sweeter in this neighborhood simpson will always sound like simpson to me vouchsafed the elder sister but weve talked enough about em an to spare you can go along rebecca but remember that a child is known by the company she keeps all right aunt miranda thank you cried rebecca leaping from the chair on which she had been twisting nervously for five minutes and how does this strike you would you be in favor of my taking clara belle a companytart dont mrs fogg feed the young one now shes taken her right into the family oh yes rebecca answered she has lovely things to eat and mrs fogg wont even let her drink skim milk but i always feel that taking a present lets the person know youve been thinking about them and are extra glad to see them besides unless we have company soon those tarts will have to be eaten by the family and a new batch made you remember the one i had when i was rewarding myself last week that was queer but nice she added hastily mebbe you could think of something of your own you could give away without taking my tarts responded miranda tersely the joints of her armor having been pierced by the fatally keen tongue of her niece who had insinuated that companytarts lasted a long time in the brick house this was a fact indeed the companytart was so named not from any idea that it would ever be eaten by guests but because it was too good for everyday use rebeccas face crimsoned with shame that she had drifted into an impolite and what was worse an apparently ungrateful speech i didnt mean to say anything not nice aunt miranda she stammered truly the tart was splendid but not exactly like new thats all and oh i know what i can take clara belle a few chocolate drops out of the box mr ladd gave me on my birthday you go down cellar and get that tart same as i told you commanded miranda and when you fill it dont uncover a new tumbler of jelly theres some driedapple preserves open thatll do wear your rubbers and your thick jacket after runnin all the way down there for your legs never seem to be rigged for walkin like other girls youll set down on some damp stone or other and ketch your death o cold an your aunt jane n ill be kep up nights nursin you and luggin your meals upstairs to you on a waiter here miranda leaned her head against the back of her rocking chair dropped her knitting and closed her eyes wearily for when the immovable body is opposed by the irresistible force there is a certain amount of jar and disturbance involved in the operation rebecca moved toward the side door shooting a questioning glance at aunt jane as she passed the look was full of mysterious suggestion and was accompanied by an almost imperceptible gesture miss jane knew that certain articles were kept in the entry closet and by this time she had become sufficiently expert in telegraphy to know that rebeccas unspoken query meant could you permit the hat with the red wings it being saturday fine settled weather and a pleasure excursion these confidential requests though fraught with embarrassment when miranda was in the room gave jane much secret joy there was something about them that stirred her spinster heart they were so gay so appealing so unsawyer unriverborolike the longer rebecca lived in the brick house the more her aunt jane marveled at the child what made her so different from everybody else could it be that her graceless popinjay of a father lorenzo de medici randall had bequeathed her some strange combination of gifts instead of fortune her eyes her brows the color of her lips the shape of her face as well as her ways and words proclaimed her a changeling in the sawyer tribe but what an enchanting changeling bringing wit and nonsense and color and delight into the gray monotony of the dragging years there was frost in the air but a bright cheery sun as rebecca walked decorously out of the brick house yard emma jane perkins was away over sunday on a visit to a cousin in moderation alice robinson and candace milliken were having measles and riverboro was very quiet still life was seldom anything but a gay adventure to rebecca and she started afresh every morning to its conquest she was not exacting the asmodean feat of spinning a sand heap into twine was poetically speaking always in her power so the mile walk to the pinkhouse gate and the tryst with freckled redhaired clara belle simpson whose face miss miranda said looked like a raw pie in a brick oven these commonplace incidents were sufficiently exhilarating to brighten her eye and quicken her step as the great bare horsechestnut near the pinkhouse gate loomed into view the red linseywoolsey speck going down the road spied the blue linseywoolsey speck coming up and both specks flew over the intervening distance and meeting embraced each other ardently somewhat to the injury of the companytart didnt it come out splendidly exclaimed rebecca i was so afraid the fishman wouldnt tell you to start exactly at two or that one of us would walk faster than the other but we met at the very spot it was a very uncommon idea wasnt it almost romantic and what do you think asked clara belle proudly look at this mrs fogg lent me her watch to come home by oh clara belle how wonderful mrs fogg gets kinder and kinder to you doesnt she youre not homesick any more are you noo not really only when i remember theres only little susan to manage the twins though theyre getting on real well without me but i kind of think rebecca that im going to be given away to the foggs for good do you mean adopted yes i think fathers going to sign papers you see we cant tell how many years itll be before the poor baby outgrows its burns and mrs foggll never be the same again and she must have somebody to help her youll be their real daughter then wont you clara belle and mr fogg is a deacon and a selectman and a road commissioner and everything splendid yes ill have board and clothes and school and be named fogg and here her voice sank to an awed whisper the upper farm if i should ever get married miss dearborn told me that herself when she was persuading me not to mind being given away clara belle simpson exclaimed rebecca in a transport whod have thought youd be a female hero and an heiress besides its just like a book story and it happened in riverboro ill make uncle jerry cobb allow there can be riverboro stories you see if i dont of course i know its all right clara belle replied soberly ill have a good home and father cant keep us all but its kind of dreadful to be given away like a piano or a horse and carriage rebeccas hand went out sympathetically to clara belles freckled paw suddenly her own face clouded and she whispered im not sure clara belle but im given away too do you spose i am poor father left us in debt you see i thought i came away from sunnybrook to get an education and then help pay off the mortgage but mother doesnt say anything about my coming back and our familys one of those toobig ones you know just like yours did your mother sign papers to your aunts if she did i never heard anything about it but theres something pinned on to the mortgage that mother keeps in the drawer of the bookcase youd know it if twas adoption papers i guess youre just lent clara belle said cheeringly i dont believe anybodyd ever give you away and oh rebecca fathers getting on so well he works on dalys farm where they raise lots of horses and cattle too and he breaks all the young colts and trains them and swaps off the poor ones and drives all over the country daly told mr fogg he was splendid with stock and father says its just like play hes sent home money three saturday nights im so glad exclaimed rebecca sympathetically now your motherll have a good time and a black silk dress wont she i dont know sighed clara belle and her voice was grave ever since i can remember shes just washed and cried and cried and washed miss dearborn has been spending her vacation up to acreville you know and she came yesterday to board next door to mrs foggs i heard them talking last night when i was getting the baby to sleep i couldnt help it they were so close and miss dearborn said mother doesnt like acreville she says nobody takes any notice of her and they dont give her any more work mrs fogg said well they were dreadful stiff and particular up that way and they liked women to have wedding rings hasnt your mother got a wedding ring asked rebecca astonished why i thought everybody had to have them just as they do sofas and a kitchen stove i never noticed she didnt have one but when they spoke i remembered mothers hands washing and wringing and she doesnt wear one i know she hasnt got any jewelry not even a breastpin rebeccas tone was somewhat censorious your fathers been so poor perhaps he couldnt afford breastpins but i should have thought hed have given your mother a wedding ring when they were married thats the time to do it right at the very first they didnt have any real church dressup wedding explained clara belle extenuatingly you see the first mother mine had the big boys and me and then she died when we were little then after a while this mother came to housekeep and she stayed and by and by she was mrs simpson and susan and the twins and the baby are hers and she and father didnt have time for a regular wedding in church they dont have veils and bridesmaids and refreshments round here like miss dearborns sister did do they cost a great deal wedding rings asked rebecca thoughtfully theyre solid gold so i spose they do if they were cheap we might buy one ive got seventyfour cents saved up how much have you fiftythree clara belle responded in a depressing tone and anyway there are no stores nearer than milltown wed have to buy it secretly for i wouldnt make father angry or shame his pride now hes got steady work and mother would know i had spent all my savings rebecca looked nonplussed i declare she said i think the acreville people must be perfectly horrid not to call on your mother only because she hasnt got any jewelry you wouldnt dare tell your father what miss dearborn heard so hed save up and buy the ring no i certainly would not and clara belles lips closed tightly and decisively rebecca sat quietly for a few moments then she exclaimed jubilantly i know where we could get it from mr aladdin and then i neednt tell him who its for hes coming to stay over tomorrow with his aunt and ill ask him to buy a ring for us in boston i wont explain anything you know ill just say i need a wedding ring that would be perfectly lovely replied clara belle a look of hope dawning in her eyes and we can think afterwards how to get it over to mother perhaps you could send it to father instead but i wouldnt dare to do it myself you wont tell anybody rebecca cross my heart rebecca exclaimed dramatically and then with a reproachful look you know i couldnt repeat a sacred secret like that shall we meet next saturday afternoon and i tell you whats happened why clara belle isnt that mr ladd watering his horse at the foot of the hill this very minute it is and hes driven up from milltown stead of coming on the train from boston to edgewood hes all alone and i can ride home with him and ask him about the ring right away clara belle kissed rebecca fervently and started on her homeward walk while rebecca waited at the top of the long hill fluttering her handkerchief as a signal mr aladdin mr aladdin she cried as the horse and wagon came nearer adam ladd drew up quickly at the sound of the eager young voice well well here is rebecca rowena fluttering along the highroad like a redwinged blackbird are you going to fly home or drive with me rebecca clambered into the carriage laughing and blushing with delight at his nonsense and with joy at seeing him again clara belle and i were just talking about you this minute and im so glad you came this way for theres something very important to ask you about she began rather breathlessly no doubt laughed adam ladd who had become in the course of his acquaintance with rebecca a sort of high court of appeals i hope the premium banquet lamp doesnt smoke as it grows older now mr aladdin you will not remember nicely mr simpson swapped off the banquet lamp when he was moving the family to acreville its not the lamp at all but once when you were here last time you said youd make up your mind what you were going to give me for christmas well and i do remember that much quite nicely well is it bought no i never buy christmas presents before thanksgiving then dear mr aladdin would you buy me something different something that i want to give away and buy it a little sooner than christmas that depends i dont relish having my christmas presents given away i like to have them kept forever in little girls bureau drawers all wrapped in pink tissue paper but explain the matter and perhaps ill change my mind what is it you want i need a wedding ring dreadfully said rebecca but its a sacred secret adam ladds eyes flashed with surprise and he smiled to himself with pleasure had he on his list of acquaintances he asked himself a person of any age or sex so altogether irresistible and unique as this child then he turned to face her with the merry teasing look that made him so delightful to young people i thought it was perfectly understood between us he said that if you could ever contrive to grow up and i were willing to wait that i was to ride up to the brick house on my snow white coal black corrected rebecca with a sparkling eye and a warning finger coal black charger put a golden circlet on your lily white finger draw you up behind me on my pillion and emma jane too rebecca interrupted i think i didnt mention emma jane argued mr aladdin three on a pillion is very uncomfortable i think emma jane leaps on the back of a prancing chestnut and we all go off to my castle in the forest emma jane never leaps and shed be afraid of a prancing chestnut objected rebecca then she shall have a gentle creamcolored pony but now without any explanation you ask me to buy you a wedding ring which shows plainly that you are planning to ride off on a snow white i mean coal black charger with somebody else rebecca dimpled and laughed with joy at the nonsense in her prosaic world no one but adam ladd played the game and answered the fool according to his folly nobody else talked delicious fairystory twaddle but mr aladdin the ring isnt for me she explained carefully you know very well that emma jane nor i cant be married till were through quackenboss grammar greenleafs arithmetic and big enough to wear long trails and run a sewing machine the ring is for a friend why doesnt the groom give it to his bride himself because hes poor and kind of thoughtless and anyway she isnt a bride any more she has three step and three other kind of children adam ladd put the whip back in the socket thoughtfully and then stooped to tuck in the rug over rebeccas feet and his own when he raised his head again he asked why not tell me a little more rebecca im safe rebecca looked at him feeling his wisdom and strength and above all his sympathy then she said hesitatingly you remember i told you all about the simpsons that day on your aunts porch when you bought the soap because i told you how the family were always in trouble and how much they needed a banquet lamp mr simpson clara belles father has always been very poor and not always very good a little bit thievish you know but oh so pleasant and nice to talk to and now hes turning over a new leaf and everybody in riverboro liked mrs simpson when she came here a stranger because they were sorry for her and she was so patient and such a hard worker and so kind to the children but where she lives now though they used to know her when she was a girl theyre not polite to her and dont give her scrubbing and washing and clara belle heard our teacher say to mrs fogg that the acreville people were stiff and despised her because she didnt wear a wedding ring like all the rest and clara belle and i thought if they were so mean as that wed love to give her one and then shed be happier and have more work and perhaps mr simpson if he gets along better will buy her a breastpin and earrings and shell be fitted out like the others i know mrs peter meserve is looked up to by everybody in edgewood on account of her gold bracelets and moss agate necklace adam turned again to meet the luminous innocent eyes that glowed under the delicate brows and long lashes feeling as he had more than once felt before as if his worldlywise grownup thoughts had been bathed in some purifying spring how shall you send the ring to mrs simpson he asked with interest we havent settled yet clara belles afraid to do it and thinks i could manage better will the ring cost much because of course if it does i must ask aunt jane first there are things i have to ask aunt miranda and others that belong to aunt jane it costs the merest trifle ill buy one and bring it to you and well consult about it but i think as youre great friends with mr simpson youd better send it to him in a letter letters being your strong point its a present a man ought to give his own wife but its worth trying rebecca you and clara belle can manage it between you and ill stay in the background where nobody will see me ninth chronicle the green isle many a green isle needs must be in the deep sea of misery or the mariner worn and wan never thus could voyage on day and night and night and day drifting on his weary way shelley meantime in these frosty autumn days life was crowded with events in the lonely simpson house at acreville the tumbledown dwelling stood on the edge of plineys pond so called because old colonel richardson left his lands to be divided in five equal parts each share to be chosen in turn by one of his five sons pliny the eldest having priority of choice pliny richardson having little taste for farming and being ardently fond of fishing rowing and swimming acted up to his reputation of being a little mite odd and took his whole twenty acres in water hence plinys pond the eldest simpson boy had been working on a farm in cumberland county for two years samuel generally dubbed seesaw had lately found a humble place in a shingle mill and was partially selfsupporting clara belle had been adopted by the foggs thus there were only three mouths to fill the capacious ones of elijah and elisha the twin boys and of lisping nineyearold susan the capable houseworker and mothers assistant for the baby had died during the summer died of discouragement at having been born into a family unprovided with food or money or love or care or even with desire for or appreciation of babies there was no doubt that the erratic father of the house had turned over a new leaf exactly when he began or how or why or how long he would continue the praiseworthy process in a word whether there would be more leaves turned as the months went on mrs simpson did not know and it is doubtful if any authority lower than that of mr simpsons maker could have decided the matter he had stolen articles for swapping purposes for a long time but had often avoided detection and always escaped punishment until the last few years three fines imposed for small offenses were followed by several arrests and two imprisonments for brief periods and he found himself wholly out of sympathy with the wages of sin sin itself he did not especially mind but the wages thereof were decidedly unpleasant and irksome to him he also minded very much the isolated position in the community which had lately become his for he was a social being and would almost rather not steal from a neighbor than have him find it out and cease intercourse this feeling was working in him and rendering him unaccountably irritable and depressed when he took his daughter over to riverboro at the time of the great flagraising there are seasons of refreshment as well as seasons of drought in the spiritual as in the natural world and in some way or other dews and rains of grace fell upon abner simpsons heart during that brief journey perhaps the giving away of a child that he could not support had made the soil of his heart a little softer and readier for planting than usual but when he stole the new flag off mrs peter meserves doorsteps under the impression that the cottoncovered bundle contained freshly washed clothes he unconsciously set certain forces in operation it will be remembered that rebecca saw an inch of red bunting peeping from the back of his wagon and asked the pleasure of a drive with him she was no daughter of the regiment but she proposed to follow the flag when she diplomatically requested the return of the sacred object which was to be the glory of the raising next day and he thus discovered his mistake he was furious with himself for having slipped into a disagreeable predicament and later when he unexpectedly faced a detachment of riverboro society at the crossroads and met not only their wrath and scorn but the reproachful disappointed glance of rebeccas eyes he felt degraded as never before the night at the centre tavern did not help matters nor the jolly patriotic meeting of the three villages at the flagraising next morning he would have enjoyed being at the head and front of the festive preparations but as he had cut himself off from all such friendly gatherings he intended at any rate to sit in his wagon on the very outskirts of the assembled crowd and see some of the gayety for heaven knows he had little enough he who loved talk and song and story and laughter and excitement the flag was raised the crowd cheered the little girl to whom he had lied the girl who was impersonating the state of maine was on the platform speaking her piece and he could just distinguish some of the words she was saying for its your star my star all the stars together that makes our countrys flag so proud to float in the bright fall weather then suddenly there was a clarion voice cleaving the air and he saw a tall man standing in the centre of the stage and heard him crying three cheers for the girl that saved the flag from the hands of the enemy he was sore and bitter enough already lonely isolated enough with no lot nor share in the honest community life no hand to shake no neighbors meal to share and this unexpected public arraignment smote him between the eyes with resentment newly kindled pride wounded vanity bleeding he flung a curse at the joyous throng and drove toward home the home where he would find his ragged children and meet the timid eyes of a woman who had been the loyal partner of his poverty and disgraces it is probable that even then his extremely light hand was already on the new leaf the angels doubtless were not especially proud of the matter and manner of his reformation but i dare say they were glad to count him theirs on any terms so difficult is the reformation of this blind and foolish world they must have been for they immediately flung into his very lap a profitable and what is more to the point an interesting and agreeable situation where money could be earned by doing the very things his nature craved there were feats of daring to be performed in sight of admiring and applauding stable boys the horses he loved were his companions he was obliged to swap for daly his employer counted on him to get rid of all undesirable stock power and responsibility of a sort were given him freely for daly was no puritan and felt himself amply capable of managing any number of simpsons so here were numberless advantages within the mans grasp and wages besides abner positively felt no temptation to steal his soul expanded with pride and the admiration and astonishment with which he regarded his virtuous present was only equaled by the disgust with which he contemplated his past not so much a vicious past in his own generous estimation of it as a thunderin foolish one mrs simpson took the same view of abners new leaf as the angels she was thankful for even a brief season of honesty coupled with the saturday night remittance and if she still washed and cried and cried and washed as clara belle had always seen her it was either because of some hidden sorrow or because her poor strength seemed all at once to have deserted her just when employment and good fortune had come to the stepchildren and her own were better fed and clothed than ever before the pain that had always lurked constant but dull near her tired heart grew fierce and triumphantly strong clutching her in its talons biting gnawing worrying leaving her each week with slighter powers of resistance still hope was in the air and a greater content than had ever been hers was in her eyes a content that came near to happiness when the doctor ordered her to keep her bed and sent for clara belle she could not wash any longer but there was the ever new miracle of the saturday night remittance for household expenses is your pain bad today mother asked clara belle who only lately given away was merely borrowed from mrs fogg for what was thought to be a brief emergency well there i cant hardly tell clara belle mrs simpson replied with a faint smile i cant seem to remember the pain these days without its extra bad the neighbors are so kind mrs little has sent me canned mustard greens and mrs benson chocolate ice cream and mince pie theres the doctors drops to make me sleep and these blankets and that great box of eatables from mr ladd and you here to keep me compny i declare im kind o dazed with comforts i never expected to see sherry wine in this house i aint never drawed the cork it does me good enough jest to look at mr ladds bottle settin on the mantelpiece with the fire shinin on the brown glass mr simpson had come to see his wife and had met the doctor just as he was leaving the house she looks awful bad to me is she goin to pull through all right same as the last time he asked the doctor nervously shes going to pull right through into the other world the doctor answered bluntly and as there dont seem to be anybody else to take the bull by the horns id advise you having made the womans life about as hard and miserable as you could to try and help her to die easy abner surprised and crushed by the weight of this verbal chastisement sat down on the doorstep his head in his hands and thought a while solemnly thought was not an operation he was wont to indulge in and when he opened the gate a few minutes later and walked slowly toward the barn for his horse he looked pale and unnerved it is uncommonly startling first to see yourself in another mans scornful eyes and then clearly in your own two days later he came again and this time it was decreed that he should find parson carll tying his piebald mare at the post clara belles quick eye had observed the minister as he alighted from his buggy and warning her mother she hastily smoothed the bedclothes arranged the medicine bottles and swept the hearth oh dont let him in wailed mrs simpson all of a flutter at the prospect of such a visitor oh dear they must think over to the village that im dreadful sick or the minister wouldnt never think of callin dont let him in clara belle im afraid he will say hard words to me or pray to me and i aint never been prayed to since i was a child is his wife with him no hes alone but fathers just drove up and is hitching at the shed door thats worse than all and mrs simpson raised herself feebly on her pillows and clasped her hands in despair you mustnt let them two meet clara belle and you must send mr carll away your father wouldnt have a minister in the house nor speak to one for a thousand dollars be quiet mother lie down itll be all right youll only fret yourself into a spell the ministers just a good man he wont say anything to frighten you fathers talking with him real pleasant and pointing the way to the front door the parson knocked and was admitted by the excited clara belle who ushered him tremblingly into the sickroom and then betook herself to the kitchen with the children as he gently requested her abner simpson left alone in the shed fumbled in his vest pocket and took out an envelope which held a sheet of paper and a tiny packet wrapped in tissue paper the letter had been read once before and ran as follows dear mr simpson this is a secret letter i heard that the acreville people werent nice to mrs simpson because she didnt have any wedding ring like all the others i know youve always been poor dear mr simpson and troubled with a large family like ours at the farm but you really ought to have given mrs simpson a ring when you were married to her right at the very first for then it would have been over and done with as they are solid gold and last forever and probably she wouldnt feel like asking you for one because ladies are just like girls only grown up and i know id be ashamed to beg for jewelry when just board and clothes cost so much so i send you a nice new wedding ring to save your buying thinking you might get mrs simpson a bracelet or eardrops for christmas it did not cost me anything as it was a secret present from a friend i hear mrs simpson is sick and it would be a great comfort to her while she is in bed and has so much time to look at it when i had the measles emma jane perkins lent me her mothers garnet ring and it helped me very much to put my wasted hand outside the bedclothes and see the ring sparkling please dont be angry with me dear mr simpson because i like you so much and am so glad you are happy with the horses and colts and i believe now perhaps you did think the flag was a bundle of washing when you took it that day so no more from your trusted friend rebecca rowena randall simpson tore the letter slowly and quietly into fragments and scattered the bits on the woodpile took off his hat and smoothed his hair pulled his mustaches thoughtfully straightened his shoulders and then holding the tiny packet in the palm of his hand he went round to the front door and having entered the house stood outside the sickroom for an instant turned the knob and walked softly in then at last the angels might have enjoyed a moment of unmixed joy for in that brief walk from shed to house abner simpsons conscience waked to life and attained sufficient strength to prick and sting to provoke remorse to incite penitence to do all sorts of divine and beautiful things it was meant for but had never been allowed to do clara belle went about the kitchen quietly making preparations for the childrens supper she had left riverboro in haste as the change for the worse in mrs simpson had been very sudden but since she had come she had thought more than once of the wedding ring she had wondered whether mr ladd had bought it for rebecca and whether rebecca would find means to send it to acreville but her cares had been so many and varied that the subject had now finally retired to the background of her mind the hands of the clock crept on and she kept hushing the strident tones of elijah and elisha opening and shutting the oven door to look at the corn bread advising susan as to her dishes and marveling that the minister stayed so long at last she heard a door open and close and saw the old parson come out wiping his spectacles and step into the buggy for his drive to the village then there was another period of suspense during which the house was as silent as the grave and presently her father came into the kitchen greeted the twins and susan and said to clara belle dont go in there yet jerking his thumb towards mrs simpsons room shes all beat out and shes just droppin off to sleep ill send some groceries up from the store as i go along is the doctor makin a second call tonight yes hell be here pretty soon now clara belle answered looking at the clock all right ill be here again tomorrow soon as its light and if she aint picked up any ill send word back to daly and stop here with you for a spell till shes better it was true mrs simpson was all beat out it had been a time of excitement and stress and the poor fluttered creature was dropping off into the strangest sleep a sleep made up of waking dreams the pain that had encompassed her heart like a band of steel lessened its cruel pressure and finally left her so completely that she seemed to see it floating above her head only that it looked no longer like a band of steel but a golden circle the frail bark in which she had sailed her life voyage had been rocking on a rough and tossing ocean and now it floated floated slowly into smoother waters as long as she could remember her boat had been flung about in storm and tempest lashed by angry winds borne against rocks beaten torn buffeted now the waves had subsided the sky was clear the sea was warm and tranquil the sunshine dried the tattered sails the air was soft and balmy and now for sleep plays strange tricks the bark disappeared from the dream and it was she herself who was floating floating farther and farther away whither she neither knew nor cared it was enough to be at rest lulled by the lapping of the cool waves then there appeared a green isle rising from the sea an isle so radiant and fairylike that her famished eyes could hardly believe its reality but it was real for she sailed nearer and nearer to its shores and at last her feet skimmed the shining sands and she floated through the air as disembodied spirits float till she sank softly at the foot of a spreading tree then she saw the green isle was a flowering isle every shrub and bush was blooming the trees were hung with rosy garlands and even the earth was carpeted with tiny flowers the rare fragrances the bird songs soft and musical the ravishment of color all bore down upon her swimming senses at once taking them captive so completely that she remembered no past was conscious of no present looked forward to no future she seemed to leave the body and the sad heavy things of the body the humming in her ears ceased the light faded the birds songs grew fainter and more distant the golden circle of pain receded farther and farther until it was lost to view even the flowering island gently drifted away and all was peace and silence it was time for the doctor now and clara belle too anxious to wait longer softly turned the knob of her mothers door and entered the room the glow of the open fire illumined the darkest side of the poor chamber there were no trees near the house and a full november moon streamed in at the unblinded uncurtained windows lighting up the bare interior the unpainted floor the gray plastered walls and the white counterpane her mother lay quite still her head turned and drooping a little on the pillow her left hand was folded softly up against her breast the fingers of the right partly covering it as if protecting something precious was it the moonlight that made the patient brow so white and where were the lines of anxiety and pain the face of the mother who had washed and cried and cried and washed was as radiant as if the closed eye were beholding heavenly visions something must have cured her thought clara belle awed and almost frightened by the whiteness and the silence she tiptoed across the floor to look more closely at the still smiling shape and bending over it saw under the shadow of the caressing right hand a narrow gold band gleaming on the workstained finger oh the ring came after all she said in a glad whisper and perhaps it was that that made her better she put her hand on her mothers gently a terrified shiver a warning shudder shook the girl from head to foot at the chilling touch a dread presence she had never met before suddenly took shape it filled the room stifled the cry on her lips froze her steps to the floor stopped the beating of her heart just then the door opened oh doctor come quick she sobbed stretching out her hand for help and then covering her eyes come close look at mother is she better or is she dead the doctor put one hand on the shoulder of the shrinking child and touched the woman with the other she is better he said gently and she is dead tenth chronicle rebeccas reminiscences rebecca was sitting by the window in her room at the wareham female seminary she was alone as her roommate emma jane perkins was reciting latin down below in some academic vault of the old brick building a new and most ardent passion for the classics had been born in emma janes hitherto unfertile brain for abijah flagg who was carrying off all the prizes at limerick academy had written her a letter in latin a letter which she had been unable to translate for herself even with the aid of a dictionary and which she had been apparently unwilling that rebecca her bosom friend confidant and roommate should render into english an oldfashioned female seminary with its allotment of one mediumsized room to two medium sized young females gave small opportunities for privacy by night or day for neither the double washstand nor the thus far unimagined bathroom nor even indeed the humble and serviceable screen had been realized in these dark ages of which i write accordingly like the irrational ostrich which defends itself by the simple process of not looking at its pursuers emma jane had kept her latin letter in her closed hand in her pocket or in her open book flattering herself that no one had noticed her pleased bewilderment at its only halfimagined contents all the fairies were not present at rebeccas cradle a goodly number of them telegraphed that they were previously engaged or unavoidably absent from town the village of temperance maine where rebecca first saw the light was hardly a place on its own merits to attract large throngs of fairies but one dear old personage who keeps her pocket full of merry leaves from the laughing tree took a fancy to come to the little birthday party and seeing so few of her sisterfairies present she dowered the sleeping baby more richly than was her wont because of its apparent lack of wealth in other directions so the child grew and the merry leaves from the laughing tree rustled where they hung from the hood of her cradle and being fairy leaves when the cradle was given up they festooned themselves on the cribside and later on blew themselves up to the ceilings at sunnybook farm and dangled there making fun for everybody they never withered even at the brick house in riverboro where the air was particularly inimical to fairies for miss miranda sawyer would have scared any ordinary elf out of her seventeen senses they followed rebecca to wareham and during abijah flaggs latin correspondence with emma jane they fluttered about that young persons head in such a manner that rebecca was almost afraid that she would discover them herself although this is something as a matter of fact that never does happen a week had gone by since the latin missive had been taken from the postoffice by emma jane and now by means of much midnight oilburning by much cautious questioning of miss maxwell by such scrutiny of the moods and tenses of latin verbs as wellnigh destroyed her brain tissue she had mastered its romantic message if it was conventional in style emma jane never suspected it if some of the similes seemed to have been culled from the latin poets and some of the phrases built up from latin exercises emma jane was neither scholar nor critic the similes the phrases the sentiments when finally translated and written down in blackandwhite english made in her opinion the most convincing and heartmelting document ever sent through the mails mea cara emma cur audeo scribere ad te epistulam es mihi dea semper es in mea anima iterum et iterum es cum me in somnis saepe video tuas capillos auri tuos pulchros oculos similes caelo tuas genas quasi rubentes rosas in nive tua vox est dulcior quam cantus avium aut murmur rivuli in montibus cur sum ego tam miser et pauper et indignus et tu tam dulcis et bona et nobilis si cogitabis de me ero beatus tu es sola puella quam amo et semper eris alias puellas non amavi forte olim amabis me sed sum indignus sine te sum miser cum tu es prope mea vita omni est goddamn vale carissima carissima puella de tuo fideli servo af my dear emma why dare i write to you a letter you are to me a goddess always you are in my heart again and again you are with me in dreams often i see your locks of gold your beautiful eyes like the sky your cheeks as red roses in snow your voice is sweeter than the singing of birds or the murmur of the stream in the mountains why am i so wretched and poor and unworthy and you so sweet and good and noble if you will think of me i shall be happy you are the only girl that i love and always will be other girls i have not loved perhaps sometime you will love me but i am unworthy without you i am wretched when you are near my life is all joy farewell dearest dearest girl from your faithful slave af emma jane knew the letter by heart in english she even knew it in latin only a few days before a dead language to her but now one filled with life and meaning from beginning to end the epistle had the effect upon her as of an intoxicating elixir often at morning prayers or while eating her rice pudding at the noon dinner or when sinking off to sleep at night she heard a voice murmuring in her ear vale carissima carissima puella as to the effect on her modest countrified little heart of the phrases in which abijah stated she was a goddess and he her faithful slave that quite baffles description for it lifted her bodily out of the scenes in which she moved into a new rosy ethereal atmosphere in which even rebecca had no place rebecca did not know this fortunately she only suspected and waited for the day when emma jane would pour out her confidences as she always did and always would until the end of time at the present moment she was busily employed in thinking about her own affairs a shabby composition book with mottled board covers lay open on the table before her and sometimes she wrote in it with feverish haste and absorption and sometimes she rested her chin in the cup of her palm and with the pencil poised in the other hand looked dreamily out on the village its huddle of roofs and steeples all blurred into positive beauty by the fastfalling snowflakes it was the middle of december and the friendly sky was softly dropping a great white mantle of peace and goodwill over the little town making all ready within and without for the feast o the babe the main street that in summer was made dignified by its splendid avenue of shade trees now ran quiet and white between rows of stalwart trunks whose leafless branches were all hanging heavy under their dazzling burden the path leading straight up the hill to the academy was broken only by the feet of the hurrying breathless boys and girls who ran up and down carrying piles of books under their arms books which they remembered so long as they were within the four walls of the recitation room and which they eagerly forgot as soon as they met one another in the living laughing world going up and down the hill its very becoming to the universe snow is though rebecca looking out of the window dreamily really theres little to choose between the world and heaven when a snowstorm is going on i feel as if i ought to look at it every minute i wish i could get over being greedy but it still seems to me at sixteen as if there werent waking hours enough in the day and as if somehow i were pressed for time and continually losing something how well i remember mothers story about me when i was four it was at early breakfast on the farm but i called all meals dinner then and when i had finished i folded up my bib and sighed o dear only two more dinners play a while and go to bed this was at six in the morning lamplight in the kitchen snowlight outside powdery powdery powdery snow making things lovely wherever you go merciful merciful merciful snow masking the ugliness hidden below herbert made me promise to do a poem for the january pilot but i mustnt take the snow as a subject there has been too great competition among the older poets and with that she turned in her chair and began writing again in the shabby book which was already three quarters filled with childish scribblings sometimes in pencil and sometimes in violet ink with carefully shaded capital letters squire bean has had a sharp attack of rheumatism and abijah flagg came back from limerick for a few days to nurse him one morning the burnham sisters from north riverboro came over to spend the day with aunt miranda and abijah went down to put up their horse commodatin bijah was his pet name when we were all young he scaled the ladder to the barn chamber the dear old ladder that used to be my safety valve and pitched down the last forkful of grandfathers hay that will ever be eaten by any visiting horse they will be delighted to hear that it is all gone they have grumbled at it for years and years what should abijah find at the bottom of the heap but my thought book hidden there two or three years ago and forgotten when i think of what it was to me the place it filled in my life the affection i lavished on it i wonder that i could forget it even in all the excitement of coming to wareham to school and that gives me an uncommon thought as i used to say it is this that when we finish building an air castle we seldom live in it after all we sometimes even forget that we ever longed to perhaps we have gone so far as to begin another castle on a higher hilltop and this is so beautiful especially while we are building and before we live in it that the first one has quite vanished from sight and mind like the outgrown shell of the nautilus that he casts off on the shore and never looks at again at least i suppose he doesnt but perhaps he takes one backward glance halfsmiling halfserious just as i am doing at my old thought book and says was that my shell goodness gracious how did i ever squeeze myself into it that bit about the nautilus sounds like an extract from a school theme or a pilot editorial or a fragment of one of dear miss maxwells lectures but i think girls of sixteen are principally imitations of the people and things they love and admire and between editing the pilot writing out virgil translations searching for composition subjects and studying rhetorical models there is very little of the original rebecca rowena about me at the present moment i am just a member of the graduating class in good and regular standing we do our hair alike dress alike as much as possible eat and drink alike talk alike i am not even sure that we do not think alike and what will become of the poor world when we are all let loose upon it on the same day of june will life real life bring our true selves back to us will love and duty and sorrow and trouble and work finally wear off the school stamp that has been pressed upon all of us until we look like rows of shining copper cents fresh from the mint yet there must be a little difference between us somewhere or why does abijah flagg write latin letters to emma jane instead of to me there is one example on the other side of the argument abijah flagg he stands out from all the rest of the boys like the rock of gibraltar in the geography pictures is it because he never went to school until he was sixteen he almost died of longing to go and the longing seemed to teach him more than going he knew his letters and could read simple things but it was i who taught him what books really meant when i was eleven and he thirteen we studied while he was husking corn or cutting potatoes for seed or shelling beans in the squires barn his beloved emma jane didnt teach him her father wold not have let her be friends with a choreboy it was i who found him after milkingtime summer nights suffering yes dying of least common multiple and greatest common divisor i who struck the shackles from the slave and told him to skip it all and go on to something easier like fractions percentage and compound interest as i did myself oh how he used to smell of the cows when i was correcting his sums on warm evenings but i dont regret it for he is now the joy of limerick and the pride of riverboro and i suppose has forgotten the proper side on which to approach a cow if you wish to milk her this now unserviceable knowledge is neatly inclosed in the outgrown shell he threw off two or three years ago his gratitude to me knows no bounds but he writes latin letters to emma jane but as mr perkins said about drowning the kittens i now quote from myself at thirteen it is the way of the world and how things have to be well i have read the thought book all through and when i want to make mr aladdin laugh i shall show him my composition on the relative values of punishment and reward as builders of character i am not at all the same rebecca today at sixteen that i was then at twelve and thirteen i hope in getting rid of my failings that i havent scrubbed and rubbed so hard that i have taken the gloss off the poor little virtues that lay just alongside of the faults for as i read the foolish doggerel and the funny funny remerniscences i see on the whole a nice wellmeaning trusting loving heedless little creature that after all id rather build on than outgrow altogether because she is me the me that was made and born just a little different from all the rest of the babies in my birthday year one thing is alike in the child and the girl they both love to set thoughts down in black and white to see how they look how they sound and how they make one feel when one reads them over they both love the sound of beautiful sentences and the tinkle of rhyming words and in fact of the three great rs of life they adore reading and riting as much as they abhor rithmetic the little girl in the old book is always thinking of what she is going to be uncle jerry cobb spoiled me a good deal in this direction i remember he said to everybody when i wrote my verses for the flagraising nary rung on the ladder o fame but that childll climb if you give her time poor uncle jerry he will be so disappointed in me as time goes on and still he would think i have already climbed two rungs on the ladder although it is only a little wareham ladder for i am one of the pilot editors the first girl editor and i have taken a fifty dollar prize in composition and paid off the interest on a twelve hundred dollar mortgage with it high is the rank we now possess but higher we shall rise though what we shall hereafter be is hid from mortal eyes this hymn was sung in meeting the sunday after my election and mr aladdin was there that day and looked across the aisle and smiled at me then he sent me a sheet of paper from boston the next morning with just one verse in the middle of it she made the cleverest people quite ashamed and evn the good with inward envy groan finding themselves so very much exceeded in their own way by all the things that she did miss maxwell says it is byron and i wish i had thought of the last rhyme before byron did my rhymes are always so common i am too busy doing nowadays to give very much thought to being mr aladdin was teasing me one day about what he calls my castoff careers what makes you aim at any mark in particular rebecca he asked looking at miss maxwell and laughing women never hit what they aim at anyway but if they shut their eyes and shoot in the air they generally find themselves in the bulls eye i think one reason that i have always dreamed of what i should be when i grew up was that even before father died mother worried about the mortgage on the farm and what would become of us if it were foreclosed it was hard on children to be brought up on a mortgage that way but oh it was harder still on poor dear mother who had seven of us then to think of and still has three at home to feed and clothe out of the farm aunt jane says i am young for my age aunt miranda is afraid that i will never really grow up mr aladdin says that i dont know the world any better than the pearl inside of the oyster they none of them know the old old thoughts i have some of them going back years and years for they are never ones that i can speak about i remember how we children used to admire father he was so handsome and graceful and amusing never cross like mother or too busy to play with us he never did any work at home because he had to keep his hands nice for playing the church melodeon or the violin or piano for dances mother used to say hannah and rebecca you must hull the strawberries your father cannot help john you must milk next year for i havent the time and it would spoil your fathers hands all the other men in temperance village wore calico or flannel shirts except on sundays but father never wore any but white ones with starched bosoms he was very particular about them and mother used to stitch and stitch on the pleats and press and press the bosoms and collar and cuffs sometimes late at night then she was tired and thin and gray with no time to sew on new dresses for herself and no time to wear them because she was always taking care of the babies and father was happy and well and handsome but we children never thought much about it until once after father had mortgaged the farm there was going to be a sociable in temperance village mother could not go as jenny had whoopingcough and mark had just broken his arm and when she was tying fathers necktie the last thing before he started he said i wish aurelia that you cared a little about your appearance and your dress it goes a long way with a man like me mother had finished the tie and her hands dropped suddenly i looked at her eyes and mouth while she looked at father and in a minute i was ever so old with a grownup ache in my heart it has always stayed there although i admired my handsome father and was proud of him because he was so talented but now that i am older and have thought about things my love for mother is different from what it used to be father was always the favorite when we were little he was so interesting and i wonder sometimes if we dont remember interesting people longer and better than we do those who are just good and patient if so it seems very cruel as i look back i see that miss ross the artist who brought me my pink parasol from paris sowed the first seeds in me of ambition to do something special her life seemed so beautiful and so easy to a child i had not been to school then or read george macdonald so i did not know that ease is the lovely result of forgotten toil miss ross sat out of doors and painted lovely things and everybody said how wonderful they were and bought them straight away and she took care of a blind father and two brothers and traveled wherever she wished it comes back to me now that summer when i was ten and miss ross painted me sitting by the millwheel while she talked to me of foreign countries the other day miss maxwell read something from brownings poems to the girls of her literature class it was about david the shepherd boy who used to lie in his hollow watching one eagle wheeling slow as in sleep he used to wonder about the wide world that the eagle beheld the eagle that was stretching his wings so far up in the blue while he the poor shepherd boy could see only the strip twixt the hill and the sky for he lay in a hollow i told mr baxter about it the next day which was the saturday before i joined the church i asked him if it was wicked to long to see as much as the eagle saw there was never anybody quite like mr baxter rebecca dear he said it may be that you need not always lie in a hollow as the shepherd boy did but wherever you lie that little strip you see twixt the hill and the sky is able to hold all of earth and all of heaven if only you have the right sort of vision i was a long long time about experiencing religion i remember sunday afternoons at the brick house the first winter after i went there when i used to sit in the middle of the diningroom as i was bid silent and still with the big family bible on my knees aunt miranda had baxters saints rest but her seat was by the window and she at least could give a glance into the street now and then without being positively wicked aunt jane used to read the pilgrims progress the fire burned low the tall clock ticked ticked so slowly and steadily that the pictures swam before my eyes and i almost fell asleep they thought by shutting everything else out that i should see god but i didnt not once i was so homesick for sunnybook and john that i could hardly learn my weekly hymns especially the sad long one beginning my thoughts on awful subjects roll damnation and the dead it was brother john for whom i was chiefly homesick on sunday afternoons because at sunnybrook farm father was dead and mother was always busy and hannah never liked to talk then the next year the missionaries from syria came to riverboro and at the meeting mr burch saw me playing the melodeon and thought i was grown up and a church member and so he asked me to lead in prayer i didnt dare to refuse and when i prayed which was just like thinking out loud i found i could talk to god a great deal easier than to aunt miranda or even to uncle jerry cobb there were things i could say to him that i could never say to anybody else and saying them always made me happy and contented when mr baxter asked me last year about joining the church i told him i was afraid i did not understand god quite well enough to be a real member so you dont quite understand god rebecca he asked smiling well there is something else much more important which is that he understands you he understands your feeble love your longings desires hopes faults ambitions crosses and that after all is what counts of course you dont understand him you are overshadowed by his love his power his benignity his wisdom that is as it should be why rebecca dear if you could stand erect and unabashed in gods presence as one who perfectly comprehended his nature or his purposes it would be sacrilege dont be puzzled out of your blessed inheritance of faith my child accept god easily and naturally just as he accepts you god never puzzled me mr baxter it isnt that i said but the doctrines do worry me dreadfully let them alone for the present mr baxter said anyway rebecca you can never prove god you can only find him then do you think i have really experienced religion mr baxter i asked am i the beginnings of a christian you are a dear child of the understanding god mr baxter said and i say it over to myself night and morning so that i can never forget it the year is nearly over and the next few months will be lived in the rush and whirlwind of work that comes before graduation the bell for philosophy class will ring in ten minutes and as i have been writing for nearly two hours i must learn my lesson going up the academy hill it will not be the first time it is a grand hill for learning i suppose after fifty years or so the very ground has become soaked with knowledge and every particle of air in the vicinity is crammed with useful information i will put my book into my trunk having no blessed haymow hereabouts and take it out again when shall i take it out again after graduation perhaps i shall be too grown up and too busy to write in a thought book but oh if only something would happen worth putting down something strange something unusual something different from the things that happen every day in riverboro and edgewood graduation will surely take me a little out of the hollow make me a little more like the soaring eagle gazing at the whole wide world beneath him while he wheels slow as in sleep but whether or not ill try not to be a discontented shepherd but remember what mr baxter said that the little strip that i see twixt the hill and the sky is able to hold all of earth and all of heaven if only i have the eyes to see it rebecca rowena randall wareham female seminary december eleventh chronicle abijah the brave and the fair emmajane i a warrior so bold and a maiden so bright conversed as they sat on the green they gazed at each other in tender delight alonzo the brave was the name of the knight and the maid was the fair imogene alas said the youth since tomorrow i go to fight in a far distant land your tears for my absence soon ceasing to flow some other will court you and you will bestow on a wealthier suitor your hand oh hush these suspicions fair imogene said so hurtful to love and to me for if you be living or if you be dead i swear by the virgin that none in your stead shall the husband of imogene be ever since she was eight years old rebecca had wished to be eighteen but now that she was within a month of that aweinspiring and longdesired age she wondered if after all it was destined to be a turning point in her quiet existence her eleventh year for instance had been a real turningpoint since it was then that she had left sunnybrook farm and come to her maiden aunts in riverboro aurelia randall may have been doubtful as to the effect upon her spinster sisters of the irrepressible child but she was hopeful from the first that the larger opportunities of riverboro would be the making of rebecca herself the next turningpoint was her fourteenth year when she left the district school for the wareham female seminary then in the heyday of its local fame graduation next to marriage perhaps the most thrilling episode in the life of a little country girl happened at seventeen and not long afterward her aunt mirandas death sudden and unexpected changed not only all the outward activities and conditions of her life but played its own part in her development the brick house looked very homelike and pleasant on a june morning nowadays with childrens faces smiling at the windows and youthful footsteps sounding through the halls and the brass knocker on the redpainted front door might have remembered rebeccas prayer of a year before when she leaned against its sunwarmed brightness and whispered god bless aunt miranda god bless the brick house that was god bless the brick house thats going to be all the doors and blinds were open to the sun and air as they had never been in miss miranda sawyers time the hollyhock bed that had been her chief pride was never neglected and rebecca liked to hear the neighbors say that there was no such row of beautiful plants and no such variety of beautiful colors in riverboro as those that climbed up and peeped in at the kitchen windows where old miss miranda used to sit now that the place was her very own rebecca felt a passion of pride in its smoothly mown fields its carefully thinnedout woods its blooming garden spots and its wellweeded vegetable patch felt too whenever she looked at any part of it a passion of gratitude to the stern old aunt who had looked upon her as the future head of the family as well as a passion of desire to be worthy of that trust it had been a very difficult year for a girl fresh from school the death of her aunt the nursing of miss jane prematurely enfeebled by the shock the removal of her own invalid mother and the rest of the little family from sunnybrook farm but all had gone smoothly and when once the randall fortunes had taken an upward turn nothing seemed able to stop their intrepid ascent aurelia randall renewed her youth in the companionship of her sister jane and the comforts by which her children were surrounded the mortgage was no longer a daily terror for sunnybrook had been sold to the new railroad hannah now mrs will melville was happily situated john at last was studying medicine mark the boisterous and unlucky brother had broken no bones for several months while jenny and fanny were doing well at the district school under miss libby moses miss dearborns successor i dont feel very safe thought rebecca remembering all these unaccustomed mercies as she sat on the front doorsteps with her tatting shuttle flying in and out of the fine cotton like a hummingbird its just like one of those too beautiful july days that winds up with a thundershower before night still when you remember that the randalls never had anything but thunder and lightning rain snow and hail in their family history for twelve or fifteen years perhaps it is only natural that they should enjoy a little spell of settled weather if it really turns out to be settled now that aunt jane and mother are strong again i must be looking up one of what mr aladdin calls my castoff careers there comes emma jane perkins through her front gate she will be here in a minute and ill tease her and rebecca ran in the door and seated herself at the old piano that stood between the open windows in the parlor peeping from behind the muslin curtains she waited until emma jane was on the very threshold and then began singing her version of an old ballad made that morning while she was dressing the ballad was a great favorite of hers and she counted on doing telling execution with it in the present instance by the simple subterfuge of removing the original hero and heroine alonzo and imogene and substituting abijah the brave and the fair emmajane leaving the circumstances in the first three verses unaltered because in truth they seemed to require no alteration her high clear voice quivering with merriment floated through the windows into the still summer air a warrior so bold and a maiden so bright conversed as they sat on the green they gazed at each other in tender delight abijah the brave was the name of the knight and the maid was the fair emmajane rebecca randall stop somebodyll hear you no they wont theyre making jelly in the kitchen miles away alas said the youth since tomorrow i go to fight in a far distant land your tears for my absence soon ceasing to flow some other will court you and you will bestow on a wealthier suitor your hand rebecca you cant think how your voice carries i believe mother can hear it over to my house then if she can i must sing the third verse just to clear your reputation from the cloud cast upon it in the second laughed her tormentor going on with the song oh hush these suspicions fair emmajane said so hurtful to love and to me for if you be living or if you be dead i swear my abijah that none in your stead shall the husband of emmajane be after ending the third verse rebecca wheeled around on the piano stool and confronted her friend who was carefully closing the parlor windows emma jane perkins it is an ordinary thursday afternoon at four oclock and you have on your new blue barege although there is not even a church sociable in prospect this evening what does this mean is abijah the brave coming at last i dont know certainly but it will be some time this week and of course youd rather be dressed up and not seen than seen when not dressed up right my fair emmajane so would i not that it makes any difference to poor me wearing my fourth best black and white calico and expecting nobody oh well you theres something inside of you that does instead of pretty dresses cried emma jane whose adoration of her friend had never altered nor lessened since they met at the age of eleven you know you are as different from anybody else in riverboro as a princess in a fairy story libby moses says they would notice you in lowell massachusetts would they i wonder speculated rebecca rendered almost speechless by this tribute to her charms well if lowell massachusetts could see me or if you could see me in my new lavender muslin with the violet sash it would die of envy and so would you if i had been going to be envious of you rebecca i should have died years ago come lets go out on the steps where its shady and cool and where we can see the perkins front gate and the road running both ways teased rebecca and then softening her tone she said how is it getting on emmy tell me whats happened since ive been in brunswick nothing much confessed emma jane he writes to me but i dont write to him you know i dont dare to till he comes to the house are his letters still in latin asked rebecca with a twinkling eye oh no not now because well because there are things you cant seem to write in latin i saw him at the masonic picnic in the grove but he wont say anything real to me till he gets more pay and dares to speak to mother and father he is brave in all other ways but i aint sure hell ever have the courage for that hes so afraid of them and always has been just remember whats in his mind all the time rebecca that my folks know all about what his mother was and how he was born on the poorfarm not that i care look how hes educated and worked himself up i think hes perfectly elegant and i shouldnt mind if he had been born in the bulrushes like moses emma janes everyday vocabulary was pretty much what it had been before she went to the expensive wareham female seminary she had acquired a certain amount of information concerning the art of speech but in moments of strong feeling she lapsed into the vernacular she grew slowly in all directions did emma jane and to use rebeccas favorite nautilus figure she had left comparatively few outgrown shells on the shores of lifes unresting sea moses wasnt born in the bulrushes emmy dear corrected rebecca laughingly pharaohs daughter found him there it wasnt quite as romantic a scene squire beans wife taking little abijah flagg from the poorhouse when his girlmother died but oh i think abijahs splendid mr ladd says riverboroll be proud of him yet and i shouldnt wonder emmy dear if you had a threestory house with a cupola on it some day and sitting down at your mahogany desk inlaid with garnets you will write notes stating that mrs abijah flagg requests the pleasure of miss rebecca randalls company to tea and that the hon abijah flagg mc will call for her on his way from the station with a span of horses and the turquoise carryall emma jane laughed at the ridiculous prophecy and answered if i ever write the invitation i shant be addressing it to miss randall im sure of that itll be to mrs dont cried rebecca impetuously changing color and putting her hand over emma janes lips if you wont ill stop teasing i couldnt bear a name put to anything i couldnt emmy dear i wouldnt tease you either if it werent something weve both known ever so long something that you have always consulted me about of your own accord and abijah too dont get excited replied emma jane i was only going to say you were sure to be mrs somebody in course of time oh said rebecca with a relieved sigh her color coming back if thats all you meant just nonsense but i thought i thought i dont really know just what i thought i think you thought something you didnt want me to think you thought said emma jane with unusual felicity no its not that but somehow today i have been remembering things perhaps it was because at breakfast aunt jane and mother reminded me of my coming birthday and said that squire bean would give me the deed of the brick house that made me feel very old and responsible and when i came out on the steps this afternoon it was just as if pictures of the old years were moving up and down the road everything is so beautiful today doesnt the sky look as if it had been dyed blue and the fields painted pink and green and yellow this very minute its a perfectly elegant day responded emma jane with a sigh if only my mind was at rest thats the difference between being young and grownup we never used to think and worry indeed we didnt look emmy theres the very spot where uncle jerry cobb stopped the stage and i stepped out with my pink parasol and my bouquet of purple lilacs and you were watching me from your bedroom window and wondering what i had in mothers little hair trunk strapped on behind poor aunt miranda didnt love me at first sight and oh how cross she was the first two years but now every hard thought i ever had comes back to me and cuts like a knife she was dreadful hard to get along with and i used to hate her like poison confessed emma jane but i am sorry now she was kinder toward the last anyway and then you see children know so little we never suspected she was sick or that she was worrying over that lost interest money thats the trouble people seem hard and unreasonable and unjust and we cant help being hurt at the time but if they die we forget everything but our own angry speeches somehow we never remember theirs and oh emma jane theres another such a sweet little picture out there in the road the next day after i came to riverboro do you remember i stole out of the brick house crying and leaned against the front gate you pushed your little fat pinkandwhite face through the pickets and said dont cry ill kiss you if you will me lumps rose suddenly in emma janes throat and she put her arm around rebeccas waist as they sat together side by side oh i do remember she said in a choking voice and i can see the two of us driving over to north riverboro and selling soap to mr adam ladd and lighting up the premium banquet lamp at the simpson party and laying the daisies round jacky winslows mother when she was dead in the cabin and trundling jacky up and down the street in our old baby carriage and i remember you continued rebecca being chased down the hill by jacob moody when we were being daughters of zion and you had been chosen to convert him and i remember you getting the flag back from mr simpson and how you looked when you spoke your verses at the flagraising and have you forgotten the week i refused to speak to abijah flagg because he fished my turban with the porcupine quills out of the river when i hoped at last that i had lost it oh emma jane we had dear good times together in the little harbor i always thought that was an elegant composition of yours that farewell to the class said emma jane the strong tide bears us on out of the little harbor of childhood into the unknown seas recalled rebecca it is bearing you almost out of my sight emmy these last days when you put on a new dress in the afternoon and look out of the window instead of coming across the street abijah flagg never used to be in the little harbor with the rest of us when did he first sail in emmy emma jane grew a deeper pink and her buttonhole of a mouth quivered with delicious excitement it was last year at the seminary when he wrote me his first latin letter from limerick academy she said in a half whisper i remember laughed rebecca you suddenly began the study of the dead languages and the latin dictionary took the place of the crochet needle in your affections it was cruel of you never to show me that letter emmy i know every word of it by heart said the blushing emma jane and i think i really ought to say it to you because its the only way you will ever know how perfectly elegant abijah is look the other way rebecca shall i have to translate it for you do you think because it seems to me i could not bear to do that it depends upon abijahs latin and your pronunciation teased rebecca go on i will turn my eyes toward the orchard the fair emmajane looking none too old still for the little harbor but almost too young for the unknown seas gathered up her courage and recited like a tremulous parrot the boyish love letter that had so fired her youthful imagination vale carissima carissima puella repeated rebecca in her musical voice oh how beautiful it sounds i dont wonder it altered your feeling for abijah upon my word emma jane she cried with a sudden change of tone if i had suspected for an instant that abijah the brave had that latin letter in him i should have tried to get him to write it to me and then it would be i who would sit down at my mahogany desk and ask miss perkins to come to tea with mrs flagg emma jane paled and shuddered openly i speak as a church member rebecca she said when i tell you ive always thanked the lord that you never looked at abijah flagg and he never looked at you if either of you ever had there never would have been a chance for me and ive always known it ii the romance alluded to in the foregoing chapter had been going on so far as abijah flaggs part of it was concerned for many years his affection dating back in his own mind to the first moment that he saw emma jane perkins at the age of nine emma jane had shown no sign of reciprocating his attachment until the last three years when the evolution of the choreboy into the budding scholar and man of affairs had inflamed even her somewhat dull imagination squire beans wife had taken abijah away from the poorhouse thinking that she could make him of some little use in her home abbie flagg the mother was neither wise nor beautiful it is to be feared that she was not even good and her lack of all these desirable qualities particularly the last one had been impressed upon the child ever since he could remember people seemed to blame him for being in the world at all this world that had not expected him nor desired him nor made any provision for him the great battleaxe of poorhouse opinion was forever leveled at the mere little atom of innocent transgression until he grew sad and shy clumsy stiff and selfconscious he had an indomitable craving for love in his heart and had never received a caress in his life he was more contented when he came to squire beans house the first year he could only pick up chips carry pine wood into the kitchen go to the postoffice run errands drive the cows and feed the hens but every day he grew more and more useful his only friend was little jim watson the storekeepers son and they were inseparable companions whenever abijah had time for play one nevertobeforgotten july day a new family moved into the white cottage between squire beans house and the sawyers mr perkins had sold his farm beyond north riverboro and had established a blacksmiths shop in the village at the edgewood end of the bridge this fact was of no special interest to the nineyearold abijah but what really was of importance was the appearance of a pretty little girl of seven in the front yard a pretty little fat doll of a girl with bright fuzzy hair pink cheeks blue eyes and a smile of almost bewildering continuity another might have criticised it as having the air of being glued on but abijah was already in the toils and never wished it to move the next day being the glorious fourth and a holiday jimmy watson came over like david to visit his favorite jonathan his jonathan met him at the top of the hill pleaded a pressing engagement curtly sent him home and then went back to play with his new idol with whom he had already scraped acquaintance her parents being exceedingly busy settling the new house after the noon dinner jimmy again yearned to resume friendly relations and forgetting his rebuff again toiled up the hill and appeared unexpectedly at no great distance from the perkins premises wearing the broad and beaming smile of one who is confident of welcome his morning call had been officious and unpleasant and unsolicited but his afternoon visit could only be regarded as impudent audacious and positively dangerous for abijah and emma jane were cosily playing house the game of all others in which it is particularly desirable to have two and not three participants at that moment the nature of abijah changed at once and forever without a pang of conscience he flew over the intervening patch of ground between himself and his dreaded rival and seizing small stones and larger ones as haste and fury demanded flung them at jimmy watson and flung and flung till the bewildered boy ran down the hill howling then he made a stickin door to the playhouse put the awed emma jane inside and strode up and down in front of the edifice like an indian brave at such an early age does woman become a distracting and disturbing influence in mans career time went on and so did the rivalry between the poorhouse boy and the son of wealth but abijahs chances of friendship with emma jane grew fewer and fewer as they both grew older he did not go to school so there was no meetingground there but sometimes when he saw the knot of boys and girls returning in the afternoon he would invite elijah and elisha the simpson twins to visit him and take pains to be in squire beans front yard doing something that might impress his inamorata as she passed the premises as jimmy watson was particularly small and fragile abijah generally chose feats of strength and skill for these prearranged performances sometimes he would throw his hat up into the elm trees as far as he could and when it came down catch it on his head sometimes he would walk on his hands with his legs wriggling in the air or turn a double somersault or jump incredible distances across the extended arms of the simpson twins and his bosom swelled with pride when the girls exclaimed isnt he splendid although he often heard his rival murmur scornfully smarty aleck a scathing allusion of unknown origin squire bean although he did not send the boy to school thinking as he was of no possible importance in the universe it was not worth while bothering about his education finally became impressed with his ability lent him books and gave him more time to study these were all he needed books and time and when there was an especially hard knot to untie rebecca as the star scholar of the neighborhood helped him to untie it when he was sixteen he longed to go away from riverboro and be something better than a chore boy squire bean had been giving him small wages for three or four years and when the time of parting came presented him with a tendollar bill and a silver watch many a time had he discussed his future with rebecca and asked her opinion this was not strange for there was nothing in human form that she could not and did not converse with easily and delightedly she had ideas on every conceivable subject and would have cheerfully advised the minister if he had asked her the fishman consulted her when he couldnt endure his motherinlaw another minute in the house uncle jerry cobb didnt part with his river field until he had talked it over with rebecca and as for aunt jane she couldnt decide whether to wear her black merino or her gray thibet unless rebecca cast the final vote abijah wanted to go far away from riverboro as far as limerick academy which was at least fifteen miles but although this seemed extreme rebecca agreed saying pensively there is a kind of magicness about going far away and then coming back all changed this was precisely abijahs unspoken thought limerick knew nothing of abbie flaggs worthlessness birth and training and the awful stigma of his poorhouse birth so that he would start fair he could have gone to wareham and thus remained within daily sight of the beloved emma jane but no he was not going to permit her to watch him in the process of becoming but after he had become something he did not propose to take any risks after all these years of silence and patience not he he proposed to disappear like the moon on a dark night and as he was at present something that mr perkins would by no means have in the family nor mrs perkins allow in the house he would neither return to riverboro nor ask any favors of them until he had something to offer yes sir he was going to be crammed to the eyebrows with learning for one thing useless kinds and all going to have good clothes and a good income everything that was in his power should be right because there would always be lurking in the background the things he never could help the mother and the poorhouse so he went away and although at squire beans invitation he came back the first year for two brief visits at christmas and easter he was little seen in riverboro for mr ladd finally found him a place where he could make his vacations profitable and learn bookkeeping at the same time the visits in riverboro were tantalizing rather than pleasant he was invited to two parties but he was all the time conscious of his shirtcollar and he was sure that his pants were not the proper thing for by this time his ideals of dress had attained an almost unrealizable height as for his shoes he felt that he walked on carpets as if they were furrows and he were propelling a plow or a harrow before him they played drop the handkerchief and copenhagen at the parties but he had not had the audacity to kiss emma jane which was bad enough but jimmy had and did which was infinitely worse the sight of james watsons unworthy and overambitious lips on emma janes pink cheek almost destroyed his faith in an overruling providence after the parties were over he went back to his old room in squire beans shed chamber as he lay in bed his thoughts fluttered about emma jane as swallows circle around the eaves the terrible sickness of hopeless handicapped love kept him awake once he crawled out of bed in the night lighted the lamp and looked for his mustache remembering that he had seen a suspicion of down on his rivals upper lip he rose again half an hour later again lighted the lamp put a few drops of oil on his hair and brushed it violently for several minutes then he went back to bed and after making up his mind that he would buy a dulcimer and learn to play on it so that he would be more attractive at parties and outshine his rival in society as he had aforetime in athletics he finally sank into a troubled slumber those days so full of hope and doubt and torture seemed mercifully unreal now they lay so far back in the past six or eight years in fact which is a lifetime to the lad of twenty and meantime he had conquered many of the adverse circumstances that had threatened to cloud his career abijah flagg was a true child of his native state something of the same timber that maine puts into her forests something of the same strength and resisting power that she works into her rocks goes into her sons and daughters and at twenty abijah was going to take his fate in his hand and ask mr perkins the rich blacksmith if after a suitable period of probation during which he would further prepare himself for his exalted destiny he might marry the fair emma jane sole heiress of the perkins house and fortunes iii this was boy and girl love calf love perhaps though even that may develop into something larger truer and finer but not so far away were other and very different hearts growing and budding each in its own way there was little miss dearborn the pretty school teacher drifting into a foolish alliance because she did not agree with her stepmother at home there was herbert dunn valedictorian of his class dazzled by huldah meserve who like a glowworm shone afar off bright but looked at near had neither heat nor light there was sweet emily maxwell less than thirty still with most of her heart bestowed in the wrong quarter she was toiling on at the wareham school living as unselfish a life as a nun in a convent lavishing the mind and soul of her the heart and body of her on her chosen work how many women give themselves thus consciously and unconsciously and though they themselves miss the joys and compensations of mothering their own little twos and threes god must be grateful to them for their mothering of the hundreds which make them so precious in his regenerating purposes then there was adam ladd waiting at thirtyfive for a girl to grow a little older simply because he could not find one already grown who suited his somewhat fastidious and exacting tastes ill not call rebecca perfection he quoted once in a letter to emily maxwell ill not call her perfection for thats a post afraid to move but shes a dancing sprig of the tree next it when first she appeared on his aunts piazza in north riverboro and insisted on selling him a large quantity of very inferior soap in order that her friends the simpsons might possess a premium in the shape of a greatly needed banquet lamp she had riveted his attention he thought all the time that he enjoyed talking with her more than with any woman alive and he had never changed his opinion she always caught what he said as if it were a ball tossed to her and sometimes her mind as through it his thoughts came back to him seemed like a prism which had dyed them with deeper colors adam ladd always called rebecca in his heart his little spring his boyhood had been lonely and unhappy that was the part of life he had missed and although it was the full summer of success and prosperity with him now he found his lost youth only in her she was to him how shall i describe it do you remember an early day in may with budding leaf warm earth tremulous air and changing willful sky how new it seemed how fresh and joyous beyond all explaining have you lain with halfclosed eyes where the flickering of sunlight through young leaves the song of birds and brook and the fragrance of wild flowers combined to charm your senses and you felt the sweetness and grace of nature as never before rebecca was springtide to adams thirsty heart she was blithe youth incarnate she was music an aeolian harp that every passing breeze woke to some whispering little tune she was a changing iridescent joybubble she was the shadow of a leaf dancing across a dusty floor no bough of his thought could be so bare but she somehow built a nest in it and evoked life where none was before and rebecca herself she had been quite unconscious of all this until very lately and even now she was but half awakened searching among her childish instincts and her girlish dreams for some ariadne thread that should guide her safely through the labyrinth of her new sensations for the moment she was absorbed or thought she was in the little love story of abijah and emma jane but in reality had she realized it that love story served chiefly as a basis of comparison for a possible one of her own later on she liked and respected abijah flagg and loving emma jane was a habit contracted early in life but everything that they did or said or thought or wrote or hoped or feared seemed so inadequate so painfully short of what might be done or said or thought or written or hoped or feared under easily conceivable circumstances that she almost felt a disposition to smile gently at the fancy of the ignorant young couple that they had caught a glimpse of the great vision she was sitting under the sweet apple tree at twilight supper was over marks restless feet were quiet fanny and jenny were tucked safely in bed her aunt and her mother were stemming currants on the side porch a blue spot at one of the perkins windows showed that in one vestal bosom hope was not dead yet although it was seven oclock suddenly there was the sound of a horses feet coming up the quiet road plainly a steed hired from some metropolis like milltown or wareham as riverboro horses when through with their days work never disported themselves so gayly a little open vehicle came in sight and in it sat abijah flagg the wagon was so freshly painted and so shiny that rebecca thought that he must have alighted at the bridge and given it a last polish the creases in his trousers too had an air of having been pressed in only a few minutes before the whip was new and had a yellow ribbon on it the gray suit of clothes was new and the coat flourished a flower in its buttonhole the hat was the latest thing in hats and the intrepid swain wore a sealring on the little finger of his right hand as rebecca remembered that she had guided it in making capital gs in his copybook she felt positively maternal although she was two years younger than abijah the brave he drove up to the perkins gate and was so long about hitching the horse that rebeccas heart beat tumultuously at the thought of emma janes heart waiting under the blue barege then he brushed an imaginary speck off his sleeve then he drew on a pair of buff kid gloves then he went up the path rapped at the knocker and went in not all the heroes go to the wars thought rebecca abijah has laid the ghost of his father and redeemed the memory of his mother for no one will dare say again that abbie flaggs son could never amount to anything the minutes went by and more minutes and more the tranquil dusk settled down over the little village street and the young moon came out just behind the top of the perkins pine tree the perkins front door opened and abijah the brave came out hand in hand with his fair emma jane they walked through the orchard the eyes of the old couple following them from the window and just as they disappeared down the green slope that led to the riverside the gray coat sleeve encircled the blue barege waist rebecca quivering with instant sympathy and comprehension hid her face in her hands emmy has sailed away and i am all alone in the little harbor she thought it was as if childhood like a thing real and visible were slipping down the grassy river banks after abijah and emma jane and disappearing like them into the moonlit shadows of the summer night i am all alone in the little harbor she repeated and oh i wonder i wonder shall i be afraid to leave it if anybody ever comes to carry me out to sea
