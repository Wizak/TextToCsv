twains letters vol ed ab paine mark twains letters arranged with comment by albert bigelow paine volume iv xxvi letters jane clemenss romance unmailed letters etc when clemens had been platforming with cable and returned to hartford for his christmas vacation the warner and clemens families had joined in preparing for him a surprise performance of the prince and the pauper the clemens household was always given to theatricals and it was about this time that scenery and a stage were prepared mainly by the sculptor gerhardt for these home performances after which productions of the prince and the pauper were given with considerable regularity to audiences consisting of parents and invited friends the subject is a fascinating one but it has been dwelt upon elsewhere in mark twain a biography chaps cliff and clx we get a glimpse of one of these occasions as well as of mark twains financial progress in the next brief note to w d howells in boston jan my dear howells the date set for the prince and pauper play is ten days hence jan i hope you and pilla can take a train that arrives here during the day the one that leaves boston toward the end of the afternoon would be a trifle late the performance would have already begun when you reached the house im out of the woods on the last day of the year i had paid out on the grant book and it was totally free from debt yrs ever mark mark twains mother was a woman of sturdy character and with a keen sense of humor and tender sympathies her husband john marshall clemens had been a man of high moral character honored by all who knew him respected and apparently loved by his wife no one would ever have supposed that during all her years of marriage and almost to her death she carried a secret romance that would only be told at last in the weary disappointment of old age it is a curious story and it came to light in this curious way to w d howells in boston hartford may my dear howells heres a secret a most curious and pathetic romance which has just come to light read these things but dont mention them last fall my old mother then took a notion to attend a convention of old settlers of the mississippi valley in an iowa town my brothers wife was astonished and represented to her the hardships and fatigues of such a trip and said my mother might possibly not even survive them and said there could be no possible interest for her in such a meeting and such a crowd but my mother insisted and persisted and finally gained her point they started and all the way my mother was young again with excitement interest eagerness anticipation they reached the town and the hotel my mother strode with the same eagerness in her eye and her step to the counter and said is dr barrett of st louis here no he was here but he returned to st louis this morning will he come again no my mother turned away the fire all gone from her and said let us go home they went straight back to keokuk my mother sat silent and thinking for many days a thing which had never happened before then one day she said i will tell you a secret when i was eighteen a young medical student named barrett lived in columbia ky eighteen miles away and he used to ride over to see me this continued for some time i loved him with my whole heart and i knew that he felt the same toward me though no words had been spoken he was too bashful to speak he could not do it everybody supposed we were engaged took it for granted we were but we were not by and by there was to be a party in a neighboring town and he wrote my uncle telling him his feelings and asking him to drive me over in his buggy and let him barrett drive me back so that he might have that opportunity to propose my uncle should have done as he was asked without explaining anything to me but instead he read me the letter and then of course i could not go and did not he barrett left the country presently and i to stop the clacking tongues and to show him that i did not care married in a pet in all these sixtyfour years i have not seen him since i saw in a paper that he was going to attend that old settlers convention only three hours before we reached that hotel he had been standing there since then her memory is wholly faded out and gone and now she writes letters to the schoolmates who had been dead forty years and wonders why they neglect her and do not answer think of her carrying that pathetic burden in her old heart sixtyfour years and no human being ever suspecting it yrs ever mark we do not get the idea from this letter that those two long ago sweethearts quarreled but mark twain once spoke of their having done so and there may have been a disagreement assuming that there was a subsequent meeting it does not matter now in speaking of it mark twain once said it is as pathetic a romance as any that has crossed the field of my personal experience in a long lifetime when mark twain a biography was written this letter had not come to light and the matter was stated there in accordance with mark twains latest memory of it howells wrote after all how poor and hackneyed all the inventions are compared with the simple and stately facts who could have imagined such a heartbreak as that yet it went along with the fulfillment of everyday duty and made no more noise than a grave under foot i doubt if fiction will ever get the knack of such things jane clemens now lived with her son orion and his wife in keokuk where she was more contented than elsewhere in these later days her memory had become erratic her realization of events about her uncertain but there were times when she was quite her former self remembering clearly and talking with her oldtime gaiety of spirit mark twain frequently sent her playful letters to amuse her letters full of such boyish gaiety as had amused her long years before the one that follows is a fair example it was written after a visit which clemens and his family had paid to keokuk to jane clemens in keokuk elmira aug dear ma i heard that molly and orion and pamela had been sick but i see by your letter that they are much better now or nearly well when we visited you a month ago it seemed to us that your keokuk weather was pretty hot jean and clara sat up in bed at mrs mcelroys and cried about it and so did i but i judge by your letter that it has cooled down now so that a person is comparatively comfortable with his skin off well it did need cooling i remember that i burnt a hole in my shirt there with some ice cream that fell on it and miss jenkins told me they never used a stove but cooked their meals on a marbletopped table in the drawingroom just with the natural heat if anybody else had told me i would not have believed it i was told by the bishop of keokuk that he did not allow crying at funerals because it scalded the furniture if miss jenkins had told me that i would have believed it this reminds me that you speak of dr jenkins and his family as if they were strangers to me indeed they are not dont you suppose i remember gratefully how tender the doctor was with jean when she hurt her arm and how quickly he got the pain out of the hurt whereas i supposed it was going to last at least an hour no i dont forget some things as easily as i do others yes it was pretty hot weather now here when a person is going to die he is always in a sweat about where he is going to but in keokuk of course they dont care because they are fixed for everything it has set me reflecting it has taught me a lesson by and by when my health fails i am going to put all my affairs in order and bid goodbye to my friends here and kill all the people i dont like and go out to keokuk and prepare for death they are all well in this family and we all send love affly your son sam the ways of city officials and corporations are often past understanding and mark twain sometimes found it necessary to write picturesque letters of protest the following to a hartford lighting company is a fair example of these documents to a gas and electriclighting company in hartford gentlemen there are but two places in our whole street where lights could be of any value by any accident and you have measured and appointed your intervals so ingeniously as to leave each of those places in the centre of a couple of hundred yards of solid darkness when i noticed that you were setting one of your lights in such a way that i could almost see how to get into my gate at night i suspected that it was a piece of carelessness on the part of the workmen and would be corrected as soon as you should go around inspecting and find it out my judgment was right it is always right when you axe concerned for fifteen years in spite of my prayers and tears you persistently kept a gas lamp exactly half way between my gates so that i couldnt find either of them after dark and then furnished such execrable gas that i had to hang a danger signal on the lamp post to keep teams from running into it nights now i suppose your present idea is to leave us a little more in the dark dont mind us out our way we possess but one vote apiece and no rights which you are in any way bound to respect please take your electric light and go to but never mind it is not for me to suggest you will probably find the way and any way you can reasonably count on divine assistance if you lose your bearings s l clemens etext editors note twain wrote another note to hartford gas and electric which he may not have mailed and which paine does not include in these volumes gentleman someday you are going to move me almost to the point of irritation with your goddamned chuckle headed fashion of turning off your goddamned gas without giving notice to your goddamned parishioners and you did it again last night dw frequently clemens did not send letters of this sort after they were written sometimes he realized the uselessness of such protest sometimes the mere writing of them had furnished the necessary relief and he put the letter away or into the wastebasket and wrote something more temperate or nothing at all a few such letters here follow clemens was all the time receiving application from people who wished him to recommend one article or another books plays tobacco and what not they were generally persistent people unable to accept a polite or kindly denial once he set down some remarks on this particular phase of correspondence he wrote i no doubt mr edison has been offered a large interest in many and many an electrical project for the use of his name to float it withal and no doubt all men who have achieved for their names in any line of activity whatever a sure market value have been familiar with this sort of solicitation reputation is a hallmark it can remove doubt from pure silver and it can also make the plated article pass for pure and so people without a hallmark of their own are always trying to get the loan of somebody elses as a rule that kind of a person sees only one side of the case he sees that his invention or his painting or his book is apparently a trifle better than you yourself can do therefore why shouldnt you be willing to put your hallmark on it you will be giving the purchaser his full moneys worth so who is hurt and where is the harm besides are you not helping a struggling fellowcraftsman and is it not your duty to do that that side is plenty clear enough to him but he cant and wont see the other side towit that you are a rascal if you put your hallmark upon a thing which you did not produce yourself howsoever good it may be how simple that is and yet there are not two applicants in a hundred who can be made to see it when one receives an application of this sort his first emotion is an indignant sense of insult his first deed is the penning of a sharp answer he blames nobody but that other person that person is a very base being he must be he would degrade himself for money otherwise it would not occur to him that you would do such a thing but all the same that application has done its work and taken you down in your own estimation you recognize that everybody hasnt as high an opinion of you as you have of yourself and in spite of you there ensues an interval during which you are not in your own estimation as fine a bird as you were before however being old and experienced you do not mail your sharp letter but leave it lying a day that saves you for by that time you have begun to reflect that you are a person who deals in exaggerations and exaggerations are lies you meant yours to be playful and thought you made them unmistakably so but you couldnt make them playfulnesses to a man who has no sense of the playful and can see nothing but the serious side of things you rattle on quite playfully and with measureless extravagance about how you wept at the tomb of adam and all in good time you find to your astonishment that no end of people took you at your word and believed you and presently they find out that you were not in earnest they have been deceived therefore as they argue and there is a sort of argument in it you are a deceiver if you will deceive in one way why shouldnt you in another so they apply for the use of your trademark you are amazed and affronted you retort that you are not that kind of person then they are amazed and affronted and wonder since when by this time you have got your bearings you realize that perhaps there is a little blame on both sides you are in the right frame now so you write a letter void of offense declining you mail this one you pigeonhole the other that is being old and experienced you do but early in your career you dont you mail the first one ii an enthusiast who had a new system of musical notation wrote to me and suggested that a magazine article from me contrasting the absurdities of the old system with the simplicities of his new one would be sure to make a rousing hit he shouted and shouted over the marvels wrought by his system and quoted the handsome compliments which had been paid it by famous musical people but he forgot to tell me what his notation was like or what its simplicities consisted in so i could not have written the article if i had wanted to which i didnt because i hate strangers with axes to grind i wrote him a courteous note explaining how busy i was i always explain how busy i am and casually drooped this remark i judge the xx notation to be a rational mode of representing music in place of the prevailing fashion which was the invention of an idiot next mail he asked permission to print that meaningless remark i answered no courteously but still no explaining that i could not afford to be placed in the attitude of trying to influence people with a mere worthless guess what a scorcher i got next mail such irony such sarcasm such caustic praise of my superhonorable loyalty to the public and withal such compassion for my stupidity too in not being able to understand my own language i cannot remember the words of this letter broadside but there was about a page used up in turning this idea round and round and exposing it in different lights unmailed answer dear sir what is the trouble with you if it is your viscera you cannot have them taken out and reorganized a moment too soon i mean if they are inside but if you are composed of them that is another matter is it your brain but it could not be your brain possibly it is your skull you want to look out for that some people when they get an idea it pries the structure apart your system of notation has got in there and couldnt find room without a doubt that is what the trouble is your skull was not made to put ideas in it was made to throw potatoes at yours truly mailed answer dear sir come come take a walk you disturb the children yours truly there was a day now happily nearly over when certain newspapers made a practice of inviting men distinguished in any walk of life to give their time and effort without charge to express themselves on some subject of the day or perhaps they were asked to send their favorite passages in prose or verse with the reasons why such symposiums were features that cost the newspapers only the writing of a number of letters stationery and postage to one such invitation mark twain wrote two replies they follow herewith unmailed answer dear sir i have received your proposition which you have imitated from a pauper london periodical which had previously imitated the idea of this sort of mendicancy from seventhrate american journalism where it originated as a variation of the inexpensive interview why do you buy associated press dispatches to make your paper the more salable you answer but why dont you try to beg them why do you discriminate i can sell my stuff why should i give it to you why dont you ask me for a shirt what is the difference between asking me for the worth of a shirt and asking me for the shirt itself perhaps you didnt know you were begging i would not use that argument it makes the user a fool the passage of poetry or prose if you will which has taken deepest root in my thought and which i oftenest return to and dwell upon with keenest no matter what is this that the proper place for journalists who solicit literary charity is on the street corner with their hats in their hands mailed answer dear sir your favor of recent date is received but i am obliged by press of work to decline the manager of a traveling theatrical company wrote that he had taken the liberty of dramatizing tom sawyer and would like also the use of the authors name the idea being to convey to the public that it was a mark twain play in return for this slight favor the manager sent an invitation for mark twain to come and see the play to be present on the opening night as it were at his the managers expense he added that if the play should be a go in the cities there might be some arrangement of profits apparently these inducements did not appeal to mark twain the long unmailed reply is the more interesting but probably the briefer one that follows it was quite as effective unmailed answer hartford sept dear sir and so it has got around to you at last and you also have taken the liberty you are no when sweeter and better people including the author have tried to dramatize tom sawyer and did not arrive what sort of show do you suppose you stand that is a book dear sir which cannot be dramatized one might as well try to dramatize any other hymn tom sawyer is simply a hymn put into prose form to give it a worldly air why the pale doubt that flitteth dim and nebulous athwart the forecastle of your third sentence have no fears your piece will be a go it will go out the back door on the first night theyve all done it the so will not one of us ever thought of the simple device of halfsoling himself with a stovelid ah what suffering a little hindsight would have saved us treasure this hint how kind of you to invite me to the funeral go to i have attended a thousand of them i have seen tom sawyers remains in all the different kinds of dramatic shrouds there are you cannot start anything fresh are you serious when you propose to pay my expence if that is the susquehannian way of spelling it and can you be aware that i charge a hundred dollars a mile when i travel for pleasure do you realize that it is miles to susquehanna would it be handy for you to send me the first so i could be counting it as i come along because railroading is pretty dreary to a sensitive nature when theres nothing sordid to buck at for zeitvertreib now as i understand it dear and magnanimous you are going to recreate tom sawyer dramatically and then do me the compliment to put me in the bills as father of this shady offspring sir do you know that this kind of a compliment has destroyed people before now listen twentyfour years ago i was strangely handsome the remains of it are still visible through the rifts of time i was so handsome that human activities ceased as if spellbound when i came in view and even inanimate things stopped to look like locomotives and district messenger boys and soon in san francisco in the rainy season i was often mistaken for fair weather upon one occasion i was traveling in the sonora region and stopped for an hours nooning to rest my horse and myself all the town came out to look the tribes of indians gathered to look a piute squaw named her baby for me a voluntary compliment which pleased me greatly other attentions were paid me last of all arrived the president and faculty of sonora university and offered me the post of professor of moral culture and the dogmatic humanities which i accepted gratefully and entered at once upon my duties but my name had pleased the indians and in the deadly kindness of their hearts they went on naming their babies after me i tried to stop it but the indians could not understand why i should object to so manifest a compliment the thing grew and grew and spread and spread and became exceedingly embarrassing the university stood it a couple of years but then for the sake of the college they felt obliged to call a halt although i had the sympathy of the whole faculty the president himself said to me i am as sorry as i can be for you and would still hold out if there were any hope ahead but you see how it is there are a hundred and thirtytwo of them already and fourteen precincts to hear from the circumstance has brought your name into most wide and unfortunate renown it causes much comment i believe that that is not an overstatement some of this comment is palliative but some of it by patrons at a distance who only know the statistics without the explanation is offensive and in some cases even violent nine students have been called home the trustees of the college have been growing more and more uneasy all these last months steadily along with the implacable increase in your census and i will not conceal from you that more than once they have touched upon the expediency of a change in the professorship of moral culture the coarsely sarcastic editorial in yesterdays alta headed give the moral acrobat a rest has brought things to a crisis and i am charged with the unpleasant duty of receiving your resignation i know you only mean me a kindness dear but it is a most deadly mistake please do not name your injun for me truly yours mailed answer new york sept dear sir necessarily i cannot assent to so strange a proposition and i think it but fair to warn you that if you put the piece on the stage you must take the legal consequences yours respectfully s l clemens before the days of international copyright no american authors books were pirated more freely by canadian publishers than those of mark twain it was always a sore point with him that these books cheaply printed found their way into the united states and were sold in competition with his better editions the law on the subject seemed to be rather hazy and its various interpretations exasperating in the next unmailed letter mark twain relieves himself to a misguided official the letter is worth reading today if for no other reason to show the absurdity of copyright conditions which prevailed at that time unmailed letter to h c christiancy on book piracy hartford dec h c christiancy esq dear sir as i understand it the position of the u s government is this if a person be captured on the border with counterfeit bonds in his hands bonds of the n y central railway for instance the procedure in his case shall be as follows if the n y c have not previously filed in the several police offices along the border proof of ownership of the originals of the bonds the government officials must collect a duty on the counterfeits and then let them go ahead and circulate in this country but if there is proof already on file then the n y c may pay the duty and take the counterfeits but in no case will the united states consent to go without its share of the swag it is delicious the biggest and proudest government on earth turned sneakthief collecting pennies on stolen property and pocketing them with a greasy and libidinous leer going into partnership with foreign thieves to rob its own children and when the child escapes the foreigner descending to the abysmal baseness of hanging on and robbing the infant all alone by itself dear sir this is not any more respectable than for a father to collect toll on the forced prostitution of his own daughter in fact it is the same thing upon these terms what is a u s custom house but a fence that is all it is a legalized trader in stolen goods and this nasty law this filthy law this unspeakable law calls itself a regulation for the protection of owners of copyright can sarcasm go further than that in what way does it protect them inspiration itself could not furnish a rational answer to that question whom does it protect then nobody as far as i can see but the foreign thiefsometimes and his fellowfootpad the u s government all the time what could the central company do with the counterfeit bonds after it had bought them of the star spangled banner masterthief sell them at a dollar apiece and fetch down the market for the genuine hundreddollar bond what could i do with that cent copy of roughing it which the united states has collared on the border and is waiting to release to me for cash in case i am willing to come down to its moral level and help rob myself sell it at ten or fifteen cents duty added and destroy the market for the original book who ever did invent that law i would like to know the name of that immortal jackass dear sir i appreciate your courtesy in stretching your authority in the desire to do me a kindness and i sincerely thank you for it but i have no use for that book and if i were even starving for it i would not pay duty on in either to get it or suppress it no doubt there are ways in which i might consent to go into partnership with thieves and fences but this is not one of them this one revolts the remains of my selfrespect turns my stomach i think i could companion with a highwayman who carried a shotgun and took many risks yes i think i should like that if i were younger but to go in with a big rich government that robs paupers and the widows and orphans of paupers and takes no risk why the thought just gags me oh no i shall never pay any duties on pirated books of mine i am much too respectable for that yet awhile but here one thing that grovels me is this as far as i can discover while freely granting that the u s copyright laws are far and away the most idiotic that exist anywhere on the face of the earth they dont authorize the government to admit pirated books into this country toll or no toll and so i think that that regulation is the invention of one of those people as a rule early stricken of god intellectually the departmental interpreters of the laws in washington they can always be depended on to take any reasonably good law and interpret the common sense all out of it they can be depended on every time to defeat a good law and make it inoperative yes and utterly grotesque too mere matter for laughter and derision take some of the decisions of the postoffice department for instance though i do not mean to suggest that that asylum is any worse than the others for the breeding and nourishing of incredible lunatics i merely instance it because it happens to be the first to come into my mind take that case of a few years ago where the p m general suddenly issued an edict requiring you to add the name of the state after boston new york chicago c in your superscriptions on pain of having your letter stopped and forwarded to the deadletter office yes and i believe he required the county too he made one little concession in favor of new york you could say new york city and stop there but if you left off the city you must add n y to your new york why it threw the business of the whole country into chaos and brought commerce almost to a standstill now think of that when that man goes to to well wherever he is going to we shant want the microscopic details of his address i guess we can find him well as i was saying i believe that this whole paltry and ridiculous swindle is a pure creation of one of those cabbages that used to be at the head of one of those retreats down there departments you know and that you will find it so if you will look into it and moreover but land i reckon we are both tired by this time truly yours mark twain xxvii miscellaneous letters of literary articles peaceful days at the farm favorite reading apology to mrs cleveland etc we have seen in the preceding chapter how unknown aspirants in one field or another were always seeking to benefit by mark twains reputation once he remarked the symbol of the human race ought to be an ax every human being has one concealed about him somewhere he declared when a stranger called on him or wrote to him in nine cases out of ten he could distinguish the gleam of the ax almost immediately the following letter is closely related to those of the foregoing chapter only that this one was mailed not once but many times in some form adapted to the specific applicant it does not matter to whom it was originally written the name would not be recognized to mrs t concerning unearned credentials etc hartford my dear madam it is an idea which many people have had but it is of no value i have seen it tried out many and many a time i have seen a lady lecturer urged and urged upon the public in a lavishly complimentary document signed by longfellow whittier holmes and some others of supreme celebrity but there was nothing in her and she failed if there had been any great merit in her she never would have needed those mens help and at her rather mature age would never have consented to ask for it there is an unwritten law about human successes and your sister must bow to that law she must submit to its requirements in brief this law is no occupation without an apprenticeship no pay to the apprentice this law stands right in the way of the subaltern who wants to be a general before he has smelt powder and it stands and should stand in everybodys way who applies for pay or position before he has served his apprenticeship and proved himself your sisters course is perfectly plain let her enclose this letter to maj j b pond and offer to lecture a year for a week and her expenses the contract to be annullable by him at any time after a months notice but not annullable by her at all the second year he to have her services if he wants them at a trifle under the best price offered her by anybody else she can learn her trade in those two years and then be entitled to remuneration but she can not learn it in any less time than that unless she is a human miracle try it and do not be afraid it is the fair and right thing if she wins she will win squarely and righteously and never have to blush truly yours s l clemens howells wrote in february offering to get a publisher to take the library of humor off mark twains hands howells had been paid twentysix hundred dollars for the work on it and his conscience hurt him when he reflected that the book might never be used in this letter he also refers to one of the disastrous inventions in which clemens had invested a method of casting brass dies for stamping bookcovers and wallpaper howellss purpose was to introduce something of the matter into his next story mark twains reply gives us a light on this particular invention hartford feb dear howells i was in new york five days ago and webster mentioned the library and proposed to publish it a year or a year and half hence i have written him your proposition today the library is part of the property of the c l w co firm i dont remember what that technical phrase was but i think you will find it in any cyclopedia under the head of brass the thing i best remember is that the selfstyled inventor had a very ingenious way of keeping me from seeing him apply his invention the first appointment was spoiled by his burning down the mans shop in which it was to be done the night before the second was spoiled by his burning down his own shop the night before he unquestionably did both of these things he really had no invention the whole project was a blackmailing swindle and cost me several thousand dollars the slip you sent me from the may study has delighted mrs clemens and me to the marrow to think that thing might be possible to many but to be brave enough to say it is possible to you only i certainly believe the longer i live the clearer i perceive how unmatchable how unapproachable a compliment one pays when he says of a man he has the courage to utter his convictions havent you had reviewers talk alps to you and then print potato hills i havent as good an opinion of my work as you hold of it but ive always done what i could to secure and enlarge my good opinion of it ive always said to myself everybody reads it and thats something it surely isnt pernicious or the most acceptable people would get pretty tired of it and when a critic said by implication that it wasnt high and fine through the remark high and fine literature is wine i retorted confidentially to myself yes high and fine literature is wine and mine is only water but everybody likes water you didnt tell me to return that proofslip so i have pasted it into my private scrapbook none will see it there with a thousand thanks ys ever mark our next letter is an unmailed answer but it does not belong with the others having been withheld for reasons of quite a different sort jeanette gilder then of the critic was one of mark twains valued friends in the comment which he made when it was shown to him twentytwo years later he tells us why he thinks this letter was not sent the name restandbethankful was the official title given to the summer place at elmira but it was more often known as quarry farm to jeannette gilder not mailed hartford may my dear miss gilder we shall spend the summer at the same old placethe remote farm called restandbethankful on top of the hills three miles from elmira n y your other question is harder to answer it is my habit to keep four or five books in process of erection all the time and every summer add a few courses of bricks to two or three of them but i cannot forecast which of the two or three it is going to be it takes seven years to complete a book by this method but still it is a good method gives the public a rest i have been accused of rushing into print prematurely moved thereto by greediness for money but in truth i have never done that do you care for trifles of information well then tom sawyer and the prince and the pauper were each on the stocks two or three years and old times on the mississippi eight one of my unfinished books has been on the stocks sixteen years another seventeen this latter book could have been finished in a day at any time during the past five years but as in the first of these two narratives all the action takes place in noahs ark and as in the other the action takes place in heaven there seemed to be no hurry and so i have not hurried tales of stirring adventure in those localities do not need to be rushed to publication lest they get stale by waiting in twentyone years with all my time at my free disposal i have written and completed only eleven books whereas with half the labor that a journalist does i could have written sixty in that time i do not greatly mind being accused of a proclivity for rushing into print but at the same time i dont believe that the charge is really well founded suppose i did write eleven books have you nothing to be grateful for go to remember the fortynine which i didnt write truly yours s l clemens notes added twentytwo years later stormfield april it seems the letter was not sent i probably feared she might print it and i couldnt find a way to say so without running a risk of hurting her no one would hurt jeannette gilder purposely and no one would want to run the risk of doing it unintentionally she is my neighbor six miles away now and i must ask her about this ancient letter i note with pride and pleasure that i told no untruths in my unsent answer i still have the habit of keeping unfinished books lying around years and years waiting i have four or five novels on hand at present in a halffinished condition and it is more than three years since i have looked at any of them i have no intention of finishing them i could complete all of them in less than a year if the impulse should come powerfully upon me long long ago moneynecessity furnished that impulse once following the equator but mere desire for money has never furnished it so far as i remember not even moneynecessity was able to overcome me on a couple of occasions when perhaps i ought to have allowed it to succeed while i was a bankrupt and in debt two offers were made me for weekly literary contributions to continue during a year and they would have made a debtless man of me but i declined them with my wifes full approval for i had known of no instance where a man had pumped himself out once a week and failed to run emptyings before the year was finished as to that noahs ark book i began it in edinburgh in this is not quite correct the noahs ark book was begun in buffalo in i dont know where the manuscript is now it was a diary which professed to be the work of shem but wasnt i began it again several months ago but only for recreation i hadnt any intention of carrying it to a finish or even to the end of the first chapter in fact as to the book whose action takes place in heaven that was a small thing captain stormfields visit to heaven it lay in my pigeonholes years then i took it out and printed it in harpers monthly last year s l c in the next letter we get a pretty and peaceful picture of restandbethankful these were mark twains balmy days the financial drain of the typemachine was heavy but not yet exhausting and the prospect of vast returns from it seemed to grow brighter each day his publishing business though less profitable was still prosperous his family life was ideal how gratefully then he could enter into the peace of that perfect day to mrs orion clemens in keokuk ia on the hill near elmira july dear mollie this is a superb sunday for weather very cloudy and the thermometer as low as the city in the valley is purple with shade as seen from up here at the study the cranes are reading and loafing in the canvascurtained summerhouse yards away on a higher the highest point the cats are loafing over at ellerslie which is the childrens estate and dwellinghouse in their own private grounds by deed from susie crane a hundred yards from the study amongst the clover and young oaks and willows livy is down at the house but i shall now go and bring her up to the cranes to help us occupy the lounges and hammocks whence a great panorama of distant hill and valley and city is seeable the children have gone on a lark through the neighboring hills and woods it is a perfect day indeed with love to you all sam two days after this letter was written we get a hint of what was the beginning of business trouble that is to say of the failing health of charles l webster webster was ambitious nervous and not robust he had overworked and was paying the penalty his trouble was neurasthenia and he was presently obliged to retire altogether from the business the sam and mary mentioned were samuel moffet and his wife to mrs pamela moffett in fredonia n y elmira july my dear sister i had no idea that charleys case was so serious i knew it was bad and persistent but i was not aware of the full size of the matter i have just been writing to a friend in hartford who treated what i imagine was a similar case surgically last fall and produced a permanent cure if this is a like case charley must go to him if relief fails there he must take the required rest whether the business can stand it or not it is most pleasant to hear such prosperous accounts of sam and mary i do not see how sam could well be more advantageously fixed he can grow up with that paper and achieve a successful life it is not all holiday here with susie and clara this time they have to put in some little time every day on their studies jean thinks she is studying too but i dont know what it is unless it is the horses she spends the day under their heels in the stables and that is but a continuation of her hartford system of culture with love from us all to you all affectionately sam mark twain had a few books that he read regularly every year or two among these were pepyss diary suetoniuss lives of the twelve caesars and thomas carlyles french revolution he had a passion for history biography and personal memoirs of any sort in his early life he had cared very little for poetry but along in the middle eighties he somehow acquired a taste for browning and became absorbed in it a browning club assembled as often as once a week at the clemens home in hartford to listen to his readings of the master he was an impressive reader and he carefully prepared himself for these occasions indicating by graduated underscorings the exact values he wished to give to words and phrases those were memorable gatherings and they must have continued through at least two winters it is one of the puzzling phases of mark twains character that notwithstanding his passion for direct and lucid expression he should have found pleasure in the poems of robert browning to w d howells in boston elmira aug my dear howells how stunning are the changes which age makes in a man while he sleeps when i finished carlyles french revolution in i was a girondin every time i have read it since i have read it differently being influenced and changed little by little by life and environment and taine and st simon and now i lay the book down once more and recognize that i am a sansculotte and not a pale characterless sansculotte but a marat carlyle teaches no such gospel so the change is in me in my vision of the evidences people pretend that the bible means the same to them at that it did at all former milestones in their journey i wonder how they can lie so it comes of practice no doubt they would not say that of dickenss or scotts books nothing remains the same when a man goes back to look at the house of his childhood it has always shrunk there is no instance of such a house being as big as the picture in memory and imagination call for shrunk how why to its correct dimensions the house hasnt altered this is the first time it has been in focus well thats loss to have house and bible shrink so under the disillusioning corrected angle is lossfor a moment but there are compensations you tilt the tube skyward and bring planets and comets and corona flames a hundred and fifty thousand miles high into the field which i see you have done and found tolstoi i havent got him in focus yet but ive got browning ys ever mark mention has been made already of mark twains tendency to absentmindedness he was always forgetting engagements or getting them wrong once he hurried to an afternoon party and finding the mistress of the house alone sat down and talked to her comfortably for an hour or two not remembering his errand at all it was only when he reached home that he learned that the party had taken place the week before it was always dangerous for him to make engagements and he never seemed to profit by sorrowful experience we however may profit now by one of his amusing apologies to mrs grover cleveland in washington hartford nov my dear madam i do not know how it is in the white house but in this house of ours whenever the minor half of the administration tries to run itself without the help of the major half it gets aground last night when i was offered the opportunity to assist you in the throwing open the warner brothers superb benefaction in bridgeport to those fortunate women i naturally appreciated the honor done me and promptly seized my chance i had an engagement but the circumstances washed it out of my mind if i had only laid the matter before the major half of the administration on the spot there would have been no blunder but i never thought of that so when i did lay it before her later i realized once more that it will not do for the literary fraction of a combination to try to manage affairs which properly belong in the office of the business bulk of it i suppose the president often acts just like that goes and makes an impossible promise and you never find it out until it is next to impossible to break it up and set things straight again well that is just our way exactlyone half of the administration always busy getting the family into trouble and the other half busy getting it out again and so we do seem to be all pretty much alike after all the fact is i had forgotten that we were to have a dinner party on that bridgeport date i thought it was the next day which is a good deal of an improvement for me because i am more used to being behind a day or two than ahead but that is just the difference between one end of this kind of an administration and the other end of it as you have noticed yourself the other end does not forget these things just so with a funeral if it is the mans funeral he is most always there of coursebut that is no credit to him he wouldnt be there if you depended on hint to remember about it whereas if on the other hand but i seem to have got off from my line of argument somehow never mind about the funeral of course i am not meaning to say anything against funerals that is as occasions mere occasions for as diversions i dont think they amount to much but as i was saying if you are not busy i will look back and see what it was i was saying i dont seem to find the place but anyway she was as sorry as ever anybody could be that i could not go to bridgeport but there was no help for it and i i have been not only sorry but very sincerely ashamed of having made an engagement to go without first making sure that i could keep it and i do not know how to apologize enough for my heedless breach of good manners with the sincerest respect s l clemens samuel clemens was one of the very few authors to copyright a book in england before the enactment of the international copyright law as early as he copyrighted roughing it in england and piratical publishers there respected his rights finally in the inland revenue office assessed him with income tax which he very willingly paid instructing his london publishers chatto windus to pay on the full amount he had received from them but when the receipt for his taxes came it was nearly a yard square with due postage of considerable amount then he wrote to mr chatto of chatto windus in london hartford dec my dear chatto look here i dont mind paying the tax but dont you let the inland revenue office send me any more receipts for it for the postage is something perfectly demoralizing if they feel obliged to print a receipt on a horseblanket why dont they hire a ship and send it over at their own expense wasnt it good that they caught me out with an old book instead of a new one the tax on a new book would bankrupt a body it was my purpose to go to england next may and stay the rest of the year but ive found that tax office out just in time my new book would issue in march and they would tax the sale in both countries come we must get up a compromise somehow you go and work in on the good side of those revenue people and get them to take the profits and give me the tax then i will come over and we will divide the swag and have a good time i wish you to thank mr christmas for me but we wont resist the country that allows me copyright has a right to tax me sincerely yours s l clemens another english tax assessment came that year based on the report that it was understood that he was going to become an english resident and had leased buckenham hall norwich for a year clemens wrote his publishers i will explain that all that about buckenham hall was an english newspapers mistake i was not in england and if i had been i wouldnt have been at buckenham hall anyway but at buckingham palace or i would have endeavored to find out the reason why clemens made literature out of this tax experience he wrote an open letter to her majesty queen victoria such a letter has no place in this collection it was published in the drawer of harpers magazine december and is now included in the uniform edition of his works under the title of a petition to the queen of england from the following letter written at the end of the year we gather that the typesetter costs were beginning to make a difference in the clemens economies to mrs moffett in fredonia hartford dec dear pamela will you take this and buy some candy or some other trifle for yourself and sam and his wife to remember that we remember you by if we werent a little crowded this year by the typesetter id send a check large enough to buy a family bible or some other useful thing like that however we go on and on but the typesetter goes on forever at a month which is much more satisfactory than was the case the first seventeen months when the bill only averaged and promised to take a thousand years well be through now in or months i reckon and then the strain will let up and we can breathe freely once more whether success ensues or failure even with a typesetter on hand we ought not to be in the least scrimpedbut it would take a long letter to explain why and who is to blame all the family send love to all of you and best christmas wishes for your prosperity affectionately sam xxviii letters a yale degree work on the yankee on interviewing etc mark twain received his first college degree when he was made master of arts by yale in june editor of the courant charles h clarke was selected to notify him of his new title clarke was an old friend to whom clemens could write familiarly to charles h clarke in hartford elmira july my dear charles thanks for your thanks and for your initiation intentions i shall be ready for you i feel mighty proud of that degree in fact i could squeeze the truth a little closer and say vain of it and why shouldnt i be i am the only literary animal of my particular subspecies who has ever been given a degree by any college in any age of the world as far as i know sincerely yours s l clemens m a reply charles h clarke to s l clemens my dear friend you are the only literary animal of your particular subspecies in existence and youve no cause for humility in the fact yale has done herself at least as much credit as she has done you and dont you forget it c h c with the exception of his brief return to the river in mark twain had been twentyseven years away from pilots and piloting nevertheless he always kept a tender place in his heart for the old times and for old river comrades major jack downing had been a mississippi pilot of early days but had long since retired from the river to a comfortable life ashore in an ohio town clemens had not heard from him for years when a letter came which invited the following answer to major jack downing in middleport ohio elmira n yno month dear major and has it come to this that the dead rise up and speak for i supposed that you were dead it has been so long since i heard your name and how young youve grown i was a mere boy when i knew you on the river where you had been piloting for years and now you are only a year and a half older than i am i mean to go to hot springs myself and get or years knocked off my age its manifestly the place that ponce de leon was striking for but the poor fellow lost the trail possibly i may see you for i shall be in st louis a day or two in november i propose to go down the river and note the changes once more before i make the long crossing and perhaps you can come there will you i want to see all the boys that are left alive and so grant marsh too is flourishing yet a mighty good fellow and smart too when we were taking that wood flat down to the chambers which was aground i soon saw that i was a perfect lubber at piloting such a thing i saw that i could never hit the chambers with it so i resigned in marshs favor and he accomplished the task to my admiration we should all have gone to the mischief if i had remained in authority i always had good judgement more judgement than talent in fact no the nom de plume did not originate in that way capt sellers used the signature mark twain himself when he used to write up the antiquities in the way of river reminiscences for the new orleans picayune he hated me for burlesquing them in an article in the true delta so four years later when he died i robbed the corpse that is i confiscated the nom de plume i have published this vital fact times now but no matter it is good practice it is about the only fact that i can tell the same way every time very glad indeed to hear from you major and shall be gladder still to see you in november truly yours s l clemens he did not make the journey down the river planned for that year he had always hoped to make another steamboat trip with bixby but one thing and another interfered and he did not go again authors were always sending their books to mark twain to read and no busy man was ever more kindly disposed toward such offerings more generously considerate of the senders louis pendleton was a young unknown writer in but clemens took time to read his story carefully and to write to him about it a letter that cost precious time thought and effort it must have rejoiced the young mans heart to receive a letter like that from one whom all young authors held supreme to louis pendleton in georgia elmira n y aug my dear sir i found your letter an hour ago among some others which had lain forgotten a couple of weeks and i at once stole time enough to read ariadne stole is the right word for the summer vacation is the only chance i get for work so no minute subtracted from work is borrowed it is stolen but this time i do not repent as a rule people dont send me books which i can thank them for and so i say nothing which looks uncourteous but i thank you ariadne is a beautiful and satisfying story and true too which is the best part of a story or indeed of any other thing even liars have to admit that if they are intelligent liars i mean in their private the word conscientious written but erased intervals i struck that word out because a mans private thought can never be a lie what he thinks is to him the truth always what he speaks but these be platitudes if you want me to pick some flaws very well but i do it unwillingly i notice one thing which one may notice also in my books and in all books whether written by man or god trifling carelessness of statement or expression if i think that you meant that she took the lizard from the water which she had drawn from the well it is evidence it is almost proof that your words were not as clear as they should have been true it is only a trifling thing but so is mist on a mirror i would have hung the pail on ariadnes arm you did not deceive me when you said that she carried it under her arm for i knew she didnt still it was not your right to mar my enjoyment of the graceful picture if the pail had been a portfolio i wouldnt be making these remarks the engraver of a fine picture revises and revises and revises and then revises and revises and revises and then repeats and always the charm of that picture grows under his hand it was good enough before told its story and was beautiful true and a lovely girl is lovely with freckles but she isnt at her level best with them this is not hypercriticism you have had training enough to know that so much concerning exactness of statement in that other notsmall matter selection of the exact single word you are hard to catch still i should hold that mrs walker considered that there was no occasion for concealment that motive implied a deeper mental search than she expended on the matter that it doesnt reflect the attitude of her mind with precision is this hypercriticism i shant dispute it i only say that if mrs walker didnt go so far as to have a motive i had to suggest that when a word is so near the right one that a body cant quite tell whether it is or isnt its good politics to strike it out and go for the thesaurus thats all motive may stand but you have allowed a snake to scream and i will not concede that that was the best word i do not apologize for saying these things for they are not said in the speckhunting spirit but in the spirit of wanttohelpifican they would be useful to me if said to me once a month they may be useful to you said once i save the other stories for my real vacation which is nine months long to my sorrow i thank you again truly yours s l clemens in the next letter we get a sidelight on the typesetting machine the frankenstein monster that was draining their substance and holding out false hopes of relief and golden return the program here outlined was one that would continue for several years yet with the end always in sight but never quite attained to orion clemens in keokuk ia oct private saturday th by a closely calculated estimate there were days work to do on the machine we can use men but not constantly if they could work constantly it would complete the machine in days of course they will all be on hand and under wages and each will get in all the work there is opportunity for but by how much they can reduce the days toward the days nobody can tell today i pay pratt whitney this squares back indebtedness and everything to date they began about may or april or march along there somewhere and have always kept from a dozen to two dozen masterhands on the machine that outgo is done men for a month or two will close up that leak and caulk it work on the patents is also kind of drawing toward a conclusion love to you both all well here and give our love to ma if she can get the idea sam mark twain that year was working pretty steadily on the yankee at king arthurs court a book which he had begun two years before he had published nothing since the huck finn story and his company was badly in need of a new book by an author of distinction also it was highly desirable to earn money for himself wherefore he set to work to finish the yankee story he had worked pretty steadily that summer in his elmira study but on his return to hartford found a good deal of confusion in the house so went over to twichells where carpenter work was in progress he seems to have worked there successfully though what improvement of conditions he found in that numerous lively household over those at home it would be difficult to say to theodore w crane at quarry farm elmira n y friday oct dear theo i am here in twichells house at work with the noise of the children and an army of carpenters to help of course they dont help but neither do they hinder its like a boilerfactory for racket and in nailing a wooden ceiling onto the room under me the hammering tickles my feet amazingly sometimes and jars my table a good deal but i never am conscious of the racket at all and i move my feet into position of relief without knowing when i do it i began here monday morning and have done eighty pages since i was so tired last night that i thought i would lie abed and rest today but i couldnt resist i mean to try to knock off tomorrow but its doubtful if i do i want to finish the day the machine finishes and a week ago the closest calculations for that indicated oct but experience teaches me that their calculations will miss fire as usual the other day the children were projecting a purchase livy and i to furnish the money a dollar and a half jean discouraged the idea she said we havent got any money children if you would think you would remember the machine isnt done its billiards tonight i wish you were here with love to you both s l c p s i got it all wrong it wasnt the children it was marie she wanted a box of blacking for the childrens shoes jean reproved herand said why marie you mustnt ask for things now the machine isnt done s l c the letter that follows is to another of his old pilot friends one who was also a schoolmate will bowen of hannibal there is today no means of knowing the occasion upon which this letter was written but it does not matter it is the letter itself that is of chief value to will bowen in hannibal mo hartford nov dear will i received your letter yesterday evening just as i was starting out of town to attend a wedding and so my mind was privately busy all the evening in the midst of the maelstrom of chat and chaff and laughter with the sort of reflections which create themselves examine themselves and continue themselves unaffected by surroundings unaffected that is understood by the surroundings but not uninfluenced by them here was the near presence of the two supreme events of life marriage which is the beginning of life and death which is the end of it i found myself seeking chances to shirk into corners where i might think undisturbed and the most i got out of my thought was this both marriage and death ought to be welcome the one promises happiness doubtless the other assures it a long procession of people filed through my mind people whom you and i knew so many years ago so many centuries ago it seems likeand these ancient dead marched to the soft marriage music of a band concealed in some remote room of the house and the contented music and the dreaming shades seemed in right accord with each other and fitting nobody else knew that a procession of the dead was passing though this noisy swarm of the living but there it was and to me there was nothing uncanny about it rio they were welcome faces to me i would have liked to bring up every creature we knew in those days even the dumb animals it would be bathing in the fabled fountain of youth we all feel your deep trouble with you and we would hope if we might but your words deny us that privilege to die ones self is a thing that must be easy and of light consequence but to lose a part of ones self well we know how deep that pang goes we who have suffered that disaster received that wound which cannot heal sincerely your friend s l clemens his next is of quite a different nature evidently the typesetting conditions had alarmed orion and he was undertaking some economies with a view of retrenchment orion was always reducing economy to science once at an earlier date he recorded that he had figured his personal living expenses down to sixty cents a week but inasmuch as he was then by his own confession unable to earn the sixty cents this particular economy was wasted orion was a trial certainly and the explosion that follows was not without excuse furthermore it was not as bad as it sounds mark twains rages always had an element of humor in them a fact which no one more than orion himself would appreciate he preserved this letter quietly noting on the envelope letter from sam about mas nurse letter to orion clemens in keokuk iowa nov jesus christ it is perilous to write such a man you can go crazy on less material than anybody that ever lived what in hell has produced all these maniacal imaginings you told me you had hired an attendant for ma now hire one instantly and stop this nonsense of wearing mollie and yourself out trying to do that nursing yourselves hire the attendant and tell me her cost so that i can instruct webster co to add it every month to what they already send dont fool away any more time about this and dont write me any more damned rot about storms and inability to pay trivial sums of money and and hell and damnation you see ive read only the first page of your letter i wouldnt read the rest for a million dollars yr sam p s dont imagine that i have lost my temper because i swear i swear all day but i do not lose my temper and dont imagine that i am on my way to the poorhouse for i am not or that i am uneasy for i am not or that i am uncomfortable or unhappy for i never am i dont know what it is to be unhappy or uneasy and i am not going to try to learn how at this late day sam few men were ever interviewed oftener than mark twain yet he never welcomed interviewers and was seldom satisfied with them what i say in an interview loses it character in print he often remarked all its life and personality the reporter realizes this himself and tries to improve upon me but he doesnt help matters any edward w bok before he became editor of the ladies home journal was conducting a weekly syndicate column under the title of boks literary leaves it usually consisted of news and gossip of writers comment etc literary odds and ends and occasional interviews with distinguished authors he went up to hartford one day to interview mark twain the result seemed satisfactory to bok but wishing to be certain that it would be satisfactory to clemens he sent him a copy for approval the interview was not returned in the place of it came a letternot altogether disappointing as the reader may believe to edward w bok in new york my dear mr bok no no it is like most interviews pure twaddle and valueless for several quite plain and simple reasons an interview must as a rule be an absurdity and chiefly for this reason it is an attempt to use a boat on land or a wagon on water to speak figuratively spoken speech is one thing written speech is quite another print is the proper vehicle for the latter but it isnt for the former the moment talk is put into print you recognize that it is not what it was when you heard it you perceive that an immense something has disappeared from it that is its soul you have nothing but a dead carcass left on your hands color play of feature the varying modulations of the voice the laugh the smile the informing inflections everything that gave that body warmth grace friendliness and charm and commended it to your affections or at least to your tolerance is gone and nothing is left but a pallid stiff and repulsive cadaver such is talk almost invariably as you see it lying in state in an interview the interviewer seldom tries to tell one how a thing was said he merely puts in the naked remark and stops there when one writes for print his methods are very different he follows forms which have but little resemblance to conversation but they make the reader understand what the writer is trying to convey and when the writer is making a story and finds it necessary to report some of the talk of his characters observe how cautiously and anxiously he goes at that risky and difficult thing if he had dared to say that thing in my presence said alfred taking a mock heroic attitude and casting an arch glance upon the company blood would have flowed if he had dared to say that thing in my presence said hawkwood with that in his eye which caused more than one heart in that guilty assemblage to quake blood would have flowed if he had dared to say that thing in my presence said the paltry blusterer with valor on his tongue and pallor on his lips blood would have flowed so painfully aware is the novelist that naked talk in print conveys no meaning that he loads and often overloads almost every utterance of his characters with explanations and interpretations it is a loud confession that print is a poor vehicle for talk it is a recognition that uninterpreted talk in print would result in confusion to the reader not instruction now in your interview you have certainly been most accurate you have set down the sentences i uttered as i said them but you have not a word of explanation what my manner was at several points is not indicated therefore no reader can possibly know where i was in earnest and where i was joking or whether i was joking altogether or in earnest altogether such a report of a conversation has no value it can convey many meanings to the reader but never the right one to add interpretations which would convey the right meaning is a something which would require what an art so high and fine and difficult that no possessor of it would ever be allowed to waste it on interviews no spare the reader and spare me leave the whole interview out it is rubbish i wouldnt talk in my sleep if i couldnt talk better than that if you wish to print anything print this letter it may have some value for it may explain to a reader here and there why it is that in interviews as a rule men seem to talk like anybody but themselves very sincerely yours mark twain xxix letters the machine death of mr crane conclusion of the yankee in january clemens believed after his long seven years of waiting fruition had come in the matter of the type machine paige the inventor seemed at last to have given it its finishing touches the mechanical marvel that had cost so much time mental stress and a fortune in money stood complete responsive to the human will and touch the latest and one of the greatest wonders of the world to george standring a london printer and publisher clemens wrote the machine is finished and added this is by far the most marvelous invention ever contrived by man and it is not a thing of rags and patches it is made of massive steel and will last a century in his fever of enthusiasm on that day when he had actually seen it in operation he wrote a number of exuberant letters they were more or less duplicates but as the one to his brother is of fuller detail and more intimate than the others it has been selected for preservation here to orion clemens in keokuk hartford jan dear orion at this afternoon a line of movable types was spaced and justified by machinery for the first time in the history of the world and i was there to see it was done automatically instantly perfectly this is indeed the first line of movable types that ever was perfectly spaced and perfectly justified on this earth this was the last function that remained to be tested and so by long odds the most amazing and extraordinary invention ever born of the brain of man stands completed and perfect livy is down stairs celebrating but its a cunning devil is that machine and knows more than any man that ever lived you shall see we made the test in this way we set up a lot of random letters in a stick threefourths of a line then filled out the line with quads representing spaces each space to be of an inch thick then we threw aside the quads and put the letters into the machine and formed them into twoletter words leaving the words separated by twoinch vacancies then we started up the machine slowly by hand and fastened our eyes on the spaceselecting pins the first pinblock projected its third pin as the first word came traveling along the raceway second block did the same but the third block projected its second pin oh hell stop the machine something wrong its going to set a space general consternation a foreign substance has got into the spacing plates this from the head mathematician yes that is the trouble assented the foreman paige examined no look in and you can see that theres nothing of the kind further examination now i know what it is what it must be one of those plates projects and binds its too bad the first testis a failure a pause well boys no use to cry get to work take the machine down no hold on dont touch a thing go right ahead we are fools the machine isnt the machine knows what its about there is a speck of dirt on one of those types and the machine is putting in a thinner space to allow for it that was just it the machine went right ahead spaced the line justified it to a hair and shoved it into the galley complete and perfect we took it out and examined it with a glass you could not tell by your eye that the third space was thinner than the others but the glass and the calipers showed the difference paige had always said that the machine would measure invisible particles of dirt and allow for them but even he had forgotten that vast fact for the moment all the witnesses made written record of the immense historical birth the first justification of a line of movable type by machinery and also set down the hour and the minute nobody had drank anything and yet everybody seemed drunk welldizzy stupefied stunned all the other wonderful inventions of the human brain sink pretty nearly into commonplace contrasted with this awful mechanical miracle telephones telegraphs locomotives cotton gins sewing machines babbage calculators jacquard looms perfecting presses arkwrights frames all mere toys simplicities the paige compositor marches alone and far in the lead of human inventions in two or three weeks we shall work the stiffness out of her joints and have her performing as smoothly and softly as human muscles and then we shall speak out the big secret and let the world come and gaze return me this letter when you have read it sam judge of the elation which such a letter would produce in keokuk yet it was no greater than that which existed in hartford for a time then further delays before the machine got the stiffness out of her joints that cunning devil manifested a tendency to break the types and paige who was never happier than when he was pulling things to pieces and making improvements had the typesetter apart again and the day of complete triumph was postponed there was sadness at the elmira farm that spring theodore crane who had long been in poor health seemed to grow daily worse in february he had paid a visit to hartford and saw the machine in operation but by the end of may his condition was very serious remembering his keen sense of humor clemens reported to him cheering and amusing incidents to mrs theodore crane in elmira n y hartford may susie dear i want you to tell this to theodore you know how absentminded twichell is and how desolate his face is when he is in that frame at such times he passes the word with a friend on the street and is not aware of the meeting at all twice in a week our clara had this latter experience with him within the past month but the second instance was too much for her and she woke him up in his tracks with a reproach she said uncle joe why do you always look as if you were just going down into the grave when you meet a person on the street and then went on to reveal to him the funereal spectacle which he presented on such occasions well she has met twichell three times since then and would swim the connecticut to avoid meeting him the fourth as soon as he sights her no matter how public the place nor how far off she is he makes a bound into the air heaves arms and legs into all sorts of frantic gestures of delight and so comes prancing skipping and pirouetting for her like a drunken indian entering heaven with a full invoice of love from us all to you and theodore s l c the reference in the next to the closing sentence in a letter written by howells to clemens about this time refers to a heartbroken utterance of the former concerning his daughter winnie who had died some time before she had been a gentle talented girl but never of robust health her death had followed a long period of gradual decline to w d howells in boston hartford judy dear howells i came on from elmira a day or two ago where i left a house of mourning mr crane died after ten months of pain and two whole days of dying at the farm on the hill the rd inst a man who had always hoped for a swift death mrs crane and mrs clemens and the children were in a gloom which brought back to me the days of nineteen years ago when mr langdon died it is heartbreaking to see mrs crane many a time in the past ten days the sight of her has reminded me with a pang of the desolation which uttered itself in the closing sentence of your last letter to me i do see that there is an argument against suicide the grief of the worshipers left behind the awful famine in their hearts these are too costly terms for the release i shall be here ten days yet and all alone nobody in the house but the servants cant mrs howells spare you to me cant you come and stay with me the house is cool and pleasant your work will not be interrupted we will keep to ourselves and let the rest of the world do the same you can have your choice of three bedrooms and you will find the childrens schoolroom which was built for my study the perfection of a retired and silent den for work there isnt a fly or a mosquito on the estate come say you will with kindest regards to mrs howells and pilla and john yours ever mark howells was more hopeful he wrote i read something in a strange book the physical theory of another life that consoles a little namely we see and feel the power of deity in such fullness that we ought to infer the infinite justice and goodness which we do not see or feel and a few days later he wrote i would rather see and talk with you than any other man in the world outside my own blood a connecticut yankee at king arthurs court was brought to an end that year and given to the artist and printer dan beard was selected for the drawings and was given a free hand as the next letter shows to fred j hall manager charles l webster co charles l webster owing to poor health had by this time retired from the firm elmira july dear mr hall upon reflection thus tell beard to obey his own inspiration and when he sees a picture in his mind put that picture on paper be it humorous or be it serious i want his genius to be wholly unhampered i shant have fears as to the result they will be better pictures than if i mixed in and tried to give him points on his own trade send this note and hell understand yr s l c clemens had made a good choice in selecting beard for the illustrations he was well qualified for the work and being of a socialistic turn of mind put his whole soul into it when the drawings were completed clemens wrote hold me under permanent obligations what luck it was to find you there are hundreds of artists that could illustrate any other book of mine but there was only one who could illustrate this one yes it was a fortunate hour that i went netting for lightning bugs and caught a meteor live forever clemens of course was anxious for howells to read the yankee and mrs clemens particularly so her eyes were giving her trouble that summer so that she could not read the ms for herself and she had grave doubts as to some of its chapters it may be said here that the book today might have been better if mrs clemens had been able to read it howells was a peerless critic but the revolutionary subjectmatter of the book so delighted him that he was perhaps somewhat blinded to its literary defects however this is premature howells did not at once see the story he had promised to come to hartford but wrote that trivial matters had made his visit impossible from the next letter we get the situation at this time the mr church mentioned was frederick s church the wellknown artist to w d howells in boston elmira july dear howells i too was as sorry as i could be yes and desperately disappointed i even did a heroic thing shipped my book off to new york lest i should forget hospitality and embitter your visit with it not that i think you wouldnt like to read it for i think you would but not on a holiday thats not the time i see how you were situated another familiarity of providence and wholly wanton intrusion and of course we could not help ourselves well just think of it a while ago while providences attention was absorbed in disordering some timetables so as to break up a trip of mine to mr churchs on the hudson that johnstown dam got loose i swear i was afraid to pray for fear i should laugh well im not going to despair well manage a meet yet i expect to go to hartford again in august and maybe remain till i have to come back here and fetch the family and along there in august some time you let on that you are going to mexico and i will let on that i am going to spitzbergen and then under cover of this clever stratagem we will glide from the trains at worcester and have a time i have noticed that providence is indifferent about mexico and spitzbergen ys ever mark possibly mark twain was not particularly anxious that howells should see his ms fearing that he might lay a ruthless hand on some of his more violent fulminations and wild fancies however this may be further postponement was soon at an end mrs clemenss eyes troubled her and would not permit her to read so she requested that the yankee be passed upon by soberminded critics such as howells and edmund clarence stedman howells wrote that even if he hadnt wanted to read the book for its own sake or for the authors sake he would still want to do it for mrs clemenss whereupon the proofs were started in his direction to w d howells in boston elmira aug dear howells if you should be moved to speak of my book in the study i shall be glad and proud and the sooner it gets in the better for the book though i dont suppose you can get it in earlier than the november number why no you cant get it in till a month later than that well anyway i dont think ill send out any other press copy except perhaps to stedman im not writing for those parties who miscall themselves critics and i dont care to have them paw the book at all its my swansong my retirement from literature permanently and i wish to pass to the cemetery unclodded i judge that the proofs have begun to reach you about this time as i had some though not revises this morning im sure im going to be charmed with beards pictures observe his nice takeoff of middleage artdinnertable scene ys sincerely mark howellss approval of the yankee came almost in the form of exultant shouts one after reading each batch of proof first he wrote its charming original wonderful good in fancy and sound to the core in morals and again its a mighty great book and it makes my heart burn with wrath it seems god did not forget to put a soul into you he shuts most literary men off with a brain merely then a few days later the book is glorious simply noble what masses of virgin truth never touched in print before and finally last night i read your last chapter as stedman says of the whole book its titanic to w d howells in boston hartford sept dear howells it is immensely good of you to grind through that stuff for me but it gives peace to mrs clemenss soul and i am as grateful to you as a body can be i am glad you approve of what i say about the french revolution few people will it is odd that even to this day americans still observe that immortal benefaction through english and other monarchical eyes and have no shred of an opinion about it that they didnt get at secondhand next to the th of july and its results it was the noblest and the holiest thing and the most precious that ever happened in this earth and its gracious work is not done yet not anywhere in the remote neighborhood of it dont trouble to send me all the proofs send me the pages with your corrections on them and wastebasket the rest we issue the book dec consequently a notice that appears dec will be just in good time i am waiting to see your study set a fashion in criticism when that happens as please god it must consider that if you lived three centuries you couldnt do a more valuable work for this country or a humaner as a rule a critics dissent merely enrages and so does no good but by the new art which you use your dissent must be as welcome as your approval and as valuable i do not know what the secret of it is unless it is your attitude man courteously reasoning with man and brother in place of the worn and wearisome critical attitude of all this long time superior being lecturing a boy well my book is written let it go but if it were only to write over again there wouldnt be so many things left out they burn in me and they keep multiplying and multiplying but now they cant ever be said and besides they would require a library and a pen warmed up in hell ys ever mark the typesetting machine began to loom large in the background clemens believed it perfected by this time paige had got it together again and it was running steadily or approximately so setting type at a marvelous speed and with perfect accuracy in time an expert operator would be able to set as high as eight thousand ems per hour or about ten times as much as a good compositor could set and distribute by hand those who saw it were convinced most of them that the typesetting problem was solved by this great mechanical miracle if there were any who doubted it was because of its marvelously minute accuracy which the others only admired such accuracy it was sometimes whispered required absolutely perfect adjustment and what would happen when the great inventor the poet in steel as clemens once called him was no longer at hand to supervise and to correct the slightest variation but no such breath of doubt came to mark twain he believed the machine as reliable as a constellation but now there was need of capital to manufacture and market the wonder clemens casting about in his mind remembered senator jones of nevada a man of great wealth and his old friend joe goodman of nevada in whom jones had unlimited confidence he wrote to goodman and in this letter we get a pretty full exposition of the whole matter as it stood in the fall of we note in this communication that clemens says that he has been at the machine three years and seven months but this was only the period during which he had spent the regular monthly sum of three thousand dollars his interest in the invention had begun as far back as to joseph t goodman in nevada private hartford oct dear joei had a letter from aleck badlam day before yesterday and in answering him i mentioned a matter which i asked him to consider a secret except to you and john mccomb this is col mccomb of the altacalifornia who had sent mark twain on the quaker city excursion as i am not ready yet to get into the newspapers i have come near writing you about this matter several times but it wasnt ripe and i waited it is ripe now it is a typesetting machine which i undertook to build for the inventorfor a consideration i have been at it three years and seven months without losing a day at a cost of a month and in so private a way that hartford has known nothing about it indeed only a dozen men have known of the matter i have reported progress from time to time to the proprietors of the n y sun herald times world harper brothers and john f trow also to the proprietors of the boston herald and the boston globe three years ago i asked all these people to squelch their frantic desire to load up their offices with the mergenthaler n y tribune machine and wait for mine and then choose between the two they have waited with no very gaudy patience but still they have waited and i could prove to them today that they have not lost anything by it but i reserve the proof for the present except in the case of the n y herald i sent an invitation there the other day a courtesy due a paper which ordered worth of our machines long ago when it was still in a crude condition the herald has ordered its foreman to come up here next thursday but that is the only invitation which will go out for some time yet the machine was finished several weeks ago and has been running ever since in the machine shop it is a magnificent creature of steel all of pratt whitneys superbest workmanship and as nicely adjusted and as accurate as a watch in construction it is as elaborate and complex as that machine which it ranks next to by every right man and in performance it is as simple and sure anybody can set type on it who can read and can do it after only minutes instruction the operator does not need to leave his seat at the keyboard for the reason that he is not required to do anything but strike the keys and set type merely one function the spacing justifying emptying into the galley and distributing of dead matter is all done by the machine without anybodys help four functions the ease with which a cub can learn is surprising day before yesterday i saw our newest cub set perfectly space and perfectly justify ems of solid nonpareil in an hour and distribute the like amount in the same hour and six hours previously he had never seen the machine or its keyboard it was a good hours work for year veterans on the other typesetting machines to do we have cubs the dean of the trio is a school youth of yesterday morning he had been an apprentice on the machine working days hour days and we speeded him to see what he could do in an hour in the hour he set ems solid nonpareil and the machine perfectly spaced and justified it and of course distributed the like amount in the same hour considering that a good fair compositor sets and distributes in the one hour this boy did the work of about x a compositors in that hour this fact sends all other typesetting machines a thousand miles to the rear and the best of them will never be heard of again after we publicly exhibit in new york we shall put on more cubs we have one school boy and two compositors now and we think of putting on a type writer a stenographer and perhaps a shoemaker to show that no special gifts or training are required with this machine we shall train these beginners two or three months or until some one of them gets up to an hour then we will show up in new york and run the machine hours a day days in the week for several months to prove that this is a machine which will never get out of order or cause delay and can stand anything an anvil can stand you know there is no other typesetting machine that can run two hours on a stretch without causing trouble and delay with its incurable caprices we own the whole field every inch of it and nothing can dislodge us now then above is my preachment and here follows the reason and purpose of it i want you to run over here roost over the machine a week and satisfy yourself and then go to john p jones or to whom you please and sell me a hundred thousand dollars worth of this property and take ten per cent in cash or the property for your trouble the latter if you are wise because the price i ask is a long way short of the value what i call property is this a small part of my ownership consists of a royalty of on every machine marketed under the american patents my sellingterms are a permanent royalty of one dollar on every americanmarketed machine for a thousand dollars cash to me in hand paid we shant market any fewer than machines in years a return of fifteen thousand dollars for one thousand a royalty is better than stock in one way it must be paid every six months rain or shine it is a debt and must be paid before dividends are declared by and by when we become a stock company i shall buy these royalties back for stock if i can get them for anything like reasonable terms i have never borrowed a penny to use on the machine and never sold a pennys worth of the property until the machine was entirely finished and proven by the severest tests to be what she started out to be perfect permanent and occupying the position as regards all kindred machines which the city of paris occupies as regards the canvasbacks of the mercantile marine it is my purpose to sell two hundred dollars of my royalties at the above price during the next two months and keep the other mrs clemens begs mrs goodman to come with you and asks pardon for not writing the message herself which would be a patheticallywelcome spectacle to me for i have been her amanuensis for months now since her eyes failed her yours as always mark while this letter with its amazing contents is on its way to astonish joe goodman we will consider one of quite a different but equally characteristic sort we may assume that mark twains sister pamela had been visiting him in hartford and was now making a visit in keokuk to mrs moffett in keokuk hartford oct dear pamela an hour after you left i was suddenly struck with a realizing sense of the utter chuckleheadedness of that notion of mine to send your trunk after you land it was idiotic none but a lunatic would separate himself from his baggage well i am soulfully glad the baggage fetcher saved me from consummating my insane inspiration i met him on the street in the afternoon and paid him again i shall pay him several times more as opportunity offers i declined the invitation to banquet with the visiting south american congress in a polite note explaining that i had to go to new york today i conveyed the note privately to patrick he got the envelope soiled and asked livy to put on a clean one that is why i am going to the banquet also why i have disinvited the boys i thought i was going to punch billiards with upstairs tonight patrick is one of the injudiciousest people i ever struck and i am the other your brother sam the yankee was now ready for publication and advance sheets were already in the reviewers hands just at this moment the brazilian monarchy crumbled and clemens was moved to write sylvester baxter of the boston herald a letter which is of special interest in its prophecy of the new day the dawn of which was even nearer than he suspected dear mr baxter another throne has gone down and i swim in oceans of satisfaction i wish i might live fifty years longer i believe i should see the thrones of europe selling at auction for old iron i believe i should really see the end of what is surely the grotesquest of all the swindles ever invented by manmonarchy it is enough to make a graven image laugh to see apparently rational people away down here in this wholesome and merciless slaughterday for shams still mouthing empty reverence for those mossbacked frauds and scoundrelisms hereditary kingship and socalled nobility it is enough to make the monarchs and nobles themselves laugh and in private they do there can be no question about that i think there is only one funnier thing and that is the spectacle of these bastard americans these hamersleys and huntingtons and such offering cash encumbered by themselves for rotten carcases and stolen titles when our great brethren the disenslaved brazilians frame their declaration of independence i hope they will insert this missing link we hold these truths to be selfevident that all monarchs are usurpers and descendants of usurpers for the reason that no throne was ever set up in this world by the will freely exercised of the only body possessing the legitimate right to set it up the numerical mass of the nation you already have the advance sheets of my forthcoming book in your hands if you will turn to about the five hundredth page you will find a state paper of my connecticut yankee in which he announces the dissolution of king arthurs monarchy and proclaims the english republic compare it with the state paper which announces the downfall of the brazilian monarchy and proclaims the republic of the united states of brazil and stand by to defend the yankee from plagiarism there is merely a resemblance of ideas nothing more the yankees proclamation was already in print a week ago this is merely one of those odd coincidences which are always turning up come protect the yank from that cheapest and easiest of all charges plagiarism otherwise you see he will have to protect himself by charging approximate and indefinite plagiarism upon the official servants of our majestic twin down yonder and then there might be war or some similar annoyance have you noticed the rumor that the portuguese throne is unsteady and that the portuguese slaves are getting restive also that the head slavedriver of europe alexander iii has so reduced his usual monthly order for chains that the russian foundries are running on only half time now also that other rumor that english nobility acquired an added stench the other day and had to ship it to india and the continent because there wasnt any more room for it at home things are working by and by there is going to be an emigration may be of course we shall make no preparation we never do in a few years from now we shall have nothing but playedout kings and dukes on the police and driving the horsecars and whitewashing fences and in fact overcrowding all the avenues of unskilled labor and then we shall wish when it is too late that we had taken common and reasonable precautions and drowned them at castle garden there followed at this time a number of letters to goodman but as there is much of a sameness in them we need not print them all clemens in fact kept the mails warm with letters bulging with schemes for capitalization and promising vast wealth to all concerned when the letters did not go fast enough he sent telegrams in one of the letters goodman is promised five hundred thousand dollars out of the profits before we get anything ourselves one thing we gather from these letters is that paige has taken the machine apart again never satisfied with its perfection or perhaps getting a hint that certain of its perfections were not permanent a letter at the end of november seems worth preserving here to joseph t goodman in california hartford nov dear joe things are getting into better and more flexible shape every day papers are now being drawn which will greatly simplify the raising of capital i shall be in supreme command it will not be necessary for the capitalist to arrive at terms with anybody but me i dont want to dicker with anybody but jones i know him that is to say i want to dicker with you and through you with jones try to see if you cant be here by the th of january the machine was as perfect as a watch when we took her apart the other day but when she goes together again the th of january we expect her to be perfecter than a watch joe i want you to sell some royalties to the boys out there if you can for i want to be financially strong when we go to new york you know the machine and you appreciate its future enormous career better than any man i know at the lowest conceivable estimate machines a year we shall sell in the life of the patent years all the family send love to you and they mean it or they wouldnt say it yours ever mark the yankee had come from the press and howells had praised it in the editors study in harpers magazine he had given it his highest commendation and it seems that his opinion of it did not change with time of all fanciful schemes of fiction it pleases me most he in one place declared and again referred to it as a greatly imagined and symmetrically developed tale in more than one letter to goodman clemens had urged him to come east without delay take the train joe and come along he wrote early in december and we judge from the following that joe had decided to come to w d howells in boston hartford dec dear howells the magazine came last night and the study notice is just great the satisfaction it affords us could not be more prodigious if the book deserved every word of it and maybe it does i hope it does though of course i cant realize it and believe it but i am your grateful servant anyway and always i am going to read to the cadets at west point jan i go from here to new york the th and up to the point the th cant you go with me its great fun im going to read the passages in the yankee in which the yankees west point cadets figure and shall covertly work in a lecture on aristocracy to those boys i am to be the guest of the superintendent but if you will go i will shake him and we will go to the hotel he is a splendid fellow and i know him well enough to take that liberty and wont you give me a day or twos visit toward the end of january for two reasons the machine will be at work again by that time and we want to hear the rest of the dreamstory mrs clemens keeps speaking about it and hankering for it and we can have joe goodman on hand again by that time and i want you to get to know him thoroughly its well worth it i am going to run up and stay over night with you as soon as i can get a chance we are in the full rush of the holidays now and an awful rush it is too you ought to have been here the other day to make that day perfect and complete all alone i managed to inflict agonies on mrs clemens whereas i was expecting nothing but praises i made a party call the day after the party and called the lady down from breakfast to receive it i then left there and called on a new bride who received me in her dressinggown and as things went pretty well i stayed to luncheon the error here was that the appointed receptionhour was in the afternoon and not at the brides house but at her aunts in another part of the town however as i meant well none of these disasters distressed me yrs ever mark the yankee did not find a very hearty welcome in england english readers did not fancy any burlesque of their arthurian tales or american strictures on their institutions mark twains publishers had feared this and asked that the story be especially edited for the english edition clemens however would not listen to any suggestions of the sort to messrs chatto windus in london eng gentlemen concerning the yankee i have already revised the story twice and it has been read critically by w d howells and edmund clarence stedman and my wife has caused me to strike out several passages that have been brought to her attention and to soften others furthermore i have read chapters of the book in public where englishmen were present and have profited by their suggestions now mind you i have taken all this pains because i wanted to say a yankee mechanics say against monarchy and its several natural props and yet make a book which you would be willing to print exactly as it comes to you without altering a word we are spoken of by englishmen as a thinskinned people it is you who are thinskinned an englishman may write with the most brutal frankness about any man or institution among us and we republish him without dreaming of altering a line or a word but england cannot stand that kind of a book written about herself it is england that is thinskinned it causeth me to smile when i read the modifications of my language which have been made in my english editions to fit them for the sensitive english palate now as i say i have taken laborious pains to so trim this book of offense that you might not lack the nerve to print it just as it stands i am going to get the proofs to you just as early as i can i want you to read it carefully if you can publish it without altering a single word go ahead otherwise please hand it to j r osgood in time for him to have it published at my expense this is important for the reason that the book was not written for america it was written for england so many englishmen have done their sincerest best to teach us something for our betterment that it seems to me high time that some of us should substantially recognize the good intent by trying to pry up the english nation to a little higher level of manhood in turn very truly yours s l clemens the english nation at least a considerable portion of it did not wish to be pried up to a higher level of manhood by a connecticut yankee the papers pretty generally denounced the book as coarse in fact a vulgar travesty some of the critics concluded that england after all had made a mistake in admiring mark twain clemens stood this for a time and then seems to have decided that something should be done one of the foremost of english critics was his friend and admirer he would state the case to him fully and invite his assistance to andrew lang in london first page missing they vote but do not print the head tells you pretty promptly whether the food is satisfactory or not and everybody hears and thinks the whole man has spoken it is a delusion only his taste and his smell have been heard from important both in a way but these do not build up the man and preserve his life and fortify it the little child is permitted to label its drawings this is a cow this is a horse and so on this protects the child it saves it from the sorrow and wrong of hearing its cows and its horses criticized as kangaroos and work benches a man who is whitewashing a fence is doing a useful thing so also is the man who is adorning a rich mans house with costly frescoes and all of us are sane enough to judge these performances by standards proper to each now then to be fair an author ought to be allowed to put upon his book an explanatory line this is written for the head this is written for the belly and the members and the critic ought to hold himself in honor bound to put away from him his ancient habit of judging all books by one standard and thenceforth follow a fairer course the critic assumes every time that if a book doesnt meet the cultivatedclass standard it isnt valuable let us apply his law all around for if it is sound in the case of novels narratives pictures and such things it is certainly sound and applicable to all the steps which lead up to culture and make culture possible it condemns the spelling book for a spelling book is of no use to a person of culture it condemns all school books and all schools which lie between the childs primer and greek and between the infant school and the university it condemns all the rounds of art which lie between the cheap terra cotta groups and the venus de medici and between the chromo and the transfiguration it requires whitcomb riley to sing no more till he can sing like shakespeare and it forbids all amateur music and will grant its sanction to nothing below the classic is this an extravagant statement no it is a mere statement of fact it is the fact itself that is extravagant and grotesque and what is the result this and it is sufficiently curious the critic has actually imposed upon the world the superstition that a painting by raphael is more valuable to the civilizations of the earth than is a chromo and the august opera than the hurdygurdy and the villagers singing society and homer than the little everybodyspoet whose rhymes are in all mouths today and will be in nobodys mouth next generation and the latin classics than kiplings farreaching buglenote and jonathan edwards than the salvation army and the venus de medici than the plastercast peddler the superstition in a word that the vast and awful comet that trails its cold lustre through the remote abysses of space once a century and interests and instructs a cultivated handful of astronomers is worth more to the world than the sun which warms and cheers all the nations every day and makes the crops to grow if a critic should start a religion it would not have any object but to convert angels and they wouldnt need it the thin top crust of humanity the cultivated are worth pacifying worth pleasing worth coddling worth nourishing and preserving with dainties and delicacies it is true but to be caterer to that little faction is no very dignified or valuable occupation it seems to me it is merely feeding the overfed and there must be small satisfaction in that it is not that little minority who are already saved that are best worth trying to uplift i should think but the mighty mass of the uncultivated who are underneath that mass will never see the old masters that sight is for the few but the chromo maker can lift them all one step upward toward appreciation of art they cannot have the opera but the hurdygurdy and the singing class lift them a little way toward that far light they will never know homer but the passing rhymester of their day leaves them higher than he found them they may never even hear of the latin classics but they will strike step with kiplings drumbeat and they will march for all jonathan edwardss help they would die in their slums but the salvation army will beguile some of them up to pure air and a cleaner life they know no sculpture the venus is not even a name to them but they are a grade higher in the scale of civilization by the ministrations of the plastercast than they were before it took its place upon then mantel and made it beautiful to their unexacting eyes indeed i have been misjudged from the very first i have never tried in even one single instance to help cultivate the cultivated classes i was not equipped for it either by native gifts or training and i never had any ambition in that direction but always hunted for bigger game the masses i have seldom deliberately tried to instruct them but have done my best to entertain them to simply amuse them would have satisfied my dearest ambition at any time for they could get instruction elsewhere and i had two chances to help to the teachers one for amusement is a good preparation for study and a good healer of fatigue after it my audience is dumb it has no voice in print and so i cannot know whether i have won its approbation or only got its censure yes you see i have always catered for the belly and the members but have been served like the others criticized from the culturestandard to my sorrow and pain because honestly i never cared what became of the cultured classes they could go to the theatre and the opera they had no use for me and the melodeon and now at last i arrive at my object and tender my petition making supplication to this effect that the critics adopt a rule recognizing the belly and the members and formulate a standard whereby work done for them shall be judged help me mr lang no voice can reach further than yours in a case of this kind or carry greater weight of authority langs reply was an article in the illustrated london news on the art of mark twain lang had no admiration to express for the yankee which he confessed he had not cared to read but he glorified huck finn to the highest i can never forget nor be ungrateful for the exquisite pleasure with which i read huckleberry finn for the first time years ago he wrote i read it again last night deserting kenilworth for huck i never laid it down till i had finished it lang closed his article by referring to the story of huck as the great american novel which had escaped the eyes of those who watched to see this new planet swim into their ken letters chiefly to jos t goodman the great machine enterprise dr john browns son whom mark twain and his wife had known in as jock sent copies of dr john brown and his sister isabella by e t mclaren it was a gift appreciated in the clemens home to mr john brown in edinburgh scotland hartford feby dear mr brown both copies came and we are reading and rereading the one and lending the other to old time adorers of rab and his friends it is an exquisite book the perfection of literary workmanship it says in every line dont look at me look at him and one tries to be good and obey but the charm of the painter is so strong that one cant keep his entire attention on the developing portrait but must steal sideglimpses of the artist and try to divine the trick of her felicitous brush in this book the doctor lives and moves just as he was he was the most extensive slaveholder of his time and the kindest and yet he died without setting one of his bondmen free we all send our very very kindest regards sincerely yours s l clemens if mark twain had been less interested in the typesetting machine he might possibly have found a profit that winter in the old sellers play which he had written with howells seven years before the play had eventually been produced at the lyceum theatre in new york with a p burbank in the leading role and clemens and howells as financial backers but it was a losing investment nor did it pay any better when clemens finally sent burbank with it on the road now however james a herne a wellknown actor and playwright became interested in the idea after a discussion of the matter with howells and there seemed a probability that with changes made under hernes advisement the play might be made sensible and successful but mark twains greater interest was now all in the typemachine and certainly he had no money to put into any other venture his next letter to goodman is illuminating the urgency of his need for funds opposed to that conscientiousness which was one of the most positive forces of mark twains body spiritual the mr arnot of this letter was an elmira capitalist to jos t goodman in california hartford march dear joe if you were here i should say get you to washington and beg senator jones to take the chances and put up about ten or no i wouldnt the money would burn a hole in my pocket and get away from me if the furnisher of it were proceeding upon merely your judgment and mine and without other evidence it is too much of a responsibility but i am in as close a place today as ever i was due for the last months machineexpenses and the purse empty i notified mr arnot a month ago that i should want today and his check arrived last night but i sent it back to him because when he bought of me on the th of december i said that i would not draw upon him for months and that before that date senator jones would have examined the machine and approved or done the other thing if jones should arrive here a week or ten days from now as he expects to do and should not approve and shouldnt buy any royalties my deal with arnot would not be symmetrically square and then how could i refund the surest way was to return his check i have talked with the madam and here is the result i will go down to the factory and notify paige that i will scrape together to meet the march and april expenses and will retire on the th of april and return the assignment to him if in the meantime i have not found financial relief it is very rough for the machine does at last seem perfect and just a bird to go i think shes going to be good for ems an hour in the hands of a good ordinary man after a solid years practice i may be in error but i most solidly believe it theres an improved mergenthaler in new york paige and davis and i watched it two whole afternoons with the love of us all mark arnot wrote clemens urging him to accept the check for five thousand dollars in this moment of need clemens was probably as sorely tempted to compromise with his conscience as he had ever been in his life but his resolution field firm to m h arnot in elmira n y mr m h arnot dear sir no no i could not think of taking it with you unsatisfied and you ought not to be satisfied until you have made personal examination of the machine and had a consensus of testimony of disinterested people besides my own perfect knowledge of what is required of such a machine and my perfect knowledge of the fact that this is the only machine that can meet that requirement make it difficult for me to realize that a doubt is possible to less wellposted men and so i would have taken your money without thinking and thus would have done a great wrong to you and a great one to myself and now that i go back over the ground i remember that where i said i could get along months without drawing on you that delay contemplated a visit from you to the machine in the interval and your satisfaction with its character and prospects i had forgotten all that but i remember it now and the fact that it was not so nominated in the bond does not alter the case or justify me in making my call so prematurely i do not know that you regarded all that as a part of the bargain for you were thoroughly and magnanimously unexacting but i so regarded it notwithstanding i have so easily managed to forget all about it you so gratified me and did me so much honor in bonding yourself to me in a large sum upon no evidence but my word and with no protection but my honor that my pride in that is much stronger than my desire to reap a money advantage from it with the sincerest appreciation i am truly yours s l clemens p s i have written a good many words and yet i seem to have failed to say the main thing in exact enough language which is that the transaction between us is not complete and binding until you shall have convinced yourself that the machines character and prospects are satisfactory i ought to explain that the grippe delayed us some weeks and that we have since been waiting for mr jones when he was ready we were not and now we have been ready more than a month while he has been kept in washington by the silver bill he said the other day that to venture out of the capitol for a day at this time could easily chance to hurt him if the bill came up for action meantime although it couldnt hurt the bill which would pass anyway mrs jones said she would send me two or three days notice right after the passage of the bill and that they would follow as soon as i should return word that their coming would not inconvenience us i suppose i ought to go to new york without waiting for mr jones but it would not be wise to go there without money the bill is still pending the mergenthaler machine like the paige was also at this time in the middle stages of experimental development it was a slower machine but it was simpler less expensive occupied less room there was not so much about it to get out of order it was not so delicate not so human these were immense advantages but no one at this time could say with certainty which typesetter would reap the harvest of millions it was only sure that at least one of them would and the mergenthaler people were willing to trade stock for stock with the paige company in order to insure financial success for both whichever won clemens with a faith that never faltered declined this offer a decision that was to cost him millions winter and spring had gone and summer had come but still there had been no financial conclusion with jones mackay and the other rich californians who were to put up the necessary million for the machines manufacture goodman was spending a large part of his time traveling back and forth between california and washington trying to keep business going at both ends paige spent most of his time working out improvements for the typesetter delicate attachments which complicated its construction more and more to joe t goodman in washington hartford june dear joe i have been sitting by the machine hours this afternoon and my admiration of it towers higher than ever there is no sort of mistake about it it is the big bonanza in the hours the time lost by typebreakage was minutes this machine is totally without a rival rivalry with it is impossible last friday fred whitmore it was the th day of his apprenticeship on the machine stacked up ems of solid nonpareil in hours and the typebreaking delay was only minutes for the day i claim yet as i have always claimed that the machines market abroad and here together is today worth without saying anything about the doubling and trebling of this sum that will follow within the life of the patents now here is a queer fact i am one of the wealthiest grandees in america one of the vanderbilt gang in fact and yet if you asked me to lend you a couple of dollars i should have to ask you to take my note instead it makes me cheerful to sit by the machine come up with mrs goodman and refresh yourself with a draught of the same ys ever mark the machine was still breaking the types now and then and no doubt paige was itching to take it to pieces and only restrained by force from doing so he was never thoroughly happy unless he was taking the machine apart or setting it up again finally he was allowed to go at it a disasterous permission for it was just then that jones decided to steal a day or two from the silver bill and watch the typesetter in operation paige already had it in parts when this word came from goodman and joness visit had to be called off his enthusiasm would seem to have weakened from that day in july goodman wrote that both mackay and jones had become somewhat diffident in the matter of huge capitalization he thought it partly due at least to the fatal delays that have sicklied over the bloom of original enthusiasm clemens himself went down to washington and perhaps warmed jones with his eloquence at least jones seemed to have agreed to make some effort in the matter a qualified promise the careful word of a wary politician and capitalist how many washington trips were made is not certain but certainly more than one jones would seem to have suggested forms of contracts but if he came to the point of signing any there is no evidence of it today any one who has read mark twains a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court has a pretty good idea of his opinion of kings in general and tyrants in particular rule by divine right however liberal was distasteful to him where it meant oppression it stirred him to violence in his article the czars soliloquy he gave himself loose rein concerning atrocities charged to the master of russia and in a letter which he wrote during the summer of he offered a hint as to remedies the letter was written by editorial request but was never mailed perhaps it seemed too openly revolutionary at the moment yet scarcely more than a quarter of a century was needed to make it timely clemens and his family were spending some weeks in the catskills when it was written an unpublished letter on the czar onteora to the editor of free russia i thank you for the compliment of your invitation to say something but when i ponder the bottom paragraph on your first page and then study your statement on your third page of the objects of the several russian liberationparties i do not quite know how to proceed let me quote here the paragraph referred to but mens hearts are so made that the sight of one voluntary victim for a noble idea stirs them more deeply than the sight of a crowd submitting to a dire fate they cannot escape besides foreigners could not see so clearly as the russians how much the government was responsible for the grinding poverty of the masses nor could they very well realize the moral wretchedness imposed by that government upon the whole of educated russia but the atrocities committed upon the defenceless prisoners are there in all their baseness concrete and palpable admitting of no excuse no doubt or hesitation crying out to the heart of humanity against russian tyranny and the tzars government stupidly confident in its apparently unassailable position instead of taking warning from the first rebukes seems to mock this humanitarian age by the aggravation of brutalities not satisfied with slowly killing its prisoners and with burying the flower of our young generation in the siberian desserts the government of alexander iii resolved to break their spirit by deliberately submitting them to a regime of unheardof brutality and degradation when one reads that paragraph in the glare of george kennans revelations and considers how much it means considers that all earthly figures fail to typify the czars government and that one must descend into hell to find its counterpart one turns hopefully to your statement of the objects of the several liberationparties and is disappointed apparently none of them can bear to think of losing the present hell entirely they merely want the temperature cooled down a little i now perceive why all men are the deadly and uncompromising enemies of the rattlesnake it is merely because the rattlesnake has not speech monarchy has speech and by it has been able to persuade men that it differs somehow from the rattlesnake has something valuable about it somewhere something worth preserving something even good and high and fine when properly modified something entitling it to protection from the club of the first comer who catches it out of its hole it seems a most strange delusion and not reconcilable with our superstition that man is a reasoning being if a house is afire we reason confidently that it is the first comers plain duty to put the fire out in any way he can drown it with water blow it up with dynamite use any and all means to stop the spread of the fire and save the rest of the city what is the czar of russia but a house afire in the midst of a city of eighty millions of inhabitants yet instead of extinguishing him together with his nest and system the liberationparties are all anxious to merely cool him down a little and keep him it seems to me that this is illogical idiotic in fact suppose you had this granitehearted bloodyjawed maniac of russia loose in your house chasing the helpless women and little children your own what would you do with him supposing you had a shotgun well he is loose in your houserussia and with your shotgun in your hand you stand trying to think up ways to modify him do these liberationparties think that they can succeed in a project which has been attempted a million times in the history of the world and has never in one single instance been successful the modification of a despotism by other means than bloodshed they seem to think they can my privilege to write these sanguinary sentences in soft security was bought for me by rivers of blood poured upon many fields in many lands but i possess not one single little paltry right or privilege that come to me as a result of petition persuasion agitation for reform or any kindred method of procedure when we consider that not even the most responsible english monarch ever yielded back a stolen public right until it was wrenched from them by bloody violence is it rational to suppose that gentler methods can win privileges in russia of course i know that the properest way to demolish the russian throne would be by revolution but it is not possible to get up a revolution there so the only thing left to do apparently is to keep the throne vacant by dynamite until a day when candidates shall decline with thanks then organize the republic and on the whole this method has some large advantages for whereas a revolution destroys some lives which cannot well be spared the dynamite way doesnt consider this the conspirators against the czars life are caught in every rank of life from the low to the high and consider if so many take an active part where the peril is so dire is this not evidence that the sympathizers who keep still and do not show their hands are countless for multitudes can you break the hearts of thousands of families with the awful siberian exodus every year for generations and not eventually cover all russia from limit to limit with bereaved fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters who secretly hate the perpetrator of this prodigious crime and hunger and thirst for his life do you not believe that if your wife or your child or your father was exiled to the mines of siberia for some trivial utterances wrung from a smarting spirit by the czars intolerable tyranny and you got a chance to kill him and did not do it that you would always be ashamed to be in your own society the rest of your life suppose that that refined and lovely russian lady who was lately stripped bare before a brutal soldiery and whipped to death by the czars hand in the person of the czars creature had been your wife or your daughter or your sister and today the czar should pass within reach of your hand how would you feel and what would you do consider that all over vast russia from boundary to boundary a myriad of eyes filled with tears when that piteous news came and through those tears that myriad of eyes saw not that poor lady but lost darlings of their own whose fate her fate brought back with new access of grief out of a black and bitter past never to be forgotten or forgiven if i am a swinburnian and clear to the marrow i am i hold human nature in sufficient honor to believe there are eighty million mute russians that are of the same stripe and only one russian family that isnt mark twain typesetter matters were going badly clemens still had faith in jones and he had lost no grain of faith in the machine the money situation however was troublesome with an expensive establishment and work of one sort or another still to be done on the machine his income would not reach perhaps goodman had already given up hope for he does not seem to have returned from california after the next letter was written a colorless letter in which we feel a note of resignation the last few lines are sufficient to joe t goodman in california dear joe i wish you could get a day off and make those two or three californians buy those privileges for im going to need money before long i dont know where the senator is but out on the coast i reckon i guess weve got a perfect machine at last we never break a type now and the new device for enabling the operator to touch the last letters and justify the line simultaneously works to a charm with love to you both mark the year closed gloomily enough the typesetter seemed to be perfected but capital for its manufacture was not forthcoming the publishing business of charles l webster co was returning little or no profit clemenss mother had died in keokuk at the end of october and his wifes mother in elmira a month later mark twain writing a short business letter to his publishing manager fred j ball closed it merry xmas to you and i wish to god i could have one myself before i die xxxi letters to howells mrs clemens and others return to literature american claimant leaving hartford europe down the rhine clemens was still not without hope in the machine at the beginning of the new year but it was a hope no longer active and it presently became a moribund jones on about the middle of february backed out altogether laying the blame chiefly on mackay and the others who he said had decided not to invest jones let his victim down easy with friendly words but it was the end for the present at least of machine financiering it was also the end of mark twains capital his publishing business was not good it was already in debt and needing more money there was just one thing for him to do and he did it at once not stopping to cry over spilt milk but with good courage and the old enthusiasm that never failed him he returned to the trade of authorship he dug out halffinished articles and stories finished them and sold them and within a week after the jones collapse he was at work on a novel based an the old sellers idea which eight years before he and howells had worked into a play the brief letter in which he reported this news to howells bears no marks of depression though the writer of it was in his fiftysixth year he was by no means well and his financial prospects were anything but golden to w d howells in boston hartford feb dear howells mrs clemens has been sick abed for near two weeks but is up and around the room now and gaining i dont know whether she has written mrs howells or not i only know she was going to and will yet if she hasnt we are promising ourselves a whole world of pleasure in the visit and you mustnt dream of disappointing us does this item stir an interest in you began a novel four days ago and this moment finished chapter four title of the book colonel mulberry sellers american claimant of the great earldom of rossmore in the peerage of great britain ys ever mark probably mark twain did not return to literary work reluctantly he had always enjoyed writing and felt now that he was equipped better than ever for authorship at least so far as material was concerned there exists a fragmentary copy of a letter to some unknown correspondent in which he recites his qualifications it bears evidence of having been written just at this time and is of unusual interest at this point fragment of letter to i confine myself to life with which i am familiar when pretending to portray life but i confined myself to the boylife out on the mississippi because that had a peculiar charm for me and not because i was not familiar with other phases of life i was a soldier two weeks once in the beginning of the war and was hunted like a rat the whole time familiar my splendid kipling himself hasnt a more burntin hardbaked and unforgetable familiarity with that deathonthepalehorsewithhellfollowingafter which is a raw soldiers first fortnight in the field and which without any doubt is the most tremendous fortnight and the vividest he is ever going to see yes and i have shoveled silver tailings in a quartzmill a couple of weeks and acquired the last possibilities of culture in that direction and ive done pocketmining during three months in the one little patch of ground in the whole globe where nature conceals gold in pockets or did before we robbed all of those pockets and exhausted obliterated annihilated the most curious freak nature ever indulged in there are not thirty men left alive who being told there was a pocket hidden on the broad slope of a mountain would know how to go and find it or have even the faintest idea of how to set about it but i am one of the possible or who possess the secret and i could go and put my hand on that hidden treasure with a most deadly precision and ive been a prospector and know pay rock from poor when i find it just with a touch of the tongue and ive been a silver miner and know how to dig and shovel and drill and put in a blast and so i know the mines and the miners interiorly as well as bret harte knows them exteriorly and i was a newspaper reporter four years in cities and so saw the inside of many things and was reporter in a legislature two sessions and the same in congress one session and thus learned to know personally three sample bodies of the smallest minds and the selfishest souls and the cowardliest hearts that god makes and i was some years a mississippi pilot and familiarly knew all the different kinds of steamboatmen a race apart and not like other folk and i was for some years a traveling jour printer and wandered from city to city and so i know that sect familiarly and i was a lecturer on the public platform a number of seasons and was a responder to toasts at all the different kinds of banquets and so i know a great many secrets about audiences secrets not to be got out of books but only acquirable by experience and i watched over one dear project of mine for years spent a fortune on it and failed to make it go and the history of that would make a large book in which a million men would see themselves as in a mirror and they would testify and say verily this is not imagination this fellow has been there and after would cast dust upon their heads cursing and blaspheming and i am a publisher and did pay to one authors widow general grants the largest copyright checks this world has seen aggregating more than l in the first year and i have been an author for years and an ass for now then as the most valuable capital or culture or education usable in the building of novels is personal experience i ought to be well equipped for that trade i surely have the equipment a wide culture and all of it real none of it artificial for i dont know anything about books no signature clemens for several years had been bothered by rheumatism in his shoulder the return now to the steady use of the pen aggravated his trouble and at times he was nearly disabled the phonograph for commercial dictation had been tried experimentally and mark twain was always ready for any innovation to w d howells in boston hartford feb dear howells wont you dropin at the boylston building new england phonograph co and talk into a phonograph in an ordinary conversationvoice and see if another person who didnt hear you do it can take the words from the thing without difficulty and repeat them to you if the experiment is satisfactory also make somebody put in a message which you dont hear and see if afterward you can get it out without difficulty wont you then ask them on what terms they will rent me a phonograph for months and furnish me cylinders enough to carry words cylinders aint it i dont want to erase any of them my right arm is nearly disabled by rheumatism but i am bound to write this book and sell copies of it no i mean a million next fall i feel sure i can dictate the book into a phonograph if i dont have to yell i write words a day i think i can dictate twice as many but mind if this is going to be too much trouble to you go ahead and do it all the same ys ever mark howells always willing to help visited the phonograph place and a few days later reported results he wrote i talked your letter into a fonograf in my usual tone at my usual gait of speech then the fonograf man talked his answer in at his wonted swing and swell then we took the cylinder to a typewriter in the next room and she put the hooks into her ears and wrote the whole out i send you the result there is a mistake of one word i think that if you have the cheek to dictate the story into the fonograf all the rest is perfectly easy it wouldnt fatigue me to talk for an hour as i did clemens did not find the phonograph entirely satisfactory at least not for a time and he appears never to have used it steadily his early experience with it however seems interesting to w d howells in boston hartford apl dear howells im ashamed it happened in this way i was proposing to acknowledge the receipt of the play and the little book per phonograph so that you could see that the instrument is good enough for mere letterwriting then i meant to add the fact that you cant write literature with it because it hasnt any ideas and it hasnt any gift for elaboration or smartness of talk or vigor of action or felicity of expression but is just matteroffact compressive unornamental and as grave and unsmiling as the devil i filled four dozen cylinders in two sittings then found i could have said about as much with the pen and said it a deal better then i resigned i believe it could teach one to dictate literature to a phonographer and some time i will experiment in that line the little book is charmingly written and it interested me but it flies too high for me its concretest things are filmy abstractions to me and when i lay my grip on one of them and open my hand i feel as embarrassed as i use to feel when i thought i had caught a fly im going to try to mail it back to you today i mean i am going to charge my memory charging my memory is one of my chief industries with our loves and our kindest regards distributed among you according to the proprieties yrs ever mark p s im sending that ancient mental telegraphy article to harpers with a modest postscript probably read it to you years ago s l c the little book mentioned in this letter was by swedenborg an author in whom the boston literary set was always deeply interested mental telegraphy appeared in harpers magazine and is now included in the uniform edition of mark twains books it was written in joe goodman had long since returned to california it being clear that nothing could be gained by remaining in washington on receipt of the news of the typesetters collapse he sent a consoling word perhaps he thought clemens would rage over the unhappy circumstance and possibly hold him in some measure to blame but it was generally the smaller annoyances of life that made mark twain rage the larger catastrophes were likely to stir only his philosophy the library of american literature mentioned in the following letter was a work in many volumes edited by edmund clarence stedman and ellen mackay hutchinson to joe t goodman april dear joe well its all right anyway diplomacy couldnt have saved it diplomacy of mine at that late day i hadnt any diplomacy in stock anyway in order to meet joness requirements i had to surrender the old contract a contract which made me boss of the situation and gave me the whiphand of paige and allow the new one to be drafted and put in its place i was running an immense risk but it was justified by joness promises promises made to me not merely once but every time i tallied with him when february arrived i saw signs which were mighty plain reading signs which meant that paige was hoping and praying that jones would go back on me which would leave paige boss and me robbed and out in the cold his prayers were answered and i am out in the cold if i ever get back my ninetwentieths interest it will be by lawsuit which will be instituted in the indefinite future when the time comes i am at work again on a book not with a great deal of spirit but with enough yes plenty and i am pushing my publishing house it has turned the corner after cleaning a year for three consecutive years and piling every cent of it into one book library of american literature and from next january onward it will resume dividends but ive got to earn for it between now and then which i will do if i keep my health this additional capital is needed for that same book because its prosperity is growing so great and exacting it is dreadful to think of you in ill health i cant realize it you are always to me the same that you were in those days when matchless health and glowing spirits and delight in life were commonplaces with us lord save us all from old age and broken health and a hopetree that has lost the faculty of putting out blossoms with love to you both from us all mark mark twains residence in hartford was drawing rapidly to a close mrs clemens was poorly and his own health was uncertain they believed that some of the european baths would help them furthermore mark twain could no longer afford the luxury of his hartford home in europe life could be simpler and vastly cheaper he was offered a thousand dollars apiece for six european letters by the mcclure syndicate and w m laffan of the sun this would at least give him a start on the other side the family began immediately their sad arrangements for departure to fred j hall manager chas l webster co n y hartford apl dear mr hall privately keep it to yourself as you are already aware we are going to europe in june for an indefinite stay we shall sell the horses and shut up the house we wish to provide a place for our coachman who has been with us a years and is sober active diligent and unusually bright and capable you spoke of hiring a colored man as engineer and helper in the packing room patrick would soon learn that trade and be very valuable we will cease to need him by the middle or end of june have you made irrevocable arrangements with the colored man or would you prefer to have patrick if he thinks he would like to try i have not said anything to him about it yet yours s l c it was to be a complete breaking up of their beautiful establishment patrick mcaleer george the butler and others of their household help had been like members of the family we may guess at the heartbreak of it all even though the letters remain cheerful howells strangely enough seems to have been about the last one to be told of their european plans in fact he first got wind of it from the papers and wrote for information likely enough clemens had not until then had the courage to confess to w d howells in boston hartford may dear howells for her healths sake mrs clemens must try baths somewhere and this it is that has determined us to go to europe the water required seems to be provided at a little obscure and littlevisited nook up in the hills back of the rhine somewhere and you get to it by rhine trafficboat and country stagecoach come get sick or sorry enough and join us we shall be a little while at that bath and the rest of the summer at annecy this confidential to you in haute savoie miles from geneva spend the winters in berlin i dont know how long we shall be in europe i have a vote but i dont cast it im going to do whatever the others desire with leave to change their mind without prejudice whenever they want to travel has no longer any charm for me i have seen all the foreign countries i want to see except heaven and hell and i have only a vague curiosity as concerns one of those i found i couldnt use the play i had departed too far from its lines when i came to look at it i thought i might get a great deal of dialogue out of it but i got only loosely written pages they saved me half a days work it was the cursing phonograph there was abundance of good dialogue but it couldnt befitted into the new conditions of the story oh look here i did today what i have several times in past years thought of doing answered an interviewing proposition from a rich newspaper with the reminder that they had not stated the terms that my time was all occupied with writing at good pay and that as talking was harder work i should not care to venture it unless i knew the pay was going to be proportionately higher i wish i had thought of this the other day when charley stoddard turned a pleasant englishman loose on me and i couldnt think of any rational excuse ys ever mark clemens had finished his sellers book and had disposed of the serial rights to the mcclure syndicate the house in hartford was closed early in june and on the th the family with one maid katie leary sailed on the gascogne two weeks later they had begun a residence abroad which was to last for more than nine years it was not easy to get to work in europe clemenss arm remained lame and any effort at writing brought suffering the century magazine proposed another set of letters but by the end of july he had barely begun on those promised to mcclure and laffan in august however he was able to send three one from aix about the baths there another from bayreuth concerning the wagner festival and a third from marienbad in bohemia where they rested for a time he decided that he would arrange for no more european letters when the six were finished but would gather material for a book he would take a courier and a kodak and go tramping again in some fashion that would be interesting to do and to write the idea finally matured when he reached switzerland and settled the family at the hotel beau rivage ouchy lausanne facing lake leman he decided to make a floating trip down the rhone and he engaged joseph very a courier that had served him on a former european trip to accompany him the courier went over to bourget and bought for five dollars a flatbottomed boat and engaged its owner as their pilot it was the morning of september when they began their floatingtrip down the beautiful historic river that flows through the loveliest and most romantic region of france he wrote daily to mrs clemens and his letters tell the story of that drowsy happy experience better than the notes made with a view to publication clemens had arrived at lake bourget on the evening before the morning of their start and slept on the island of chatillon in an old castle of the same name lake bourget connects with the rhone by a small canal letters and memoranda to mrs clemens in ouchy switzerland sept sunday am on the lake bourget just started the castle of chatillon high overhead showing above the trees it was a wonderfully still place to sleep in beside us there was nobody in it but a woman a boy and a dog a pope was born in the room i slept in no he became a pope later the lake is smooth as glass a brilliant sun is shining our boat is comfortable and shady with its awning we have crossed the lake and are entering the canal shall presently be in the rhone noon nearly down to the rhone passing the village of chanaz p m sunday we have been in the rhone hours it is unimaginably still and reposeful and cool and soft and breezy no rowing or work of any kind to do we merely float with the current we glide noiseless and swift as fast as a london cabhorse rips along miles an hour the swiftest current ive ever boated in we have the entire river to ourselves nowhere a boat of any kind good bye sweetheart s l c port de grolee monday pm sept name of the village which we left five minutes ago we went ashore at p m yesterday dear heart and walked a short mile to st geuix a big village and took quarters at the principal inn had a good dinner and afterwards along walk out of town on the banks of the guiers till went to bed at and continued to make notes and read books and newspapers till midnight slept until breakfasted in bed and lay till noon because there had been a very heavy rain in the night and the day was still dark and lowering but at noon the sun broke through and in minutes we were tramping toward the river got afloat at p m but at we had to rush suddenly ashore and take refuge in the above village just as we got ourselves and traps safely housed in the inn the rain let go and came down in great style we lost an hour and a half there but we are off again now with bright sunshine i wrote you yesterday my darling and shall expect to write you every day goodday and love to all of you saml on the rhone below villebois tuesday noon good morning sweetheart night caught us yesterday where we had to take quarters in a peasants house which was occupied by the family and a lot of cows and calves also several rabbits his word for fleas the latter had a ball and i was the ballroom but they were very friendly and didnt bite the peasants were mighty kind and hearty and flew around and did their best to make us comfortable this morning i breakfasted on the shore in the open air with two sociable dogs and a cat clean cloth napkin and table furniture white sugar a vast hunk of excellent butter good bread first class coffee with pure milk fried fish just caught wonderful that so much cleanliness should come out of such a phenomenally dirty house an hour ago we saw the falls of the rhone a prodigiously rough and dangerous looking place shipped a little water but came to no harm it was one of the most beautiful pieces of piloting and boatmanagement i ever saw our admiral knew his business we have had to run ashore for shelter every time it has rained heretofore but joseph has been putting in his odd time making a waterproof sunbonnet for the boat and now we sail along dry although we had many heavy showers this morning with a word of love to you all and particularly you saml on the rhone below vienna i salute you my darling your telegram reached me in lyons last night and was very pleasant news indeed i was up and shaved before this morning but we got delayed and didnt sail from lyons till o an hour and a half lost and weve lost another hour two of them i guess since by an error we came in sight of vienne at oclock several miles ahead on a hill and i proposed to walk down there and let the boat go ahead of us so joseph and i got out and struck through a willow swamp along a dim path and by and by came out on the steep bank of a slough or inlet or something and we followed that bank forever and ever trying to get around the head of that slough finally i noticed a twig standing up in the water and by george it had a distinct and even vigorous quiver to it i dont know when i have felt so much like a donkey on an island i wanted to drown somebody but i hadnt anybody i could spare however after another long tramp we found a lonely native and he had a scow and soon we were on the mainland yes and a blamed sight further from vienne than we were when we started notes i make millions of them and so i get no time to write to you if youve got a pad there please send it posterestante to avignon i may not need it but i fear i shall im straining to reach st pierre de boef but its going to be a close fit i reckon afloat friday pm livy darling we sailed from st pierre de boef six hours ago and are now approaching tournon where we shall not stop but go on and make valence a city of people its too delicious floating with the swift current under the awning these superb sunshiny days in deep peace and quietness some of these curious old historical towns strangely persuade me but it is so lovely afloat that i dont stop but view them from the outside and sail on we get abundance of grapes and peaches for next to nothing joseph is perfect he is at his very best and never was better in his life i guess he gets discouraged and feels disliked and in the way when he is lying around but here he is perfection and brim full of useful alacrities and helps and ingenuities when i woke up an hour ago and heard the clock strike i said i seem to have been asleep an immensely long time i must have gone to bed mighty early i wonder what time i did go to bed and i got up and lit a candle and looked at my watch to see afloat hours below bourg st andeol monday am sept livy darling i didnt write yesterday we left la voulte in a driving storm of cold rain couldnt write in it and at p m when we were not thinking of stopping we saw a picturesque and mighty ruin on a high hill back of a village and i was seized with a desire to explore it so we landed at once and set out with rubbers and umbrella sending the boat ahead to st andeol and we spent hours clambering about those cloudy heights among those worn and vast and idiotic ruins of a castle built by two crusaders years ago the work of these asses was full of interest and we had a good time inspecting examining and scrutinizing it all the hills on both sides of the rhone have peaks and precipices and each has its gray and wasted pile of mouldy walls and broken towers the romans displaced the gauls the visigoths displaced the romans the saracens displaced the visigoths the christians displaced the saracens and it was these pious animals who built these strange lairs and cut each others throats in the name and for the glory of god and robbed and burned and slew in peace and war and the pauper and the slave built churches and the credit of it went to the bishop who racked the money out of them these are pathetic shores and they make one despise the human race we came down in an hour by rail but i couldnt get your telegram till this morning for it was sunday and they had shut up the post office to go to the circus i went too it was all one family parents and children performing in the open air to of these enchanted villagers who contributed coppers when called on it was a most gay and strange and pathetic show i got up at this morning to see the poor devils cook their poor breakfast and pack up their sordid fineries this is a km current and the wind is with us we shall make avignon before oclock i saw watermelons and pomegranates for sale at st andeol with a power of love sweetheart saml hotel deurope avignon monday pm sept well livy darling i have been having a perfect feast of letters for an hour and i thank you and dear clam with all my heart its like hearing from home after a long absence it is early to be in bed but im always abed before on this voyage and up at or a trifle later every morning if i ever take such a trip again i will have myself called at the first tinge of dawn and get to sea as soon after as possible the early dawn on the waternothing can be finer as i know by old mississippi experience i did so long for you and sue yesterday morning the most superb sunrise the most marvelous sunrise and i saw it all from the very faintest suspicion of the coming dawn all the way through to the final explosion of glory but it had interest private to itself and not to be found elsewhere in the world for between me and it in the far distanteastward was a silhouette mountainrange in which i had discovered the previous afternoon a most noble face upturned to the sky and mighty form out stretched which i had named napoleon dreaming of universal empire and now this prodigious face soft rich blue spirituelle asleep tranquil reposeful lay against that giant conflagration of ruddy and golden splendors all rayed like a wheel with the upstreaming and farreaching lances of the sun it made one want to cry for delight it was so supreme in its unimaginable majesty and beauty we had a curious experience today a little after i had sealed and directed my letter to you in which i said we should make avignon before we got lost we ceased to encounter any village or ruin mentioned in our particularizes and detailed guide of the rhone went drifting along by the hour in a wholly unknown land and on an uncharted river confound it we stopped talking and did nothing but stand up in the boat and search the horizons with the glass and wonder what in the devil had happened and at last away yonder at oclock when some east towers and fortresses hove in sight we couldnt recognize them for avignon yet we knew by the broken bridge that it was avignon then we saw what the trouble was at some time or other we had drifted down the wrong side of an island and followed a sluggish branch of the rhone not frequented in modern times we lost an hour and a half by it and missed one of the most picturesque and gigantic and historysodden masses of castellated medieval ruin that europe can show it was dark by the time we had wandered through the town and got the letters and found the hotel so i went to bed we shall leave here at noon tomorrow and float down to arles arriving about dark and there bid good bye to the boat the rivertrip finished between arles and nimes and avignon again we shall be till saturday morning then rail it through on that day to ouchy reaching the hotel at at night if the train isnt late next day sunday if you like go to basel and monday to berlin but i shall be at your disposal to do exactly as you desire and prefer with no end of love to all of you and twice as much to you sweetheart saml i believe my arm is a trifle better than it was when i started the mention in the foregoing letter of the napoleon effigy is the beginning of what proved to be a rather interesting episode mark twain thought a great deal of his discovery as he called it the giant figure of napoleon outlined by the distant mountain range in his notebook he entered memoranda telling just where it was to be seen and added a pencil sketch of the huge profile but then he characteristically forgot all about it and when he recalled the incident ten years later he could not remember the name of the village beauchastel from which the great figure could be seen also that he had made a record of the place but he was by this time more certain than ever that his discovery was a remarkable one which if known would become one of the great natural wonders such as niagara falls theodore stanton was visiting him at the time and clemens urged him on his return to france to make an excursion to the rhone and locate the lost napoleon as he now called it but clemens remembered the wonder as being somewhere between arles and avignon instead of about a hundred miles above the lastnamed town stanton naturally failed to find it and it remained for the writer of these notes motoring up the rhone one september day exactly twentytwo years after the first discovery to relocate the vast reclining figure of the first consul of france dreaming of universal empire the rediscovery was not difficult with mark twains memoranda as a guide and it was worth while perhaps the lost napoleon is not so important a natural wonder as mark twain believed but it is a striking picture and on a clear day the calm blue face outlined against the sky will long hold the travelers attention to clara clemens in ouchy switzerland afloat am sept tuesday dear old ben the vast stone masses and huge towers of the ancient papal palace of avignon are projected above an intervening wooded island a mile up the river behind me for we are already on our way to arles it is a perfectly still morning with a brilliant sun and very hot outside but i am under cover of the linen hood and it is cool and shady in here please tell mamma i got her very last letter this morning and i perceive by it that i do not need to arrive at ouchy before saturday midnight i am glad because i couldnt do the railroading i am proposing to do during the next two or three days and get there earlier i could put in the time till sunday midnight but shall not venture it without telegraphic instructions from her to nimes day after tomorrow oct care hotel manivet the only adventures we have is in drifting into rough seas now and then they are not dangerous but they go thro all the motions of it yesterday when we shot the bridge of the holy spirit it was probably in charge of some inexperienced deputy spirit for the day for we were allowed to go through the wrong arch which brought us into a tourbillon below which tried to make this old scow stand on its head of course i lost my temper and blew it off in a way to be heard above the roar of the tossing waters i lost it because the admiral had taken that arch in deference to my opinion that it was the best one while his own judgment told him to take the one nearest the other side of the river i could have poisoned him i was so mad to think i had hired such a turnip a boatman in command should obey nobodys orders but his own and yield to nobodys suggestions it was very sweet of you to write me dear and i thank you ever so much with greatest love and kisses papa to mrs clemens in ouchy switzerland arles sept noon livy darling i haint got no time to write today because i am sight seeing industriously and imagining my chapter bade goodbye to the river trip and gave away the boat yesterday evening we had ten great days in her we reached here after dark we were due about counting by distance but we couldnt calculate on such a lifeless current as we found i love you sweetheart saml it had been a long time since clemens had written to his old friend twichell but the rhone trip must have reminded him of those days thirteen years earlier when comparatively young men he and twichell were tramping through the black forest and scaling gemmi pass he sent twichell a reminder of that happy time to rev joseph h twichell in hartford conn nimes oct dear joe i have been ten days floating down the rhone on a raft from lake bourget and a most curious and darling kind of a trip it has been you ought to have been along i could have made room for you easily and you would have found that a pedestrian tour in europe doesnt begin with a raftvoyage for hilarity and mild adventure and intimate contact with the unvisited native of the back settlements and extinction from the world and newspapers and a conscience in a state of coma and lazy comfort and solid happiness in fact theres nothing thats so lovely but its all over i gave the raft away yesterday at arles and am loafing along back by short stages on the rail to ouchylausanne where the tribe are staying love to you all mark the clemenses settled in berlin for the winter at kornerstrasse and later at the hotel royal there had been no permanent improvement in mark twains arm and he found writing difficult some of the letters promised to laffan and mcclure were still unfinished young hall his publishing manager in america was working hard to keep the business afloat and being full of the optimism of his years did not fail to make as good a showing as he could we may believe his letters were very welcome to clemens and his wife who found little enough in the general prospect to comfort them to mr hall in new york berlin nov dear mr hall that kind of a statement is valuable it came this morning this is the first time since the business began that i have had a report that furnished the kind of information i wanted and was really enlightening and satisfactory keep it up dont let it fall into desuetude everything looks so fine and handsome with the business now that i feel a great letup from depression the rewards of your long and patient industry are on their way and their arrival safe in port presently seems assured by george i shall be glad when the ship comes in my arm is so much better that i was able to make a speech last night to americans but when they threw my portrait on the screen it was a sorrowful reminder for it was from a negative of years ago and hadnt a gray hair in it and now that my arm is better i have stolen a couple of days and finished up a couple of mcclure letters that have been lying a long time i shall mail one of them to you next tuesday registered lookout for it i shall register and mail the other one concerning the jungfrau next friday look out for it also and drop me a line to let me know they have arrived i shall write the th and last letter by and by when i have studied berlin sufficiently yours in a most cheerful frame of mind and with my and all the familys thanksgiving greetings and best wishes s l clemens postscript by mrs clemens written on mr clemenss letter dear mr hall this is my birthday and your letter this morning was a happy addition to the little gifts on the breakfast table i thought of going out and spending money for something unnecessary after it came but concluded perhaps i better wait a little longer sincerely yours o l clemens the german chicago was the last of the six mcclure letters and was finished that winter in berlin it is now included in the uniform edition of mark twains works and is one of the best descriptive articles of the german capital ever written he made no use of the rhone notes further than to put them together in literary form they did not seem to him to contain enough substance to warrant publication a letter to hall written toward the end of december we find rather gloomy in tone though he is still able to extract comfort and even cheerfulness from one of mr halls reports memorandum to fred j hall in new york among the mss i left with you are a few that have a recent look and are written on rather stiff pale green paper if you will have those typewritered and keep the originals and send me the copies one per mail not two ill see if i can use them but tell howells and other inquirers that my hopes of writing anything are very slender i seem to be disabled for life drop mcclure a line and tell him the same i cant dare to make an engagement now for even a single letter i am glad howells is on a magazine but sorry he gave up the study i shall have to go on a magazine myself if this l a l continues to hold my nose down to the grindstone much longer im going to hold my breath now for days then the annual statement will arrive and i shall know how we feel merry xmas to you from us all sincerely s l c p s just finished the above and finished raging at the eternal german taxgatherer and so all the jubilant things which i was going to say about the past years business got knocked out of me after writing this present letter i was feeling blue about huck finn but i sat down and overhauled your reports from now back to last april and compared them with the splendid octnov business and went to bed feeling refreshed and fine for certainly it has been a handsome year now rush me along the annual report and lets see how we feel s l c xxxii letters chiefly to mr hall and mrs crane in berlin mentone badnauheim florence mark twain was the notable literary figure in berlin that winter the center of every great gathering he was entertained by the kaiser and shown many special attentions by germans of every rank his books were as well known in berlin as in new york and at court assemblies and embassies he was always a chief center of interest he was too popular for his own good the gaiety of the capital told on him finally one night after delivering a lecture in a hot room he contracted a severe cold driving to a ball at general von versens and a few days later was confined to his bed with pneumonia it was not a severe attack but it was long continued he could write some letters and even work a little but he was not allowed to leave his bed for many weeks a condition which he did not find a hardship for no man ever enjoyed the loose luxury of undress and the comfort of pillows more than mark twain in a memorandum of that time he wrote i am having a booming time all to myself meantime hall in america was sending favorable reports of the publishing business and this naturally helped to keep up his spirits he wrote frequently to hall of course but the letters for the most part are purely of a business nature and of little interest to the general reader to fred j hall in new york hotel royal berlin feb dear mr hall daly wants to get the stage rights of the american claimant the foundation from which i wrote the story is a play of the same name which has been in a p burbanks hands or years that play cost me some money helping burbank stage it but has never brought me any i have written burbank lotos club and asked him to give me back his rights in the old play so that i can treat with daly and utilize this chance to even myself up burbank is a lovely fellow and if he objects i cant urge him but you run in at the lotos and see him and if he relinquishes his claim then i would like you to conduct the business with daly or have whitford or some other lawyer do it under your supervision if you prefer this morning i seem to have rheumatism in my right foot i am ordered south by the doctor and shall expect to be well enough to start by the end of this month no signature it is curious after clemens and howells had tried so hard and so long to place their sellers play that now when the story appeared in book form augustin daly should have thought it worth dramatizing daly and clemens were old friends and it would seem that daly could hardly have escaped seeing the play when it was going the rounds but perhaps there is nothing more mysterious in the world than the ways and wants of theatrical managers the matter came to nothing of course but the fact that daly should have thought a story built from an old discarded play had a play in it seems interesting clemens and his wife were advised to leave the cold of berlin as soon as he was able to travel this was not until the first of march when taking their old courier joseph very they left the children in good hands and journeyed to the south of france to susy clemens in berlin mentone mch susy dear i have been delighted to note your easy facility with your pen and proud to note also your literary superiorities of one kind and another clearness of statement directness felicity of expression photographic ability in setting forth an incident style good style no barnacles on it in the way of unnecessary retarding words the shipman scrapes off the barnacles when he wants his racer to go her best gait and straight to the buoy you should write a letter every day long or short and so ought i but i dont mamma says tell clara yes she will have to write a note if the fan comes back mended we couldnt go to nice today had to give it up on various accounts and this was the last chance i am sorry for mamma i wish she could have gone she got a heavy fall yesterday evening and was pretty stiff and lame this morning but is working it off trunk packing joseph is gone to nice to educate himself in kodaking and to get the pictures mounted which mamma thinks she took here but i noticed she didnt take the plug out as a rule when she did she took nine pictures on top of each other composites with lots of love papa in the course of their italian wanderings they reached florence where they were so comfortable and well that they decided to engage a villa for the next winter through prof willard fiske they discovered the villa viviani near settignano an old palace beautifully located on the hilltops east of florence commanding a wonderful view of the ancient city clemens felt that he could work there and time proved that he was right for the summer however they returned to germany and located at badnauheim clemens presently decided to make a trip to america to give some personal attention to business matters for one thing his publishinghouse in spite of prosperity seemed constantly to be requiring more capital and then a chicago company had been persuaded by paige to undertake the manufacture of the typesetter it was the beginning of a series of feverish trips which he would make back and forth across the ocean during the next two years to fred j hall in new york badnauheim june saturday dear mr hall if this arrives before i do let it inform you that i am leaving bremen for new york next tuesday in the havel if you can meet me when the ship arrives you can help me to get away from the reporters and maybe you can take me to your own or some other lodgings where they cant find me but if the hour is too early or too late for you i shall obscure myself somewhere till i can come to the office yours sincerely s l c nothing of importance happened in america the new paige company had a factory started in chicago and expected to manufacture fifty machines as a beginning they claimed to have capital or to be able to command it and as the main control had passed from clemenss hands he could do no more than look over the ground and hope for the best as for the business about all that he could do was to sign certain notes necessary to provide such additional capital as was needed and agree with hall that hereafter they would concentrate their efforts and resist further temptation in the way of new enterprise then he returned to badnauheim and settled down to literature this was the middle of july and he must have worked pretty steadily for he presently had a variety of mss ready to offer to fred j hall in new york aug dear mr halt i have dropped that novel i wrote you about because i saw a more effective way of using the main episode to wit by telling it through the lips of huck finn so i have started huck finn and tom sawyer still years old and their friend the freed slave jim around the world in a stray balloon with huck as narrator and somewhere after the end of that great voyage he will work in the said episode and then nobody will suspect that a whole book has been written and the globe circumnavigated merely to get that episode in an effective and at the same time apparently unintentional way i have written words of this narrative and find that the humor flows as easily as the adventures and surprises so i shall go along and make a book of from to words it is a story for boys of course and i think will interest any boy between years and when i was in new york the other day mrs dodge editor of st nicholas wrote and offered me for serial right a story for boys words long i wrote back and declined for i had other matter in my mind then i conceive that the right way to write a story for boys is to write so that it will not only interest boys but will also strongly interest any man who has ever been a boy that immensely enlarges the audience now this story doesnt need to be restricted to a childs magazine it is proper enough for any magazine i should think or for a syndicate i dont swear it but i think so proposed title of the story new adventures of huckleberry finn no signature the novel mentioned in the foregoing was the extraordinary twins a story from which puddnhead wilson would be evolved later it was a wildly extravagant farce just the sort of thing that now and then mark twain plunged into with an enthusiasm that had to work itself out and die a natural death or mellow into something worth while tom sawyer abroad as the new huck story was finally called was completed and disposed of to st nicholas for serial publication the twichells were in europe that summer and came to badnauheim the next letter records a pleasant incident the prince of wales of that day later became king edward vii to mr and mrs orion clemens in keokuk iowa private badnauheim aug dear orion and mollie private because no newspaperman or other gossip must get hold of it livy is getting along pretty well and the doctor thinks another summer here will cure her the twichells have been here four days and we have had good times with them joe and i ran over to homburg the great pleasure resort saturday to dine with some friends and in the morning i went walking in the promenade and met the british ambassador to the court of berlin and he introduced me to the prince of wales and i found him a most unusually comfortable and unembarrassing englishman to talk with quick to see the obscurest point and equipped with a laugh which is spontaneous and catching am invited by a near friend of his to meet him at dinner day after tomorrow and there could be a good time but the brass band will smash the talk and spoil everything we are expecting to move to florence ten or twelve days hence but if this hot weather continues we shall wait for cooler i take clara to berlin for the wintermusic mainly with german and french added thus far jean is our only glib french scholar we all send love to you all and to pamela and sams family and annie sam clemens and family left badnauheim for italy by way of switzerland in september mrs clemenss sister mrs crane who had been with them in europe during the first year had now returned to america mrs clemens had improved at the baths though she had by no means recovered her health we get a general report of conditions from the letter which clemens wrote mrs crane from lucerne switzerland where the party rested for several days the phelps mentioned in this letter was william walter phelps united states minister to germany the phelps and clemens families had been much associated in berlin mason was frank mason consul general at frankfort and in later years at paris charlie and ida were charles and mrs langdon of elmira to mrs crane in elmira n y lucerne sept dear aunt sue imagine how i felt to find that you had actually gone off without filling my traveling ink stand which you gave me i found it out yesterday livy advised me to write you about it i have been driving this pen hard i wrote pages on a yarn called tom sawyer abroad then took up the twins again destroyed the last half of the manuscript and rewrote it in another form and am going to continue it and finish it in florence tom sawyer seems rather pale to the family after the extravagances of the twins but they came to like it after they got used to it we remained in nauheim a little too long if we had left there four or five days earlier we should have made florence in days but by the time we got started livy had got smitten with what we feared might be erysipelas greatly swollen neck and face and unceasing headaches we lay idle in frankfort days doctoring we started thursday and made bale hard trip because it was one of those trains that gets tired every seven minutes and stops to rest three quarters of an hour it took us hours to get here instead of the regulation we reached here friday evening and will leave tomorrow tuesday morning the rest has made the headaches better we shall pull through to milan tomorrow if possible next day we shall start at a m and try to make bologna hours next day thursday florence d v next year we will walk for these excursions have got to be made over again ive got seven trunks and i undertook to be courier because i meant to express them to florence direct but we were a couple of days too late all continental roads had issued a peremptory order that no baggage should travel a mile except in the company of the owner all over europe people are howling they are separated from their baggage and cant get it forwarded to them i have to reship my trunks every day it is very amusing uncommonly so there seemed grave doubts about our being able to get these trunks over the italian frontier but ive got a very handsome note from the frankfort italian consul general addressed to all italian customs officers and we shall get through if anybody does the phelpses came to frankfort and we had some great times dinner at his hotel the masons supper at our inn livy not in it she was merely allowed a glimpse no more of course phelps said she was merely pretending to be ill was never looking so well and fine the children are all right they paddle around a little and driveso do we all lucerne seems to be pretty full of tourists the fleulen boat went out crowded yesterday morning the paris herald has created a public interest by inoculating one of its correspondents with cholera a man said yesterday he wished to god they would inoculate all of them yes the interest is quite general and strong and much hope is felt livy says i have said enough bad things and better send all our loves to you and charley and ida and all the children and shut up which i do and shut up s l c they reached florence on the th and four days later we find clemens writing again to mrs crane detailing everything at length little comment on this letter is required it fully explains itself perhaps a word of description from one of his memoranda will not be out of place of the villa he wrote it is a plain square building like a box and is painted light green and has green windowshutters it stands in a commanding position on the artificial terrace of liberal dimensions which is walled around with masonry from the walls the vineyards and olive groves of the estate slant away toward the valley roses overflow the retaining walls and the battered and mossy stone urn on the gatepost in pink and yellow cataracts exactly as they do on the dropcurtains in the theaters the house is a very fortress for strength the mrs ross in this letter was janet ross daughter of lady duff gordon remembered today for her egyptian letters the ross castle was but a little distance away to mrs crane in elmira villa viviani settignano florence sept dear sue we have been in the house several days and certainly it is a beautiful place particularly at this moment when the skies are a deep leaden color the domes of florence dim in the drizzling rain and occasional perpendicular coils of lightning quivering intensely in the black sky about galileos tower it is a charming panorama and the most conspicuous towers and domes down in the city look today just as they looked when boccaccio and dante used to contemplate them from this hillock five and six hundred years ago the mademoiselle is a great help to livy in the housekeeping and is a cheery and cheerful presence in the house the butler is equipped with a little french and it is this fact that enables the house to go but it wont go well until the family get some sort of facility with the italian tongue for the cook the womanofallwork and the coachman understand only that it is a stubborn and devilish language to learn but jean and the others will master it livys german nauheim girl is the worst off of anybody as there is no market for her tongue at all among the help with the furniture in and the curtains up the house is very pretty and not unhomelike at midnight last night we heard screams up stairs susy had set the lofty window curtains afire with a candle this sounds kind of frightful whereas when you come to think of it a burning curtain or pile of furniture hasnt any element of danger about it in this fortress there isnt any conceivable way to burn this house down or enable a conflagration on one floor to climb to the next mrs ross laid in our wood wine and servants for us and they are excellent she had the house scoured from cellar to rook the curtains washed and put up all beds pulled to pieces beaten washed and put together again and beguiled the marchese into putting a big porcelain stove in the vast central hall she is a wonderful woman and we dont quite see how or when we should have gotten under way without her observe our address above the post delivers letters daily at the house even with the work and fuss of settling the house livy has improved and the best is yet to come there is going to be absolute seclusion here a hermit life in fact we the rest of us shall run over to the rosss frequently and they will come here now and then and see livy that is all mr fiske is away nobody knows where and the work on his house has been stopped and his servants discharged therefore we shall merely go rossing as far as society is concerned shant circulate in florence until livy shall be well enough to take a share in it this present house is modern it is not much more than two centuries old but parts of it and also its foundations are of high antiquity the fine beautiful family portraits the great carved ones in the large ovals over the doors of the big hall carry one well back into the past one of them is dated he could have known dante you see another is dated he could have known boccaccio and spent his afternoons in fiesole listening to the decameron tales another is dated he could have met columbus evening the storm thundered away until night and the rain came down in floods for awhile there was a partial break which furnished about such a sunset as will be exhibited when the last day comes and the universe tumbles together in wreck and ruin i have never seen anything more spectacular and impressive one person is satisfied with the villa anyway jean prefers it to all europe save venice jean is eager to get at the italian tongue again now and i see that she has forgotten little or nothing of what she learned of it in rome and venice last spring i am the head french duffer of the family most of the talk goes over my head at the table i catch only words not phrases when italian comes to be substituted i shall be even worse off than i am now i suppose this reminds me that this evening the german girl said to livy man hat mir gesagt loss sie una candella verlaught habe unconsciously dropping in a couple of italian words you see so she is going to join the polyglots too it appears they say it is good entertainment to hear her and the butler talk together in their respective tongues piecing out and patching up with the universal signlanguage as they go along five languages in use in the house including the signlanguagehardestworked of them all and yet with all this opulence of resource we do seem to have an uncommonly tough time making ourselves understood what we lack is a cat if we only had germania that was the most satisfactory allround cat i have seen yet totally ungermanic in the raciness of his character and in the sparkle of his mind and the spontaneity of his movements we shall not look upon his like again s l c clemens got well settled down to work presently he found the situation the climate the background entirely suited to literary production and in a little while he had accomplished more than at any other time since his arrival in europe from letters to mrs crane and to mr hall we learn something of his employments and his satisfaction to mrs crane in elmira villa viviani settignano florence oct dear sue we are getting wonted the open fires have driven away the cold and the doubt and now a cheery spirit pervades the place livy and the kings and mademoiselle having been taking their tea a number of times lately on the open terrace with the city and the hills and the sunset for company i stop work a few minutes as a rule when the sun gets down to the hilltops west of florence and join the teagroup to wonder and exclaim there is always some new miracle in the view a new and exquisite variation in the show a variation which occurs every minutes between dawn and night once early in the morning a multitude of white villas not before perceived revealed themselves on the far hills then we recognized that all those great hills are snowed thick with them clear to the summit the variety of lovely effects the infinitude of change is something not to be believed by any who has not seen it no view that i am acquainted with in the world is at all comparable to this for delicacy charm exquisiteness dainty coloring and bewildering rapidity of change it keeps a person drunk with pleasure all the time sometimes florence ceases to be substantial and becomes just a faint soft dream with domes and towers of air and one is persuaded that he might blow it away with a puff of his breath livy is progressing admirably this is just the place for her remainder missing to fred j hall in new york dec dear mr hall november check received i have lent the californians story to arthur stedman for his author club book so your suggestion that my new springbook bear that name arrives too late as he probably would not want us to use that story in a book of ours until the author book had had its run that is for him to decide and i dont want him hampered at all in his decision i for my part prefer the banknote and other stories by mark twain as a title but above my judgment i prefer yours i mean this it is not taffy i told arthur to leave out the former squib or paragraph and use only the californians story tell him this is because i am going to use that in the book i am now writing i finished those extraordinary twins night before last makes or words havent counted the last third of it suits me to a dot i begin today to entirely recast and rewrite the first twothirds new plan with two minor characters made very prominent one major character cropped out and the twins subordinated to a minor but not insignificant place the minor character will now become the chiefest and i will name the story after him puddnhead wilson merry xmas to you and great prosperity and felicity s l clemens xxxiii letters to mr hall mrs clemens and others florence business troubles puddnhead wilson joan of arc at the players new york the reader may have suspected that young mr hall in new york was having his troubles he was by this time onethird owner in the business of charles l webster co as well as its general manager the business had been drained of its capital one way and anotherpartly by the publication of unprofitable books partly by the earlier demands of the typesetter but more than all by the manufacturing cost and agents commissions demanded by l a l that is to say the eleven large volumes constituting the library of american literature which webster had undertaken to place in a million american homes there was plenty of sale for it indeed that was just the trouble for it was sold on payments small monthly payments while the cost of manufacture and the liberal agents commissions were cash items and it would require a considerable period before the dribble of collections would swell into a tide large enough to satisfy the steady outflow of expense a sale of twentyfive sets a day meant prosperity on paper but unless capital could be raised from some other source to make and market those books through a period of months perhaps even years to come it meant bankruptcy in reality it was halls job with clemens to back him to keep their ship afloat on these steadily ebbing financial waters it was also halls affair to keep mark twain cheerful to look pleasant himself and to show how they were steadily getting rich because orders were pouring in though a cloud that resembled bankruptcy loomed always a little higher upon the horizon if hall had not been young and an optimist he would have been frightened out of his boots early in the game as it was he made a brave steady fight kept as cheerful and stiff an upper lip as possible always hoping that something would happen some grand sale of his other books some unexpected inflow from the typesetter interests anything that would sustain his ship until the l a l tide should turn and float it into safety clemens had faith in hall and was fond of him he never found fault with him he tried to accept his encouraging reports at their face value he lent the firm every dollar of his literary earnings not absolutely needed for the familys support he signed new notes he allowed mrs clemens to put in such remnants of her patrimony as the typesetter had spared the situation in was about as here outlined the letters to hall of that year are frequent and carry along the story to any who had formed the idea that mark twain was irascible exacting and faultfinding they will perhaps be a revelation to fred j hall in new york florence jan dear mr hall yours of dec is to hand and mrs clemens is deeply distressed for she thinks i have been blaming you or finding fault with you about something but most surely that cannot be i tell her that although i am prone to write hasty and regrettable things to other people i am not a bit likely to write such things to you i cant believe i have done anything so ungrateful if i have pile coals of fire on my head for i deserve it i wonder if my letter of credit isnt an encumbrance do you have to deposit the whole amount it calls for if that is so it is an encumbrance and we must withdraw it and take the money out of soak i have never made drafts upon it except when compelled because i thought you deposited nothing against it and only had to put up money that i drew upon it that therefore the less i drew the easier it would be for you i am dreadfully sorry i didnt know it would be a help to you to let my monthly check pass over a couple of months i could have stood that by drawing what is left of mrs clemenss letter of credit and we would have done it cheerfully i will write whitmore to send you the century check for and you can collect mrs dodges whitmore has power of attorney which i think will enable him to endorse it over to you in my name if you need that put it in the business and use it and send whitmore the companys note for a year if you dont need it turn it over to mr halsey and let him invest it for me ive a mighty poor financial head and i may be all wrong but tell me if i am wrong in supposing that in lending my own firm money at per cent i pay of it myself and so really get only a per cent now dont laugh if that is stupid of course my friend declined to buy a quarter interest in the l a l for i judged he would i hoped he would offer but he didnt if the cholera breaks out in america a few months hence we cant borrow or sell but if it doesnt we must try hard to raise i wish we could do it before there is a cholera scare i have been in bed two or three days with a cold but i got up an hour ago and i believe i am all right again how i wish i had appreciated the need of when i was in new york last summer i would have tried my best to raise it it would make us able to stand sets of l a l per month but not any more i guess you have done magnificently with the business and we must raise the money somehow to enable you to reap the reward of all that labor sincerely yours s l clemens whitmore in this letter was f g whitmore of hartford mark twains financial agent the money due from mrs dodge was a balance on tom sawyer abroad which had been accepted by st nicholas mr halsey was a downtown broker clemens who was growing weary of the constant demands of l a l had conceived the idea that it would be well to dispose of a portion of it for enough cash to finance its manufacture we dont know who the friend was to whom he offered a quarter interest for the modest sum of two hundred thousand dollars but in the next letter we discover designs on a certain very canny scotchman of skibo to fred j hall in new york florence jan dear mr hall i want to throw out a suggestion and see what you think of it we have a good start and solid ground under us we have a valuable reputation our business organization is practical sound and welldevised our publications are of a respectworthy character and of a moneybreeding species now then i think that the association with us of some one of great name and with capital would give our business a prodigious impetus that phrase is not too strong as i look at it it is not money merely that is needed if that were all the firm has friends enough who would take an interest in a paying venture we need some one who has made his life a success not only from a business standpoint but with that achievement back of him has been great enough to make his power felt as a thinker and a literary man it is a pretty usual thing for publishers to have this sort of partners now you see what a power carnegie is and how far his voice reaches in the several lines i speak of do you know him you do by correspondence or purely business talks about his books but personally i mean so that it would not be an intrusion for you to speak to him about this desire of mine for i would like you to put it before him and if you fail to interest him in it you will probably get at least some valuable suggestions from him ill enclose a note of introduction you neednt use it if you dont need to yours s l c p s yes i think i have already acknowledged the dec and the jan and if another was mailed days ago theres no hiatus i think i also reminded you that the new letter of credit does not cover the unexpended balance of the old one but falls considerably short of it do your best with carnegie and dont wait to consider any of my intermediate suggestions or talks about our raising half of the ourselves i mean wait for nothing to make my suggestion available i should have to go over and see arnot and i dont want to until i can mention carnegies name to him as going in with us my book is typewritten and ready for print puddnhead wilsona tale or those extraordinary twins if preferable it makes words more than huck finn but i dont know what to do with it mrs clemens thinks it wouldnt do to go to the am pub co or anywhere outside of our own house we have no subscription machinery and a book in the trade is a book thrown away as far as moneyprofit goes i am in a quandary give me a lift out of it i will mail the book to you and get you to examine it and see if it is good or if it is bad i think it is good and i thought the claimant bad when i saw it in print but as for real judgment i think i am destitute of it i am writing a companion to the prince and pauper which is half done and will make words and i have had the idea that if it were gotten up in handsome style with many illustrations and put at a high enough price maybe the l a l canvassers would take it and run it with that book would they it could be priced anywhere from up to according to how it was gotten up i suppose i dont want it to go into a magazine s l c i am having several short things typewritered i will send them to you presently i like the century and harpers but i dont know that i have any business to object to the cosmopolitan if they pay as good rates i suppose a man ought to stick to one magazine but that may be only superstition what do you think s l c the companion to the prince and the pauper mentioned in this letter was the story of joan of arc perhaps the most finished of mark twains literary productions his interest in joan had been first awakened when as a printers apprentice in hannibal he had found blowing along the street a stray leaf from some printed story of her life that fragment of history had pictured joan in prison insulted and mistreated by ruffians it had aroused all the sympathy and indignation in the boy sam clemens also it had awakened his interest in history and indeed in all literature his love for the character of joan had grown with the years until in time he had conceived the idea of writing her story as far back as the early eighties he had collected material for it and had begun to make the notes one thing and another had interfered and he had found no opportunity for such a story now however in florence in the ancient villa and in the quiet garden looking across the vineyards and olive groves to the dream city along the arno he felt moved to take up the tale of the shepherd girl of france the soldier maid or as he called her the noble child the most innocent the most lovely the most adorable the ages have produced his surroundings and background would seem to have been perfect and he must have written with considerable ease to have completed a hundred thousand words in a period of not more than six weeks perhaps hall did not even go to see carnegie at all events nothing seems to have come of the idea once at a later time mask twain himself mentioned the matter to carnegie and suggested to him that it was poor financiering to put all of ones eggs into one basket meaning into iron but carnegie answered thats a mistake put all your eggs into one basket and watch that basket it was march when clemens felt that once more his presence was demanded in america he must see if anything could be realized from the typesetter or l a l to fred j hall in new york march dear mr hall i am busy getting ready to sail the d in the kaiser wilhelm ii i send herewith magazine articles the story contains to words the diary contains words each would make about pages of the century the diary is a gem if i do say it myself that shouldnt if the cosmopolitan wishes to pay for either of them or for both gather in the check and i will use the money in america instead of breaking into your treasury if they dont wish to trade for either send the articles to the century without naming a price and if their check isnt large enough i will call and abuse them when i come i signed and mailed the notes yesterday yours s l c clemens reached new york on the d of april and made a trip to chicago but accomplished nothing except to visit the worlds fair and be laid up with a severe cold the machine situation had not progressed the financial stringency of had brought everything to a standstill the new york bank would advance webster co no more money so disturbed were his affairs so disordered was everything that sometimes he felt himself as one walking amid unrealities a fragment of a letter to mrs crane conveys this i dreamed i was born and grew up and was a pilot on the mississippi and a miner and a journalist in nevada and a pilgrim in the quaker city and had a wife and children and went to live in a villa at florence and this dream goes on and on and sometimes seems so real that i almost believe it is real i wonder if it is but there is no way to tell for if one applies tests they would be part of the dream too and so would simply aid the deceit i wish i knew whether it is a dream or real he saw warner briefly in america also howells now living in new york but he had little time for visiting on may th he sailed again for europe on the kaiser wilhelm ii on the night before sailing he sent howells a goodby word to w d howells in new york city murray hill hotel new yore may midnight dear howells i am so sorry i missed you i am very glad to have that book for sea entertainment and i thank you ever so much for it ive had a little visit with warner at last i was getting afraid i wasnt going to have a chance to see him at all i forgot to tell you how thoroughly i enjoyed your account of the country printing office and how true it all was and how intimately recognizable in all its details but warner was full of delight over it and that reminded me and i am glad for i wanted to speak of it you have given me a book annie trumbull has sent me her book i bought a couple of books mr hall gave me a choice german book laflan gave me two bottles of whisky and a box of cigars i go to sea nobly equipped goodbye and all good fortune attend you and yours and upon you all i leave my benediction mark mention has already been made of the ross home being very near to viviani and the association of the ross and clemens families there was a fine vegetable garden on the ross estate and it was in the interest of it that the next letter was written to the secretary of agriculture to hon j sterling morton in washington d c editorial department century magazine union square new york april to the hon j sterling morton dear sir your petitioner mark twain a poor farmer of connecticut indeed the poorest one there in the opinion of manydesires a few choice breeds of seed corn maize and in return will zealously support the administration in all ways honorable and otherwise to speak by the card i want these things to hurry to italy to an english lady she is a neighbor of mine outside of florence and has a great garden and thinks she could raise corn for her table if she had the right ammunition i myself feel a warm interest in this enterprise both on patriotic grounds and because i have a key to that garden which i got made from a wax impression it is not very good soil still i think she can grow enough for one table and i am in a position to select the table if you are willing to aid and abet a countryman and gilder thinks you are please find the signature and address of your petitioner below respectfully and truly yours mark twain fifth avenue new york p s a handful of choice southern watermelon seeds would pleasantly add to that ladys employments and give my table a corresponding lift his idea of business values had moderated considerably by the time he had returned to florence he was not hopeless yet but he was clearly a good deal disheartened anxious for freedom to fred j hall in new york florence may dear mr hall you were to cable me if you sold any machine royalties so i judge you have not succeeded this has depressed me i have been looking over the past years letters and statements and am depressed still more i am terribly tired of business i am by nature and disposition unfitted for it and i want to get out of it i am standing on the mount morris volcano with help from the machine a long way off doubtless a long way further off than the connecticut co imagines now here is my idea for getting out the firm owes mrs clemens and me i do not know quite how much but it is about or suppose i make this guess from the documents here whose technicalities confuse me horribly the firm owes other sums but there is stock and cash assets to cover the entire indebtedness and over is that it in addition we have the l a l plates and copyright worth more than is that correct that is to say we have property worth about above indebtedness i suppose or by one of your estimates the greater part of the first debts to me is in notes paying percent the rest the old or whatever it is pays no interest now then will harper or appleton or putnam give me for those debts and my twothirds interest in the firm the firm of course taking the mount morris and all such obligations off my hands and leaving me clear of all responsibility i dont want much money i only want first class notes worth of them at per cent payable monthly yearly notes renewable annually for years with of the principal payable at the beginning and middle of each year after that the notes renewable annually and perhaps a larger part of the principal payable semiannually please advise me and suggest alterations and emendations of the above scheme for i need that sort of help being ignorant of business and not able to learn a single detail of it such a deal would make it easy for a big firm to pour in a big cash capital and jump l a l up to enormous prosperity then your onethird would be a fortune and i hope to see that day i enclose an authority to use with whitmore in case you have sold any royalties but if you cant make this deal dont make any wait a little and see if you cant make the deal do make the deal if you possibly can and if any presence shall be necessary in order to complete it i will come over though i hope it can be done without that get me out of business and i will be yours forever gratefully s l clemens my idea is that i am offering my of l a l and the business for thirty or forty thousand dollars is that it p s s the new firm could retain my books and reduce them to a percent royalty s l c to rev jos h twichell in hartford villa viviani settignano florence june dear joe the sea voyage set me up and i reached here may in tolerable condition nothing left but weakness cough all gone old sir henry layard was here the other day visiting our neighbor janet ross daughter of lady duff gordon and since then i have been reading his account of the adventures of his youth in the far east in a footnote he has something to say about a sailor which i thought might interest you viz this same quartermaster was celebrated among the english in mesopotamia for an entry which he made in his logbookafter a perilous storm the windy and watery elements raged tears and prayers was had recourse to but was of no manner of use so we hauled up the anchor and got round the point there it isnt ned wakeman it was before his day with love mark they closed villa viviani in june and near the end of the month arrived in munich in order that mrs clemens might visit some of the german baths the next letter is written by her and shows her deep sympathy with hall in his desperate struggle there have been few more unselfish and courageous women in history than mark twains wife from mrs clemens to mr hall in new york june th munich dear mr hall your letter to mr clemens of june th has just reached here as he has gone to berlin for clara i am going to send you just a line in answer to it mr clemens did not realize what trouble you would be in when his letter should reach you or he would not have sent it just then i hope you will not worry any more than you can help do not let our interests weigh on you too heavily we both know you will as you always have look in every way to the best interests of all i think mr clemens is right in feeling that he should get out of business that he is not fitted for it it worries him too much but he need be in no haste about it and of course it would be the very farthest from his desire to imperil in the slightest degree your interests in order to save his own i am sure that i voice his wish as well as mine when i say that he would simply like you to bear in mind the fact that he greatly desires to be released from his present anxiety and worry at a time when it shall not endanger your interest or the safety of the business i am more sorry than i can express that this letter of mr clemens should have reached you when you were struggling under such terrible pressure i hope now that the weight is not quite so heavy he would not have written you about the money if he had known that it was an inconvenience for you to send it he thought the bookkeeper whose duty it is to forward it had forgotten we can draw on mr langdon for money for a few weeks until things are a little easier with you as mr clemens wrote you we would say do not send us any more money at present if we were not afraid to do so i will say however do not trouble yourself if for a few weeks you are not able to send the usual amount mr clemens and i have the greatest possible desire not to increase in any way your burdens and sincerely wish we might aid you i trust my brother may be able in his talk with you to throw some helpful light on the situation hoping you will see a change for the better and begin to reap the fruit of your long and hard labor believe me very cordially yours olivia l clemens hall naturally did not wish to be left alone with the business he realized that his credit would suffer both at the bank and with the public if his distinguished partner should retire he wrote therefore proposing as an alternate that they dispose of the big subscription set that was swamping them it was a good plan if it would work and we find clemens entering into it heartily to fred j hall in new york munich july dear mr hall you make a suggestion which has once or twice flitted dimly through my mind heretofore to wit sell l a l i like that better than the other scheme for it is no doubt feasible whereas the other is perhaps not the firm is in debt but l a l is free and not only free but has large money owing to it a proposition to sell that by itself to a big house could be made without embarrassment we merely confess that we cannot spare capital from the rest of the business to run it on the huge scale necessary to make it an opulent success it will be selling a good thing for somebody and it will be getting rid of a load which we are clearly not able to carry whoever buys will have a noble good opening a complete equipment a well organized business a capable and experienced manager and enterprise not experimental but under full sail and immediately able to pay per cent a year on every dollar the publisher shall actually invest in it i mean in making and selling the books i am miserably sorry to be adding bothers and torments to the oversupply which you already have in these hideous times but i feel so troubled myself considering the dreary fact that we are getting deeper and deeper in debt and the l a l getting to be a heavier and heavier burden all the time that i must bestir myself and seek a way of relief it did not occur to me that in selling out i would injure you for that i am not going to do but to sell l a l will not injure you it will put you in better shape sincerely yours s l clemens to fred j hall in new york july dear mr hall i am sincerely glad you are going to sell l a l i am glad you are shutting off the agents and i hope the fatal book will be out of our hands before it will be time to put them on again with nothing but our nonexistent capital to work with the book has no value for us rich a prize as it will be to any competent house that gets it i hope you are making an effort to sell before you discharge too many agents for i suppose the agents are a valuable part of the property we have been stopping in munich for awhile but we shall make a break for some country resort in a few days now sincerely yours s l c july p s no i suppose i am wrong in suggesting that you wait a moment before discharging your l a l agents in fact i didnt mean that i judge your only hope of salvation is in discharging them all at once since it is their commissions that threaten to swamp us it is they who have eaten up the i left with you in such a brief time no doubt i feel panicky i think the sale might be made with better advantage however now than later when the agents have got out of the purchasers reach s l c p s no monthly report for many months those who are old enough to remember the summer of may recall it as a black financial season banks were denying credit businesses were forced to the wall it was a poor time to float any costly enterprise the chicago company who was trying to build the machines made little progress the book business everywhere was bad in a brief note following the foregoing letters clemens wrote hall it is now past the middle of july and no cablegram to say the machine is finished we are afraid you are having miserable days and worried nights and we sincerely wish we could relieve you but it is all black with us and we dont know any helpful thing to say or do he inclosed some kind of manuscript proposition for john brisben walker of the cosmopolitan with the comment it is my ingenious scheme to protect the family against the almshouse for one more year and after that well goodness knows i have never felt so desperate in my life and good reason for i havent got a penny to my name and mrs clemens hasnt enough laid up with langdon to keep us two months it was like mark twain in the midst of all this turmoil to project an entirely new enterprise his busy mind was always visioning success in unusual undertakings regardless of immediate conditions and the steps necessary to achievement to fred j hall in new york july dear mr hall i hope the machine will be finished this month but it took me four years and cost me to finish the other machine after it was apparently entirely complete and setting type like a houseafire i wonder what they call finished after it is absolutely perfect it cant go into a printingoffice until it has had a months wear running night and day to get the bearings smooth i judge i may be able to run over about midoctober then if i find you relieved of l a l we will start a magazine inexpensive and of an entirely unique sort arthur stedman and his father editors of it arthur could do all the work merely submitting it to his father for approval the first number should pay and all subsequent ones cents a number cost of first number copies give most of them away sell the rest advertising and other expenses cost unknown send one to all newspapers it would get a notice favorable too but we cannot undertake it until l a l is out of the way with our hands free and some capital to spare we could make it hum where is the shelley article if you have it on hand keep it and i will presently tell you what to do with it dont forget to tell me yours sincerely s l c the shelley article mentioned in this letter was the defense of harriet sheller one of the very best of his essays how he could have written this splendid paper at a time of such distraction passes comprehension furthermore it is clear that he had revised indeed rewritten the long story of puddnhead wilson to fred j hall in new york july dear mr hall this time puddnhead wilson is a success even mrs clemens the most difficult of critics confesses it and without reserves or qualifications formerly she would not consent that it be published either before or after my death i have pulled the twins apart and made two individuals of them i have sunk them out of sight they are mere flitting shadows now and of no importance their story has disappeared from the book aunt betsy hale has vanished wholly leaving not a trace behind aunt patsy cooper and her daughter rowena have almost disappeared they scarcely walk across the stage the whole story is centered on the murder and the trial from the first chapter the movement is straight ahead without divergence or sideplay to the murder and the trial everything that is done or said or that happens is a preparation for those events therefore people stand up high from beginning to end and only puddnhead tom driscoll and his nigger mother roxana none of the others are important or get in the way of the story or require the readers attention consequently the scenes and episodes which were the strength of the book formerly are stronger than ever now when i began this final reconstruction the story contained words now it contains only i have knocked out everything that delayed the march of the story even the description of a mississippi steamboat theres no weather in and no scenery the story is stripped for flight now then what is she worth the amount of matter is but words short of the american claimant for which the syndicate paid there was nothing new in that story but the fingerprints in this one is virgin ground absolutely fresh and mighty curious and interesting to everybody i dont want any more syndicating nothing short of anyway and that i cant get but wont you see how much the cosmopolitan will stand do your best for me for i do not sleep these nights for visions of the poorhouse this in spite of the hopeful tone of yours of th to langdon just received for in me hope is very nearly expiring everything does look so blue so dismally blue by and by i shall take up the rhone openboat voyage again but not nowwe are going to be moving around too much i have torn up some of it but still have words that mrs clemens approves of and that i like i may go at it in paris again next winter but not unless i know i can write it to suit me otherwise i shall tackle adam once more and do him in a kind of a friendly and respectful way that will commend him to the sunday schools ive been thinking out his first lifedays today and framing his childish and ignorant impressions and opinions for him will ship puddnhead in a few days when you get it cable mark twain care brownship london received i mean to ship puddnhead wilson to yousay tomorrow itll furnish me hash for awhile i reckon i am almost sorry it is finished it was good entertainment to work at it and kept my mind away from things we leave here in about ten days but the doctors have changed our plans again i think we shall be in bohemia or thereabouts till near the end of september then go to paris and take a rest yours sincerely s l c p s mrs clemens has come in since and read your letter and is deeply distressed she thinks that in some letter of mine i must have reproached you she says it is wonderful that you have kept the ship afloat in this storm that has seen fleets and fleets go down that from what she learns of the american businesssituation from her home letters you have accomplished a marvel in the circumstances and that she cannot bear to have a word said to you that shall voice anything but praise and the heartiest appreciation and not the shadow of a reproach will she allow i tell her i didnt reproach you and never thought of such a thing and i said i would break open my letter and say so mrs clemens says i must tell you not to send any money for a month or two so that you may be afforded what little relief is in our power all right im willing this is honest but i wish brer chatto would send along his little yearly contribution i dropped him a line about another matter a week ago asked him to subscribe for the daily news for me you see i wanted to remind him in a covert way that it was payup time but doubtless i directed the letter to you or some one else for i dont hear from him and dont get any daily news either to fred j hall in new york aug dear mr hall i am very sorry it was thoughtless in me let the reports go send me once a month two items and two only cash liabilities so much cash assets so much i can perceive the condition of the business at a glance then and that will be sufficient here we never see a newspaper but even if we did i could not come anywhere near appreciating or correctly estimating the tempest you have been buffeting your way through only the man who is in it can do that but i have tried not to burden you thoughtlessly or wantonly i have been wrought and unsettled in mind by apprehensions and that is a thing that is not helpable when one is in a strange land and sees his resources melt down to a two months supply and cant see any sure daylight beyond the bloody machine offered but a doubtful outlook and will still offer nothing much better for a long time to come for when daviss three weeks is up theres three months tinkering to follow i guess that is unquestionably the boss machine of the world but is the toughest one on prophets when it is in an incomplete state that has ever seen the light neither davis nor any other man can foretell with any considerable approach to certainty when it will be ready to get down to actual work in a printing office no signature three days after the foregoing letter was written he wrote briefly great scott but its a long yearfor you and me i never knew the almanac to drag so at least since i was finishing that other machine i watch for your letters hungrily just as i used to watch for the cablegram saying the machines finished but when next week certainly swelled into three weeks sure i recognized the old familiar tune i used to hear so much ward dont know what sickheartedness is but he is in a way to find out always the quaint form of his humor no matter how dark the way we may picture him walking the floor planning scheming and smoking always smoking trying to find a way out it was not the kind of scheming that many men have done under the circumstances not scheming to avoid payment of debts but to pay them to fred j hall in new york aug dear mr hall i am very glad indeed if you and mr langdon are able to see any daylight ahead to me none is visible i strongly advise that every penny that comes in shall be applied to paying off debts i may be in error about this but it seems to me that we have no other course open we can pay a part of the debts owing to outsiders none to the clemenses in very prosperous times we might regard our stock and copyrights as assets sufficient with the money owing to us to square up and quit even but i suppose we may not hope for such luck in the present condition of things what i am mainly hoping for is to save my royalties if they come into danger i hope you will cable me so that i can come over and try to save them for if they go i am a beggar i would sail today if i had anybody to take charge of my family and help them through the difficult journeys commanded by the doctors i may be able to sail ten days hence i hope so and expect so we can never resurrect the l a l i would not spend any more money on that book you spoke a while back of trying to start it up again as a preparation to disposing of it but we are not in shape to venture that i think it would require more borrowing and we must not do that yours sincerely s l c aug i have thought and thought but i dont seem to arrive in any very definite place of course you will not have an instants safety until the bank debts are paid there is nothing to be thought of but to hand over every penny as fast as it comes in and that will be slow enough or could you secure them by pledging part of our cash assets and i am coming over just as soon as i can get the family moved and settled s l c two weeks following this letter he could endure the suspense no longer and on august th sailed once more for america in new york clemens settled down at the players club where he could live cheaply and undertook some literary work while he was casting about for ways and means to relieve the financial situation nothing promising occurred until one night at the murray hill hotel he was introduced by dr clarence c rice to henry h rogers of the standard oil group of financiers rogers had a keen sense of humor and had always been a great admirer of mark twains work it was a mirthful evening and certainly an eventful one in mark twains life a day or two later doctor rice asked the millionaire to interest himself a little in clemenss business affairs which he thought a good deal confused just what happened is not remembered now but from the date of the next letter we realize that a discussion of the matter by clemens and rogers must have followed pretty promptly to mrs clemens in europe oct dear dear sweetheart i dont seem to get even half a chance to write you these last two days and yet theres lots to say apparently everything is at last settled as to the giveaway of l a l and the papers will be signed and the transfer made tomorrow morning meantime i have got the best and wisest man in the whole standard oil group of muftimillionaires a good deal interested in looking into the typesetter this is private dont mention it he has been searching into that thing for three weeks and yesterday he said to me i find the machine to be all you represented it i have here exhaustive reports from my own experts and i know every detail of its capacity its immense value its construction cost history and all about its inventors character i know that the new york co and the chicago co are both stupid and that they are unbusinesslike people destitute of money and in a hopeless boggle then he told me the scheme he had planned then said if i can arrange with these people on this basis it will take several weeks to find out i will see to it that they get the money they need then the thing will move right along and your royalties will cease to be waste paper i will post you the minute my scheme fails or succeeds in the meantime you stop walking the floor go off to the country and try to be gay you may have to go to walking again but dont begin till i tell you my scheme has failed and he added keep me posted always as to where you are for if i need you and can use you i want to know where to put my hand on you if i should even divulge the fact that the standard oil is merely talking remotely about going into the typesetter it would send my royalties up with worlds and worlds of love and kisses to you all saml with so great a burden of care shifted to the broad financial shoulders of h h rogers mark twains spirits went ballooning soaring toward the stars he awoke too to some of the social gaieties about him and found pleasure in the things that in the hour of his gloom had seemed mainly mockery we find him going to a sunday evening at howellss to john mackays and elsewhere to mrs clemens in paris dec livy darling last night at john mackays the dinner consisted of soup raw oysters corned beef and cabbage and something like a custard i ate without fear or stint and yet have escaped all suggestion of indigestion the men present were old gray pacificcoasters whom i knew when i and they were young and not gray the talk was of the days when we went gypsying a long time ago thirty years indeed it was a talk of the dead mainly that and of how they looked and the harumscarum things they did and said for there were no cares in that life no aches and pains and not time enough in the day and threefourths of the night to work off ones surplus vigor and energy of the midnight highway robbery joke played upon me with revolvers at my head on the windswept and desolate gold hill divide no witness is left but me the victim all the friendly robbers are gone these old fools last night laughed till they cried over the particulars of that old forgotten crime john mackay has no family here but a pet monkey a most affectionate and winning little devil but he makes trouble for the servants for he is full of curiosity and likes to take everything out of the drawers and examine it minutely and he puts nothing back the examinations of yesterday count for nothing today he makes a new examination every day but he injures nothing i went with laffan to the racquet club the other night and played billiards two hours without starting up any rheumatism i suppose it was all really taken out of me in berlin richard harding davis spoke yesterday of claras impersonations at mrs van rensselaers here and said they were a wonderful piece of work livy dear i do hope you are comfortable as to quarters and food at the hotel brighton but if youre not dont stay there make one more effort dont give it up dear heart this is from one who loves you which is saml it was decided that rogers and clemens should make a trip to chicago to investigate personally the typesetter situation there clemens reports the details of the excursion to mrs clemens in a long subdivided letter most of which has no general interest and is here omitted the trip as a whole would seem to have been satisfactory the personal portions of the long christmas letter may properly be preserved to mrs clemens in paris the players xmas no merry xmas my darling and all my darlings i arrived from chicago close upon midnight last night and wrote and sent down my christmas cablegram before undressing merry xmas promising progress made in chicago it would get to the telegraph office toward this morning and reach you at luncheon i was vaguely hoping all the past week that my xmas cablegram would be definite and make you all jump with jubilation but the thought always intruded itself you are not going out there to negotiate with a man but with a louse this makes results uncertain i was asleep as christmas struck upon the clock at mid night and didnt wake again till two hours ago it is now half past xmas morning i have had my coffee and bread and shant get out of bed till it is time to dress for mrs laflans christmas dinner this evening where i shall meet bram stoker and must make sure about that photo with irvings autograph i will get the picture and he will attend to the rest in order to remember and not forget well i will go there with my dress coat wrong side out it will cause remark and then i shall remember no and i tell you it was interesting the chicago campaign i mean on the way out mr rogers would plan out the campaign while i walked the floor and smoked and assented then he would close it up with a snap and drop it and we would totally change the subject and take up the scenery etc here follows the long detailed report of the chicago conference of interest only to the parties directly concerned no we had nice tripe going and coming mr rogers had telegraphed the pennsylvania railroad for a couple of sections for us in the fast train leaving at p m the nd the vice president telegraphed back that every berth was engaged which was not true it goes without saying but that he was sending his own car for us it was mighty nice and comfortable in its parlor it had two sofas which could become beds at night it had four comfortablycushioned cane armchairs it had a very nice bedroom with a wide bed in it which i said i would take because i believed i was a little wider than mr rogers which turned out to be true so i took it it had a darling backporch railed roofed and roomy and there we sat most of the time and viewed the scenery and talked for the weather was may weather and the soft dreampictures of hill and river and mountain and sky were clear and away beyond anything i have ever seen for exquisiteness and daintiness the colored waiter knew his business and the colored cook was a finished artist breakfasts coffee with real cream beefsteaks sausage bacon chops eggs in various ways potatoes in various yes and quite wonderful baked potatoes and hot as fire dinners all manner of things including canvasback duck apollinaris claret champagne etc we sat up chatting till midnight going and coming seldom read a line day or night though we were well fixed with magazines etc then i finished off with a hot scotch and we went to bed and slept till am i honestly tried to pay my share of hotel bills fees etc but i was not allowed and i knew the reason why and respected the motive i will explain when i see you and then you will understand we were hours going to chicago we were there hours we were hours returning brisk work but all of it enjoyable we insisted on leaving the car at philadelphia so that our waiter and cook to whom mr r gave apiece could have their christmaseve at home mr rogerss carriage was waiting for us in jersey city and deposited me at the players there thats all this letter is to make up for the three letterless days i love you dear heart i love you all saml xxxiv letters a winter in new york business failure end of the machine the beginning of the new year found mark twain sailing buoyantly on a tide of optimism he believed that with h h rogers as his financial pilot he could weather safely any storm or stress he could divert himself or rest or work and consider his business affairs with interest and amusement instead of with haggard anxiety he ran over to hartford to see an amateur play to boston to give a charity reading to fair haven to open the library which mr rogers had established there he attended gay dinners receptions and late studio parties acquiring the name of the belle of new york in the letters that follow we get the echo of some of these things the mrs rice mentioned in the next brief letter was the wife of dr clarence c rice who had introduced h h rogers to mark twain to mrs clemens in paris jan livy darling i came down from hartford yesterday with kipling and he and hutton and i had the small smoking compartment to ourselves and found him at last at his ease and not shy he was very pleasant company indeed he is to be in the city a week and i wish i could invite him to dinner but it wont do i should be interrupted by business of course the construction of a contract that will suit paiges lawyer not paige turns out to be very difficult he is embarrassed by earlier advice to paige and hates to retire from it and stultify himself the negotiations are being conducted by means of tedious long telegrams and by talks over the longdistance telephone we keep the wires loaded dear me dinner is ready so mrs rice says with worlds of love saml clemens and oliver wendell holmes had met and become friends soon after the publication of innocents abroad in now twentyfive years later we find a record of what without doubt was their last meeting it occurred at the home of mrs james t field to mrs clemens in paris boston jan livy darling i am caught out worse this time than ever before in the matter of letters tuesday morning i was smart enough to finish and mail my long letter to you before breakfast for i was suspecting that i would not have another spare moment during the day it turned out just so in a thoughtless moment i agreed to come up here and read for the poor i did not reflect that it would cost me three days i could not get released yesterday i had myself called at and ran out to mr rogerss house at and talked business until half past then caught oclock train and arrived here at was shaven and dressed by and ready for dinner here in mrs fields charming house dr oliver wendell holmes never goes out now he is in his th year but he came out this timesaid he wanted to have a time once more with me mrs fields said aldrich begged to come and went away crying because she wouldnt let him she allowed only her family sarah orne jewett and sister to be present because much company would overtax dr holmes well he was just delightful he did as brilliant and beautiful talking and listening as ever he did in his life i guess fields and jewett said he hadnt been in such splendid form in years he had ordered his carriage for the coachman sent in for him at but he said oh nonsense leave glories and grandeurs like these tell him to go away and come in an hour at he was called for again and mrs fields getting uneasy rose but he wouldnt go and so we rattled ahead the same as ever twice more mrs fields rose but he wouldnt go and he didnt go till half past an unwarrantable dissipation for him in these days he was prodigiously complimentary about some of my books and is having puddnhead read to him i told him you and i used the autocrat as a courting book and marked it all through and that you keep it in the sacred green box with the love letters and it pleased him goodbye my dear darling it is minutes to dinner and im not dressed yet i have a reception tonight and will be out very late at that place and at irvings theatre where i have a complimentary box i wish you were all here saml in the next letter we meet james j corbett gentleman jim as he was sometimes called the champion pugilist of that day the howells incident so amusingly dramatized will perhaps be more appreciated if the reader remembers that mark twain himself had at intervals been a mindhealing enthusiast indeed in spite of his strictures on mrs eddy his interest in the subject of mindcure continued to the end of his life to mrs clemens in paris sunday a m livy dear when we got out to the house last night mrs rogers who is up and around now didnt want to go down stairs to dinner but mr r persuaded her and we had a very good time indeed by oclock we were down again and bought a fifteendollar box in the madison square garden rogers bought it not i then he went and fetched dr rice while i went to the players and picked up two artists reid and simmons and thus we filled of the seats there was a vast multitude of people in the brilliant place stanford white came along presently and invited me to go to the worldchampions dressing room which i was very glad to do corbett has a fine face and is modest and diffident besides being the most perfectly and beautifully constructed human animal in the world i said you have whipped mitchell and maybe you will whip jackson in june but you are not done then you will have to tackle me he answered so gravely that one might easily have thought him in earnest no i am not going to meet you in the ring it is not fair or right to require it you might chance to knock me out by no merit of your own but by a purely accidental blow and then my reputation would be gone and you would have a double one you have got fame enough and you ought not to want to take mine away from me corbett was for a long time a clerk in the nevada bank in san francisco there were lots of little boxing matches to entertain the crowd then at last corbett appeared in the ring and the people present went mad with enthusiasm my two artists went mad about his form they said they had never seen anything that came reasonably near equaling its perfection except greek statues and they didnt surpass it corbett boxed rounds with the middleweight australian champion oh beautiful to see then the show was over and we struggled out through a perfect wash of humanity when we reached the street i found i had left my arctics in the box i had to have them so simmons said he would go back and get them and i didnt dissuade him i couldnt see how he was going to make his way a single yard into that solid oncoming wave of people yet he must plow through it full yards he was back with the shoes in minutes how do you reckon he accomplished that miracle by saying way gentlemen please coming to fetch mr corbetts overshoes the word flew from mouth to mouth the red sea divided and simmons walked comfortably through and back dry shod simmons this was revealed to me under seal of secrecy by reid is the hero of gwen and he and gwens author were once engaged to marry this is fireescape simmons the inveterate talker you know exit in case of simmons i had an engagement at a beautiful dwelling close to the players for i was there by thirty cultivated and very musical ladies and gentlemen present all of them acquaintances and many of them personal friends of mine that wonderful hungarian band was there they charge for an evening conversation and band until midnight then a bite of supper then the company was compactly grouped before me and i told about dr b e martin and the etchings and followed it with the scotchirish christening my but the martin is a darling story next the head tenor from the opera sang half a dozen great songs that set the company wild yes mad with delight that nobly handsome young damrosch accompanying on the piano just a little pause then the band burst out into an explosion of weird and tremendous dance music a hungarian celebrity and his wife took the floor i followed i couldnt help it the others drifted in one by one and it was onteora over again by half past i had danced all those people down and yet was not tired merely breathless i was in bed at and asleep in ten minutes up at and presently at work on this letter to you i think i wrote until or half past then i walked leisurely out to mr rogerss it is called miles but it is short of it arriving at but he was out to return at and a person was in whom i dont particularly like so i didnt stay but dropped over and chatted with the howellses until first howells and i had a chat together i asked about mrs h he said she was fine still steadily improving and nearly back to her old best health i asked as if i didnt know what do you attribute this strange miracle to mindcure simply mindcure lord what a conversion you were a scoffer three months ago i i wasnt you were you made elaborate fun of me in this very room i did not clemens its a lie howells you did i detailed to him the conversation of that time with the stately argument furnished by boyesen in the fact that a patient had actually been killed by a mindcurist and howellss own smart remark that when the mindcurist is done with you you have to call in a regular at last because the former cant procure you a burial permit at last he gave in he said he remembered that talk but had now been a mindcurist so long it was difficult for him to realize that he had ever been anything else mrs h came skipping in presently the very person to a dot that she used to be so many years ago mrs h said people may call it what they like but it is just hypnotism and thats all it is hypnotism pure and simple mindcure the idea why this woman that cured me hasnt got any mind shes a good creature but shes dull and dumb and illiterate and now eleanor i know what im talking about dont i go there twice a week and mr clemens if you could only see her wooden and satisfied face when she snubs me for forgetting myself and showing by a thoughtless remark that to me weather is still weather instead of being just an abstraction and a superstition oh its the funniest thing you ever saw andwhen she tilts up her nosewell its its well its that kind of a nose that now eleanor the woman is not responsible for her nose and soon and soon it didnt seem to me that i had any right to be having this feast and you not there she convinced me before she got through that she and william james are right hypnotism and mindcure are the same thing no difference between them very well the very source the very center of hypnotism is paris dr charcots pupils and disciples are right there and ready to your hand without fetching poor dear old susy across the stormy sea let mrs mackay to whom i send my best respects tell you whom to go to to learn all you need to learn and how to proceed do do it honey dont lose a minute at oclock last night mr rogers said i am able to feel physical fatigue and i feel it now you never show any either in your eyes or your movements do you ever feel any i was able to say that i had forgotten what that feeling was like dont you remember how almost impossible it was for me to tire myself at the villa well it is just so in new york i go to bed unfatigued at i get up fresh and fine six hours later i believe i have taken only one daylight nap since i have been here when the anchor is down then i shall say farewell a long farewell to business i will never touch it again i will live in literature i will wallow in it revel in it i will swim in ink joan of arc but all this is premature the anchor is not down yet tomorrow tuesday i will add a p s if ive any to add but whether or no i must mail this to morrow for the mail steamer goes next day p m great scott this is tuesday i must rush this letter into the mail instantly tell that sassy ben ive got her welcome letter and ill write her as soon as i get a daylight chance ive most time at night but id druther write daytimes saml the reid and simmons mentioned in the foregoing were robert reid and edward simmons distinguished painter the latter a brilliant fluent and industrious talker the title fireescape simmons which clemens gives him originated when oliver herford whose quaint wit has so long delighted newyorkers one day pinned up by the back door of the players the notice exit in case of simmons gwen a popular novel of that day was written by blanche willis howard jamie dodge in the next letter was the son of mrs mary mapes dodge editor of st nicholas to clara clemens in paris mr rogerss office feb dear benny i was intending to answer your letter today but i am away down town and will simply whirl together a sentence or two for goodfellowship i have bought photographs of coquelin and jane hading and will ask them to sign them i shall meet coquelin tomorrow night and if hading is not present i will send her picture to her by somebody i am to breakfast with madame nordica in a few days and meantime i hope to get a good picture of her to sign she was of the breakfast company yesterday but the picture of herself which she signed and gave me does not do her majestic beauty justice i am too busy to attend to the photocollecting right because i have to live up to the name which jamie dodge has given me the belle of new york and it just keeps me rushing yesterday i had engagements to breakfast at noon dine at and dine again at i got away from the long breakfast at p m went and excused myself from the oclock dinner then lunched with mrs dodge in th street returned to the players and dressed dined out at and was back at mrs dodges at p m where we had magiclantern views of a superb sort and a lot of yarns until an hour after midnight and got to bed at this morning a good deal of a gain on my recent hours but i dont get tired i sleep as sound as a dead person and always wake up fresh and strong usually at exactly i was at breakfast lately where people of seven separate nationalities sat and the seven languages were going all the time at my side sat a charming gentleman who was a delightful and active talker and interesting he talked glibly to those folks in all those seven languages and still had a language to spare i wanted to kill him for very envy i greet you with love and kisses papa to mrs clemens in paris feb livy dear last night i played billiards with mr rogers until then went to robert reids studio and had a most delightful time until this morning no ladies were invited this time among the people present were coquelin richard harding davis harrison the great outdoor painter wm h chase the artist bettini inventor of the new phonograph nikola tesla the worldwide illustrious electrician see article about him in jan or feb century john drew actor james barnes a marvelous mimic my you should see him smedley the artist zorn the artist zogbaum the artist reinhart the artist metcalf the artist ancona head tenor at the opera oh a great lot of others everybody there had done something and was in his way famous somebody welcomed coquelin in a nice little french speech john drew did the like for me in english and then the fun began coquelin did some excellent french monologues one of them an ungrammatical englishman telling a colorless historiette in french it nearly killed the fifteen or twenty people who understood it i told a yarn ancona sang half a dozen songs barnes did his darling imitations harding davis sang the hanging of danny deever which was of course good but he followed it with that most fascinating for what reason i dont know of all kiplings poems on the road to mandalay sang it tenderly and it searched me deeper and charmed me more than the deever young gerrit smith played some ravishing dance music and we all danced about an hour there couldnt be a pleasanter night than that one was some of those people complained of fatigue but i dont seem to know what the sense of fatigue is coquelin talks quite good english now he said i have a brother who has the fine mind ah a charming and delicate fancy and he knows your writings so well and loves them and that is the same with me it will stir him so when i write and tell him i have seen you wasnt that nice we talked a good deal together he is as winning as his own face but he wouldnt sign that photograph for clara that no she shall have a better one i will send it to you he is much driven and will forget it but reid has promised to get the picture for me and i will try and keep him reminded oh dear my time is all used up and your letters are not answered mama dear i dont go everywhere i decline most things but there are plenty that i cant well get out of i will remember what you say and not make my yarning too common i am so glad susy has gone on that trip and that you are trying the electric may you both prosper for you are mighty dear to me and in my thoughts always saml the affairs of the webster publishing company were by this time getting into a very serious condition indeed the effects of the panic of the year before could not be overcome creditors were pressing their claims and profits were negligible in the following letter we get a mark twain estimate of the great financier who so cheerfully was willing to undertake the solving of mark twains financial problems to mrs clemens in paris the players feb p m livy darling yesterday i talked all my various matters over with mr rogers and we decided that it would be safe for me to leave here the th of march in the new york so his private secretary miss harrison wrote and ordered a berth for me and then i lost no time in cabling you that i should reach southampton march and paris the th land but it made my pulses leap to think i was going to see you again one thing at a time i never fully laid websters disastrous condition before mr rogers until tonight after billiards i did hate to burden his good heart and overworked head with it but he took hold with avidity and said it was no burden to work for his friends but a pleasure we discussed it from various standpoints and found it a sufficiently difficult problem to solve but he thinks that after he has slept upon it and thought it over he will know what to suggest you must not think i am ever rude with mr rogers i am not he is not common clay but fine fine and delicate and that sort do not call out the coarsenesses that are in my sort i am never afraid of wounding him i do not need to watch myself in that matter the sight of him is peace he wants to go to japan it is his dream wants to go with me which means the two families and hear no more about business for awhile and have a rest and he needs it but it is like all the dreams of all busy men fated to remain dreams you perceive that he is a pleasant text for me it is easy to write about him when i arrived in september lord how black the prospect was how desperate how incurably desperate webster and co had to have a small sum of money or go under at once i flew to hartford to my friends but they were not moved not strongly interested and i was ashamed that i went it was from mr rogers a stranger that i got the money and was by it saved and then while still a stranger he set himself the task of saving my financial life without putting upon me in his native delicacy any sense that i was the recipient of a charity a benevolence and he has accomplished that task accomplished it at a cost of three months of wearing and difficult labor he gave that time to me time which could not be bought by any man at a hundred thousand dollars a month no nor for three times the money well in the midst of that great fight that long and admirable fight george warner came to me and said there is a splendid chance open to you i know a man a prominent man who has written a book that will go like wildfire a book that arraigns the standard oil fiends and gives them unmitigated hell individual by individual it is the very book for you to publish there is a fortune in it and i can put you in communication with the author i wanted to say the only man i care for in the world the only man i would give a damn for the only man who is lavishing his sweat and blood to save me and mine from starvation and shame is a standard oil fiend if you know me you know whether i want the book or not but i didnt say that i said i didnt want any book i wanted to get out of the publishing business and out of all business and was here for that purpose and would accomplish it if i could but theres enough i shall be asleep by and i dont need much sleep because i am never drowsy or tired these days dear dear susy my strength reproaches me when i think of her and you my darling saml but even so able a man as henry rogers could not accomplish the impossible the affairs of the webster company were hopeless the business was not worth saving by mr rogerss advice an assignment was made april after its early spectacular success less than ten years had brought the business to failure the publication of the grant memoirs had been its only great achievement clemens would seem to have believed that the business would resume and for a time rogers appears to have comforted him in his hope but we cannot believe that it long survived young hall who had made such a struggle for its salvation was eager to go on but he must presently have seen the futility of any effort in that direction of course the failure of mark twains firm made a great stir in the country and it is easy to understand that loyal friends would rally in his behalf to mrs clemens in paris april dear old darling we all think the creditors are going to allow us to resume business and if they do we shall pull through and pay the debts i am prodigiously glad we made an assignment and also glad that we did not make it sooner earlier we should have made a poor showing but now we shall make a good one i meet flocks of people and they all shake me cordially by the hand and say i was so sorry to hear of the assignment but so glad you did it it was around this long time that the concern was tottering and all your friends were afraid you would delay the assignment too long john mackay called yesterday and said dont let it disturb you sam we all have to do it at one time or another its nothing to be ashamed of one stranger out in new york state sent me a dollar bill and thought he would like to get up a dollarsubscription for me and poultney bigelows note came promptly with his check for i had been meeting him every day at the club and liking him better and better all the time i couldnt take his money of course but i thanked him cordially for his good will now and then a good and dear joe twichell or susy warner condoles with me and says cheer up dont be downhearted and some other friend says i am glad and surprised to see how cheerful you are and how bravely you stand it and none of them suspect what a burden has been lifted from me and how blithe i am inside except when i think of you dear heart then i am not blithe for i seem to see you grieving and ashamed and dreading to look people in the face for in the thick of the fight there is cheer but you are far away and cannot hear the drums nor see the wheeling squadrons you only seem to see rout retreat and dishonored colors dragging in the dirt whereas none of these things exist there is temporary defeat but no dishonor and we will march again charley warner said today sho livy isnt worrying so long as shes got you and the children she doesnt care what happens she knows it isnt her affair which didnt convince me good bye my darling i love you and all of the kids and you can tell clara i am not a spitting gray kitten saml clemens sailed for europe as soon as his affairs would permit him to go he must get settled where he could work comfortably typesetter prospects seemed promising but meantime there was need of funds he began writing on the ship as was his habit and had completed his article on fenimore cooper by the time he reached london in august we find him writing to mr rogers from etretat a little norman wateringplace to h h rogers in new york etretat normandie chalet des abris aug dear mr rogers i find the madam ever so much better in health and strength the air is superb and soothing and wholesome and the chalet is remote from noise and people and just the place to write in i shall begin work this afternoon mrs clemens is in great spirits on account of the benefit which she has received from the electrical treatment in paris and is bound to take it up again and continue it all the winter and of course i am perfectly willing she requires me to drop the lecture platform out of my mind and go straight ahead with joan until the book is finished if i should have to go home for even a week she means to go with me wont consent to be separated again but she hopes i wont need to go i tell her all right i wont go unless you send and then i must she keeps the accounts and as she ciphers it we cant get crowded for money for eight months yet i didnt know that but i dont know much anyway sincerely yours s l clemens the reader may remember that clemens had written the first half of his joan of arc book at the villa viviani in florence nearly two years before he had closed the manuscript then with the taking of orleans and was by no means sure that he would continue the story beyond that point now however he was determined to reach the tales tragic conclusion to h h rogers in new york etretat sunday sept dear mr rogers i drove the quill too hard and i broke down in my head it has now been three days since i laid up when i wrote you a week ago i had added words or thereabout to joan next day i added which was a proper enough days work though not a full one but during tuesday and wednesday i stacked up an aggregate of words and that was a very large mistake my head hasnt been worth a cent since however theres a compensation for in those two days i reached and passed successfully a point which i was solicitous about before i ever began the book viz the battle of patay because that would naturally be the next to the last chapter of a work consisting of either two books or one in the one case one goes right along from that point as i shall do now in the other he would add a windup chapter and make the book consist of joans childhood and military career alone i shall resume work today and hereafter i will not go at such an intemperate rate my head is pretty cobwebby yet i am hoping that along about this time i shall hear that the machine is beginning its test in the herald office i shall be very glad indeed to know the result of it i wish i could be there sincerely yours s l clemens rouen where joan met her martyrdom was only a short distance away and they halted there en route to paris where they had arranged to spend the winter the health of susy clemens was not good and they lingered in rouen while clemens explored the old city and incidentally did some writing of another sort in a note to mr rogers he said to put in my odd time i am writing some articles about paul bourget and his outremer chapters laughing at them and at some of our oracular owls who find them important what the hell makes them important i should like to know he was still at rouen two weeks later and had received encouraging news from rogers concerning the typesetter which had been placed for trial in the office of the chicago herald clemens wrote i can hardly keep from sending a hurrah by cable i would certainly do it if i wasnt superstitious his restraint though wise was wasted the end was near to h h rogers in new york rue de luniversite paris dec dear mr rogers i seemed to be entirely expecting your letter and also prepared and resigned but lord it shows how little we know ourselves and how easily we can deceive ourselves it hit me like a thunderclap it knocked every rag of sense out of my head and i went flying here and there and yonder not knowing what i was doing and only one clearly defined thought standing up visible and substantial out of the crazy stormdrift that my dream of ten years was in desperate peril and out of the or projects for its rescue that came floating through my skull not one would hold still long enough for me to examine it and size it up have you ever been like that not so much so i reckon there was another clearly defined idea i must be there and see it die that is if it must die and maybe if i were there we might hatch up some nexttoimpossible way to make it take up its bed and take a walk so at the end of four hours i started still whirling and walked over to the rue scribe p m and asked a question or two and was told i should be running a big risk if i took the p m train for london and southampton better come right along at per havre special and step aboard the new york all easy and comfortable very and i about two miles from home with no packing done then it occurred to me that none of these salvationnotions that were whirlwinding through my head could be examined or made available unless at least a months time could be secured so i cabled you and said to myself that i would take the french steamer tomorrow which will be sunday by bedtime mrs clemens had reasoned me into a fairly rational and contented state of mind but of course it didnt last long so i went on thinking mixing it with a smoke in the dressing room once an hour until dawn this morning result a sane resolution no matter what your answer to my cable might be i would hold still and not sail until i should get an answer to this present letter which i am now writing or a cable answer from you saying come or remain i have slept hours my pond has clarified and i find the sediment of my projects to be of this character several pages of suggestions for reconstructing the machine follow dont say im wild for really im sane again this morning i am going right along with joan now and wait untroubled till i hear from you if you think i can be of the least use cable me come i can write joan on board ship and lose no time also i could discuss my plan with the publisher for a deluxe joan time being an object for some of the pictures could be made over here cheaply and quickly but would cost much time and money in america if the meeting should decide to quit business jan id like to have stoker stopped from paying in any more money if miss harrison doesnt mind that disagreeable job and ill have to write them too of course with love s l clemens the stoker of this letter was bram stoker long associated with sir henry irving irving himself had also taken stock in the machine the address rue de luniversite whence these letters are written was the beautiful studio home of the artist pomroy which they had taken for the winter to h h rogers in new york rue de luniversite paris dec dear mr rogers notwithstanding your heart is old and hard you make a body choke up i know you mean every word you say and i do take it in the same spirit in which you tender it i shall keep your regard while we two live that i know for i shall always remember what you have done for me and that will insure me against ever doing anything that could forfeit it or impair it i am years old yet i never had a friend before who put out a hand and tried to pull me ashore when he found me in deep waters it is six days or seven days ago that i lived through that despairing day and then through a night without sleep then settled down next day into my right mind or thereabouts and wrote you i put in the rest of that day till p m plenty comfortably enough writing a long chapter of my book then went to a masked ball blacked up as uncle remus taking clara along and we had a good time i have lost no day since and suffered no discomfort to speak of but drove my troubles out of my mind and had good success in keeping them out through watchfulness i have done a good weeks work and put the book a good way ahead in the great trial which is the difficult part which requires the most thought and carefulness i cannot see the end of the trial yet but i am on the road i am creeping surely toward it why not leave them all to me my business bothers i take you by the hand i jump at the chance i ought to be ashamed and i am trying my best to be ashamed and yet i do jump at the chance in spite of it i dont want to write irving and i dont want to write stoker it doesnt seem as if i could but i can suggest something for you to write them and then if you see that i am unwise you can write them something quite different now this is my idea to return stokers to him and keep his stock and tell irving that when luck turns with me i will make good to him what the salvage from the dead co fails to pay him of his p s madam says no i must face the music so i enclose my effort to be used if you approve but not otherwise there now if you will alter it to suit your judgment and bang away i shall be eternally obliged we shall try to find a tenant for our hartford house not an easy matter for it costs heavily to live in we can never live in it again though it would break the familys hearts if they could believe it nothing daunts mrs clemens or makes the world look black to her which is the reason i havent drowned myself we all send our deepest and warmest greetings to you and all of yours and a happy new year s l clemens enclosure my dear stoker i am not dating this because it is not to be mailed at present when it reaches you it will mean that there is a hitch in my machineenterprise a hitch so serious as to make it take to itself the aspect of a dissolved dream this letter then will contain cheque for the which you have paid and will you tell irving for me i cant get up courage enough to talk about this misfortune myself except to you whom by good luck i havent damaged yet that when the wreckage presently floats ashore he will get a good deal of his back and a dab at a time i will make up to him the rest im not feeling as fine as i was when i saw you there in your home please remember me kindly to mrs stoker i gave up that london lectureproject entirely had to theres never been a chance since to find the time sincerely yours s l clemens xxxv letters to h h rogers and others finishing joan of arc the trip around the world death of susy clemens to h h rogers in new york city no date dear mr rogers yours of dec has arrived containing the circular to stockholders and i guess the co will really quit there doesnt seem to be any other wise course theres one thing which makes it difficult for me to soberly realize that my ten year dream is actually dissolved and that is that it reveries my horoscope the proverb says born lucky always lucky and i am very superstitious as a small boy i was notoriously lucky it was usual for one or two of our lads per annum to get drowned in the mississippi or in bear creek but i was pulled out in a drowned condition times before i learned to swim and was considered to be a cat in disguise when the pennsylvania blew up and the telegraph reported my brother as fatally injured with others but made no mention of me my uncle said to my mother it means that sam was somewhere else after being on that boat a year and a half he was born lucky yes i was somewhere else i am so superstitious that i have always been afraid to have business dealings with certain relatives and friends of mine because they were unlucky people all my life i have stumbled upon lucky chances of large size and whenever they were wasted it was because of my own stupidity and carelessness and so i have felt entirely certain that that machine would turn up trumps eventually it disappointed me lots of times but i couldnt shake off the confidence of a lifetime in my luck well whatever i get out of the wreckage will be due to good luck the good luck of getting you into the scheme for but for that there wouldnt be any wreckage it would be total loss i wish you had been in at the beginning then we should have had the good luck to step promptly ashore miss harrison has had a dream which promises me a large bank account and i want her to go ahead and dream it twice more so as to make the prediction sure to be fulfilled ive got a first rate subject for a book it kept me awake all night and i began it and completed it in my mind the minute i finish joan i will take it up love and happy new year to you all sincerely yours s l clemens this was about the end of the machine interests so far as clemens was concerned paige succeeded in getting some new people interested but nothing important happened or that in any way affected mark twain characteristically he put the whole matter behind him and plunged into his work facing comparative poverty and a burden of debts with a stout heart the beginning of the new year found him really poorer in purse than he had ever been in his life but certainly not crushed or even discouraged at least not permanently and never more industrious or capable to h h rogers in new york city rue de luniversite paris jan dear mr rogers after i wrote you two or three days ago i thought i would make a holiday of the rest of the day the second deliberate holiday since i had the gout on the first holiday i wrote a tale of about words which was days work in one and this time i did before midnight i got nothing out of that first holiday but the recreation of it for i condemned the work after careful reading and some revision but this time i fared better i finished the huck finn tale that lies in your safe and am satisfied with it the bacheller syndicate tribune building want a story of words lowest limit of their london agent for and offer to plank the check on delivery and it was partly to meet that demand that i took that other holiday so as i have no short story that suits me and cant and shant make promises the best i can do is to offer the longer one which i finished on my second holiday tom sawyer detective it makes or words and is really written for grown folks though i expect young folk to read it too it transfers to the banks of the mississippi the incidents of a strange murder which was committed in sweden in old times ill refer applicants for a sight of the story to you or miss harrison secretary to mr rogers yours sincerely s l clemens to h h rogers in new york city rue de luniversite apr dear mr rogers your felicitous delightful letter of the th arrived three days ago and brought great pleasure into the house there is one thing that weighs heavily on mrs clemens and me that is brusnahans money if he is satisfied to have it invested in the chicago enterprise well and good if not we would like to have the money paid back to him i will give him as many months to decide in as he pleases let him name or or and we will let the money stay where it is in your hands till the time is up will miss harrison tell him so i mean if you approve i would like him to have a good investment but would meantime prefer to protect him against loss at minutes past yesterday evening joan of arc was burned at the stake with the long strain gone i am in a sort of physical collapse today but it will be gone tomorrow i judged that this end of the book would be hard work and it turned out so i have never done any work before that cost so much thinking and weighing and measuring and planning and cramming or so much cautious and painstaking execution for i wanted the whole rouen trial in if it could be got in in such a way that the readers interest would not flag in fact i wanted the readers interest to increase and so i stuck to it with that determination in view with the result that i have left nothing out but unimportant repetitions although it is mere history history pure and simple history stripped naked of flowers embroideries colorings exaggerations invention the family agree that i have succeeded it was a perilous thing to try in a tale but i never believed it a doubtful one provided i stuck strictly to business and didnt weaken and give up or didnt get lazy and skimp the work the first twothirds of the book were easy for i only needed to keep my historical road straight therefore i used for reference only one french history and one english one and shoveled in as much fancy work and invention on both sides of the historical road as i pleased but on this last third i have constantly used five french sources and five english ones and i think no telling historical nugget in any of them has escaped me possibly the book may not sell but that is nothing it was written for love there im called to see company the family seldom require this of me but they know i am not working today yours sincerely s l clemens brusnahan of the foregoing letter was an employee of the new york herald superintendent of the pressroom who had invested some of his savings in the typesetter in february clemens returned to new york to look after matters connected with his failure and to close arrangements for a readingtour around the world he was nearly sixty years old and time had not lessened his loathing for the platform more than once however in earlier years he had turned to it as a debtpayer and never yet had his burden been so great as now he concluded arrangements with major pond to take him as far as the pacific coast and with r s smythe of australia for the rest of the tour in april we find him once more back in paris preparing to bring the family to america he had returned by way of london where he had visited stanley the explorer an old friend to h h rogers in new york city rue de luniversite sunday apr dear mr rogers stanley is magnificently housed in london in a grand mansion in the midst of the official world right off downing street and whitehall he had an extraordinary assemblage of brains and fame there to meet me thirty or forty both sexes at dinner and more than a hundred came in after dinner kept it up till after midnight there were cabinet ministers ambassadors admirals generals canons oxford professors novelists playwrights poets and a number of people equipped with rank and brains i told some yarns and made some speeches i promised to call on all those people next time i come to london and show them the wife and the daughters if i were younger and very strong i would dearly love to spend a season in london provided i had no work on hand or no work more exacting than lecturing i think i will lecture there a month or two when i return from australia there were many delightful ladies in that company one was the wife of his excellency admiral bridge commanderin chief of the australian station and she said her husband was able to throw wide all doors to me in that part of the world and would be glad to do it and would yacht me and my party around and excursion us in his flagship and make us have a great time and she said she would write him we were coming and we would find him ready i have a letter from her this morning enclosing a letter of introduction to the admiral i already know the admiral commanding in the china seas and have promised to look in on him out there he sleeps with my books under his pillow praps it is the only way he can sleep according to mrs clemenss present plans subject to modification of course we sail in may stay one day or two days in new york spend june july and august in elmira and prepare my lectures then lecture in san francisco and thereabouts during september and sail for australia before the middle of october and open the show there about the middle of november we dont take the girls along it would be too expensive and they are quite willing to remain behind anyway mrs c is feeling so well that she is not going to try the new york doctor till we have gone around the world and robbed it and made the finances a little easier with a power of love to you all s l clemens there would come moments of depression of course and a week later he wrote i am tired to death all the time to a man of less vitality less vigor of mind and body it is easy to believe that under such circumstances this condition would have remained permanent but perhaps after all it was his comic outlook on things in general that was his chief lifesaver to h h rogers in new york city rue de luniversite apr dear mr rogers i have been hidden an hour or two reading proof of joan and now i think i am a lost child i cant find anybody on the place the baggage has all disappeared including the family i reckon that in the hurry and bustle of moving to the hotel they forgot me but it is no matter it is peacefuller now than i have known it for days and days and days in these joan proofs which i have been reading for the september harper i find a couple of tiptop platform readings and i mean to read them on our trip if the authorship is known by then and if it isnt i will reveal it the fact is there is more good platformstuff in joan than in any previous book of mine by a long sight yes every danged member of the tribe has gone to the hotel and left me lost i wonder how they can be so careless with property i have got to try to get there by myself now all the trunks are going over as luggage then ive got to find somebody on the dock who will agree to ship of them to the hartford customhouse if it is difficult i will dump them into the river it is very careless of mrs clemens to trust trunks and things to me sincerely yours s l clemens by the latter part of may they were at quarry farm and clemens laid up there with a carbuncle was preparing for his long tour the outlook was not a pleasant one to mr rogers he wrote i shant be able to stand on the platform before we start west i shant get a single chance to practice my reading but will have to appear in cleveland without the essential preparation nothing in this world can save it from being a shabby poor disgusting performance ive got to stand i cant do it and talk to a house and how in the nation am i going to sit land of goshen its this night week pray for me the opening at cleveland july th appears not to have been much of a success though from another reason one that doubtless seemed amusing to him later to h h rogers in new york city forenoon cleveland july dear mr rogers had a roaring success at the elmira reformatory sunday night but here last night i suffered defeat there were a couple of hundred little boys behind me on the stage on a lofty tier of benches which made them the most conspicuous objects in the house and there was nobody to watch them or keep them quiet why with their scufflings and horseplay and noise it was just a menagerie besides a concert of amateurs had been smuggled into the program to precede me and their families and friends say ten per cent of the audience kept encoring them and they always responded so it was minutes to before i got the platform in front of those people who had paid a dollar apiece for a chance to go to hell in this fashion i got started magnificently but inside of half an hour the scuffling boys had the audiences maddened attention and i saw it was a gone case so i skipped a third of my program and quit the newspapers are kind but between you and me it was a defeat there aint going to be any more concerts at my lectures i care nothing for this defeat because it was not my fault my first half hour showed that i had the house and i could have kept it if i hadnt been so handicapped yours sincerely s l clemens p s had a satisfactory time at petoskey crammed the house and turned away a crowd we had in the house which was more than it had ever had in it before i believe i dont care to have a talk go off better than that one did mark twain on this long tour was accompanied by his wife and his daughter clara susy and jean clemens remaining with their aunt at quarry farm the tour was a financial success from the start by the time they were ready to sail from vancouver five thousand dollars had been remitted to mr rogers against that day of settlement when the debts of webster co were to be paid perhaps it should be stated here that a legal settlement had been arranged on a basis of fifty cents on the dollar but neither clemens nor his wife consented to this as final they would pay in full they sailed from vancouver august about the only letter of this time is an amusing note to rudyard kipling written at the moment of departure to rudyard kipling in england august dear kipling it is reported that you are about to visit india this has moved me to journey to that far country in order that i may unload from my conscience a debt long due to you years ago you came from india to elmira to visit me as you said at the time it has always been my purpose to return that visit and that great compliment some day i shall arrive next january and you must be ready i shall come riding my ayah with his tusks adorned with silver bells and ribbons and escorted by a troop of native howdahs richly clad and mounted upon a herd of wild bungalows and you must be on hand with a few bottles of ghee for i shall be thirsty affectionately s l clemens clemens platforming in australia was too busy to write letters everywhere he was welcomed by great audiences and everywhere lavishly entertained he was beset by other carbuncles but would seem not to have been seriously delayed by them a letter to his old friend twichell carries the story to rev jos h twichell in hartford frank moellers masonic hotel napier new zealand november dear joe your welcome letter of two months and five days ago has just arrived and finds me in bed with another carbuncle it is no not a serious one this time i lectured last night without inconvenience but the doctors thought best to forbid tonights lecture my second one kept me in bed a week in melbourne we are all glad it is you who is to write the article it delights us all through i think it was a good stroke of luck that knocked me on my back here at napier instead of some hotel in the centre of a noisy city here we have the smooth and placidlycomplaining sea at our door with nothing between us and it but yards of shingle and hardly a suggestion of life in that space to mar it or make a noise away down here fiftyfive degrees south of the equator this sea seems to murmur in an unfamiliar tongue a foreign tongue tongue bred among the icefields of the antarctic a murmur with a note of melancholy in it proper to the vast unvisited solitudes it has come from it was very delicious and solacing to wake in the night and find it still pulsing there i wish you were here land but it would be fine livy and clara enjoy this nomadic life pretty well certainly better than one could have expected they would they have tough experiences in the way of food and beds and frantic little ships but they put up with the worst that befalls with heroic endurance that resembles contentment no doubt i shall be on the platform next monday a week later we shall reach wellington talk there nights then sail back to australia we sailed for new zealand october day before yesterday was livys birthday under world time and tomorrow will be mine i shall be no thanks for it i and the others send worlds and worlds of love to all you dear ones mark the article mentioned in the foregoing letter was one which twichell had been engaged by harpers magazine to write concerning the home life and characteristics of mark twain by the time the clemens party had completed their tour of india a splendid triumphant tour too full of work and recreation for letterwriting and had reached south africa the article had appeared a satisfactory one if we may judge by mark twains next this letter however has a special interest in the account it gives of mark twains visit to the jameson raiders then imprisoned at pretoria to rev jos h twichell in hartford pretoria south african republic the queens birthday may dear old joe harper for may was given to me yesterday in johannesburg by an american lady who lives there and i read your article on me while coming up in the train with her and an old friend and fellowmissourian of mine mrs john hays hammond the handsome and spirited wife of the chief of the reformers who lies in prison here under a year sentence along with minor reformers who are in for and year terms thank you a thousand times joe you have praised me away above my deserts but i am not the man to quarrel with you for that and as for livy she will take your very hardiest statements at par and be grateful to you to the bottom of her heart between you and punch and brander matthews i am like to have my opinion of myself raised sufficiently high and i guess the children will be after you for it is the study of their lives to keep my selfappreciation down somewhere within bounds i had a note from mrs rev gray nee tyler yesterday and called on her today she is well yesterday i was allowed to enter the prison with mrs hammond a boer guard was at my elbow all the time but was courteous and polite only he barred the way in the compound quadrangle or big open court and wouldnt let me cross a white mark that was on the ground the deathline one of the prisoners called it not in earnest though i think i found that i had met hammond once when he was a yale senior and a guest of gen franklins i also found that i had known capt mein intimately years ago one of the english prisoners had heard me lecture in london years ago after being introduced in turn to all the prisoners i was allowed to see some of the cells and examine their food beds etc i was told in johannesburg that hammonds salary of a year is not stopped and that the salaries of some of the others are still continued hammond was looking very well indeed and i can say the same of all the others when the trouble first fell upon them it hit some of them very hard several fell sick hammond among them two or three had to be removed to the hospital and one of the favorites lost his mind and killed himself poor fellow last week his funeral with a sorrowing following of took the place of the public demonstration the americans were getting up for me these prisoners are strong men prominent men and i believe they are all educated men they are well off some of them are wealthy they have a lot of books to read they play games and smoke and for awhile they will be able to bear up in their captivity but not for long not for very long i take it i am told they have times of deadly brooding and depression i made them a speech sitting down it just happened so i dont prefer that attitude still it has one advantage it is only a talk it doesnt take the form of a speech i have tried it once before on this trip however if a body wants to make sure of having liberty and feeling at home he had better stand up of course i advised them at considerable length to stay where they were they would get used to it and like it presently if they got out they would only get in again somewhere else by the look of their countenances and i promised to go and see the president and do what i could to get him to double their jailterms we had a very good sociable time till the permitted time was up and a little over and we outsiders had to go i went again today but the rev mr gray had just arrived and the warden a genial elderly boer named du plessis explained that his orders wouldnt allow him to admit saint and sinner at the same time particularly on a sunday du plessis descended from the huguenot fugitives you see of years ago but he hasnt any french left in him now all dutch it gravels me to think what a goose i was to make livy and clara remain in durban but i wanted to save them the hour railway trip to johannesburg and durban and its climate and opulent foliage were so lovely and the friends there were so choice and so hearty that i sacrificed myself in their interests as i thought it is just the beginning of winter and although the days are hot the nights are cool but its lovely weather in these regions too and the friends are as lovely as the weather and johannesburg and pretoria are brimming with interest i talk here twice more then return to johannesburg next wednesday for a fifth talk there then to the orange free state capital then to some town on the way to port elizabeth where the two will join us by sea from durban then the gang will go to kimberley and presently to the cape and so in the course of time we shall get through and sail for england and then we will hunt up a quiet village and i will write and livy edit for a few months while clara and susy and jean study music and things in london we have had noble good times everywhere and every day from cleveland july to pretoria may and never a dull day either on sea or land notwithstanding the carbuncles and things even when i was laid up days at jeypore in india we had the charmingest times with english friends all over india the english well you will never know how good and fine they are till you see them midnight and after and i must do many things today and lecture tonight a world of thanks to you joe dear and a world of love to all of you mark perhaps for readers of a later day a word as to what constituted the jameson raid would not be out of place here dr leander starr jameson was an english physician located at kimberley president kruger oom paul head of the south african republic was one of his patients also lobengula the matabele chief from lobengula concessions were obtained which led to the formation of the south african company jameson gave up his profession and went in for conquest associating himself with the projects of cecil rhodes in time he became administrator of rhodesia by the end of he was in high feather and during a visit to england was feted as a sort of romantic conqueror of the olden time perhaps this turned his head at all events at the end of came the startling news that dr jim as he was called at the head of six hundred men had ridden into the transvaal in support of a rhodes scheme for an uprising at johannesburg the raid was a failure jameson and those other knights of adventure were captured by the forces of oom paul and some of them barely escaped execution the boer president handed them over to the english government for punishment and they received varying sentences but all were eventually released jameson later became again prominent in southafrican politics but there is no record of any further raids the clemens party sailed from south africa the middle of july and on the last day of the month reached england they had not planned to return to america but to spend the winter in or near london in some quiet place where clemens could write the book of his travels the two daughters in america susy and jean were expected to arrive august th but on that day there came instead a letter saying that susy clemens was not well enough to sail a cable inquiry was immediately sent but the reply when it came was not satisfactory and mrs clemens and clara sailed for america without further delay this was on august th three days later in the old home at hartford susy clemens died of cerebral fever she had been visiting mrs charles dudley warner but by the physicians advice had been removed to the comfort and quiet of her own home only a few steps away mark twain returning from his triumphant tour of the world in the hope that soon now he might be free from debt with his family happily gathered about him had to face alone this cruel blow there was no purpose in his going to america susy would be buried long before his arrival he awaited in england the return of his broken family they lived that winter in a quiet corner of chelsea no tedworth square to rev joseph h twichell in hartford conn permanent address chatto windus t martins lane london sept through livy and katy i have learned dear old joe how loyally you stood poor susys friend and mine and livys how you came all the way down twice from your summer refuge on your merciful errands to bring the peace and comfort of your beloved presence first to that poor child and again to the broken heart of her poor desolate mother it was like you like your good great heart like your matchless and unmatchable self it was no surprise to me to learn that you stayed by susy long hours careless of fatigue and heat it was no surprise to me to learn that you could still the storms that swept her spirit when no other could for she loved you revered you trusted you and uncle joe was no empty phrase upon her lips i am grateful to you joe grateful to the bottom of my heart which has always been filled with love for you and respect and admiration and i would have chosen you out of all the world to take my place at susys side and livys in those black hours susy was a rare creature the rarest that has been reared in hartford in this generation and livy knew it and you knew it and charley warner and george and harmony and the hillyers and the dunhams and the cheneys and susy and lilly and the bunces and henry robinson and dick burton and perhaps others and i also was of the number but not in the same degree for she was above my duller comprehension i merely knew that she was my superior in fineness of mind in the delicacy and subtlety of her intellect but to fully measure her i was not competent i know her better now for i have read her private writings and sounded the deeps of her mind and i know better now the treasure that was mine than i knew it when i had it but i have this consolation that dull as i was i always knew enough to be proud when she commended me or my work as proud as if livy had done it herself and i took it as the accolade from the hand of genius i see now as livy always saw that she had greatness in her and that she herself was dimly conscious of it and now she is dead and i can never tell her god bless you joe and all of your house s l c to mr henry c robinson hartford conn london sept it is as you say dear old friend the pathos of it yes it was a piteous thing as piteous a tragedy as any the year can furnish when we started westward upon our long trip at half past ten at night july at elmira susy stood on the platform in the blaze of the electric light waving her goodbyes to us as the train glided away her mother throwing back kisses and watching her through her tears one year one month and one week later clara and her mother having exactly completed the circuit of the globe drew up at that platform at the same hour of the night in the same train and the same car and again susy had come a journey and was near at hand to meet them she was waiting in the house she was born in in her coffin all the circumstances of this death were pathetic my brain is worn to rags rehearsing them the mere death would have been cruelty enough without overloading it and emphasizing it with that score of harsh and wanton details the child was taken away when her mother was within three days of her and would have given three decades for sight of her in my despair and unassuageable misery i upbraid myself for ever parting with her but there is no use in that since it was to happen it would have happened with love s l c the life at tedworth square that winter was one of almost complete privacy of the hundreds of friends which mark twain had in london scarcely half a dozen knew his address he worked steadily on his book of travels following the equator and wrote few letters beyond business communications to mr rogers in one of these he said i am appalled here i am trying to load you up with work again after you have been drayhorsing over the same tiresome ground for a year its too bad and i am ashamed of it but late in november he sent a letter of a different sort one that was to have an important bearing on the life of a girl today of unique and worldwide distinction to mrs h h rogers in new york city for and in behalf of helen keller stone blind and deaf and formerly dumb dear mrs rogers experience has convinced me that when one wishes to set a hardworked man at something which he mightnt prefer to be bothered with it is best to move upon him behind his wife if she cant convince him it isnt worth while for other people to try mr rogers will remember our visit with that astonishing girl at lawrence huttons house when she was fourteen years old last july in boston when she was she underwent the harvard examination for admission to radcliffe college she passed without a single condition she was allowed the same amount of time that is granted to other applicants and this was shortened in her case by the fact that the question papers had to be read to her yet she scored an average of as against an average of on the part of the other applicants it wont do for america to allow this marvelous child to retire from her studies because of poverty if she can go on with them she will make a fame that will endure in history for centuries along her special lines she is the most extraordinary product of all the ages there is danger that she must retire from the struggle for a college degree for lack of support for herself and for miss sullivan the teacher who has been with her from the start mr rogers will remember her mrs hutton writes to ask me to interest rich englishmen in her case and i would gladly try but my secluded life will not permit it i see nobody nobody knows my address nothing but the strictest hiding can enable me to write my long book in time so i thought of this scheme beg you to lay siege to your husband and get him to interest himself and mess john d and william rockefeller and the other standard oil chiefs in helens case get them to subscribe an annual aggregate of six or seven hundred or a thousand dollars and agree to continue this for three or four years until she has completed her college course im not trying to limit their generosity indeed no they may pile that standard oil helen keller college fund as high as they please they have my consent mrs huttons idea is to raise a permanent fund the interest upon which shall support helen and her teacher and put them out of the fear of want i shant say a word against it but she will find it a difficult and disheartening job and meanwhile what is to become of that miraculous girl no for immediate and sound effectiveness the thing is for you to plead with mr rogers for this hampered wonder of your sex and send him clothed with plenary powers to plead with the other chiefs they have spent mountains of money upon the worthiest benevolences and i think that the same spirit which moved them to put their hands down through their hearts into their pockets in those cases will answer here when its name is called in this one there i dont need to apologize to you or to h h for this appeal that i am making i know you too well for that goodbye with love to all of you s l clemens laurence hutton is on the staff of harpers monthly close by and handy when wanted the plea was not made in vain mr and mrs rogers interested themselves most liberally in helen kellers fortune and certainly no one can say that any of those who contributed to her success ever had reason for disappointment in his letter of grateful acknowledgment which follows clemens also takes occasion to thank mr rogers for his further efforts in the matter of his own difficulties this particular reference concerns the publishing complications which by this time had arisen between the american publishing company of hartford and the house in franklin square london dec dear mrs rogers it is superb and i am beyond measure grateful to you both i knew you would be interested in that wonderful girl and that mr rogers was already interested in her and touched by her and i was sure that if nobody else helped her you two would but you have gone far and away beyond the sum i expected may your lines fall in pleasant places here and hereafter for it the huttons are as glad and grateful as they can be and i am glad for their sakes as well as for helens i want to thank mr rogers for crucifying himself again on the same old cross between bliss and harper and goodness knows i hope he will come to enjoy it above all other dissipations yet seeing that it has about it the elements of stability and permanency however at any time that he says sign were going to do it ever sincerely yours s l clemens xxxvi letters london switzerland vienna mark twain worked steadily on his book that sad winter and managed to keep the gloom out of his chapters though it is noticeable that following the equator is more serious than his other books of travel he wrote few letters and these only to his three closest friends howells twichell and rogers in the letter to twichell which follows there is mention of two unfinished manuscripts which he expects to resume one of these was a dream story enthusiastically begun but perhaps with insufficient plot to carry it through for it never reached conclusion he had already tried it in one or two forms and would begin it again presently the identity of the other tale is uncertain to rev j h twichell in hartford london jan dear joe do i want you to write to me indeed i do i do not want most people to write but i do want you to do it the others break my heart but you will not you have a something divine in you that is not in other men you have the touch that heals not lacerates and you know the secret places of our hearts you know our life the outside of it as the others do and the inside of it which they do not you have seen our whole voyage you have seen us go to sea a cloud of sail and the flag at the peak and you see us now chartless adrift derelicts battered waterlogged our sails a ruck of rags our pride gone for it is gone and there is nothing in its place the vanity of life was all we had and there is no more vanity left in us we are even ashamed of that we had ashamed that we trusted the promises of life and builded high to come to this i did know that susy was part of us i did not know that she could go away i did not know that she could go away and take our lives with her yet leave our dull bodies behind and i did not know what she was to me she was but treasure in the bank the amount known the need to look at it daily handle it weigh it count it realize it not necessary and now that i would do it it is too late they tell me it is not there has vanished away in a night the bank is broken my fortune is gone i am a pauper how am i to comprehend this how am i to have it why am i robbed and who is benefited ah well susy died at home she had that privilege her dying eyes rested upon nothing that was strange to them but only upon things which they had known and loved always and which had made her young years glad and she had you and sue and katy and john and ellen this was happy fortune i am thankful that it was vouchsafed to her if she had died in another housewell i think i could not have borne that to us our house was not unsentient matter it had a heart and a soul and eyes to see us with and approvals and solicitudes and deep sympathies it was of us and we were in its confidence and lived in its grace and in the peace of its benediction we never came home from an absence that its face did not light up and speak out its eloquent welcome and we could not enter it unmoved and could we now oh now in spirit we should enter it unshod i am trying to add to the assets which you estimate so generously no i am not the thought is not in my mind my purpose is other i am working but it is for the sake of the work the surcease of sorrow that is found there i work all the days and trouble vanishes away when i use that magic this book will not long stand between it and me now but that is no matter i have many unwritten books to fly to for my preservation the interval between the finishing of this one and the beginning of the next will not be more than an hour at most continuances i mean for two of them are already well along in fact have reached exactly the same stage in their journey words each the present one will contain words are done i am well protected but livy she has nothing in the world to turn to nothing but housekeeping and doing things for the children and me she does not see people and cannot books have lost their interest for her she sits solitary and all the day and all the days wonders how it all happened and why we others were always busy with our affairs but susy was her comrade had to be driven from her loving persecutions sometimes at in the morning to livy the persecutions were welcome it was heaven to her to be plagued like that but it is ended now livy stands so in need of help and none among us all could help her like you some day you and i will walk again joe and talk i hope so we could have such talks we are all grateful to you and harmony how grateful it is not given to us to say in words we pay as we can in love and in this coin practicing no economy good bye dear old joe mark the letters to mr rogers were for the most part on matters of business but in one of them he said i am going to write with all my might on this book and follow it up with others as fast as i can in the hope that within three years i can clear out the stuff that is in me waiting to be written and that i shall then die in the promptest kind of a way and no fooling around and in one he wrote you are the best friend ever a man had and the surest to w d howells in new york london feb dear howellsi find your generous article in the weekly and i want to thank you for its splendid praises so daringly uttered and so warmly the words stir the dead heart of me and throw a glow of color into a life which sometimes seems to have grown wholly wan i dont mean that i am miserable no worse than that indifferent indifferent to nearly everything but work i like that i enjoy it and stick to it i do it without purpose and without ambition merely for the love of it this mood will pass some day there is history for it but it cannot pass until my wife comes up out of the submergence she was always so quick to recover herself before but now there is no rebound and we are dead people who go through the motions of life indeed i am a mud image and it will puzzle me to know what it is in me that writes and has comedyfancies and finds pleasure in phrasing them it is a law of our nature of course or it wouldnt happen the thing in me forgets the presence of the mud image and goes its own way wholly unconscious of it and apparently of no kinship with it i have finished my book but i go on as if the end were indefinitely away as indeed it is there is no hurry at any rate there is no limit jeans spirits are good claras are rising they have youth the only thing that was worth giving to the race these are sardonic times look at greece and that whole shabby muddle but i am not sorry to be alive and privileged to look on if i were not a hermit i would go to the house every day and see those people scuffle over it and blether about the brotherhood of the human race this has been a bitter year for english pride and i dont like to see england humbled that is not too much we are sprung from her loins and it hurts me i am for republics and she is the only comrade weve got in that we cant count france and there is hardly enough of switzerland to count beneath the governing crust england is soundhearted and sincere too and nearly straight but i am appalled to notice that the wide extension of the surface has damaged her manners and made her rather americanly uncourteous on the lower levels wont you give our love to the howellses all and particular sincerely yours s l clemens the travelbook did not finish easily and more than once when he thought it completed he found it necessary to cut and add and change the final chapters were not sent to the printer until the middle of may and in a letter to mr rogers he commented a successful book is not made of what is in it but what is left out of it clemens was at the time contemplating a uniform edition of his books and in one of his letters to mr rogers on the matter he wrote whimsically now i was proposing to make a thousand sets at a hundred dollars a set and do the whole canvassing myself i would load up every important jail and saloon in america with de luxe editions of my books but mrs clemens and the children object to this i do not know why and in a moment of depression you see the lightning refuses to strike me there is where the defect is we have to do our own striking as barney barnato did but nobody ever gets the courage until he goes crazy they went to switzerland for the summer to the village of weggis on lake lucerne the charmingest place we ever lived in he declared for repose and restfulness and superb scenery it was here that he began work on a new story of tom and huck and at least upon one other manuscript from a brief note to mr rogers we learn something of his employments and economies to henry h rogers in new york lucerne august the something or other dear mr rogers i am writing a novel and am getting along very well with it i believe that this place weggis half an hour from lucerne is the loveliest in the world and the most satisfactory we have a small house on the hillside all to ourselves and our meals are served in it from the inn below on the lake shore six francs a day per head house and food included the scenery is beyond comparison beautiful we have a row boat and some bicycles and good roads and no visitors nobody knows we are here and sunday in heaven is noisy compared to this quietness sincerely yours s l c to rev j h twichell in hartford lucerne aug dear joe livy made a noble find on the lucerne boat the other day on one of her shopping trips george williamson smith did i tell you about it we had a lovely time with him and such intellectual refreshment as we had not tasted in many a month and the other night we had a detachment of the jubilee singers i had known one of them in london years ago three of the were born in slavery the others were children of slaves how charming they were in spirit manner language pronunciation enunciation grammar phrasing matter carriage clothes in every detail that goes to make the real lady and gentleman and welcome guest we went down to the village hotel and bought our tickets and entered the beerhall where a crowd of german and swiss men and women sat grouped at round tables with their beer mugs in front of them selfcontained and unimpressionable looking people an indifferent and unposted and disheartened audience and up at the far end of the room sat the jubilees in a row the singers got up and stood the talking and glass jingling went on then rose and swelled out above those common earthly sounds one of those rich chords the secret of whose make only the jubilees possess and a spell fell upon that house it was fine to see the faces light up with the pleased wonder and surprise of it no one was indifferent any more and when the singers finished the camp was theirs it was a triumph it reminded me of launcelot riding in sir kays armor and astonishing complacent knights who thought they had struck a soft thing the jubilees sang a lot of pieces arduous and painstaking cultivation has not diminished or artificialized their music but on the contrary to my surprise has mightily reinforced its eloquence and beauty away back in the beginning to my mind their music made all other vocal music cheap and that early notion is emphasized now it is utterly beautiful to me and it moves me infinitely more than any other music can i think that in the jubilees and their songs america has produced the perfectest flower of the ages and i wish it were a foreign product so that she would worship it and lavish money on it and go properly crazy over it now these countries are different they would do all that if it were native it is true they praise god but that is merely a formality and nothing in it they open out their whole hearts to no foreigner the musical critics of the german press praise the jubilees with great enthusiasm acquired technique etc included one of the jubilee men is a son of general joe johnson and was educated by him after the war the party came up to the house and we had a pleasant time this is paradise here but of course we have got to leave it by and by the th of august anniversary of susy clemenss death has come and gone joe and we still seem to live with love from us all mark clemens declared he would as soon spend his life in weggis as anywhere else in the geography but october found them in vienna for the winter at the hotel metropole the austrian capital was just then in a political turmoil the character of which is hinted in the following to rev j h twichell in hartford hotel metropole vienna oct dear joe we are gradually getting settled down and wonted vienna is not a cheap place to live in but i have made one small arrangement which has a distinctly economical aspect the vice consul made the contract for me yesterdaytowit a barber is to come every morning and shave me and keep my hair trimmed for a month i used to pay per shave in our house in hartford does it suggest to you reflections when you reflect that this is the most important event which has happened to me in ten days unless i count in my handing a cabman over to the police day before yesterday with the proper formalities and promised to appear in court when his case comes up if i had time to run around and talk i would do it for there is much politics agoing and it would be interesting if a body could get the hang of it it is christian and jew by the horns the advantage with the superior man as usual the superior man being the jew every time and in all countries land joe what chance would the christian have in a country where there were jews to christians oh not the shade of a shadow of a chance the difference between the brain of the average christian and that of the average jew certainly in europe is about the difference between a tadpoles and an archbishops its a marvelous race by long odds the most marvelous that the world has produced i suppose and theres more politics the clash between czech and austrian i wish i could understand these quarrels but of course i cant with the abounding love of us all mark in following the equator there was used an amusing picture showing mark twain on his trip around the world it was a trick photograph made from a picture of mark twain taken in a steamerchair cut out and combined with a dilapidated negrocart drawn by a horse and an ox in it clemens appears to be sitting luxuriously in the end of the disreputable cart his companions are two negroes to the creator of this ingenious effect mark twain sent a characteristic acknowledgment to t s frisbie vienna oct mr t s frisbie dear sir the picture has reached me and has moved me deeply that was a steady sympathetic and honorable team and although it was not swift and not showy it pulled me around the globe successfully and always attracted its proper share of attention even in the midst of the most costly and fashionable turnouts princes and dukes and other experts were always enthused by the harness and could hardly keep from trying to buy it the barouche does not look as fine now as it did earlierbut that was before the earthquake the portraits of myself and uncle and nephew are very good indeed and your impressionist reproduction of the palace of the governor general of india is accurate and full of tender feeling i consider that this picture is much more than a work of art how much more one cannot say with exactness but i should think twothirds more very truly yours mark twain following the equator was issued by subscription through mark twains old publishers the blisses of hartford the sale of it was large not only on account of the value of the book itself but also because of the sympathy of the american people with mark twains brave struggle to pay his debts when the newspapers began to print exaggerated stories of the vast profits that were piling up bliss became worried for he thought it would modify the sympathy he cabled clemens for a denial with the following result to frank e bliss in hartford vienna nov dear bliss your cablegram informing me that a report is in circulation which purports to come from me and which says i have recently made and paid all my debts has just reached me and i have cabled back my regret to you that it is not true i wrote a letter a private letter a short time ago in which i expressed the belief that i should be out of debt within the next twelvemonth if you make as much as usual for me out of the book that belief will crystallize into a fact and i shall be wholly out of debt i am encoring you now it is out of that moderate letter that the eightytwo thousanddollar mares nest has developed but why do you worry about the various reports they do not worry me they are not unfriendly and i dont see how they can do any harm be patient you have but a little while to wait the possible reports are nearly all in it has been reported that i was seriously ill it was another man dying it was another man dead the other man again it has been reported that i have received a legacy it was another man that i am out of debt it was another man and now comes this still another man it has been reported that i am writing books for publication i am not doing anything of the kind it would surprise and gratify me if i should be able to get another book ready for the press within the next three years you can see yourself that there isnt anything more to be reported invention is exhausted therefore dont worry bliss the long night is breaking as far as i can see nothing remains to be reported except that i have become a foreigner when you hear it dont you believe it and dont take the trouble to deny it merely just raise the american flag on our house in hartford and let it talk truly yours mark twain p s this is not a private letter i am getting tired of private letters to rev j h twichell in hartford vienna hotel metropole nov dear joe above is our private and permanent address for the winter you neednt send letters by london i am very much obliged for forrests austrohungarian articles i have just finished reading the first one and in it i find that his opinion and viennas are the same upon a point which was puzzling me the paucity no the absence of austrian celebrities he and vienna both say the country cannot afford to allow great names to grow up that the whole safety and prosperity of the empire depends upon keeping things quiet cant afford to have geniuses springing up and developing ideas and stirring the public soul i am assured that every time a man finds himself blooming into fame they just softly snake him down and relegate him to a wholesome obscurity it is curious and interesting three days ago the new york world sent and asked a friend of mine correspondent of a london daily to get some christmas greetings from the celebrities of the empire she spoke of this two or three bright austrians were present they said there are none who are known all over the world none who have achieved fame none who can point to their work and say it is known far and wide in the earth there are no names kossuth known because he had a father and lecher who made the hour speech two namesnothing more every other country in the world perhaps has a giant or two whose heads are away up and can be seen but ours weve got the material have always had it but we have to suppress it we cant afford to let it develop our political salvation depends upon tranquillity always has poor livy she is laid up with rheumatism but she is getting along now we have a good doctor and he says she will be out of bed in a couple of days but must stay in the house a week or ten clara is working faithfully at her music jean at her usual studies and we all send love mark mention has already been made of the political excitement in vienna the trouble between the hungarian and german legislative bodies presently became violent clemens found himself intensely interested and was present in one of the galleries when it was cleared by the police all sorts of stories were circulated as to what happened to him one of which was cabled to america a letter to twichell sets forth what really happened to rev j h twichell in hartford hotel metropole vienna dec dear joe pond sends me a cleveland paper with a cablegram from here in it which says that when the police invaded the parliament and expelled the members i waved my handkerchief and shouted hoch die deutschen and got hustled out oh dear what a pity it is that ones adventures never happen when the ordner sergeantatarms came up to our gallery and was hurrying the people out a friend tried to get leave for me to stay by saying but this gentleman is a foreigner you dont need to turn him out he wont do any harm oh i know him very well i recognize him by his pictures and i should be very glad to let him stay but i havent any choice because of the strictness of the orders and so we all went out and no one was hustled below i ran across the london times correspondent and he showed me the way into the first gallery and i lost none of the show the first gallery had not misbehaved and was not disturbed we cannot persuade livy to go out in society yet but all the lovely people come to see her and clara and i go to dinner parties and around here and there and we all have a most hospitable good time jeans woodcarving flourishes and her other studies goodbye joe and we all love all of you mark clemens made an article of the austrian troubles one of the best things he ever wrote and certainly one of the clearest elucidations of the austrohungarian confusions it was published in harpers magazine and is now included in his complete works thus far none of the webster company debts had been paid at least none of importance the money had been accumulating in mr rogerss hands but clemens was beginning to be depressed by the heavy burden he wrote asking for relief part of a letter to h h rogers in new york dear mr rogers i throw up the sponge i pull down the flag let us begin on the debts i cannot bear the weight any longer it totally unfits me for work i have lost three entire months now in that time i have begun twenty magazine articles and books and flung every one of them aside in turn the debts interfered every time and took the spirit out of any work and yet i have worked like a bond slave and wasted no time and spared no effort rogers wrote proposing a plan for beginning immediately upon the debts clemens replied enthusiastically and during the next few weeks wrote every few days expressing his delight in liquidation extracts from letters to h h rogers in new york we all delighted with your plan only dont leave b out apparently that claim has been inherited by some women daughters no doubt we dont want to see them lose any thing b is an ass and disgruntled but i dont care for that i am responsible for the money and must do the best i can to pay it i am writing hard writing for the creditors dec land we are glad to see those debts diminishing for the first time in my life i am getting more pleasure out of paying money out than pulling it in jan since we have begun to pay off the debts i have abundant peace of mind again no sense of burden work is become a pleasure again it is not labor any longer march mrs clemens has been reading the creditors letters over and over again and thanks you deeply for sending them and says it is the only really happy day she has had since susy died xxxvii letters to howells and twichell life in vienna payment of the debts assassination of the empress the end of january saw the payment of the last of mark twains debts once more he stood free before the world a world that sounded his praises the latter fact rather amused him honest men must be pretty scarce he said when they make so much fuss over even a defective specimen when the end was in sight clemens wrote the news to howells in a letter as full of sadness as of triumph to w d howells in new york hotel metropole vienna jan dear howells look at those ghastly figures i used to write it hartford there was no susy then there is no susy now and how much lies between one long lovely stretch of scented fields and meadows and shady woodlands and suddenly sahara you speak of the glorious days of that old time and they were it is my quarrel that traps like that are set susy and winnie given us in miserable sport and then taken away about the last time i saw you i described to you the culminating disaster in a book i was going to write and will yet when the stroke is further away a mans dead daughter brought to him when he had been through all other possible misfortunes and i said it couldnt be done as it ought to be done except by a man who had lived it it must be written with the blood out of a mans heart i couldnt know then how soon i was to be made competent i have thought of it many a time since if you were here i think we could cry down each others necks as in your dream for we are a pair of old derelicts drifting around now with some of our passengers gone and the sunniness of the others in eclipse i couldnt get along without work now i bury myself in it up to the ears long hours and on a stretch sometimes and all the days sundays included it isnt all for print by any means for much of it fails to suit me words of it in the past year it was because of the deadness which invaded me when susy died but i have made a change lately into dramatic work and i find it absorbingly entertaining i dont know that i can write a play that will play but no matter ill write half a dozen that wont anyway dear me i didnt know there was such fun in it ill write twenty that wont play i get into immense spirits as soon as my day is fairly started of course a good deal of this friskiness comes of my being in sight of land on the webster co debts i mean private weve lived close to the bone and saved every cent we could and theres no undisputed claim now that we cant cash i have marked this private because it is for the friends who are attending to the matter for us in new york to reveal it when they want to and if they want to there are only two claims which i dispute and which i mean to look into personally before i pay them but they are small both together they amount to only i hope you will never get the like of the load saddled onto you that was saddled onto me years ago and yet there is such a solid pleasure in paying the things that i reckon maybe it is worth while to get into that kind of a hobble after all mrs clemens gets millions of delight out of it and the children have never uttered one complaint about the scrimping from the beginning we all send you and all of you our love mark howells wrote i wish you could understand how unshaken you are you old tower in every way your foundations are struck so deep that you will catch the sunshine of immortal years and bask in the same light as cervantes and shakespeare the clemens apartments at the metropole became a sort of social clearinghouse of the viennese art and literary life much more like an embassy than the home of a mere literary man celebrities in every walk of life persons of social and official rank writers for the press assembled there on terms hardly possible in any other home in vienna wherever mark twain appeared in public he was a central figure now and then he read or spoke to aid some benefit and these were great gatherings attended by members of the royal family it was following one such event that the next letter was written private to rev j h twichell in hartford hotel metropole vienna feb dear joe theres that letter that i began so long ago you see how it is cant get time to finish anything i pile up lots of work nevertheless there may be idle people in the world but im not one of them i say private up there because ive got an adventure to tell and you mustnt let a breath of it get out first i thought i would lay it up along with a thousand others that ive laid up for the same purpose to talk to you about but those others have vanished out of my memory and that must not happen with this the other night i lectured for a vienna charity and at the end of it livy and i were introduced to a princess who is aunt to the heir apparent of the imperial throne a beautiful lady with a beautiful spirit and very cordial in her praises of my books and thanks to me for writing them and glad to meet me face to face and shake me by the hand just the kind of princess that adorns a fairy tale and makes it the prettiest tale there is very well we long ago found that when you are noticed by supremacies the correct etiquette is to go within a couple of days and pay your respects in the quite simple form of writing your name in the visitors book kept in the office of the establishment that is the end of it and everything is squared up and shipshape so at noon today livy and i drove to the archducal palace and got by the sentries all right and asked the grandlyuniformed porter for the book and said we wished to write our names in it and he called a servant in livery and was sending us up stairs and said her royal highness was out but would soon be in of course livy said no no we only want the book but he was firm and said you are americans yes then you are expected please go up stairs but indeed we are not expected please let us have the book and her royal highness will be back in a very little while she commanded me to tell you so and you must wait well the soldiers were there close by there was no use trying to resist so we followed the servant up but when he tried to beguile us into a drawingroom livy drew the line she wouldnt go in and she wouldnt stay up there either she said the princess might come in at any moment and catch us and it would be too infernally ridiculous for anything so we went down stairs again to my unspeakable regret for it was too darling a comedy to spoil i was hoping and praying the princess would come and catch us up there and that those other americans who were expected would arrive and be taken for impostors by the portier and shot by the sentinels and then it would all go into the papers and be cabled all over the world and make an immense stir and be perfectly lovely and by that time the princess would discover that we were not the right ones and the minister of war would be ordered out and the garrison and they would come for us and there would be another prodigious time and that would get cabled too and well joe i was in a state of perfect bliss but happily oh so happily that big portier wouldnt let us out he was sorry but he must obey orders we must go back up stairs and wait poor livy i couldnt help but enjoy her distress she said we were in a fix and how were we going to explain if the princess should arrive before the rightful americans came we went up stairs again laid off our wraps and were conducted through one drawing room and into another and left alone there and the door closed upon us livy was in a state of mind she said it was too theatrically ridiculous and that i would never be able to keep my mouth shut that i would be sure to let it out and it would get into the papers and she tried to make me promise promise what i said to be quiet about this indeed i wont its the best thing that ever happened ill tell it and add to it and i wish joe and howells were here to make it perfect i cant make all the rightful blunders myself it takes all three of us to do justice to an opportunity like this i would just like to see howells get down to his work and explain and lie and work his futile and inventionless subterfuges when that princess comes raging in here and wanting to know but livy could not hear fun it was not a time to be trying to be funny we were in a most miserable and shameful situation and if just then the door spread wide and our princess and more and little princes flowed in our princess and her sister the archduchess marie therese mother to the imperial heir and to the young girl archduchesses present and aunt to the little princes and we shook hands all around and sat down and had a most sociable good time for half an hour and by and by it turned out that we were the right ones and had been sent for by a messenger who started too late to catch us at the hotel we were invited for oclock but we beat that arrangement by an hour and a half wasnt it a rattling good comedy situation seems a kind of pity we were the right ones it would have been such nuts to see the right ones come and get fired out and we chatting along comfortably and nobody suspecting us for impostors we send lots and lots of love mark the reader who has followed these pages has seen how prone mark twain was to fall a victim to the lure of a patentright how he wasted several small fortunes on profitless contrivances and one large one on that insatiable demon of intricacy and despair the paige typesetter it seems incredible that after that experience and its attending disaster he should have been tempted again but scarcely was the ink dry on the receipts from his creditors when he was once more borne into the clouds on the prospect of millions perhaps even billions to be made from a marvelous carpetpattern machine the invention of sczezepanik an austrian genius that clemens appreciated his own tendencies is shown by the parenthetic line with which he opens his letter on the subject to mr rogers certainly no man was ever a more perfect prototype of colonel sellers than the creator of that lovely irrepressible visionary to mr rogers in new york march dear mr rogers i feel like col sellers mr kleinberg agent for sczezepanik came according to appointment at last night and brought his englishspeaking secretary i asked questions about the auxiliary invention which i call no and got as good an idea of it as i could it is a machine it automatically punches the holes in the jacquard cards and does it with mathematical accuracy it will do for what now costs so it has value but no is the great thingthe designing invention it saves out of and the jacquard looms must have it then i arrived at my new project and said to him in substance this you are on the point of selling the no patents to belgium italy etc i suggest that you stop those negotiations and put those people off two or three months they are anxious now they will not be less anxious then just the reverse people always want a thing that is denied them so far as i know no great worldpatent has ever yet been placed in the grip of a single corporation this is a good time to begin we have to do a good deal of guesswork here because we cannot get hold of just the statistics we want still we have some good statistics and i will use those for a test you say that of the austrian textile factories use the jacquard then we will guess that of the american factories use the jacquard and must have our no you say that a middlesized austrian factory employs from to designers and pays them from to odd florins a year a florin is francs let us call the average wage florins let us apply these figures the low wages too to the american factories with this difference to guard against overguessing that instead of allowing for to designers to a middlesized factory we allow only an average of to each of the factories a total of designers wages at a total of let us consider that no will reduce this expense to a year the saving is per each of the of capital employed in the jacquard business over there let us consider that in the countries covered by this patent an aggregate of of capital is employed in factories requiring no the saving as above is a year the company holding in its grip all these patents would collar of that as its share possibly more competition would be at an end in the jacquard business on this planet pricecutting would end fluctuations in values would cease the business would be the safest and surest in the world commercial panics could not seriously affect it its stock would be as choice an investment as government bonds when the patents died the company would be so powerful that it could still keep the whole business in its hands would you like to grant me the privilege of placing the whole jacquard business of the world in the grip of a single company and dont you think that the business would growgrow like a weed ach america it is the country of the big let me get my breath then we will talk so then we talked talked till pretty late would germany and england join the combination i said the company would know how to persuade them then i asked for a supplementary option to cover the world and we parted i am taking all precautions to keep my name out of print in connection with this matter and we will now keep the invention itself out of print as well as we can descriptions of it have been granted to the dry goods economist new york and to a syndicate of american papers i have asked mr kleinberg to suppress these and he feels pretty sure he can do it with love s l c if this splendid enthusiasm had not cooled by the time a reply came from mr rogers it must have received a sudden chill from the letter which he inclosed the brief and concise report from a carpetmachine expert who said i do not feel that it would be of any value to us in our mills and the number of jacquard looms in america is so limited that i am of the opinion that there is no field for a company to develop the invention here a cursory examination of the pamphlet leads me to place no very high value upon the invention from a practical standpoint with the receipt of this letter carpetpattern projects would seem to have suddenly ceased to be a factor in mark twains calculations such a letter in the early days of the typemachine would have saved him a great sum in money and years of disappointment but perhaps he would not have heeded it then the year brought the spanishamerican war clemens was constitutionally against all wars but writing to twichell whose son had enlisted we gather that this one was an exception to rev j h twichell in hartford kaltenleutgeben near vienna june dear joe you are living your wardays over again in dave and it must be a strong pleasure mixed with a sauce of apprehension enough to make it just schmeck as the germans say dave will come out with two or three stars on his shoulderstraps if the war holds and then we shall all be glad it happened we started with bull run before dewey and hobson have introduced an improvement on the game this time i have never enjoyed a wareven in written history as i am enjoying this one for this is the worthiest one that was ever fought so far as my knowledge goes it is a worthy thing to fight for ones freedom it is another sight finer to fight for another mans and i think this is the first time it has been done oh never mind charley warner he would interrupt the raising of lazarus he would say the will has been probated the property distributed it will be a world of trouble to settle the rows better leave well enough alone dont ever disturb anything where its going to break the soft smooth flow of things and wobble our tranquillity company sh it happens every day and we came out here to be quiet love to you all mark they were spending the summer at kaltenleutgeben a pleasant village near vienna but apparently not entirely quiet many friends came out from vienna including a number of visiting americans clemens however appears to have had considerable time for writing as we gather from the next to howells to w d howells in america kaltenleutgeben bei wien aug dear howells your letter came yesterday it then occurred to me that i might have known per mental telegraph that it was due for a couple of weeks ago when the weekly came containing that handsome reference to me i was powerfully moved to write you and my letter went on writing itself while i was at work at my other literature during the day but next day my other literature was still urgent and so on and so on so my letter didnt get put into ink at all but i see now that you were writing about that time therefore a part of my stir could have come across the atlantic per mental telegraph in or i wrote words of a story called simon wheeler wherein the nub was the preventing of an execution through testimony furnished by mental telegraph from the other side of the globe i had a lot of people scattered about the globe who carried in their pockets something like the old mesmerizerbutton made of different metals and when they wanted to call up each other and have a talk they pressed the button or did something i dont remember what and communication was at once opened i didnt finish the story though i rebegan it in several new ways and spent altogether words on it then gave it up and threw it aside this much as preliminary to this remark some day people will be able to call each other up from any part of the world and talk by mental telegraph and not merely by impression the impression will be articulated into words it could be a terrible thing but it wont be because in the upper civilizations everything like sentimentality i was going to say sentiment will presently get materialized out of people along with the already fading spiritualities and so when a man is called who doesnt wish to talk he will be like those visitors you mention not chosen and will be frankly damned and shut off speaking of the ill luck of starting a piece of literary work wrongand again and again always aware that there is a way if you could only think it out which would make the thing slide effortless from the penthe one right way the sole form for you the other forms being for men whose line those forms are or who are capabler than yourself ive had no end of experience in that and maybe i am the only one let us hope so last summer i started things wrong books and mag articles and could only make little wee things words altogether succeed only that out of piles and stacks of diligentlywrought ms the labor of weeks unremitting effort i could make all of those things go if i would take the trouble to rebegin each one half a dozen times on a new plan but none of them was important enough except one the story i in the wrong form mapped out in paris three or four years ago and told you about in new york under seal of confidence no other person knows of it but mrs clemens the story to be called which was the dream a week ago i examined the ms words and saw that the plan was a totally impossible onefor me but a new plan suggested itself and straightway the tale began to slide from the pen with ease and confidence i think ive struck the right one this time i have already put words of it on paper and mrs clemens is pretty outspokenly satisfied with ita hard critic to content i feel sure that all of the first half of the story and i hope threefourths will be comedy but by the former plan the whole of it except the first chapters would have been tragedy and unendurable almost i think i can carry the reader a long way before he suspects that i am laying a tragedytrap in the present form i could spin books out of it with comfort and joy but i shall deny myself and restrict it to one if you should see a little short story in a magazine in the autumn called my platonic sweetheart written weeks ago that is not this one it may have been a suggester though i expect all these singular privacies to interest you and you are not to let on that they dont we are leaving this afternoon for ischl to use that as a base for the baggage and then gad around ten days among the lakes and mountains to restup mrs clemens who is jaded with housekeeping i hope i can get a chance to work a little in spots i cant tell but you do it therefore why should you think i cant remainder missing the dream story was never completed it was the same that he had worked on in london and perhaps again in switzerland it would be tried at other times and in other forms but it never seemed to accommodate itself to a central idea so that the good writing in it eventually went to waste the short story mentioned my platonic sweetheart a charming idyllic tale was not published during mark twains lifetime two years after his death it appeared in harpers magazine the assassination of the empress of austria at geneva was the startling event of that summer in a letter to twichell clemens presents the tragedy in a few vivid paragraphs later he treated it at some length in a magazine article which very likely because of personal relations with members of the austrian court he withheld from print it has since been included in a volume of essays what is man etc to rev j h twichell in hartford kaltenleutgeben sep dear joe you are mistaken people dont send us the magazines no harper century and mcclure do an example i should like to recommend to other publishers and so i thank you very much for sending me branders article when you say i like brander matthews he impresses me as a man of parts and power i back you right up to the hub i feel the same way and when you say he has earned your gratitude for cuffing me for my crimes against the leather stockings and the vicar i aint making any objection dern your gratitude his article is as sound as a nut brander knows literature and loves it he can talk about it and keep his temper he can state his case so lucidly and so fairly and so forcibly that you have to agree with him even when you dont agree with him and he can discover and praise such merits as a book has even when they are half a dozen diamonds scattered through an acre of mud and so he has a right to be a critic to detail just the opposite of the above invoice is to describe me i havent any right to criticise books and i dont do it except when i hate them i often want to criticise jane austen but her books madden me so that i cant conceal my frenzy from the reader and therefore i have to stop every time i begin that good and unoffending lady the empress is killed by a madman and i am living in the midst of worldhistory again the queens jubilee last year the invasion of the reichsrath by the police and now this murder which will still be talked of and described and painted a thousand years from now to have a personal friend of the wearer of the crown burst in at the gate in the deep dusk of the evening and say in a voice broken with tears my god the empress is murdered and fly toward her home before we can utter a questionwhy it brings the giant event home to you makes you a part of it and personally interested it is as if your neighbor antony should come flying and say caesar is butchered the head of the world is fallen of course there is no talk but of this the mourning is universal and genuine the consternation is stupefying the austrian empire is being draped with black vienna will be a spectacle to see by next saturday when the funeral cortege marches we are invited to occupy a room in the sumptuous new hotel the krantz where we are to live during the fall and winter and view it and we shall go speaking of mrs leiter there is a noble dame in vienna about whom they retail similar slanders she said in french she is weak in french that she had been spending a sunday afternoon in a gathering of the demimonde meaning the unknown land that mercantile land that mysterious halfworld which underlies the aristocracy but these malaproperies are always inventions they dont happen yes i wish we could have some talks im full to the eyelids had a noble good one with parker and dunham land but we were grateful for that visit yours with all our loves mark inclosed with the foregoing among the inadequate attempts to account for the assassination we must concede high rank to the german emperors he justly describes it as a deed unparalleled for ruthlessness and then adds that it was ordained from above i think this verdict will not be popular above a man is either a free agent or he isnt if a man is a free agent this prisoner is responsible for what he has done but if a man is not a free agent if the deed was ordained from above there is no rational way of making this prisoner even partially responsible for it and the german court cannot condemn him without manifestly committing a crime logic is logic and by disregarding its laws even emperors as capable and acute as william ii can be beguiled into making charges which should not be ventured upon except in the shelter of plenty of lightningrods mark the end of the year found mark twain once more in easy even luxurious circumstances the hard work and good fortune which had enabled him to pay his debts had in the course of another year provided what was comparative affluence his report to howells is characteristic and interesting to w d howells in new york hotel krantz wien l never markt dec dear howells i begin with a date including all the details though i shall be interrupted presently by a southafrican acquaintance who is passing through and it may be many days before i catch another leisure moment note how suddenly a thing can become habit and how indestructible the habit is afterward in your house in cambridge a hundred years ago mrs howells said to me here is a bunch of your letters and the dates are of no value because you dont put any in the years anyway that remark diseased me with a habit which has cost me worlds of time and torture and ink and millions of vain efforts and buckets of tears to break it and here it is yet i could easier get rid of a virtue i hope it will interest you for i have no one else who would much care to know it that here lately the dread of leaving the children in difficult circumstances has died down and disappeared and i am now having peace from that long long nightmare and can sleep as well as anyone every little while for these three years now mrs clemens has come with pencil and paper and figured up the condition of things she keeps the accounts and the bankbook and has proven to me that the clouds were lifting and so has hoisted my spirits temporarily and kept me going till another figuringup was necessary last night she figured up for her own satisfaction not mine and found that we own a house and furniture in hartford that my english and american copyrights pay an income which represents a value of and that we have cash in the bank i have been out and bought a box of cent cigars i was smoking centers before at the house of an english friend on christmas eve we saw the mousetrap played and well played i thought the house would kill itself with laughter by george they played with life and it was most devastatingly funny and it was well they did for they put us clemenses in the front seat and if they played it poorly i would have assaulted them the head young man and girl were americans the other parts were taken by english irish and scotch girls then there was a niggerminstrel show of the genuine old sort and i enjoyed that too for the niggershow was always a passion of mine this one was created and managed by a quaker doctor from philada years old and he was the middle man there were others americans from states and a scotchman englishmen and an irishman all postgraduatemedical young fellows of course or it could be music but it would be bound to be one or the other its quite true i dont read you as much as i ought nor anywhere near half as much as i want to still i read you all i get a chance to i saved up your last story to read when the numbers should be complete but before that time arrived some other admirer of yours carried off the papers i will watch admirers of yours when the silver wedding journey begins and that will not happen again the last chance at a bound book of yours was in london nearly two years ago the last volume of your short things by the harpers i read the whole book twice through and some of the chapters several times and the reason that that was as far as i got with it was that i lent it to another admirer of yours and he is admiring it yet your admirers have ways of their own i dont know where they get them yes our project is to go home next autumn if we find we can afford to live in new york weve asked a friend to inquire about flats and expenses but perhaps nothing will come of it we do afford to live in the finest hotel in vienna and have bedrooms a diningroom a drawingroom bathrooms and vorzimmers and food but we couldnt get the half of it in new york for the same money a month susy hovers about us this holiday week and the shadows fall all about us of the days when we went gipsying a long time ago death is so kind so benignant to whom he loves but he goes by us others and will not look our way we saw the master of palmyra last night how death with the gentleness and majesty made the human grandfolk around him seem little and trivial and silly with love from all of us to all of you mark xxxviii letters to howells and others vienna london a summer in sweden the beginning of found the clemens family still in vienna occupying handsome apartments at the hotel krantz their rooms so often thronged with gay and distinguished people were sometimes called the second embassy clemens himself was the central figure of these assemblies of all the foreign visitors in the austrian capital he was the most notable everywhere he was surrounded by a crowd of listeners his sayings and opinions were widely quoted a project for world disarmament promulgated by the czar of russia would naturally interest mark twain and when william t stead of the review of reviews cabled him for an opinion on the matter he sent at first a brief word and on the same day followed it with more extended comment the great war which has since devastated the world gives to this incident an added interest to wm t stead in london no vienna jan dear mr steadthe czar is ready to disarm i am ready to disarm collect the others it should not be much of a task now mark twain to wm t stead in london no dear mr stead peace by compulsion that seems a better idea than the other peace by persuasion has a pleasant sound but i think we should not be able to work it we should have to tame the human race first and history seems to show that that cannot be done cant we reduce the armaments little by little on a pro rata basis by concert of the powers cant we get four great powers to agree to reduce their strength per cent a year and thrash the others into doing likewise for of course we cannot expect all of the powers to be in their right minds at one time it has been tried we are not going to try to get all of them to go into the scheme peaceably are we in that case i must withdraw my influence because for business reasons i must preserve the outward signs of sanity four is enough if they can be securely harnessed together they can compel peace and peace without compulsion would be against nature and not operative a sliding scale of reduction of per cent a year has a sort of plausible look and i am willing to try that if three other powers will join i feel sure that the armaments are now many times greater than necessary for the requirements of either peace or war take wartime for instance suppose circumstances made it necessary for us to fight another waterloo and that it would do what it did before settle a large question and bring peace i will guess that men were on hand at waterloo i have forgotten the figures in five hours they disabled men it took them that tedious long time because the firearms delivered only two or three shots a minute but we would do the work now as it was done at omdurman with shower guns raining balls a minute four men to a gun is that the number a hundred and fifty shots a minute per man thus a modern soldier is waterloo soldiers in one thus also we can now retain one man out of each in service disband the others and fight our waterloos just as effectively as we did eightyfive years ago we should do the same beneficent job with men now that we did with then the allies could take of the men and give napoleon and then whip him but instead what do we see in wartime in germany russia and france taken together we find about million men equipped for the field each man represents waterloo men in usefulness and killing capacity altogether they constitute about million waterloo men and there are not quite that many grown males of the human race now on this planet thus we have this insane fact that whereas those three countries could arm men with modern weapons and make them the equals of million men of napoleons day and accomplish with them all necessary war work they waste their money and their prosperity creating forces of their populations in piling together extra waterloo equivalents which they would have no sort of use for if they would only stop drinking and sit down and cipher a little perpetual peace we cannot have on any terms i suppose but i hope we can gradually reduce the war strength of europe till we get it down to where it ought to be men properly armed then we can have all the peace that is worth while and when we want a war anybody can afford it vienna january p s in the article i sent the figures are wrong million ought to be million ought to be and the remark about the sum being a little more than the present number of males on the planet that is wrong of course it represents really one and a half the existing males now and then one of mark twains old comrades still reached out to him across the years he always welcomed such letters they came as from a lost land of romance recalled always with tenderness he sent light chaffing replies but they were never without an undercurrent of affection to major jack downing in middleport ohio hotel krantz wein i neuer mart feb dear major no it was to bixby that i was apprenticed he was to teach me the river for a certain specified sum i have forgotten what it was but i paid it i steered a trip for bart bowen of keokuk on the a t lacy and i was partner with will bowen on the a b chambers one trip and with sam bowen a whole summer on a small memphis packet the newspaper report you sent me is incorrect bixby is not he is i am myself and i couldnt talk plain and had just begun to walk when i apprenticed myself to bixby who was then passing himself off for and successfully too for he always looked or years younger than he really was at that time he was piloting the mississippi on a potomac commission granted him by george washington who was a personal friend of his before the revolution he has piloted every important river in america on that commission he has also used it as a passport in russia i have never revealed these facts before i notice too that you are deceiving the people concerning your age the printed portrait which you have enclosed is not a portrait of you but a portrait of me when i was i remember very well when it was common for people to mistake bixby for your grandson is it spreading i wonder this disposition of pilots to renew their youth by doubtful methods beck jolly and joe bryan they probably go to sunday school now but it will not deceive yes it is as you say all of the procession but a fraction has passed it is time for us all to fall in sincerely yours s l clemens to w d howells in new york hotel krantz wien i neuer markt april dear howells i am waiting for the april harper which is about due now waiting and strongly interested you are old enough to be a weary man with paling interests but you do not show it you do your work in the same old delicate and delicious and forceful and searching and perfect way i dont know how you can but i suspect i suspect that to you there is still dignity in human life and that man is not a joke a poor joke the poorest that was ever contrived since i wrote my bible last year what is man which mrs clemens loathes and shudders over and will not listen to the last half nor allow me to print any part of it man is not to me the respectworthy person he was before and so i have lost my pride in him and cant write gaily nor praisefully about him any more and i dont intend to try i mean to go on writing for that is my best amusement but i shant print much for i dont wish to be scalped any more than another april the harper has come i have been in leipzig with your party and then went on to karlsbad and saw mrs marshs encounter with the swine with the toothpick and the other manners their silver wedding journey at this point jean carried the magazine away is it imagination or anyway i seem to get furtive and fleeting glimpses which i take to be the weariness and condolence of age indifference to sights and things once brisk with interest tasteless stale stuff which used to be champagne the boredom of travel the secret sigh behind the public smile the private whatinhelldidicomefor but maybe that is your art maybe that is what you intend the reader to detect and think he has made a columbusdiscovery then it is well done perfectly done i wrote my last travel book following the equator in hell but i let on the best i could that it was an excursion through heaven some day i will read it and if its lying cheerfulness fools me then i shall believe it fooled the reader how i did loathe that journey around the world except the seapart and india evening my tail hangs low i thought i was a financier and i bragged to you i am not bragging now the stock which i sold at such a fine profit early in january has never ceased to advance and is now worth more than i sold it for i feel just as if i had been spending a month and i feel reproached for this showy and unbecoming extravagance last week i was going down with the family to budapest to lecture and to make a speech at a banquet just as i was leaving here i got a telegram from london asking for the speech for a new york paper i this is strictly private sent it and then i didnt make that speech but another of a quite different character a speech born of something which the introducer said if that said speech got cabled and printed you neednt let on that it was never uttered that was a darling night and those hungarians were lively people we were there a week and had a great time at the banquet i heard their chief orator make a most graceful and easy and beautiful and delicious speech i never heard one that enchanted me more although i did not understand a word of it since it was in hungarian but the art of itit was superlative they are wonderful english scholars these people my lecture audience all hungarians understood me perfectly to judge by the effects the english clergyman told me that in his congregation are young english women who earn their living teaching their language and that there are others besides these for cents a week the telephone reads the morning news to you at home gives you the stocks and markets at noon gives you lessons in foreign languages during hours gives you the afternoon telegrams and at night the concerts and operas of course even the clerks and seamstresses and bootblacks and everybody else are subscribers correction mrs clemens says it is cents a month i am renewing my youth i made speeches at one banquet here last saturday night and ive been to a lot of football matches jean has been in here examining the poll for the immortals literature march in the hope i think that at last she should find me at the top and you in second place and if that is her ambition she has suffered disappointment for the third time and will never fare any better i hope for you are where you belong by every right she wanted to know who it is that does the voting but i was not able to tell her nor when the election will be completed and decided next morning i have been reading the morning paper i do it every morning well knowing that i shall find in it the usual depravities and basenesses and hypocrisies and cruelties that make up civilization and cause me to put in the rest of the day pleading for the damnation of the human race i cannot seem to get my prayers answered yet i do not despair escaped from oclock tea sh oh the american girl in europe often she is creditable but sometimes she is just shocking this one a minute ago fatface raspy voice pert ways the selfcomplacency of god and with it all a silly laugh embarrassed which kept breaking out through her chatter all along whereas there was no call for it for she said nothing that was funny spose so many ve told y how they njoyed yr chaptr on the germ tongue its bringin coals to newcastle kehe say anything bout it kehehe spent m vacation n russia n saw tolstoi he said it made me shudder april jean has been in here with a copy of literature complaining that i am again behind you in the election of the consecrated members and seems troubled about it and not quite able to understand it but i have explained to her that you are right there on the ground inside the poolbooth keeping game and that that makes a large difference in these things th i have been to the knustausstellung with mrs clemens the office of art seems to be to grovel in the dirt before emperors and this and that and the other damned breed of priests yrs ever mark howells and clemens were corresponding regularly again though not with the frequency of former years perhaps neither of them was bubbling over with things to say perhaps it was becoming yearly less attractive to pick up a pen and write and then of course there was always the discouragement of distance once howells wrote i know this will find you in austria before i can well turn round but i must make believe you are in kennebunkport before i can begin it and in another letter it ought to be as pleasant to sit down and write to you as to sit down and talk to you but it isnt the only reason why i write is that i want another letter from you and because i have a whole afternoon for the job i have the whole of every afternoon for i cannot work later than lunch i am fagged by that time and sunday is the only day that brings unbearable leisure i hope you will be in new york another winter then i shall know what to do with these foretastes of eternity clemens usually wrote at considerable length for he had a good deal to report of his life in the austrian capital now drawing to a close to w d howells in new york may dear howells p m tea for mr and mrs tower who are leaving for russia just over nice people and rather creditable to the human race mr and mrs tower the new minister and his wife the secretary of legation the naval and military attach several english ladies an irish lady a scotch lady a particularly nice young austrian baron who wasnt invited but came and went supposing it was the usual thing and wondered at the unusually large gathering two other austrians and several americans who were also in his fix the old baronin langeman the only austrian invited the rest were americans it made just a comfortable crowd in our parlor with an overflow into claras through the folding doors i dont enjoy teas and am daily spared them by mrs clemens but this was a pleasant one i had only one accident the old baronin langeman is a person i have a strong fondness for for we violently disagree on some subjects and as violently agree on others for instance she is temperance and i am not she has religious beliefs and feelings and i have none shes a methodist she is a democrat and so am i she is womans rights and so am i she is laborers rights and approves trades unions and strikes and that is me and so on after she was gone an english lady whom i greatly like began to talk sharply against her for contributing money time labor and public expression of favor to a strike that is on for an hour day in the silk factories of bohemia and she caught me unprepared and betrayed me into overwarm argument i am sorry for she didnt know anything about the subject and i did and one should be gentle with the ignorant for they are the chosen of god the new minister is a good man but out of place the sec of legation is a good man but out of place the attache is a good man but out of place our government for displacement beats the new white star ship and her possible is tons may p m a beautiful english girl and her handsome english husband came up and spent the evening and she certainly is a bird english parents she was born and reared in roumania and couldnt talk english till she was or she came up clothed like the sunset and was a delight to look at roumanian costume twentyfour young people have gone out to the semmering today and tomorrow and mrs clemens and an english lady and old leschetitzky and his wife have gone to chaperon them they gave me a chance to go but there are no snow mountains that i want to look at three hours out three hours back and sit up all night watching the young people dance yelling conversationally and being yelled at conversationally by new acquaintances through the deafening music about how i like vienna and if its my first visit and how long we expect to stay and did i see the footwashing and am i writing a book about vienna and so on the terms seemed too severe snow mountains are too dear at the price for several years i have been intending to stop writing for print as soon as i could afford it at last i can afford it and have put the potboiler pen away what i have been wanting is a chance to write a book without reserves a book which should take account of no ones feelings and no ones prejudices opinions beliefs hopes illusions delusions a book which should say my say right out of my heart in the plainest language and without a limitation of any sort i judged that that would be an unimaginable luxury heaven on earth it is under way now and it is a luxury an intellectual drunk twice i didnt start it right and got pretty far in both times before i found it out but i am sure it is started right this time it is in taleform i believe i can make it tell what i think of man and how he is constructed and what a shabby poor ridiculous thing he is and how mistaken he is in his estimate of his character and powers and qualities and his place among the animals so far i think i am succeeding i let the madam into the secret day before yesterday and locked the doors and read to her the opening chapters she said it is perfectly horrible and perfectly beautiful within the due limits of modesty that is what i think i hope it will take me a year or two to write it and that it will turn out to be the right vessel to contain all the abuse i am planning to dump into it yours ever mark the story mentioned in the foregoing in which mark twain was to give his opinion of man was the mysterious stranger it was not finished at the time and its closing chapter was not found until after his death six years later it was published serially in harpers magazine and in book form the end of may found the clemens party in london where they were received and entertained with all the hospitality they had known in earlier years clemens was too busy for letterwriting but in the midst of things he took time to report to howells an amusing incident of one of their entertainments to w d howells in america london july dear howells ive a lot of things to write you but its no use i cant get time for anything these days i must break off and write a postscript to canon wilberforce before i go to bed this afternoon he left a luncheonparty half an hour ahead of the rest and carried off my hat which has mark twain in a big hand written in it when the rest of us came out there was but one hat that would go on my head it fitted exactly too so wore it away it had no name in it but the canon was the only man who was absent i wrote him a note at pm saying that for four hours i had not been able to take anything that did not belong to me nor stretch a fact beyond the frontiers of truth and my family were getting alarmed could he explain my trouble and now at pm comes a note from him to say that all the afternoon he has been exhibiting a wondercompelling mental vivacity and grace of expression etc etc and have i missed a hat our letters have crossed yours ever mark news came of the death of robert ingersoll clemens had been always one of his most ardent admirers and a warm personal friend to ingersolls niece he sent a word of heartfelt sympathy to miss eva farrell in new york wellington court albert gate dear miss farrell except my daughters i have not grieved for any death as i have grieved for his his was a great and beautiful spirit he was a man all man from his crown to his foot soles my reverence for him was deep and genuine i prized his affection for me and returned it with usury sincerely yours s l clemens clemens and family decided to spend the summer in sweden at sauna in order to avail themselves of osteopathic treatment as practised by heinrick kellgren kellgrens method known as the swedish movements seemed to mark twain a wonderful cure for all ailments and he heralded the discovery far and wide he wrote to friends far and near advising them to try kellgren for anything they might happen to have whatever its beginning any letter was likely to close with some mention of the new panacea to rev j h twichell traveling in europe sanna sept dear joe ive no business in here i ought to be outside i shall never see another sunset to begin with it this side of heaven venice land what a poor interest that is this is the place to be i have seen about sunsets here and a good of them were clear and away beyond anything i had ever imagined before for dainty and exquisite and marvellous beauty and infinite change and variety america italy the tropics they have no notion of what a sunset ought to be and this one this unspeakable wonder it discounts all the rest it brings the tears it is so unutterably beautiful if i had time i would say a word about this curative system here the people actually do several of the great things the christian scientists pretend to do you wish to advise with a physician about it certainly there is no objection he knows next to something about his own trade but that will not embarrass him in framing a verdict about this one i respect your superstitions we all have them it would be quite natural for the cautious chinaman to ask his native priest to instruct him as to the value of the new religious specialty which the western missionary is trying to put on the market before investing in it he would get a verdict love to you all always yours mark howells wrote that he was going on a readingtourdreading it of courseand asking for any advice that clemens felt qualified to give naturally clemens gave him the latest he had in stock without realizing perhaps that he was recommending an individual practice which few would be likely to imitate nevertheless what he says is interesting to w d howells in america sanna sweden sept dear howells get your lecture by heart it will pay you i learned a trick in vienna by accident which i wish i had learned years ago i meant to read from a tauchnitz because i knew i hadnt well memorized the pieces and i came on with the book and read a few sentences then remembered that the sketch needed a few words of explanatory introduction and so lowering the book and now and then unconsciously using it to gesture with i talked the introduction and it happened to carry me into the sketch itself and then i went on pretending that i was merely talking extraneous matter and would come to the sketch presently it was a beautiful success i knew the substance of the sketch and the telling phrases of it and so the throwing of the rest of it into informal talk as i went along limbered it up and gave it the snap and go and freshness of an impromptu i was to read several pieces and i played the same game with all of them and always the audience thought i was being reminded of outside things and throwing them in and was going to hold up the book and begin on the sketch presently and so i always got through the sketch before they were entirely sure that it had begun i did the same thing in budapest and had the same good time over again its a new dodge and the best one that was ever invented try it youll never lose your audience not even for a moment their attention is fixed and never wavers and that is not the case where one reads from book or ms or where he stands up without a note and frankly exposes the fact by his confident manner and smooth phrasing that he is not improvising but reciting from memory and in the heat of telling a thing that is memorised in substance only one flashes out the happiest suddenlybegotten phrases every now and then try it such a phrase has a life and sparkle about it that twice as good a one could not exhibit if prepared beforehand and it fetches an audience in such an enthusing and inspiring and uplifting way that that lucky phrase breeds another one sure your september instalment their silver wedding journey was delicious every word of it you havent lost any of your splendid art callers have arrived with love mark yes wrote howells if i were a great histrionic artist like you i would get my poor essays by heart and recite them but being what i am i should do the thing so lifelessly that i had better recognise their deadness frankly and read them from vienna clemens had contributed to the cosmopolitan then owned by john brisben walker his first article on christian science it was a delicious bit of humor and found such enthusiastic appreciation that walker was moved to send an additional check in payment for it this brought prompt acknowledgment to john brisben walker in irvington n y london oct dear mr walker by gracious but you have a talent for making a man feel proud and good to say a compliment well is a high art and few possess it you know how to do it and when you confirm its sincerity with a handsome cheque the limit is reached and compliment can no higher go i like to work for you when you dont approve an article you say so recognizing that i am not a child and can stand it and when you approve an article i dont have to dicker with you as if i raised peanuts and you kept a stand i know i shall get every penny the article is worth you have given me very great pleasure and i thank you for it sincerely yours s l clemens on the same day he sent word to howells of the good luck which now seemed to be coming his way the joan of arc introduction was the same that today appears in his collected works under the title of saint joan of arc to w d howells in new york london oct dear howells my its a lucky day of the sort when it never rains but it pours i was to write an introduction to a nobler book the english translation of the official record unabridged of the trials and rehabilitation of joan of arc and make a lot of footnotes i wrote the introduction in sweden and here a few days ago i tore loose from a tale i am writing and took the ms book and went at the grind of notemaking a fearful job for a man not used to it this morning brought a note from my excellent friend murray a rich englishman who edits the translation saying never mind the notes well make the translators do them that was comfort and joy the same mail brought a note from canon wilberforce asking me to talk joan of arc in his drawingroom to the dukes and earls and m ps which would fetch me out of my seclusion and into print and i couldnt have that and so of course i must run down to the abbey and explain and lose an hour just then came murray and said leave that to me ill go and do the explaining and put the thing off months you write a note and tell him i am coming which i did later wilberforce carried off my hat from a lunch party last summer and in todays note he said he wouldnt steal my new hat this time in my note i said i couldnt make the drawingroom talk now murray would explain and added a p s you mustnt think it is because i am afraid to trust my hat in your reach again for i assure you upon honor it isnt i should bring my old one i had suggested to murray a fortnight ago that he get some big guns to write introductory monographs for the book miss x joans voices and prophecies the lord chief justice of england the legal prodigies which she performed before her judges lord roberts her military genius kipling her patriotism and so on when he came this morning he said he had captured miss x that lord roberts and kipling were going to take hold and see if they could do monographs worthy of the book he hadnt run the others to cover yet but was on their track very good news it is a grand book and is entitled to the best efforts of the best people as for me i took pains with my introduction and i admit that it is no slouch of a performance then i came down to chattos and found your all too beautiful letter and was lifted higher than ever next came letters from america properly glorifying my christian science article in the cosmopolitan and one roundly abusing it and a letter from john brisben walker enclosing additional pay for the article he had already paid enough but i didnt mention that which wasnt right of me for this is the second time he has done such a thing whereas gilder has done it only once and no one else ever i make no prices with walker and gilder i can trust them and last of all came a letter from m how i do wish that man was in hell eventhe briefest line from that idiot puts me in a rage but on the whole it has been a delightful day and with min hell it would have been perfect but that will happen and i can wait ah if i could look into the inside of people as you do and put it on paper and invent things for them to do and say and tell how they said it i could writs a fine and readable book now for ive got a prime subject ive written words of it and satisfied myself that the stuff is there so i am going to discard that ms and begin all over again and have a good time with it oh i know how you feel ive been in hell myself you are there tonight by difference in time you are at luncheon now and not eating it nothing is so lonesome as gadding around platforming i have declined lectures todayengland and scotland i wanted the money but not the torture good luck to you and repentance with love to all of you mark letters of mainly to twichell the boer war boxer troubles the return to america the new year found clemens still in london chiefly interested in osteopathy and characteristically glorifying the practice at the expense of other healing methods to rev j h twichell in hartford london jan dear joe mental telepathy has scored another mental telegraphy will be greatly respected a century hence by the accident of writing my sister and describing to her the remarkable cures made by kellgren with his hands and without drugs i brought upon myself a quite stunning surprise for she wrote to me that she had been taking this very treatment in buffalo and that it was an american invention well it does really turn out that dr still in the middle of kansas in a village began to experiment in only five years after kellgren began the same work obscurely in the village of gotha in germany dr still seems to be an honest man therefore i am persuaded that kellgren moved him to his experiments by mental telegraphy across six hours of longitude without need of a wire by the time still began to experiment kellgren had completed his development of the principles of his system and established himself in a good practice in london and was in good shape to convey his discovery to kansas mental telegraphically yes i was greatly surprised to find that my mares nest was much in arrears that this new science was well known in america under the name of osteopathy since then i find that in the past years it has got itself legalized in states in spite of the opposition of the physicians that it has established osteopathic schools and colleges that among its students are allopathic physicians that there is a school in boston and another in philadelphia that there are about students in the parent college dr stills at kirksville missouri and that there are about graduates practicing in america dear me there are not in europe europe is so sunk in superstitions and prejudices that it is an almost impossible thing to get her to do anything but scoff at a new thing unless it come from abroad as witness the telegraph dentistry c presently the osteopath will come over here from america and will soon make himself a power that must be recognized and reckoned with and then years from now england will begin to claim the invention and tell all about its origin in the cyclopedia b as in the case of the telegraph applied anaesthetics and the other benefactions which she heaped her abuse upon when her inventors first offered them to her i cannot help feeling rather inordinately proud of america for the gay and hearty way in which she takes hold of any new thing that comes along and gives it a first rate trial many an ass in america is getting a deal of benefit out of xsciences new exploitation of an ageold healing principle faith combined with the patients imagination let it boom along i have no objection let them call it by what name they choose so long as it does helpful work among the class which is numerically vastly the largest bulk of the human race ie the fools the idiots the puddnheads we do not guess we know that in of the species are puddnheads we know it by various evidences and one of them is that for ages the race has respected and almost venerated the physicians grotesque system the emptying of miscellaneous and harmful drugs into a persons stomach to remove ailments which in many cases the drugs could not reach at all in many cases could reach and help but only at cost of damage to some other part of the man and in the remainder of the cases the drug either retarded the cure or the disease was cured by nature in spite of the nostrums the doctors insane system has not only been permitted to continue its follies for ages but has been protected by the state and made a close monopoly an infamous thing a crime against a freemans proper right to choose his own assassin or his own method of defending his body against disease and death and yet at the same time with curious and senile inconsistency the state has allowed the man to choose his own assassin in one detail the patentmedicine detail making itself the protector of that perilous business collecting money out of it and appointing no committee of experts to examine the medicines and forbid them when extra dangerous really when a man can prove that he is not a jackass i think he is in the way to prove that he is no legitimate member of the race i have by me a list of human ailments common ones and in this list i count which the physicians art cannot cure but there isnt one which osteopathy or kellgren cannot cure if the patient comes early fifteen years ago i had a deep reverence for the physician and the surgeon but months of closely watching the kellgren business has revolutionized all that and now i have neither reverence nor respect for the physicians trade and scarcely any for the surgeons i am convinced that of all quackeries the physicians is the grotesquest and the silliest and they know they are shams and humbugs they have taken the place of those augurs who couldnt look each other in the face without laughing see what a powerful hold our ancient superstitions have upon us two weeks ago when livy committed an incredible imprudence and by consequence was promptly stricken down with a heavy triple attack influenza bronchitis and a lung affected she recognized the gravity of the situation and her old superstitions rose she thought she ought to send for a doctor think of it the last man in the world i should want around at such a time of course i did not say no not that i was indisposed to take the responsibility for i was not my notion of a dangerous responsibility being quite the other way but because it is unsafe to distress a sick person i only said we knew no good doctor and it could not be good policy to choose at hazard so she allowed me to send for kellgren today she is up and aroundlured it is safe to say that persons hit in the same way at the same time are in bed yet and booked to stay there a good while and to be in a shackly condition and afraid of their shadows for a couple of years or more to come it will be seen by the foregoing that mark twains interest in the kellgren system was still an ardent one indeed for a time he gave most of his thought to it and wrote several long appreciations perhaps with little idea of publication but merely to get his enthusiasm physically expressed war however presently supplanted medicine the boer troubles in south africa and the boxer insurrection in china it was a disturbing exciting year to w d howells in boston wellington court knightsbridge jan dear howells if you got half as much as pond prophesied be content and praise god it has not happened to another but i am sorry he didnt go with you for it is marvelous to hear him yarn he is good company cheery and hearty and his mill is never idle your doing a lecture tour was heroic it was the highest order of grit and you have a right to be proud of yourself no mount of applause or money or both could save it from being a hell to a man constituted as you are it is that even to me who am made of coarser stuff i knew the audiences would come forward and shake hands with you that one infallible sign of sincere approval in all my life wherever it failed me i left the hall sick and ashamed knowing what it meant privately speaking this is a sordid and criminal war and in every way shameful and excuseless every day i write in my head bitter magazine articles about it but i have to stop with that for england must not fall it would mean an inundation of russian and german political degradations which would envelop the globe and steep it in a sort of middleage night and slavery which would last till christ comes again even wrong and she is wrong england must be upheld he is an enemy of the human race who shall speak against her now why was the human race created or at least why wasnt something creditable created in place of it god had his opportunity he could have made a reputation but no he must commit this grotesque folly a lark which must have cost him a regret or two when he came to think it over and observe effects for a giddy and unbecoming caprice there has been nothing like it till this war i talk the war with both sides always waiting until the other man introduces the topic then i say my head is with the briton but my heart and such rags of morals as i have are with the boer now we will talk unembarrassed and without prejudice and so we discuss and have no trouble jan it was my intention to make some disparaging remarks about the human race and so i kept this letter open for that purpose and for the purpose of telling my dream wherein the trinity were trying to guess a conundrum but i can do better for i can snip out of the times various samples and sidelights which bring the race down to date and expose it as of yesterday if you will notice there is seldom a telegram in a paper which fails to show up one or more members and beneficiaries of our civilization as promenading in his shirttail with the rest of his regalia in the wash i love to see the holy ones air their smug pieties and admire them and smirk over them and at the same moment frankly and publicly show their contempt for the pieties of the boer confidently expecting the approval of the country and the pulpit and getting it i notice that god is on both sides in this war thus history repeats itself but i am the only person who has noticed this everybody here thinks he is playing the game for this side and for this side only with great love to you all mark one cannot help wondering what mark twain would have thought of human nature had he lived to see the great world war fought mainly by the christian nations who for nearly two thousand years had been preaching peace on earth and goodwill toward men but his opinion of the race could hardly have been worse than it was and nothing that human beings could do would have surprised him to rev j h twichell in hartford london jan dear joe apparently we are not proposing to set the filipinos free and give their islands to them and apparently we are not proposing to hang the priests and confiscate their property if these things are so the war out there has no interest for me i have just been examining chapter lxx of following the equator to see if the boers old military effectiveness is holding out it reads curiously as if it had been written about the present war i believe that in the next chapter my notion of the boer was rightly conceived he is popularly called uncivilized i do not know why happiness food shelter clothing wholesale labor modest and rational ambitions honesty kindliness hospitality love of freedom and limitless courage to fight for it composure and fortitude in time of disaster patience in time of hardship and privation absence of noise and brag in time of victory contentment with a humble and peaceful life void of insane excitements if there is a higher and better form of civilization than this i am not aware of it and do not know where to look for it i suppose we have the habit of imagining that a lot of artistic intellectual and other artificialities must be added or it isnt complete we and the english have these latter but as we lack the great bulk of these others i think the boer civilization is the best of the two my idea of our civilization is that it is a shabby poor thing and full of cruelties vanities arrogancies meannesses and hypocrisies as for the word i hate the sound of it for it conveys a lie and as for the thing itself i wish it was in hell where it belongs provided we could get something better in the place of it but that is not possible perhaps poor as it is it is better than real savagery therefore we must stand by it extend it and in public praise it and so we must not utter any hateful word about england in these days nor fail to hope that she will win in this war for her defeat and fall would be an irremediable disaster for the mangy human race naturally then i am for england but she is profoundly in the wrong joe and no instructed englishman doubts it at least that is my belief maybe i managed to make myself misunderstood as to the osteopathists i wanted to know how the men impress you as to their art i know fairly well about that and should not value hartfords opinion of it nor a physicians nor that of another who proposed to enlighten me out of his ignorance opinions based upon theory superstition and ignorance are not very precious livy and the others are off for the country for a day or two love to you all mark the next letter affords a pleasant variation without doubt it was written on realizing that good nature and enthusiasm had led him into indiscretion this was always happening to him and letters like this are not infrequent though generally less entertaining to mr ann in london wellington court feb dear mr ann upon sober second thought it wont do i withdraw that letter not because i said anything in it which is not true for i didnt but because when i allow my name to be used in forwarding a stockscheme i am assuming a certain degree of responsibility as toward the investor and i am not willing to do that i have another objection a purely selfish one trading upon my name whether the enterprise scored a success or a failure would damage me i cant afford that even the archbishop of canterbury couldnt afford it and he has more character to spare than i have ah a happy thought if he would sign the letter with me that would change the whole complexion of the thing of course i do not know him yet i would sign any commercial scheme that he would sign as he does not know me it follows that he would sign anything that i would sign this is unassailable logic but really that is all that can be said for it no i withdraw the letter this virgin is pure up to date and is going to remain so ys sincerely s l c to rev j h twichell in hartford wellington court knightsbridge mch dear joe henry robinsons death is a sharp wound to me and it goes very deep i had a strong affection for him and i think he had for me every friday threefourths of the year for years he was of the billiardparty in our house when we come home how shall we have billiardnights again with no ned bunce and no henry robinson i believe i could not endure that we must find another use for that room susy is gone george is gone libby hamersley ned bunce henry robinson the friends are passing one by one our house where such warm blood and such dear blood flowed so freely is become a cemetery but not in any repellent sense our dead are welcome there their life made it beautiful their death has hallowed it we shall have them with us always and there will be no parting it was a moving address you made over ward cheney that fortunate youth like susy he got out of life all that was worth the living and got his great reward before he had crossed the tropic frontier of dreams and entered the sahara of fact the deep consciousness of susys good fortune is a constant comfort to me london is happyhearted at last the british victories have swept the clouds away and there are no uncheerful faces for three months the private dinner parties we go to no public ones have been lodges of sorrow and just a little depressing sometimes but now they are smiley and animated again joe do you know the irish gentleman and the irish lady the scotch gentleman and the scotch lady these are darlings every one night before last it was all irish one would have to travel far to match their ease and sociability and animation and sparkle and absence of shyness and selfconsciousness it was american in these fine qualities this was at mr leckys he is irish you know last night it was irish again at lady gregorys lord roberts is irish and sir william butler and kitchener i think and a disproportion of the other prominent generals are of irish and scotch breedkeeping up the traditions of wellington and sir colin campbell of the mutiny you will have noticed that in s a as in the mutiny it is usually the irish and the scotch that are placed in the forefront of the battle an irish friend of mine says this is because the kelts are idealists and enthusiasts with ageold heroisms to emulate and keep bright before the world but that the lowclass englishman is dull and without ideals fighting bulldoggishly while he has a leader but losing his head and going to pieces when his leader falls not so with the kelt sir wm butler said the kelt is the spearhead of the british lance love to you all mark the henry robinson mentioned in the foregoing letter was henry c robinson onetime governor of connecticut long a dear and intimate friend of the clemens household lecky was w e h lecky the irish historian whose history of european morals had been for many years one of mark twains favorite books in july the clemenses left the small apartment at wellington court and established a summer household a little way out of london at dollis hill today the place has been given to the public under the name of gladstone park so called for the reason that in an earlier time gladstone had frequently visited there it was a beautiful spot a place of green grass and spreading oaks in a letter in which mrs clemens wrote to her sister she said it is simply divinely beautiful and peaceful the great old trees are beyond everything i believe nowhere in the world do you find such trees as in england clemens wrote to twichell from the house you can see little but spacious stretches of hayfields and green turf yet the massed brick blocks of london are reachable in three minutes on a horse by rail we can be in the heart of london in baker street in seventeen minutes by a smart train in five mail however would seem to have been less prompt to the editor of the times in london sir it has often been claimed that the london postal service was swifter than that of new york and i have always believed that the claim was justified but a doubt has lately sprung up in my mind i live eight miles from printing house square the times leaves that point at oclock in the morning by mail and reaches me at in the afternoon thus making the trip in thirteen hours it is my conviction that in new york we should do it in eleven c dollis hill n w to rev j h twichell in hartford dollis hill house kilburn n w london aug dear joe the sages prof fiske and brander matthews were out here to tea a week ago and it was a breath of american air to see them we furnished them a bright day and comfortable weather and they used it all up in their extravagant american way since then we have sat by coal fires evenings we shall sail for home sometime in october but shall winter in new york where we can have an osteopath of good repute to continue the work of putting this family in proper condition livy and i dined with the chief justice a month ago and he was as wellconditioned as an athlete it is all china now and my sympathies are with the chinese they have been villainously dealt with by the sceptred thieves of europe and i hope they will drive all the foreigners out and keep them out for good i only wish it of course i dont really expect it why hang it it occurs to me that by the time we reach new york you twichells will be invading europe and once more we shall miss the connection this is thoroughly exasperating arent we ever going to meet again with no end of love from all of us mark p s aug dear joe it is a m i have been waking very early lately if it occurs once more it will be habit then i will submit and adopt it this is our day of mourning it is four years since susy died it is five years and a month that i saw her alive for the last timethrowing kisses at us from the railway platform when we started west around the world sometimes it is a century sometimes it was yesterday with love mark we discover in the foregoing letter that the long european residence was drawing to an end more than nine years had passed since the closing of the hartford house eventful years that had seen failure bereavement battle with debt and rehabilitated fortunes all the family were anxious to get home mark twain most anxious of all they closed dollis hill house near the end of september and put up for a brief period at a family hotel an amusing picture of which follows to j y m macalister in london sep my dear macalister we do really start next saturday i meant to sail earlier but waited to finish some studies of what are called family hotels they are a london specialty god has not permitted them to exist elsewhere they are ramshackle clubs which were dwellings at the time of the heptarchy dover and albemarle streets are filled with them the once spacious rooms are split up into coops which afford as much discomfort as can be had anywhere out of jail for any money all the modern inconveniences are furnished and some that have been obsolete for a century the prices are astonishingly high for what you get the bedrooms are hospitals for incurable furniture i find it so in this one they exist upon a tradition they represent the vanishing homelike inn of fifty years ago and are mistaken by foreigners for it some quite respectable englishmen still frequent them through inherited habit and arrested development many americans also through ignorance and superstition the rooms are as interesting as the tower of london but older i think older and dearer the lift was a gift of william the conqueror some of the beds are prehistoric they represent geological periods mine is the oldest it is formed in strata of old red sandstone volcanic tufa ignis fatuus and bicarbonate of hornblende superimposed upon argillaceous shale and contains the prints of prehistoric man it is in no thousands of scientists come to see it they consider it holy they want to blast out the prints but cannot dynamite rebounds from it finished studies and sail saturday in minnehaha yours ever affectionately mark twain they sailed for new york october th and something more than a week later america gave them a royal welcome the press far and wide sounded mark twains praises once more dinners and receptions were offered on every hand editors and lecture agents clamored for him the family settled in the earlington hotel during a period of househunting they hoped eventually to return to hartford but after a brief visit paid by clemens alone to the old place he wrote to sylvester baxter in boston new york oct dear mr baxter it was a great pleasure to me to renew the other days with you and there was a pathetic pleasure in seeing hartford and the house again but i realize that if we ever enter the house again to live our hearts will break i am not sure that we shall ever be strong enough to endure that strain sincerely yours s l clemens mr and mrs rogers wished to have them in their neighborhood but the houses there were not suitable or were too expensive through mr frank doubleday they eventually found at west tenth street a large residence handsomely furnished and this they engaged for the winter we were lucky to get this big house furnished he wrote macalister in london there was not another one in town procurable that would answer us but this one is all right space enough in it for several families the rooms all oldfashioned great size the little note that follows shows that mark twain had not entirely forgotten the days of tom sawyer and huck finn to a neighbor on west tenth street new york nov dear madam i know i ought to respect my duty and perform it but i am weak and faithless where boys are concerned and i cant help secretly approving pretty bad and noisy ones though i do object to the kind that ring doorbells my family try to get me to stop the boys from holding conventions on the front steps but i basely shirk out of it because i think the boys enjoy it my wife has been complaining to me this evening about the boys on the front steps and under compulsion i have made some promises but i am very forgetful now that i am old and my sense of duty is getting spongy very truly yours s l clemens
