no escape the kgb kidnaps a top british spy and the lives of the leningrad cell are immediately endangered quiller is sent to get him out escaping from the lubyanka will be harder adam hall the scorpion signal shapiro i turned again wheeling into the wind with the edge of the cliff a hundred feet below me the air feathered against my face numbing it and tears crept back from the corners of my eyes drying on the skin a pale sun was turning the sea into hammered gold below on my right side and the waves were rolling in iceblue arcs hanging poised for an instant before they shattered along the shore it had been the twentieth turn id been counting them i was now half hypnotized by the sliding images of grass and cliff and sand and sea as they floated below my prone body and by the periods of nearweightlessness as the wind gusts dropped me into the troughs and lifted me out again a minute ago two gulls had come abreast of me and drifted alongside not far away their sharp heads turned to watch me as they wondered what i was inland i could see our three shadows gliding in perfect formation across the short brown grass of the cliff top two small ones and the third much bigger but still the shape of a bird not of a man by a degree however small i was taking on their character watching the land below and feeling the lie of the wind the muscles compensating as evolution worked on my humanoid body and adapted its behaviour to the needs of a bird i broke the next turn at ninety degrees and went downwind across the edge of the cliff to try out the air on the lee side for a moment the car was directly below me and i saw norton again standing near it and gazing up another car was pulling in rather fast from the cliff road and bouncing over the grass but i lost sight of it as the sail hit some turbulence i worked on the bar tilting it back to gain speed and pulling the nose up to get some more height then i veered into the wind and crossed the cliff again turning to drift parallel with it after the next turn i saw the other car had pulled up alongside nortons mg there were a couple of men in dark uniforms and norton started waving to me with wide urgent gestures i checked the sail and rigging but couldnt see anything wrong i didnt expect to i had a rough idea of what had come up at the end of the run i turned and moved inland again all three of them were waving to me with flailing downward motions putting a lot of expression into it i could now see the white letters on the back of the second car i didnt like it any of it because id been on leave only two weeks and my nerves were still trying to shake themselves out i made three more runs trying to forget about them but they began using the horns at me and a siren wailed into life and died again they were still waving so i compromised i think i could have got enough height to come in and land on the grass and ask them what the hell they wanted but i gave myself a final fling and put the nose down and swooped over their heads in a long arrowing dive across the cliff and the beach and the sea wheeling against the beaten gold reflection and moving into wind again lowering the trailing edge fluttering near stalling point a few feet above the ground then i put the nose down and ran in with my feet ploughing up the sand as i got the last of the wind out of the sail i was still dismantling when norton came sprinting along from the cliff path to help me london he said im frozen stiff i told him look after this will you i left him and ran hard for a mile as far as the pier and back feeling better because id worked a bit of the frustration out there was absolutely no point in getting annoyed just because hed mentioned london they couldnt send me out again not this soon police escort norton said as he strapped the spars together not my fault all i need i said is a phone and the best of luck oh for christs sake shut up i hated panic and a police escort meant someone in london was panicking it was ten minutes before we got the kite up the steps in the cliff the two cops helped us stow it on the rack of nortons mg asking a lot of silly questions what did it feel like wasnt it dangerous so forth they followed us to the hotel and i used the telephone and talked to three people one of them tilson then i put the phone down and came back to the lobby and told norton you werent joking he puffed out his cheeks are you taking your car yes ill need it to come back in tomorrow he didnt make any comment the two cops were looking at us from the entrance doors and one of them called out we were told to get a move on its up to you i went over to the desk to pay my bill give me a lift norton asked me where to i was thinking of helena london i turned and looked at him do they want you too they might i suppose he could have gone over to the telephone booth by the doors while i was calling london the first line id tried had been engaged maybe theyd told him to make sure i got there look i told the cashier theres a helena swinburn meeting me here in an hour from now give her this message and get the florist to bring round some gardenias if not orchids if not carnations all right add twentyfive to the card to cover it and im leaving my bags in the room he was making notes youll be keeping the room then sir yes ill be back tomorrow some time i could hear norton whistling under his breath hed caught some of the panic from london when hed phoned typical admin reaction i went over to the cops whats the form you follow us if you cant keep up just give a toot bloody cheek i said and went out to look for the jag in the next ten minutes we cleared all the red lights in the town with the siren and flashers going and settled down into the nineties as soon as we got on to the motorway north reaching mitcham in seventy minutes flat chopper norton said he hadnt spoken before id been watching it the patrol car was slowing hard in front of us and taking us across the common pulling up close to the spot where the helicopter was touching down on skis it was a police machine with the coatofarms of the royal borough of westminster on the side i suppose they hadnt been able to get the sussex constabulary to fly us in from the coast everyone had obviously been playing about with the radio and i began feeling depressed because this was fullyalert procedure and i was meant to be on leave the door slid back and a voice came above the sound of the blades no baggage no hop in nortons foot slipped on the metal rung of the step as he swung up watch it they slammed the door and gunned up and lifted of with the first of the neon street lights falling away below norton was still untalkative he sat puffing his cheeks out trying to get rid of the tension hed been with the bureau nearly as long as i had and he knew the signs this wasnt a mission they wanted me for someone had blown a fuse and the whole network had gone out of whack it had happened twice before during my time once when fraser had been pulling a polish intelligence colonel across the frontier at szczecin and the checkpoint had shut down on them and once when theyd hauled me out of tokyo to look for some nerve gas some bloody fool had dropped all over the sahara whatever they wanted me for this time it was no go london was coming up a haze of light from horizon id horizon under the late january fog norton was rubbing his hands together though it wasnt cold in the cabin i felt sorry for him with all that adrenalin sloshing about before wed even started never mind i said above the beat of the rotors its probably some bloody fool in signals getting his homework wrong oh shit he said and swung to face me and i realized hed been startled out of his thoughts by the sound of my voice i began wondering if he knew something that i didnt something about the panic going on where are you putting us down i asked the pilot battersea heliport all right its your toy we were lowering now with the city lights swarming to meet us you from the yard are you sir thats right we never mind what they think we are a signal was coming through and the navigator leaned towards me the glow of the instrument panel on his face they want to know if our people can take your jag to sloane street for you theyre off their beat already can you do that easy he talked into the headset and signalled out well i asked him did you arrange it yes sir he could have told me nerves there was a bump and we keeledeven under slowing rotors while norton hit his seatbelt open and went down first and stood on the landing pad waiting to help me if i slipped on the rungs bloody little nursemaid theyd given him instructions to bopeep me all the way home much obliged i he called through the doorway and pulled his collar up against the icy draught we jogged across to the door of the building as the rotors sped up and sent a gust of exhaust gas against our backs theyd got their liaison worked out there was a squad car waiting at the kerb when we went out through the front norton showed his card and they snapped the rear door open and got the flashers going the moment we turned out into the traffic stream using the siren once or twice to get us some headway norton still didnt talk and by this time i didnt want him to we tumbled out of the car across the slush of a recent thaw and slipped through the narrow doorway halfway down whitehall and hit the lift button and waited not looking at each other dirty water seeped from our shoes under the bleak security lights as i thought of helena and wondered if id ever see her again tilson met us as we got out of the lift my dear fellow he said and held out his warm dry hand long time no see two weeks thats not long norton had gone quietly rushing off along the corridor i suppose hed been told to report somewhere the moment we got in i know what you mean tilson said with a slow blink he was trying hard to look amiable and comforting since it was his role in life but tonight he couldnt manage it he just looked frightened to death right at the back of his eyes what about a spot of tea what the hell are you talking about weve got a few minutes you see he guided me gently along the corridor as far as the caff were not quite set up for you yet look tilson just give me a clue will you its not really for me to say old horse he shuffled across the room in his carpet slippers to a corner table one of the few left maggie saw us and came over and mopped up some spilled tea and when shed gone again he said with his lips hardly moving theyve sent for mr croder hes on his way in from rome croder he shouldnt be long i shut up for a minute croder was chief of the base directorate and handled the ultrasensitive operations and had a mortality rate for foreign actions higher than the rest of them put together not because he wasnt brilliant but because he took on risks that most of the others shied at id never worked for him not even on the sahara thing i didnt want to i listened to jessop and wallis sitting at the next table but they werent talking about the job jessop had bought a piper three weeks ago and took one of his girlfriends for a joyride and wrapped the thing round a power pylon and got away with it except that she was suing him for five hundred thousand pounds for a new face before she could model again i listened to some people talking on the other side but couldnt pick anything up i was desperate for clues because i knew i wouldnt get any from tilson he was just here to make sure i didnt get away tilson i said evenly ive been on leave exactly two weeks and im due for eight and im not coming in yet okay no mission nix niet ninguno are you receiving me he looked vaguely at the wall i dont think theres a mission on the board old fruit not officially the tea came and he began spooning sugar into it he hadnt looked at me since hed met me outside the lift and that wasnt like him hes always been cagey but not this bad what about unofficially i asked him nothing ever happens in this place he turned his bland pink face to me for the first time unofficially i held on hard i just want a clue tilson why has everyone started tearing up the peapatch he began sipping his tea it was too hot but he was just making a gesture and trying not to look scared youll have to be a bit patient old horse he gave a wintry smile not quite your forte i know orourke was coming towards us between the tables his hands dug into the pockets of his mack and pulling it tight round his thighs so he wouldnt knock anyones tea over i thought he was coming to talk to tilson but he dumped himself down between jessop and wallis at the next table i heard him quite clearly theyve lost shapiro he told them and i saw jessop going slowly white and in a couple of seconds he got up and went out bumping into a table on his way and not noticing dead i asked orourke he looked up what did they find him dead who shapiro i dont know who found him i dont know i shut up tilson wasnt looking at either of us he was just listening with his face down over his tea orourke didnt know anything nobody in this place knows anything because thats the official policy the staff has to have an overall view of operations but theres always a handful of field executives hanging around between missions or waiting to be sent out and the less we know of whats going on the less we can tell the opposition if we make a mistake out there and they pull us in and throw us under the bright white light and keep us there till it burns through to the brain while theyre asking us questions you did a bit of work tilson said conversationally with shapiro didnt you a couple of times cyprus tenerife he nodded and looked down and drank some more tea while i sat there trying not to think about shapiro trying not to remember him too well there wasnt anything definite about that bit of news id just overheard he could still be alive and if he wasnt there was nothing i could do about it we come and go i wonder if i can find anyone tilson said plaintively to look after you until mr croder shows up i dont like your having to hang about like this he got up and wandered off and i noticed his tea wasnt finished he just wanted to get me away from wallis and orourke before i overheard anything else that suited me the more we hear up and down these bleak greenpainted corridors the more we become involved the more we become exposed we dont want that to happen the bureau doesnt exist so we dont exist either if were wise its less painful like that and infinitely less dangerous it was nearly nine in the evening before tilson came and got me out of monitoring where id been passing the time listening to a lot of flak from one of our cells in africa which was trying to pull itself out of the general bush fire that had gone up after the kibombo massacre talk to you tilson asked from the doorway for a jiff it was terribly low key and i started worrying again he took me along the corridor with our footsteps echoing from the high arched ceiling theres still no carpeting in this bloody place they say the parquets got woodworm in it and they have to keep a watch on it weve got mr croder for you tilson told me and hustled me into signals from that moment i began going cold we can always refuse a mission and we dont have to give our reasons some of the operations look strictly shutended during the planning stage and we reserve the right to go on living if we think the risk is too high but we cant refuse to listen to a director if hes got something for us to do and sometimes hell prick our conscience or our pride and lever us into a tricky one before we know whats happening my nerves were still out of condition from the last operation although youd think wed get over it one day and learn to live with it maybe some of them have but i havent yet and its getting late there were only four people manning the room tonight two of them handling separate missions at the main console with the code names flashpoint and banjo on the boards above their heads and two others waiting for us at the unit nearer the door where is he i asked tilson mr croder hes in geneva he was flying from rome the last never mind tilson said amiably and looked at the big international clock hes coming through on the hour one of the operators said using the booster at lausanne would you like to sit down no they waited quietly with their hands on their tops and the light of the panel on their faces ill need a shield a sharp voice came from the main console but youll have to hurry it sounded like symes but i didnt think theyd use him for an asian job both missions were designated far east alongside the code names and he was a latincountry specialist you could smell the garlic the minute he came in for debriefing the operator flicked the switch for direct contact with the base director and started talking but i didnt hear the rest because a light started winking on our unit and the man with the chewinggum opened the signal and set to scramble and clarify aalpha channel clarifying we waited the light went on winking croder there was a long pause the weathers closing down everywhere and the london flight was laid off his voice was thin and precise the scrambler giving it a metallic echo have you brought quiller in yes sir the operator slipped out of the padded chair and motioned me to take it i sat down this is quiller ah yes a couple of seconds went by you were on leave i understand i still am there was a much longer pause yes i am on leave too but i want you to listen very carefully i dont think i can reach london with any immediate predictability since a lot of flights are either being cancelled or diverted but i can reach berlin before midnight according to current reports i would like you to meet me there as soon as you can get a plane in a moment i said look im still on leave and i need to relax its too soon i felt tilson move an inch beside me i understand that the thin precise voice came from the speaker but something rather exceptional has happened and weve got to deal with it as soon as we can or if you prefer ive got to deal with it i was rather hoping youd agree to help me but what can i say you are on leave the silence was so long that i thought hed gone off the air again like some kind of ghost fading and reappearing i was very cold now and sat with my hands folded into my arms and my neck hunched into my coat there was something weird about this whole thing croder was sitting on some sort of time bomb and he was having to use an awful lot of control in the way he handled me he wasnt used to that finally i couldnt stand the silence any more is it a mission i asked him it is a rescue mission we have to get someone out i waited for more but hed stopped i didnt ask him out of where because that didnt make a lot of difference he meant out of trouble the air in the room seemed to shiver suddenly as the sharp voice came from the main console across from us i tell you we cant hope to go in without a shield tilson moved again beside me unnerved hes normally a stoic type and can keep as still as a lizard for hours i said to croder why cant someone else do it he came back a little faster this time of those people available i think you stand the best chance if theres a chance at all im not available listen i came off the last thing two weeks ago didnt anyone tell you that two weeks my voice had risen a fraction and i didnt like that but it might give him a clue as to the condition i was in i know that yes he paused again you did rather well i left that one every word he said was a baited hook a very great deal depends you see on whether we can do anything for this man it touches all of us he was being asspecific as he could on the air it was no use asking him to spell anything out he couldnt he was trying to get me to read between the lines and i wasnt interested i didnt want to know the operator with the chewinggum was on my other side opposite tilson and i swung my head up would you go and spit that bloody stuff out for christs sake i cant stand the smell my hands were frozen i was afraid of what croder was going finally to make me do by pricking my conscience or my pride i listened to the rain beating at the row of narrow sooty windows and wondered who the poor bastard was and where we have to get someone out he couldnt be done for yet he was lying on a rooftop somewhere in the pouring rain with the patrol lights sweeping the streets waiting till he bad to show himself or hunched between rocks in a frontier zone like a wild dog with a broken leg and no hope of food or shelter or mercy when they found him or sitting in a basement propped in an upright chair with the bright light probing into his eyes till he couldnt see them any more could only hear what they were asking him feel what they were doing when he didnt answer it touches all of us the man with the chewinggum had moved away but i could still smell the stuff like toothpaste i spoke into the console is it shapiro tilson moved again yes croder said i could tell by his tone that i wasnt meant to know i wanted to say well what about orourke and wallis and jessop shouting the bloody odds all over the caff down there security stank in this place always did half the staff trying to keep the lid on things and the other half yelling their heads off shapiro a small quiet man with sharp pointed ears and a passion for chess and a girl in brighton and a scar the length of his forearm where the knife had got him before i could throw the rest of them off and reach him in time glass all over the place from the explosion and the sirens coming in tenerife with a full moon and the night temperature still in me nineties and rosita sobbing her heart out in a bar at the end of the jetty because theyd got templer nothing we could do ill take this one hed told me the night before they know you but they dont know me but it was just that hed been frightened and wanted to prove that he wasnt weve get a few things in common so he wasnt dead what theatre i asked croder europe that was all id get there wasnt anything more i could ask him he could have switched to selective code but he obviously wasnt prepared to in a couple of seconds he said you know him quite well i understand shapiro not too well but i know him the bloody thing had been ticking all the time and hed stock looking at it with his small gnomes head on one side the best thingd be to disarm it dont you think take it apart before it can do any harm hed worked at it for nearly three hours without a break his pale grey eyes wide open staring at god all the time while his nicotinestained fingers stroked and caressed the mattblack metal components and the sweat ran off his face and dripped on to the bare boards where i sat waiting hunched into my own ghost and unable to look away i think thats it hed said at last and pulled the detonator dear and reached for a cigarette and put it into his mouth with fingers that shook so badly now that he knocked the flame out and i had to strike another match for him shapiro say this much he was a professional you know his work at least croders voice came insistently yes what would be your opinion of him in slow and reasonable tones as an executive in the field i felt tilson listening beside me i thought of lying then realized i didnt have to in the end i could refuse i could refuse repeat it like a litany i could refuse first class quite so you wouldnt croder said with a certain silkiness consider him expendable like a dog with a broken leg no stonewall the bastard dont give him any rope all i would ask is that you would at least meet me in berlin so that i can give you the details three seconds four that is all i would ask for him the lights glowed on the console i could hear the voice of the man in the field coming faintly across the room where they were running flashpoint tilson hadnt moved the smell of peppermint had gone now or i was getting used to it i leaned forward towards the console so that croder would hear me clearly and know by my tone that i meant what i said im on leave i havent got my nerve back yet it was dose to the crunch that time and im lucky to be here so youll have to find someone else because i refuse i got out of the chair and went past tilson without looking at him and opened the door and threw it shut behind me and walked down the greenpainted corridor to the lift and pressed the button for down it was a deluge outside and there was a traffic block near hyde park corner and i sat waiting for fifteen minutes before i took the phone off the dip and got tilson and told him i wanted a police car to get me out of this mess and i wanted a flight to berlin the first he could find for me and tell croder tempelhof blinding sleet and the runway lights floating up from the dark as the wheels hit and we bounced and they hit again and we bounced again with the airframe shuddering was zum teufel macht der pilot a few uneasy laughs but at least we were down bitte behdten sie ihren sicherheitsgurtel an a fat man sat leaning forward with his face white and his head down i hoped hed found the bag sleet washed past the windows in a bow wave mon dieu il est impossible meme de voir la tour dobser esperons que nous nallons pas senfoncer centre elle reverse thrust and we sat feeling the drag are you all right audrey someone asked sort of a breathless giggle then she lit a cigarette and blew out a noisy sigh in the rear of the plane a child had started crying tempelhof was packed excuse me but do you know where the information desk is in the middle of that crowd over there i said and she went hurrying off trailing a flight bag with a broken strap there were puddles everywhere with people bringing slush in from the front of the building haben sie etioas zu deklarieren gar nichts keine rauchwaren kein alkohol nein he didnt bloody well believe me went right through my bag we were meant to land at tegel a man with an astrakhan coat said to me but there was too much stuff in the circuit i wondered if hed got any other useless information in the main hall people were milling around looking for friends children baggage a porter to help them out of the chaos three north africans carrying skis edged their way through the crowd clouting people every time they turned round to look for what theyd lost entschuldigen sie sind sie herr wolsteffer nein i told him a party of chinese trotted past towards the main exit their leader waving a little red flag to guide them pardon monsieur vous etes de paris non mademoiselle cest le vol de londres she went across to the information desk pretty legs not a very nice evening not very i said what sort of flight bloody awful we started walking looking for somewhere we could talk been waiting long half an hour he said did what i could london was a mess lets go over there croder said all right there was a lot of water on the floor below one of the big windows which had sprung a leak and we stood there with our backs to the dark glass watching the people near us i didnt know whether hed got here without any tags on him as a rule the london directors arent too good i the field he stood with his hands in the pockets of the big military coat he was wearing its buttons plain now and the marks still showing where the insignia had been taken off it looked too big for him he was a slight man thinboned and pallid with a head like a skull and the hands of a skeleton and only the eyes alive brooding in his face as if they were trapped there under the taut parched skin their black luminescence shadowed by heavy lids he hadnt looked at me good of you to come he said formally i was surprised when they said youd changed your mind so was i he made a smile with his small teeth like a rat nibbling we nearly missed each other they had to get back to me through interpol it was a reprimand wheres shapiro i asked him he didnt answer for a moment there was a lot of noise from a bunch of people over by the doors and croder gazed at them steadily east germans he said they were going into schoenefeld but an engine was out so they came into tempelhof instead his small teeth made a token smile half of them are demanding asylum wouldnt you we dont know where shapiro is he said without looking away from the coup his cover name is schrenk forget shapiro schrenk he spelt it for me he was in moscow for two months working very well then they uncovered him and put him through interrogation in lubyanka then he escaped for the first time he turned and looked at me with his black contemplative eyes and i thought christ almighty only shapiro could have got out of lubyanka by the midnight express only schrenk he got as far as west germany croder said and we had him put straight into a clinic i dont chink he would have made it as far as london he was in a pretty bad way were you running him i didnt think hed answer that he looked back at the group of east germans it doesnt natter who was running him he was in the clinic for nearly three months and recovering steadily they were going to discharge him before long as soon as he was fit enough to stand up to debriefing but the k got him again and one report says hes back in lubyanka there was a chill coming into the air i felt it against my skin possibly the sweat was starting to creep setting up refrigeration i have never been inside lubyanka but ive talked to people who have there arent many of them at liberty north had got back from there the night he blew his brains out at connies place croder was gazing across the hall in silence and i asked him whats our timing on this theres a flight for hanover in forty minutes and theres a seat booked for you in case i want one he ignored that schrenk carried a capsule it was part of the contract on that particular mission obviously he didnt use it he turned away from the group of people and stood facing me hunched into his big coat and saying with muted force he would have saved us an immense amount of trouble if he had used it an immense amount of trouble he waited for the message to sink in because what we have on our hands now is a potential disaster unless we can somehow prevent it schrenk prided himself on his ability to survive the most gruelling interrogation by the use of practised and convincing disinformation he had three or four different scenarios worked out and he rehearsed them every day of his life in series we know that we had him tested at norfolk a year ago and even hypnosis couldnt break him down because hed used autohypnosis himself to move his scenarios down into the subconscious that is the kind of man he is the heavy lids were lowered for a moment but norfolk isnt lubyanka we do not know you see how bad the position is because we dont know how much he gave away he withdrew into himself again staring at nothing or maybe at schrenks insubstantial image lost somewhere in the wastes of soviet russia the sleet outside was turning to water on the window and the light from the tall gooseneck lamps threw its translucent delineations against his face so that his skin crept with rivulets what has he got i asked him to give away im sorry he swung to look at me you said you dont know how much he gave away you mean something specific his sharp teeth bit at the air again yes the leningrad cell mother of god this was why norton had been showing his nerves today and why tilson had looked scared behind the eyes the leningrad cell had taken eleven years to build up and once established and running it had given us the shotokof project and the submarine dispersal pattern and the tactical analysis for the buriedweapons system for transmission to nato and the cia plus satellite scanning plus laser progress in the militaryapplication laboratories plus the whole of the missiletesting programme including the ultraclassified globalrange icbms from x to the cityheat guidance marathon l that was the leningrad cell but he couldnt have known i said hopelessly much about it he worked there for two years before he was seconded to ac fieldexecutive branch he knows everything about it i didnt understand but who could have let him that is not your concern spittle came against his lower lip and in a moment he licked it away and said more slowly for your information it wasnt i i let it go someone had blundered and disastrously because once youre with a cell you stay there till your times up you dont go anywhere else and you dont get seconded to the fieldexecutive pool because you know too much of value and they wont risk sending you into the field where the opposition can pick you up and drag you in and take your brain apart but someone had done that with schrenk your only concern croder said with a lot of control is to find him and pull him out if indeed youre prepared to do that for us the need for control worried me because this man was known for his cool and hed lost it and in front of the executive he was desperate to recruit my nerves were jumping again you would receive intensive support i need hardly say in moscow right in the target area wherever that may be cutouts backups shields no shields he shrugged you may be glad i said no shields my own control wasnt too good and i waited and counted three i make my own decisions and my own mistakes and i wont involve anyone else shields were dangerous they could get in your way and when the crunch came theyd save themselves not you what about the director in the field if the timings that close you cant bracken he said brackens in singapore we called him in he moved his eyes to the clock over the information desk he is at present airborne with bag arriving moscow at noon tomorrow local time he waited ive never worked with him hes first class you know that he directed fenton in cairo last year he got matthews out of pekin first class there were thirty minutes left on the clock and i thought of something else when did you find out schrenk was back in moscow early this morning then you havent had time to set it up im not it was ready to run before i called base from geneva you have a director a safehouse contacts sleepers signal availability and embassy liaison his thin mouth was contemptuous what more do you want for gods sake access im on their files and id never get through the airport you have access by road into east germany overt of course not what are you talking about a bloody farm cart or something a dosed truck will take you across the frontier at zellerfeld in the harz mountains with no questions asked he was blocking me every time i was his last hope i knew that now hed tried half a dozen other people and drawn blank because this was a suicide trip and he didnt pretend it was anything else what about access into moscow by commercial airline aeroflot we have a seat for you on the morning flight from leipzig where the truck will drop you its perfectly straightforward i took a slow breath cover transit papers east german national it was beginning to sound like a trap and i stopped thinking about it for a minute watching the people in the group by the main doors a man was shouting his head off now and so was his wife he wanted asylum but his wife said it would mean leaving her mother behind and the secret police would take reprisals a younger man possibly their son was trying to make them shut up two more policemen were marching towards them unbuttoning their holsters to make an effect a crowd was collecting fluggaste fur plug nummer fur hannover kommen sie bitte sofort zum eingang nummer i looked at the clock is that the flight you booked for me i asked croder yes then theres no time for briefing youll be briefed on the access in hanover and fully briefed in moscow by bracken yes whos our man in hanover hes an agentinplace i want to know who he is all you want croder said with his mouth tight is just one good reason for getting the next plane back to london with whats left of your conscience and the problem is that you wont find one because weve been hard at it setting the whole thing up and it works it really does the odds of course he said without looking away from my face are not in your favour and id quite understand it if you didnt fed up to the task your nerves as you say are still my nerves are my business a lot of heat came out and his black eyes flickered you know bloody well youve got me hooked or i wouldnt be here in this stinking hole would i control get control its just that i want but the anger ran out and we stood facing each other without another word while the shadows of the rain crept down his neongrey face and his eyes looked into mine and waited to know whether i would do the job that had to be done or whether i was too old at last for this game or too scared when i was ready i said who else did you ask i told you before i went straight for you his eyes went on waiting i only had one more question and it was difficult because i thought i knew what hed say what hed have to say what happens if i find him but cant get him out he didnt hesitate that would make things easier for you all we want is his silence jump it had been snowing in hanover the roofs were white with it under a full moon when we touched down he was wailing on the other side of the gate a short man with a deerstalker hat and a long green woollen scarf wound several times round his neck he was rubbing his hands and blowing into them watching me as i came through from the office he asked me who are you floderus have you got any baggage no ok ive got a car here he led the way with short energetic steps his hands in his coat pockets now i want to see the clinic i said when we got outside did he tell you yes i only just caught the doc there hes off on vacation first thing in the morning we got into the mercedes it was the only condition id made to croder i wanted to know everything i could about schrenk if i were going to do anything for him what was it like in london floderus asked pissing down i shouldve known he got off the autobahn at the hanoverherrenhausen exit and drove south on route as far as the river are you expecting any problems i asked him what no he did it again why fond of the minor oh habit i supposed he could have been in from the field sleepers and aips arent normally so nervous whats this mans name asked him what man the doctor oh steinberg along dorfstrasse he turned right and began slowing the clinic was just after the church a long white building with a board with gold fetters floderus pulled up steinberg opened the door to us himself tall stooping wrapped in a dressinggown with cigarette bums on it a man who worked too late he took us straight into a consultingroom and i let floderus stay we spoke in german you wish to know about your patient here i understand yes i want to know his state of mind he considered this staring at the top of his desk through thick round glasses i know nothing at all about his present state of mind of course he was abducted in violent fashion and that would have induced further shock i have no means of knowing what has happened to him since in terms of his state of mind what was he like just before the abduction he lit a cigarette and squinted through the smoke at that time he was quite alert quite normal the nightmares had stopped and he did very well in tests still rather bitter towards those people understandably we felt he bitter he glanced up quickly he harboured a grudge against them dont you feel that was understandable herr matthofer i suppose so i said it was as far as i could go he didnt know who we were but something was odd we dont harbour grudges against the opposition whatever they do to us theres nothing personal its dog eat dog i didnt see why schrenk should have been bitter he put up quite a struggle the doctor said the place was in a mess with blood on the carpet and some glass from a broken syringe one of my staff ran into the street after them but they didnt stop you called the police immediately we are not used to that sort of affair in my clinic it was very disturbing what did they do to him they took him away he looked at me quizzically i told you they i mean before before he was brought here ah that he screwed his face against the smoke and pulled a drawer open putting a thick file on to the desk and opening it i have had some experience with these things you understand i am a member of amnesty international and the world medical association we study these phenomena i looked at my watch and he noticed but didnt hurry floderus sat snuffling in his handkerchief we questioned the patient and his answers were consistent with the trauma we noted on his body he studied the file he was subjected to the wet canvas treatment do you know what that is yes but they wouldnt have started off with that one they risk losing you that way because panic sets in they used falanga and we found extensive ecchymoses and edema with some degree of irreversible ischemic changes in the intermetatarsal areas of the foot there were what was he walking like before they took him away his feet were still rather painful he tended to hobble all right what else he looked at the file again he said they had suspended him from the arms for prolonged periods but we found no evidence of cervical dislocations we took xrays of course he could use his arms perfectly well after about eight weeks we found hematuria and some bleeding from the ears but again we were able to treat these symptoms successfully this kind of thing is found extensively in chile by the way and uruguay youll find it everywhere i said i heard floderus swallowing saliva so we are beginning to discover steinberg nodded and dropped ash on to his dressinggown there was in herr schrenks case local infiltration of anaesthetics into the eyelids floderus was leaning forward what for he asked the doctor i beg your pardon so that he couldnt shut his eyes i told him against the light i wished i hadnt let him stay he was getting on my nerves did they use drugs i asked steinberg he described certain phases of mental disorientarion including hallucination but of no great significance it might have been induced by reaction to the physical trauma if they used drugs they may have used thiopental or one of the amphetamines he exhibited no lasting evidence of this he dosed the file and put it in the drawer can you tell me anything else he drew on his cigarette leaving a shred of tobacco on his up i think that is all i can give you as to his present state of mind it depends upon how they have treated him since they took him away he spread his thick white hands we can only hope that by some good fortune did he tell you hed revealed any information i heard nothing about that would you have heard it would be in the records taped records we record conversations with patients yes it is routine an essential part of the therapy can i hear some of the tapes that is quite out of the question such matters are strictly confidential we did he mention any names names of people in moscow i cannot say it would be in the records he began fidgeting with a penholder did he scream any names in his nightmares herr matthofer i am not at liberty to did he make any threats of what nature any nature any threats against anyone at all i got up and walked past his desk to the window and back you said he was bitter and bore a grudge against whom there was nothing specific he stubbed out his cigarette annoyed by the way things were going he was the top kick in this place and hed found me on the doorstep washed up by the night you mean he was bitter in general what made you think he bore someone a grudge he stood up and came from behind his desk drawing the dressinggown around him surely you can understand that a man in his condition should bear a grudge against those responsible for it or did you just expect him to feel like that it was important and he didnt realize it and i couldnt explain you will have to excuse me herr matthofer i agreed to receiving you in the middle of the night in order to discuss this patients case for a few minutes but not to submit to an interrogation i am leaving hanover at nine oclock and i need some sleep he jerked the chain of the desk lamp and went over to the door floderus got up i asked steinberg did the police find any clues not to my knowledge they came here to ask questions but of course did anyone see the car these people used no they did not i would have been told now i will say good night gentlemen he opened the front door for us floderus started blowing into his hands again the minute we were in the street havent you got any gloves for gods sake i asked him i lost them he said irritably havent you got any others why was it so important he asked me about schrenk being bitter he swung the mercedes in full turn and headed north by the river its right out of character what times our rendezvous at zellerfeld he should be there by now why so early i didnt know you wanted to see steinberg first couldnt you signal him look he said were all doing our best ok he got on to the autobahn at hanoverflughafen and drove east moving into the eighties before turning south at the cloverleaf with the hildesheim sign coming up your stuffs in the glove pocket if you want to start looking it over i found the thick envelope it had the single word scorpion written in pencil at the top left corner where else did they take him i asked floderus as i pulled out the papers apart from lubyanka we think he was at the serbsky institute of forensic psychiatry in moscow and the mental hospital in chernyakhovsk londons still checking with our people in moscow and youll be briefed when you get there is that all you know im just contact and relay sorry i checked the stuff over transit cover in the name of hans matthofer east german representative for plastichen farben visa and travel permit moscow only record of previous visits stated purpose of present visit advance hotel booking and proposed itinerary currency vouchers a batch of sheets in a file with photographs of plastic moulding and three letters of introduction one of them to the ministry of labour my photograph was recognizable with fur hat have you got any clothes for me in the back coat hat furlined boots and gloves its twenty below in moskers rather you than me we drove for two hours through hildesheim and over roads covered with snow when we reached the mountains while i bought of croder and schrenk and steinberg and tried to think why schrenk should feel bitter about what theyd done so him it didnt fit in with the pattern and i kept on worrying it because these are the little things that can take you of coarse if youre not watching id done two missions with schrenk and in two missions you learn a lot about a man schrenk knew the score all the way along the line and he wouldnt bear a grudge against the kgb any more than hed bear a grudge against a snake that had bitten him because heres nothing personal about these things floderus was slowing and i tore off the top left corner of the envelope and put the papers back where are we the other side of zellerfeld i made a loop he drove slowly sot another half mile and pulled up on a snowcovered patch alongside the road dousing the headlamps the moonlight brightened gradually is this the place yes where is he he should be here whats the landmark that sign over there einbeck i began worrying how far is it to the checkpoint four kilometres he began blowing into his hands and i reached over to the back seat and rummaged about and found c gloves and dropped them on to his lap for christs sake put these on youll need them when put them on till then a slight break in the tone inadmisable in the prejump phase but my nerves were only just under the surface and small things were picking at them because this is the phase when youre stone cold and your mind is clear and you know youre putting your life on the line and you know youve done it before and got away with it but this time its different and youre scared again and swallowing and alert to the signs and portents that are suddenly in every sound and every shadow till you cant stand a man blowing into his hands because the repetition drives you up the wall not good not at all propitious better to get to a telephone and pull tilson out of bed and tell him to find croder tell him i was right im not ready hell have to get someone else gunther what his names gunther said floderus again the man with the truck i wound the window down and listened the air was perfectly still and the snow had brought its own peculiar silence a jet was moving at altitude lost in the brightness of the moon its thin whine threading the night i could hear other sounds distant and muffled by the terrain dogs what yes at the checkpoint where else nowhere else in this area i dont like dogs you want a gun what for he looked at me in the pale light sniffing a drip off his nose for the mission no is this meant to be clearance sort of i wanted to laugh clearance and briefing normally takes hours and you see a dozen people and sign a dozen forms and make half a dozen declarations because thats all thats going to be left of you if you muck it up out there a record of what you were it makes you feel youre important to somebody if only to the computer clerks but this trip i was being kicked across the frontier by a junior aip with a drip on his nose and only just enough control over himself to keep him from telling me i shouldnt have got him out of bed in the first place youd better sign this he sniffed again and got out a crumpled handkerchief taking off one of my gloves to use it that your own code i looked at the form my own what five hundred roses for moira i didnt want to talk about that so i got a pen and signed the form no nextofkin no dependants nothing saved up to give to anyone just enough for the roses what was she doing now when did she last think of me where the hell is that man gunther floderus looked at his watch in the moonlight hell be here he put the glove back on how bigs the truck its a tentonner whats it carrying you come on for christs sake i want briefing he jerked back and stared at me i want to know what else that trucks carrying and where its going and why hes got a free run across e frontier i want information is that too much to ask he pulled himself round on his seat and said a bit shakily look i havent been told all that much youre being briefed in moscow they said all im here for is information dont you know what it means about the truck oh well he gave a long riffling sniff its taking luxury pods across for the black market in leipzig a regular run scotch and perfume and american goods jazz records and cassettes and stuff like who runs this the party if you want to go right to the top its for them and their wives the same thing that goes on in moscow they how often does this truck go across about every month it varies just the driver no one with him no he is he russian east german west german hes from hamburg has he ever been turned back only once he only once he caught his breath and said in a moment there was a new guard commander and he wasnt tipped off he was changed again i didnt want to know any more this was russian roulette theyd got me playing either wed get across the frontier or we wouldnt either id find schrenk or i wouldnt all i could do was to stop thinking and let the strain off and leave it to croder and try to believe he knew what he was doing i shut my eyes for a while until i heard the faint clinking of snow chains and the throb of a diesel engine there was light flushing across the road behind us is this gunther yes he said hed how do you know its not someone else there shouldnt be anyone else up here this time of night shouldnt jesus christ i wished ferris were here or someone who didnt leave everything to chance its okay floderus said hes flashing us what sort of terrain is there i asked him wearily between here and the checkpoint what oh just rocks and a few trees why doesnt he just give a blast on the horns he stared at me theyd hear it from the frontier some kind of laughter came out of me maybe panic in disguise the truck came alongside and i waited for floderus to check the driver before i got out and opened the rear door of the car and changed coats and put on the fur hat at least london had got this much right pulling the tailor out of bed as well to check on the size gloves i said oh he gave them to me this is gunther he said in german a thickshouldered man in a reefer jacket and woollen hat his flat square face half buried in a scarf everything is in order he said why were you late there was snow he pulled open the rear doors of the truck and jumped up in here most of the stuff on the floor was scotch in cases of a dozen bottles and he had to shift four of them before he could drag the lid of the recess upwards and swing it to one side the compartment was lined with felt he stood clear of it to let the roof light shine down whats underneath nothing he said the road but its thick and there are steel brackets do you bring people across in this the other way i have brought seven in the past three months seventy thousand us dollars not for me for them his breath clouded under the roof light how much do you get one thousand i get one for you his small brown eyes moved over me its the first time ive taken anyone this way are you going to move those cases back over the trap when im inside yes how many of them these here four maybe five how much do they weigh each seventeen kilos i dropped into the recess facedown and told him to shut the lid then i humped my back until my spine made contact there werent more than a few inches of leverage but it might be enough to shift five cases of scotch because id only have to do it if i got trapped and if i got trapped thered be a lot of adrenalin to help me i told him to open the lid on your back he said is best thats the way you put people in coffins i looked at floderus standing out there at the back of the truck with his hands tucked under his arms is there anything else this he said and gave me a small red metal box normally i refuse it but on this trip i didnt think much of my chances and if they caught up with me in moscow and pulled me in i might want to opt out rather than finish up like schrenk his feet were still rather painful he tended to hobble i put the box in my pocket send a signal i told floderus as soon as you can get to a telephone understood ok i dropped into the recess again and told gunther to shut the lid the time by my watch was first there was just one man talking to gunther then a second one came up and told him to open the rear doors of the truck i could hear those bloody dogs again not far away now i was lying in total darkness with only aural data coming in when the doors banged back the voices were much clearer what is in these boxes what is in those packages over there so forth sweat was running on my face because there werent enough ventilation holes in this thing and they shouldnt be asking all those questions out there gunther had said there wouldnt be any trouble at the checkpoint hed drive straight through as soon as they recognized him how many cases are there their boots grated on the floorboards just above me i lay with my eyes shut to keep the sweat from running into them does the gruppenfuhrer know about this consignment there was grit under their boots and it sounded like static immediately above my head of course the gruppenfuhrer knew about it gunther told them i thought his voice was too loud too blustering a dog barked again and my scalp shrank because this wasnt the end phase of the mission with the blood up and the nerves singing and the target in sight this was the jump phase and the sweat was cold on me and i wasnt ready for them to tell gunther to pull up on the floorboard here this loose one wait there i shall have to wake the guard commander theyd be in trouble gunther told them if they woke the gruppenfuhrer for nothing hed have their hide we shall see about that the man said and his boots thudded on the roadway as he dropped from the truck i listened to the ticking sounds of the exhaust pipe contracting as it cooled light showed faintly through some of the ventilation holes and a door slammed somewhere on the right of the truck voices came again gunthers the loudest and with panic in it they didnt listen to him move your vehicle over here its in the way his boots loudened again and the doors at the rear slammed shut like an explosion i listened to him going forward and climbing into the cab pulling the door shut exhaust gas seeped in through the ventilation holes as he started the engine and i began shallow breathing as we started to roll i waited to feel the movement as he turned the wheel but it didnt come my feet were being pushed against the end of the recess as he gunned up in first gear and botched into second and kept his foot down as a man began shouting somewhere behind us the roar of the exhaust drowned everything out until the truck hit something headon and began dragging the debris with it possibly the barrier but i tried to believe that gunther knew he wouldnt have a chance in hell of putting a tentonner through a checkpoint and getting away with it there were more shouts now and i could see lights flashing in the ventilation holes then the noise fell away and we seemed to be clear of the debris as gunther forced a fast change into third gear and flattened the throttle again a lot of vibration started and i braced my hands forward in case we hit something else when the first shots came i humped my back and heaved upwards against the trapdoor feeling the weight of the cases and heaving again till they were forced clear there was some rapid fire now and i crawled out of the recess and lurched forward getting most of the cargo between my body and the rear doors as a bottle was hit and glass exploded inside one of the cases the truck was swaying as we took a curve and some of the load went over bursting open and shattering against the doors i thought i could hear gunther shouting in the cab but couldnt make out any words a bullet came through at an angle deflected by the cargo and crumping into the timber dose to my head i lay face down my body in line with the longitudinal axis of the truck feet towards the rear doors light was showing from somewhere bright light from behind us filtering through the gaps where the hinges were the shots were lower now clanging into the chassis below the tailboard one of them ripped a hole in the silencer and a sustained roaring started up i heard a tyre burst but there were twin wheels at the rear and gunther still had control a klaxon was going its sound getting louder as a vehicle closed in its light silvering the dark through the cracks in the rear doors the next volley smashed into a case and sent glass fluting through the air then they were shooting low again and two more tyres burst and the truck lurched over righting itself and lurching again and starting a long slow zigzag on the rear wheelrims then everything went i felt a final lurch and then a brief period of weightlessness as the truck left the road and began floating into the drop tilting to one side and staving like that then tilting right over before it hit the rockface and started bouncing orientation was down to near zero now i was inside a rolling barrel and the cargo had gone wild and all i could do was squeeze under the rear shelf and try to hang on but it wasnt easy because the noise had reached a crescendo i was trapped inside a thunderstorm and couldnt think my way out glass shattered raining against me and i kept my face down my head hunched between my shoulders a period of weightlessness came again two seconds three four fiveas the truck found a sheer drop and floated free turning slowly and bringing a kind of calm as the rotational speed of the cargo matched the speed of the truck itself it was the eye of the storm and i waited seven seconds eight ninethen we struck rock and smashed down again and the storm burst as it had before a crash coming as the rear doors were forced open one of them dragging itself off the hinges with a scream of metal on stone then the truck veered at right angles and the rolling stopped we hit the floor of the slope headon and i was flung backwards with the rest of the cargo keeping my head in my arms and going with it something dragging against my thigh and ripping the coat away and tearing the flesh a shower of glass whining across my head through the open doors a last case toppling and smashing down as the truck shuddered and rolled again slowly and rocked to stillness i made for where i could smell the air and see the moon the senses were partially numbed and the organism was working with instinct but i could smell fuel oil and i fought in a frenzy to get clear feeling the snow under my hands as the first same burst and took hold the split tank coughed into life and black smoke began pouring across the rockface as i pitched forward and got up and staggered straightening and going on down the mountainside away from the fierce white light that had started blazing from the roadway above the ravine the truck was a mass of flames and i kept low lurching and rolling among the snowcovered boulders and keeping the fire between me and the fierce white light twice i saw my shadow in front of me and dropped flat waiting to know if theyd seen me waiting for the shot moscow i sat waiting the night was perfectly quiet with no movement in the air the moon neared its zenith towards the south i shifted my position again and the nerves in my right thigh reacted the tissues had only just begun healing i didnt know if i could run yet if i had to there was nothing else wrong with me except for the lingering effects of the shock unexpected sounds made my head jerk as if they were shots it was freezing cold what held you up another trolleybus went past the end of the street along ckalova ulica a no it was the seventh id counted there had been a dozen cars during the same period it was eleven oclock and traffic was light we crashed the truck i told him he started the engine again to blow some more air through the heater it was a pobeda stinking of oil and stale cigarette smoke we couldnt run the engine all the time because itd be noticed we were parked by the river close to the intersection and four militia patrols had gone past in the last fifty minutes one of them slowing to look at us i didnt like it any of it my scalp crept too easily and i was breathing top fast id got close to being wiped out in that truck and the organism remembered we thought wed lost you the contact said his speech was indistinct as if his mouth were bruised there was a complete blackout on you after floderus signalled from hanover it was close what happened to the driver the truck went up i didnt want to talk about it he turned the engine off and the cold began creeping through the cracks again from outside the car what else he asked me it was his job to find out this was moscow and in moscow you live from one minute to the next because theres no building that isnt bugged and no street that isnt surveyed and no hope of getting away with sloppy security or a doubtful drop or inadequate cover they could stop the next time around and poke their torches in here and ask for our papers and pull us in if everything wasnt exactly right or even if it was so he had to find out what id been doing because in five minutes from now i might not be able to tell anyone i said i got as far as ashersleben in a shepherds volkswagen and asked for some medical attention and bought a new coat that was this morning there wasnt a plane till leipzig time then what medical attention he turned to look at me and the oblique light shadowed the scar that ran from one ear along the jawline a lot of them look a bit creased in one way or another when theyve come in from the field torn leg i said is that all and screw you too he laughed without any sound at all laying his head back and giving a little shake as long as youre fit for work im as fit as ill ever be where the hell is bracken he began watching the intersection again through a gap in the buildings i could see a curve of floodlit gold one of the domes of the kremlin its difficult he said in that softslipper voice of his since the trial started we cant make a move without drawing a tag theres a lot of foreign journalists in town and the k dont like it how did bracken get in diplomatic cover it was lastminute stuff they had to fake a case of hepatitis in the embassy and send a man home with bracken to replace him my nerves reacted again shrinking the scalp most of the field directors come in like that but not so fast london would prepare the ground a month ahead to avoid any fuss but this wasnt a planned operation it was a lastditch emergency job and the man theyd thrown me as director in the field was trying to shake off the ticks before he got close to me and blew me skyhigh at the first rendezvous i began taking slow breaths working on the nerves brackens all right the contact said he knows his moscow dont worry it wont help him not at night bracken would have left the embassy in a car with diplomatic plates and the tags would have fallen in behind it was routine kgb procedure when someone new joined the staff and he couldnt drive clear of them by putting his foot down because he wasnt going to ground he was going back to the embassy sooner or later and theyd ask an awful lot of questions theres not much traffic at night in this city and youd wake the dead if you hit the tit and left rubber all over the road all he could do was to try getting a truck or a bus or something between them and himself and ease off into a side street while their view was blocked and the best of luck have you worked here before the contact asked me no i was trained here for curtain operations are you fluent yes local accent when were you here last he asked me watching the intersection three years ago another militia patrol went past in one of their small snubnosed volgas a face was turned towards us the car didnt slow thats a long time the contact said things are changing fast over here youll have to be careful oh for christs sake dyou think i need telling his head moved a fraction to watch my reflection in the windscreen sorry old boy i slowed my breathing counting the breaths id have to do better than this a hell of a lot better otherwise i was going to blow up when the heat came on eight nine ten they pulled me in from leave i said more quietly two peeks after the last lot bastards arent they we watched the car i could have refused why didnt you vanity he laughed again soundlessly but didnt take his eyes off the car it was moving into better light now turning off ckalova ulica towards us and speeding up a little it was a black number with cd plates youre driving this one the contact said all right i said yes and watched the humber there was nothing behind it but there was still plenty of time we were parked less than a hundred yards from the intersection it came on slowing as it neared another bus passed along the ring road then a private car going quite fast cutting it fine the contact said the humber was nearly abreast of us now and slowing under full brakes the drivers door coming open a moment before it stopped a man got out and came across to us as the contact hit the door open and left the wheel to me i slid behind it as the other man got in and said youd better hurry a squeal came as the contact took the humber away with the engine racing in low gear before the change i hit the stickshift and did a tight uturn and found a side street and swung into it with my eyes on the mirror there was nothing youd better go south the man said get on to the ring road as soon as you can he sat back stretching his legs out but i think were all right im bracken quiller i made two right turns watching the mirror this is the car youll use bracken told me the papers are in the glove pocket i was getting worried about you we had problems at each turn the street lights threw his reflection on to the windscreen and filled in what i remembered of him he was a shutfaced man with a tight mouth and eyes that never came to rest on anything for more than a second he was looking around him now with brief jerks of his head he couldnt keep his feet still either he kept on shuffling them against the floorboards maybe he wasnt always like that he could be worried at the moment because hed been cutting things fine if theyd turned off the ring road after him he would have driven straight past us but theres always a risk and he could have come close to blowing me i didnt know much about him only a few things id heard over cups of tea in the caff between missions someone had said hed been thrown out of an instructors job at norfolk because hed used a live charge to demonstrate his dearming techniques and someone else had told me hed murdered his mistress and been acquitted because the bureau had suppressed some of the evidence i didnt necessarily believe either story but the truth was probably somewhere there in the background theres usually something a bit touched about the field directors look at ferris always strangling mice what sort of problems bracken wanted to know access croders not as good as they say his blunt head turned quickly croder is very good it couldnt have been his fault he took a hell of a risk quite possibly he takes on things that other people wont touch so do you thats why he wanted you for this one did you fly in yes where did you land domodedovo what hotel the aeroflot are we still in the clear yes id been using the mirror at fivesecond intervals he stopped shuffling his feet did you leave your passport at immigration yes i want you to ask for it back in the prescribed two days and then go to ground and come up as a soviet citizen he took an envelope from his coat and put it into the glove compartment everythings there he talked for ten minutes without stopping except to answer questions we covered liaison contacts signals the safehouse and possible exit procedures i want you to know that youll receive every support from the people here in the field and of course from london im not trying to boost your morale we want schrenk badly md we think you can pull him out for us where is he we dont know weve you dont know he waited three seconds we are looking for him very hard we have a contact inside lubyanka watching for schrenk to come in at the moment we cant understand why he wasnt taken straight there from hanover were therefore watching a lot of other places the serbsky institute here in moscow and the facilities they run in the urals the komi republic murmansk the potma complex and of course with the slightest pause in leningrad they might have gone to hanover to kill him i made another turn and got on to the ring road going south the mirror was clear except for a trolleybus in the distance not without trying again to break him and they couldnt do mat in hanover its going to take time and a lot of personnel we know that what about leningrad his speech became slightly faster pushed by his nerves the cell is still intact obviously schrenk hasnt been broken yet of course they might have gone too far he might be dead but weve got to know what are their plans if he breaks he said in a moment some of them will try making a run for it but they wont get across any of the frontiers because the guard posts will be alerted and so will the airports they cant quietly leave their jobs before the balloon goes up because most of them are entrenched very deeply in official positions and theyd expose the whole network one or two have elected to take capsules if they have to rather than face interrogation and the labour camps he took some kind of inhaler from his pocket and started using it it smelt like vicks how many people are there fifteen headlights came into the mirror and i watched them cant any of them get clear comstock was in leningrad and so was whitman id worked with both of them not without putting everyone else at risk hed begun shuffling his feet again incidentally the cia is furious with us about schrenk they know leningrad could blow theyve done all right for eleven years thats why theyre furious he inhaled again and then screwed the cap on the whole car was reeking of menthol the papers for this car i asked him are for which cover youve got both get them out will you put the east german papers in your pocket these too i pulled out the credentials floderus had given me start reading the russian cover do you mind aloud yes he didnt turn his head have we picked someone up i dont know yet its just some headlights his hands began working busily transferring the papers dont you trust the german cover id rather be a local citizen if im going to be found with a foreign embassy man just a slight edge but i wasnt happy because every minute we were together we risked being picked up and questioned the whole operation was balanced on a knife edge and we had to keep very still kapista mikhail kirov bracken began reading age born moscow october th the kuncevo district he paused briefly height weight and description are all yours precisely the faster the lights in the mirror were getting bright now father now deceased valery kapista died in an industrial accident troicelykovo district mother also deceased i took a right turn and gunned up with the tyres just this side of the squealingpoint and passed three parked trucks and crossed some lights at red and turned right again glare filled the mirror and died away this cars perfectly all right bracken said theyve picked up a radio call and theyre sniffing out the area where you slipped them they started calling the minute they lost you i turned off all the lights and waited as long as possible before i put the pobeda into a side street a hundred yards before the next major intersection there was a whole line of trucks parked along one side of the street and i gunned up again and found a gap and hit the brakes and pushed the stick into reverse and got a brief whimper from the rear tyres as the power dragged us against the kerb i cut the engine and sat waiting read more bracken asked no time he sat with his feet perfectly still his head turned slightly to the left where he could pick up echoes and reflections from the buildings opposite the wheel was locked hard over and i left it like that because they might be stupid enough to leave a gap if they came past and saw us and stopped there was just a chance we could get out fast enough to confuse them before they could open fire if they saw us and pulled up and blocked the gap i could try making a break on foot the trucks gave a lot of cover and there was no snow on the ground it would depend on what bracken wanted me to do instructions i said he waited two seconds we both had to listen if you can drive us out of it he said evenly do that we listened again and heard the distant sound of a car but not unless the chances are good all right the sound of the car was loudening it was accelerating very hard in one of the indirect gears where do i drop you if i can get clear any cab rank im going back to the embassy we listened again the car had changed into top and was travelling flat out echoes were coming in now from the buildings at the intersection and they made it difficult to hear what was happening i thought i was picking up a second car somewhere also accelerating i wasnt sure if i cant drive us out i asked bracken run all right i sat listening again bracken wouldnt have a lot of trouble they couldnt search him and they couldnt arrest him and at the moment they didnt have anything on him to justify kicking him out of the country but if they caught me theyd question me and a soviet citizen shouldnt make contact with any foreigners least of all members of a diplomatic mission the cover wouldnt stand up if they wanted to put it under the light two he asked suddenly what two cars we listened again yes the first one was close now the second one was still piling up the speed in an indirect gear somewhere in the distance what is there in the envelope i asked bracken on schrenk quite a lot everything you ought to have local friends movements contacts everything croder instructed me fair enough we sat waiting light swept suddenly across the face of i the buildings opposite brightening and going dark as the first car crossed the intersection flat out with its echoes drumming and fading over the next few seconds one yes tyres started howling and light came again on the buildings as the second car turned at the intersection and sped up towards us with a gear botching and the power coming on and the exhaust sending out a hollow rising roar until the gears shifted and the power came on again i got comfortable in my seat and moved the stick into low and kept my foot down on the clutch and put my fingers against the starter key and watched the light flood brightly across the buildings as i waited to know if the trap we were sitting in was going to spring shut natalya good evening little mother her head came up sharply she was sitting with her back to the wall of the hallway her cracked black shoes resting on the edge of a slowcombustion stove the naked bulb throwing light on her white hair some mauve knitting was on her lap and she had been nibbling at a sausage when id come in what do you want comrade her small eyes were narrowed focusing on my face i want to see the upravdom is he here she eyed me up and down again noting my clothes needing to find a pigeonhole for me in the infinitelyvaried strata of moscow society i will see she said and took another small bite of sausage i waited while she reached and took a brass bell from the shelf of her vestibule and swung it three times i was standing halfway between the stairs and the entrance doors with the street exposed to my peripheral vision this was just routine id left bracken at a taxi rank along narodnaja ulica ten minutes ago and got here clean the second militia patrol had gone hounding straight past us and id used the back streets towards the ring road working my way out of the search area reach me through the embassy hed told me i shall be in signals with london direct were on the board as scorpion and youll use that in paroles and countersigns id had to ask him for my east german papers back he hadnt thought of it first not a good sign he was here to direct me in the field and the field was dangerous and already hed missed a trick because the brush with the militia patrols had unnerved him i felt vulnerable and exposed footsteps sounded on the stone stairway i am yuri gorsky a fleshy man with watchful eyes and a shock of stiff greying hair his worn suit smelling of black tobacco his hand was steady and strong kirov i said he led me upstairs to a room at the end of the passage on the third floor and showed me in it was small cluttered and stifling with the fumes of a charcoal heater sharp on the air one door one window one light bulb and one narrow bed no telephone i have been expecting you gorsky said in a low voice he stood waiting i was looking for signs everywhere signs of something wrong of a hundred things wrong he understood this and i could feel his understanding as we waited the time out unsure of each other that was on the air too as strong as the charcoal fumes the scent of creatures met by night their hairs lifted and their eyes watching at the edge of vision their breath held and their muscles tensed by the knowledge of where they stood on dangerous ground bracken had said he was totally reliable but i didnt trust that i trusted my own feelings is this the top floor i asked him yes he closed the door quietly and went to the window lifting the lower sash so easily that i knew the wooden frame must have been soaped he beckoned to me the freezing air came into my lungs as i leaned and looked down tracing the skeletonic pattern of the fire escape downwards to the ground where a street lamp stood there was nothing running upwards against the wall the guttering passed across the top of the window two feet higher it looked strong but that meant nothing its the best room gorsky said and i believed him people from the other rooms on this floor would have to run the length of the iron balcony before they reached the fire escape the lower floors were more dangerous they would be searched first if anyone came dont worry he said in his low voice about the little dezhurnaya in the hallway she has a grandson in the labour camps but give her money if you want to not too much how long has she been in this building nearly seven years as long as i have i slid the window shut was schrenk here yes he offered me a black and yellow packet and i shook my head when before they arrested him he took a cigarette and lit it throwing the match into the charcoal heater i went absolutely still and he sensed it dont worry he said they arrested him in the street nowhere near here they wouldnt have been interested in where he came from they would have been interested in what he was doing if they had wanted to know where he came from they would have asked him and if he had told them they would have come here he drew the cigarette to a bright red glow and then blew the smoke out in a slow cloud watching me through it so dont worry you will be safe here i looked at the bed and the cracked handbasin and the flimsy bookshelves one end wired to the wall where a calendar was pinned two years out of date and with a portrait of lenin on the yellowed paper was he here in this actual room yes said gorsky he was comfortable gorsky was responsible for the safehouse not for people who got arrested in the street telephone i said you must not use the one in the building i cannot send messages either you must use the telephone box in the street at the first corner the light in it doesnt work but if you need it screw the bulb in tighter he drew deeply on the black tobacco will you have visitors no that is better i wont write your name on the residence record of course we shall agree if it is ever necessary that i forgot he gave a faint smile though it would be too late for excuses by then tell me he said as he moved to the door if there is anything you need there is an alleyway quite narrow not far from the building you go past the telephone box and turn right and you will see it it is useful when hed gone i looked round the room again at the armchair with the stuffing out and the cracked mirror askew over the handbasin and the pile of dogeared magazines on the floor by the window schrenk had been here then before theyd arrested him i was that close and that far i had the new cover by heart in thirty minutes kapista mikhail kirov moscow representative for the state factory complex in the ukraine plastics and allied products current moscow visa for three months schedule of meetings at the ministry of labour references employment card food and lodging vouchers transport allowance rates per day members of family and nextofkin party membership card izmajlovo chapter there were voices and i listened they were a mans and a womans nearing along the corridor a door opened and closed and the voices went on muffled now i would have to get to know the voices here so that one day if strangers came id be warned i trusted gorsky but he was human and therefore fallible a safehouse is a safehouse until its blown there was a dossier on helmut schrenk with photographs and a description i didnt think hed look much like that now he was described in his cover as a demolition worker which was typically close to reality hed been trained at norfolk in explosives it said that four months ago when hed been doing a lowkey penetration job in moscow hed applied for a post as agentinplace why had he done that i went over the material again in the last three years hed completed seven successful missions apart from his liaison work in the north leningrad at the age of thirtyfive he had a lot of steam left and he wasnt the type to sit at a desk and play about with microdots there was a tremendous amount of latent aggression in the man and he used his executive work as a safetyvalve id seen him in action id have to ask bracken it was the second thing that didnt fit schrenks character the first had been dr steinbergs reference to his bearing a grudge against his interrogators in lubyanka i laid the destruct material on top of the charcoal until it caught fire and then held it at the mouth of the galvanized chimney so that all the smoke would go out then i put the east german cover and car papers inside the third magazine from the bottom of the lefthand pile and went down to talk to gorsky again it was then he told me about natalya shes over there the cafe was crowded they were mostly young people perched along the benches with newspapers opened on the tables among the dark bread and bowls of soup komsomolskaya pravda sovetsky sport literturnaya gazeta at one table they were arguing loudly and passing separate sheets from their newspapers for the others to read they were talking about the borodinski trial i looked across the room which one with the fair hair next to the man with the beard i pushed my way between the tables some of the men looked up at me noting my clothes and looking away again i assumed theyd seen the man sitting alone near the doors and talking to no one they must have natalya she looked up at me through the tobacco smoke so did the bearded man which natalya he asked me straightening natalya fyodorova she went on staring at me without answering her iceblue eyes showing nothing at all who are you the bearded man asked me i went on watching the girl the man said she doesnt want to talk to you i leaned over the table and spoke close to the girl on the other side from the man im a friend of helmuts her hands were on the table in front of her and i saw them move slightly coming together as i straightened up she looked at the man i thought she was wondering if hed heard what id said she doesnt want to talk to you he told me are you deaf or something he pushed his bowl of soup farther away from him as if to give himself room the girl looked up at me who arc you her eyes were still cool but she was watchful now involved a friend of his im trying to find him the sound level around me went down suddenly as some of the people stopped talking i looked into the mirror above the brass samovar and saw two men coming in they didnt greet anyone but took up a position on the far side of the room talking to each other but looking around them in a minute the sound level went up again but it wasnt as loud as before i looked down from the mirror whose friend the bearded man asked me he was leaning back ready to get up if he had to the girl was quite pretty and i understood his reactions i wondered if shed noticed that he hadnt heard the first thing id said to her it could be important the trials fixed said a young jew at the same table theyre all fixed we know that all of them shhhh a girl said gripping his arm to hell with them he said loudly and looked across at the two men whod just come in the noise level dipped again and recovered a woman laughed about something to show that she didnt care in the mirror i saw the two men watching her natalya stood up suddenly taking her sealskin hat from the table knocking against a bowl of soup the man caught it in time i remember him now she told him hes in my office this is work she came round the table shaking her hair back and putting her fur hat on glancing into the mirror through the haze of smoke this isnt the time to work the man said and got to his feet stay here ivan im coming back and get me some more solyanka as we moved away she asked me whats your name well talk outside the two security men werent watching us specifically but i didnt want to give them time to take an interest in this city the faceless live longest the militia men were still at the junction of the two streets when we went outside stamping their feet in the cold their breath clouded in front of them as they turned to watch us leaving the cafe a black volga was parked halfway along the block with its lights out it hadnt been there before the girl asked my name again but i said it wouldnt mean anything to you she wanted to stop but i kept going and she had to come with me men on surveillance get bored and theyll question anyone in sight we turned the corner and kept on walking this street was clean and the pobeda was parked in shadow between two of the lamps how did you find me she kept swinging her head to look at me frightened because i knew her and she didnt know me i took her arm so that shed keep walking the two militia men would be watching us simply because we were something that moved in a static environment gorsky told me where to look i dont know any gorsky she tried to hold back and i tightened her arm in mine do you want to see helmut again yes she said on a breath but they then trust me and do as i tell you weve got to keep walking she quickened her step you do know gorsky hes the upravdom at the building in vojtovica ulica she was beside herself gorsky had told me when she heard hed been arrested she kept coming back every day asking if i had any more news this was another thing right out of character with schrenk when youre in the field you do not take a girl to the safehouse you dont take anyone id been worried about his state of mind after theyd interrogated him but now i was worried about the things hed been doing before his arrest it was as if there were two people schrenk and this other man whod been breaking all the rules do they always watch that cafe i asked the girl she was keeping up with me now and i could feel the tension in her because id talked about helmut not always tonight its because of the trial they think we might demonstrate or make trouble most of the people who go there are jews and they want borodinski released it would be symbolic of what of the power of the dissidents thereve been many demonsrations all over the city dont you know that i felt a slight tug on my arm as she held back again not trusting me not knowing who i was and not wanting to cause any harm to helmut she wasnt his type his women had been dark simmering sensual corinne rebecca toni alvirez i couldnt see him with this fairhaired girl full of her fears and her extrovert dreams the symbolic power of the dissidents the effectiveness of demonstrations not his type it was inconsistent again whats your job i asked her im a senior clerk in the kremlin connection whos the man you were talking to ivan hes an engineer did he know helmut no i dont understand she said tightly you said you were looking for him but he was arrested didnt you know that he escaped escaped life came into her and her hand dug into my arm you mean hes free i dont know two more i dont understand she said anxiously if he escaped then he must be he managed to reach west germany then they found him again i think hes in moscow two more militia men you mean in prison i dont know i began slowing our pace a fraction if he is there are certain friends wholl be trying to get him out by demonstrating it was all they could think about they thought they could get borodinski off a life sentence or a death sentence just as theyd thought they could get ginzburg off and pektus and shcharansky but all they could ever get by demonstrating was a night in the cells and a roughing up and a new entry on their records in the kgb files no i said not by demonstrating they were coming towards us from the other end of the street on this side the pobeda was on the opposite side and the distance at the moment was about the same i could turn round now and take the girl with me and get her into the car and drive off but i didnt think i could do it without hurrying without being seen to hurry i might have done it alone measuring my steps walking indiscernibly faster and with a longer stride getting my keys ready but i couldnt do it with the girl she was still frightened of me frightened for him because whatever i said to her it wouldnt convince her that i wasnt in the police and hunting for schrenk and hoping she could lead me to him who was his best friend i asked her you i love him her voice faltered on it it was over three months since shed last seen him and shed been starting to get over it and now id brought it all back id do anything to see him again then keep hoping and trust me the two militia men were dose now there was no reason why they should stop us but there was always a risk and it worried me because yesterday id been hanggliding over the sussex cliffs trying to shake off the tensions of the last operation and then croder had thrown me out here and this was alien soil hostile and dangerous and unpredictable and i didnt feel ready to take the risks and beat the odds and stay this side of survival i wasnt sure of my cover or my accent to be word perfect in the safehouse was different from being put to the test in the street above all i wasnt sure of the essential steadiness of nerve i was going to need if they lifted a hand and said propusk papers what other friends did he have i asked her there wasnt much time now we might get separated he didnt have many friends give me one of them two of them trust me they carried walkietalkies so if i turned round and took me girl with me and began hurrying they didnt even have to shout to us to stop they just had to press a button and tell the other two to stop that car when it reaches you and check it out and thered be no hope this time of keeping enough distance between them and the number plate theyd see it and alert the volga and bring in the radio networks and it wouldnt matter how fast i drove or how far i could fed the blood leaving my face and going to the muscles and the quickening of the pulse as the adrenalin started to flow i was that bad to that degree unready even for a routine encounter with a couple of flatfooted young militia men an exercise the training directors put the novices through on their first trip behind tike curtain so what was it going to be like when bracken called me and said yes hes inside lubyanka after all we want you to go and get him out ignatov the girl said other name she hesitated again because she didnt know that she wasnt putting ignatov in danger or helmut i watched the militia men coming pyotr she said half holding it back who else i dont remember anyone else she thought shed gone too far natalya i said is your identity card in order she swung her head yes why these two here i said if they question us dont mention helmut or pyotr ignatov were just recent acquaintances you understand yes they were watching us now peaked caps batons sidearms radio sets they were walking in step you dont know anything about me i told her just my name my name is kapista kirov but we both like music classical music close now briskly in step they were young men conscious of their uniforms and their heady power they might stop us simply because they decided theyd like to talk to a pretty girl watching her iceblue eyes while they went through the routine questions ill step off the pavement i told her well make room for them the whole problem with prokofiev it seems to me isnt in his music at all its simply that hes overrated by the critics the result is that a lot of his work sounds disappointing after all the eulogies and the acclaim their eyes in the shadow of their peaked caps watching us his music is just as good as it always was and we should listen to it as if weve never heard of him before otherwise we shall miss a lot of what he was trying to convey briskly in step nikolai doesnt agree with me i know but propusk one of them said as they stopped ignatov two kopecks is sergei there who sergei panov im sorry theres nobody here of that name this is the british embassy oh excuse me i must have asked for the wrong number thats quite all right every line to the embassy was tapped and radio was out of the question and protracted speechcode was a slowburn fuse because theyd go straight through the exchange and trace the call and raid the place within minutes so id had to ask for a cutout sergei was for taganskaja metro station and i got there in fourteen minutes feeling nervy again because in this city there wasnt much traffic at night and i was vulnerable it had been bad enough half an hour ago have you been to the cafe the younger one had asked yes shed said before i could stop her i see and were you talking about the trial there about the traitor borodinski his eyes going over my papers again turning them to the light looking for the wrong weave the wrong coloration the wrong serial number looking at the photograph and then at my face then back at the photograph we were talking about prokofiev i said before she could answer she could get us arrested they were trying to provoke us into saying something wrong prokofiev or borodinski a little joke his tone amused a young man who knew his composers he wasnt playing a game of his own since the trial had begun the standing orders for the police were to show these dissidents that it was useless protesting and demonstrating and thumping the cafe tables comrade borodinski would be tried in the court not in the streets a night in the cell would remind them of that if we call him a traitor before hes tried it simply means i cut in on her again that its how we regard him with a short laugh squeezing her arm ask helmut he says we ought to raid the courthouse and string him up from a lamppost outside who is helmut his eyes watching her watching me a friend of ours i told him he feels rather strongly about traitors the other man stamped his feet feeling the cold getting bored i was waiting for natalya to say something ready to cut in on her at once but she was quiet now because of my warning where are you two going now home i said he looked down at the papers again but you live in opposite directions from here im seeing my friend home first his head came up why are you saying the streets care dangerous of course not its just that im enjoying her company a thin smile lets hope shes enjoying yours he passed my papers back slapping them on to my hand its late for people to be out on the streets it disturbs the more respectable citizens who are trying to sleep quite bad enough the cutout came up the escalator of the metro station dropping his thin little cigar into the sand bin at the fourth pace from the moving stairs and sliding both hands into the pockets of his coat thumbs hooked out he wasnt too quick on the parole and countersign and i put him through a variation before i took him across to the car and drove five blocks and stopped between two trucks parked on the wasteground alongside a building site where a crew was working the night shift it was a new apartment block and the crane was swinging an entire prefabricated wall into place with four window apertures in it sparks flew in a fountain from a welders torch on the floor below have they found schrenk yet not yet he said youd have been told i was absent from base oh he gave me the tape recorder and took something else from the glove pocket and sat clutching it in his bare hands whats that this handwarmer burns charcoal i cant stand this bloody cold look at these chilblains i began talking on to the tape i need all info on natalya fyodorova senior clerk kremlin office companion of subject before arrest also all info on pyotr ignatov party member often in subjects company no other details known shed told me i would find him at a meeting of the izmajlovo chapter at ten oclock tomorrow morning and i was going to be there if i could make it this wasnt for the tape because bracken might decide to send someone else in to watch ignatov and i wanted to work solo the man could be ultra sensitive about schrenks arrest and they could frighten him off i need to know how the subject was arrested in a street or where what street what place had he made a mistake bad security was he blown need to know why he applied for post as aip this is important im finding inconsistencies in his behaviour prior to arrest condensation was forming on the windscreen and the crane swung its skeletonic arm through the floodlights insubstantially like a back projection on frosted glass the welders torch flared with an acid radiance and i looked away from it to protect my night vision should i stress the importance of natalya fyodorova she probably knew more about schrenk than anyone else in moscow more than brackens team could find out in a month but i was seeing her again tomorrow leave it at that and dont risk oversurveillance she could be frightened off as easily as ignatov i suggest messages by hand direct to base in digraphic square key when absent ill report hourly at the hour plus extension silent line signal ends i sat thinking for another five minutes there was a lot more i wanted to ask but i wasnt going to put it on tape because i didnt want to show my hand at this stage i didnt know how bracken normally worked but i knew he was the key man in a crisis and he might react differently once he knew my line of enquiry he might throw in contacts and tags and shields and the whole bloody bazaar i didnt want anyone in my way who does this go to i asked the man beside me winfield whos he one of our aips wheres his base didnt anybody tell you anything we wheres his base low threshold the airport his head was turned to watch me now oh come on which one sheremetyevo its for christs sake i said you dont go all the way out there every time no we use a drop mobile yes the aeroflot ferry bus desperate times bracken was keeping himself strictly in the shadows while he tried to dig himself in and set up an untapped phone line and signals facilities somewhere outside the embassy and it wouldnt be easy to do but hed have to do it because all id wanted was a brief squawk on the tape and this man had taken twenty minutes to make the rendezvous and so had i youll receive every possible support croder had said bracken had said both of them lying this wasnt support it was bloody musical chairs or was that what theyd meant by possible was this all theyd got for me were trying to put someone into your sector the cutout was saying rubbing his hands on the charcoal thing i mean really close you know five minutes away make things a lot easier of course its always getting a phone thats the trouble i mean a clean one i dropped the tape recorder on to his lap and started the engine and wiped the stuff off the windscreen whos my director i asked him i dont know strictly in the shadows but that was all right it was what a cutout was for to protect both ends of the signal im going to put you back on the metro at proletarskaya i told him is tint closer no but i dont like doubling on my tracks the trains dont stop running till one oclock youve got enough time i got into gear and swung the headlight beams across the low relief of the wasteground whats he done he asked me in a moment who schrenk i got fedup again he hadnt been fully trained the executive asks all the questions and its strictly oneway conversation because otherwise its dangerous once in the field you dont look for nonbrief information any more than you look for a gas leak with a match and they ought to have told him that hes disappeared i said i know but and its all you need to know it began snowing the next morning not long after first light a few big flakes drifting down from a leadgrey sky id slept for three hours with the foot of the bed jammed against the door and the castors out and the window raised a few inches from the bottom with the lid of the samovar hanging from one edge of the frame a fat lot of good against a fullscale raid but itd give me five or six seconds to trigger the organism and i was here in this city now with the morning light in my eyes because more than once somewhere along the line in berlin or bangkok or hong kong thered been five or six seconds to spare on my side instead of theirs he took me right across the jauza from the place in izmajlovskij prospekt where theyd held the party meeting and it was difficult at first because hed walked for two blocks to where hed left his car and his fiat heavy features and his dark fur coat and hat made him look like most of the other men in the street id had to tag him in the pobeda moving at a crawl and stopping when i could in case he got on to a tram i wasnt even certain he was the right man at the meeting theyd addressed him as comrade ignatov but it was a common enough name and there might have been more than one of them he was driving a small mudcoloured syrena taking his time and going westwards across the river into the baumanskaja district the snow was still falling steadily but the sky wasnt thick with it this looked like the edge of a cloud formation that was moving in from the north at slow speed the road surface wasnt affected yet and there were no sand trucks on the move along baumanskaja the syrena turned right and stopped just after the intersection so that i had to drive past and pull up a hundred yards farther on using a parked van for cover i was out of the car and walking towards the apartment block just as ignatov was going up the steps and i kept moving because if he lived here i could get his number from the upravdom and if he didnt live here thered be no way of tagging him inside the building without the risk of a confrontation and i wasnt ready for that all i wanted from him was information on schrenks movements before the arrest but i might learn more by watching him than by asking questions and it might be safer that way schrenk could have been blown by one of the people hed been running with and it could have been ignatov the building was red brick with the single word pavilion in corroded aluminium over the entrance four storeys eighteen windows along the front and no other doorway into the street i made one circuit and found a yard with a dozen cars parked in it and room for a dozen more ignatov would have used this if hed lived here then i went back and moved the pobeda into deeper cover but left it facing the same direction and used the mirror and rear window focusing on the syrena he was in the building for an hour and he came out alone id got his walk now he leaned backwards slightly and his feet were splayed the walk of a heavy man with somewhere to go where was he going his time and travel pattern might be repetitive and i noted on my watch as he got into the syrena and started up and drove past me without turning his head he took me west again this time along karl marx ulica and across the ring road traffic was light and i kept well back leaving a truck and a vw between us and pulling ahead only when there was no street to the right at the lights to take up the slack if he went through dose to the yellow i didnt want to lose him at he stopped near plevna metro and went across to the telephone box by the cigar store looking at his watch i noted this because the people of this city are not punctual and he wasnt going to call anyone to say hed be late because he hadnt been hurrying i didnt like it there was a slot by the kerb and i put the pobeda into it and sat scanning the environment and doing it carefully he shouldnt have looked at his watch like that when id picked him up at the party meeting hed walked to his car without any hurry and hed driven at a normal speed to the pavilion building and driven away from it at the same speed and suddenly he wanted to know the time nerves the alarm threshold was still too low ten private cars parked and a light van unloading cardboard cases near the intersection a no trolleybus moving in to the kerb and putting down four passengers taking on seven a militia man standing not far from the cigar store hands behind his back his feet feeling the cold other people on the pavement most of them hurrying a little because the snow was getting worse nothing in the environment to worry me nothing but the hairs had begun rising on the backs of my hands and my breathing had quickened ignore the trolleybus pulled away and i could see the whole of the environment again as it had been before nothing had changed ignatov was still in the telephone box the pale blur of his face showing through the condensation on the glass a woman in a muskrat coat came up and started waiting for the phone a child with her both of them eating icecreams from the stall on the other side of the cigar store in moscow the people eat icecream in all weathers even in the depth of winter in moscow the people are not punctual and should not look at the time the cold was creeping into the car again but i didnt switch the heater on because it would mean running the engine and i didnt want to do that till i was ready to drive away because the militia man would catch the sound and turn his head the ideal to aim at in a potentially hostile environment they tell us repeatedly at norfolk is to become or remain invisible inaudible and unfindable noted a black zil limousine with central committee moc number plates and its rear windows curtained and its headlights on came hounding down the chaika lane and i watched the policeman at the intersection jumping into the roadway with his illuminated baton raised to halt the cross traffic his whistle shrilling as the zil went through the red heading westwards towards the kremlin the woman was still standing there eating her icecream the small boy was waving his in the air trying to make a snowflake settle on it the woman laughed and began doing the same thing ignatov had been in the phone box for three minutes my legs were getting chilled because of the cold air coming into the car through the gaps round the doors and because of the nerves three minutes was a long time in three minutes the environment had changed considerably most of the people whod been on the pavement when id arrived here had gone and as many others had taken their place but the woman and the child were still there and the militia man had moved a few paces to stand watching them smiling as the boy caught a snowflake at last on his icecream in moscow everyone loves children the light flashed across the glass door of the telephone box as it opened and ignatov came out in the warmth of the box he lad loosened his dark coat and now he buttoned it up and pulled his woollen scarf straight tucking it in without looking around him he stopped to talk to the militia man halfway across to his car taking something out of his wallet and showing it to him briefly and getting a salute and putting the wallet away as he went on talking standing quite close in a moment the militia man undipped the radio from his belt and began speaking into it looking up and down the street i waited watching them it was all i could do or needed to do i had no information the militia man was gazing up the street now also waiting then he began walking into the roadway taking his time as he raised his baton to halt the line of traffic on the side where i was parked in my mirror the line was slowing to a stop except for a low black van with lights on its roof a police vehicle coming up fast and overtaking the other traffic until the militia man swung his baton and pointed it straight at my car and i thought oh christ its a trap the police van was still slowing hard under the brakes and veering across the front of the traffic line when i hit the starter and botched the gears in and wheelspin into motion with the tyres squawking and the flashlight on the windscreen ledge sliding across and smashing against the pillar as i locked the wheel over and heeled into the roadway and straightened up clouting the front end of the van and ripping my rear wing away i heard it clatter behind me a jangle of metal on tarmac as the whine of the siren came in and someone shouted on the conscious level the visual and aural experience was mostly a kaleidoscope of shapes and a medley of sound the militia man leaping dear and the siren wailing and a faint thin whine starting from the rear of the pobeda where a wing bracket was gouging the tyre a face on the pavement ignatovs and a small boy hunched in surprise and the lights at the intersection changing to red and the siren still howling as the van dosed up and smashed into my rear bumper and bounced back with its reflection rocking in the mirror the traffic policeman tried to get in my way but i kept going and he jumped back with the shrill of his whistle breaking off a truck had started across and i touched the wheel and used the only space i had and ripped the rear door across his front end before i was clear and moving faster with the engine at peak revs in second gear the mirror was vibrating but i could see the truck slewing to a stop and the front of the police van nosing round it with the rear end swinging as it struggled for traction this was kujbyseva ulica and the street was wide but i needed obstacles for cover because if i kept straight on id be plumb in their sights so i took the first right turn with the tyres sliding on the thin wet film left by the snow and the whine of the wing bracket descending in tone and then yipping suddenly as the rear wheels span under the acceleration i was driving by instinct the organism was in shock and trying to survive but nearer the conscious level i knew there wasnt a chance because these were the streets that fanned out from the kremlin and there were people along the pavements and a militia patrol at every corner and it was full daylight strictly no go but i wasnt going to stop before i had to mirror the van was there with its roof light flashing the siren died away and a voice came over the bullhorn stopyou are ordered to stop there wasnt a chance because theyd be sending this out on their radio and asking for a converging movement a routine trap that would put me into the centre of a closing net and hold me there while they slid to a stop and the doors swung open and they came for me on foot not hurrying i could drive this thing through any gap they left for me and run it into the ground if i had to but id need clear streets and there werent any if i kept on going id risk losing control and ploughing into the people on the pavements this was a dead end a bottleneck there were sirens ahead of me now echoing from the face of the building at the intersection while the surrealistic voice squawked from the bullhorn behind me stop you are ordered to stop the mirror was shivering the black rectangular image jerking in it like an old film i couldnt judge the distance between us but on this surface i could spin the pobeda full circle without losing control and take it from there and hope for confusion enough confusion to give me the five or six seconds id need to work in if i came out of the wreckage and there were anything i could do another siren was cutting in the whole city was wailing and the echoes were washing the sound back in undulating waves i was still accelerating but the breakoff point was close now and if i didnt shut down the speed id lose the surface and slide into the intersection with the wheels locked and no hope of any control the nearest threat was still the vehicle behind me and if i could knock it out there was a chance of getting clear before the others turned into the street ahead of me the surface was touchy and nothing much happened when i swung the wheel hard over and left it there and waited then we found a drier patch and the pobeda began spinning with one side lifting off the springs and a howl rising from the nearside wing brackets as they shaved the tyres while the street went swinging round against my eyes and the black rectangle came closer curving away on the next swing and coming closer again curving for the third time and suddenly filling the vision field as we met and hit and bounced and hit again as the vans momentum carried us locked together across the wet surface before a tyre burst and was wrenched off and the wheel buckled and dug into the roadway and the van swung hard and lifted rolling over and slamming down with the pobeda halflooping and then tumbling against it with a shrilling of metal and flying glass the sirens were dosing in sepulchre a city is a warren and the nearest hole i could see was one of the dark arched doorways of the gum department store and i went for that headlong across the roadway and the pavement and through the people as a man tried to trip me and someone shouted whistles blowing and the last of the glass still tinkling among the wreckage as the doors were forced open the whole street shocked and full of sound and stilled movement for the six seconds it took me to reach the arch another man with his hands going down to tackle me but not fast enough as i hit the doors and pitched through into the bright lamplit interior and swerved at right angles and broke through a group of people faces opening in surprise someone running to the glass doors to see what was happening outside in the street stop thief someone was calling out it was a trap in here but worse in the open keep running its all you can do glass doors arches windows and a stairway everywhere crowded wrought iron bridges crossing the cathedral form of the building a bell ringing somewhere then more shouting as doors crashed open behind me and to my left keep running and find a door a mans hand swinging out and his arm hooking round my throat but i used a fare claw and span clear and hit the door and went through a woman screaming and a table going over with buttons everywhere a thousand of them and reels of cotton rolling and a box of scarlet plumes falling and exploding through the air my hand on a brass handle and the inner door slamming back against shelves as i went through and saw the long narrow window and got there and used a packing case as a springboard and rolled breaking the iron latch and falling the woman screaming again it was a corridor and i ran hard for the door at the end slowing and going through at a quick walk shutting it behind me i was back in the main building again with a lot of commotion at the kujbyseva entrance where id come in i began walking the other way a little faster when i reached the big central fountain not too fast watch it everyones looking the other way and im not im on the move become or remain invisible inaudible and unfindable an old woman in black watching me question it and now a man why watching my face and i touched it blood and got out my handkerchief as someone began shouting a lot of them looking at me now so i went low and broke and ran again dodging a group of children the whistles blowing behind me and a foot darting out and sending me pitching against a man whose lined grey face loomed and stared straight into mine before i span away and went full tilt at the big glass doors at the end stop thief a dull rising roar of voices filling the arched building and then the crash as i hit the door on the left and swung through and found the street slow down the snow filling the dark sky and the pavement slippery with it slow down the sound of sirens on the air again directionless and echoing from everywhere a black patrol car slewing in to the kerb with uniformed men getting out of it uncertain where they should go i began walking faster because people had started staring at my face again and i kept on using the handkerchief but it was soaked by now and i put it away and broke into a run as far as the corner and saw two militia men and swerved away and found a doorway as they shouted behind me and i knocked someone down running hard a room on the left and a girl with her face opening in shock and starting to scream as i kept going and found a corridor empty and ran hard to the end the word men on a door and i went in and the go bloodied face met me in the mirror as i stopped dead no wonder shed screamed water gushing and a rolled paper towel it was a long gash from the cheekbone to the chin and i could feel glass fragments moving in it as i went to work blood on my hands on my coat i used more water swabbing at the astrakhan listening for sounds outside a door thudding and someone shouting i ripped off some more of the towel and made a wad and held it against my face as i went out and climbed three steps and found the street again slow slow down get the breathing under control head down and watching the wet pavement like everyone else breathe deep and breathe slow and dont look up dont look round the noise was behind me a staccato medley of voices and farther away a siren dying and the slam of a car door i was on the east side of red square now with the walls of the kremlin opposite i went that way crossing the open space with the knowledge that if they found me here there wouldnt be any cover except for the long queue of people reaching from below spassky gate to lenins tomb i kept walking my head down and the snow drifting across the ground beginning to settle three men walked together towards the line of people and i moved nearer them to make a group others were crossing red square towards the walls of the kremlin hurrying because of the snow and because the queue was lengthening one of the sirens was still wailing through the streets behind me and i could hear a car moving at high speed with its engine racing i didnt look back i walked with the three men in black through the drifting snow the wad of paper was pressed hard against my face if i could stop the blood flow i could regain something like a normal image i didnt know whether the paper was white or red it would make a difference when i reached the queue of people they were facing towards us all of them wrapped tight in their fur coats and hats and headscarves staring across the square whats happening over there was there an accident we walked steadily towards them joining the line near spassky gate it was four deep and i took up my position on the far side away from the department store do you have toothache yes i said whats happening across the square there i dont know i counted seven police cars one of them moving slowly round the cathedral and another one turning and accelerating in the opposite direction but both keeping close to the square teh theres blood on your face are you hurt its nothing much i slipped on the snow you need medical attention it will heal a body of militia men was moving away from the thick of the patrol cars and spreading out along the edge of the square facing this way one of the cars had dropped two men off not far from nikolsky gate and they were walking steadily past the museum towards the queue of mourners they looked closely at everyone they passed i turned away from the queue but saw a police van slowing to a halt opposite nabatny tower a dozen men got out of it and began forming a group facing this way i turned back do you live in moscow yes i said we are from abramtsevo she was a motherly woman half buried in black shawls her bright eyes watching me this is my son viktorovich he would like to live in moscow but he cant get a visa hes a sewage engineer an apprentice i nodded to him you must keep trying you know how it is when you want something from them when i looked behind me again i saw the group of police spreading out and moving slowly towards the queue stopping a man here and there and questioning him i turned again and looked towards spassky gate where two sentries stood have you visited the mausoleum before asked the woman no ive been wanting to see it for a long time the sentries would certainly see me and probably stop me they were aware that every male in the square was being scrutinized the three lines of police and militia men were moving steadily in from the other three sides we have been twice already she said every time i see me sepulchre i have tears she rocked gently nodding with the whole of her round shawled body every day we have fifteen thousand people here to see it but you will know this since you live in moscow the snow was falling thickly now the sky overhead was stormdark and the air was heavy we shuffled forward watched by the police guards the last time we came the woman said the queue reached right round to kutafya tower of course it was summer then she peered up at me with her bright eyes do you have influence in moscow no i said but your son should keep on trying it wears them down in the end a man and a woman broke from the queue not far away and a police guard called to them return to the line please i get back into line but we cant wait any longer my wife has a cold very well we shuffled forward again the militia men were halfway across the square by now one of them stopping the man to question him while his wife waited puzzled when i turned round i saw two of the police unit reach the end of the queue and start moving along it scrutinizing the men ahead of us people were breaking away to put their cameras and parcels into a locker room coming back to their places and shuffling forward again the militia men were moving steadily in our direction there wasnt any way out if i tried running theyd head me off and if i stayed where i was theyd question me chat have you done to your face why is your coat torn like this were you in an accident the snow is already thick in abramtsevo the chickens can hardly find the grain she moved forward with her son there was no way out but i had a choice schrenk carried a capsule croder had said he would have saved us an immense amount of trouble if he had used it the small red box was in a pocket on the inside of my waistband and in it was the capsule cushioned in silicagel desiccant they might not search me immediately not for anything small but theyd see me if i tried to reach it and in any case theyd make a detailed search as soon as we got to lubyanka and that wasnt far from here four minutes in a police car it depended on how much hed told them ignatov he didnt know who i was he was a total stranger and he hadnt looked at me once in the meeting hall or when id followed him to his car not once but hed told them to pick me up we moved forward again and the womans son took his camera across to the locker room and came back the police guards were watching us closely now their caps jutting and their bonewhite faces reflecting the snow natalya she might have told ignatov he said that if helmut was in moscow there were certain friends whod try to get him out of prison natalya possibly i didnt think so she hadnt enough guile who else if not natalya there was no one who knew me keep close in line their eyes moved over our faces we shuffled forward again and climbed the steps between the guards of honour going inside it was quiet now except for the movement of feet across the wooden platform people had stopped talking and the men were taking off their hats guards with fixed bayonets stood watching us as we climbed the steps to the tomb it would depend on what ignatov had told them if hed said i was a dissident trying to provoke others last night in the star cafe a dissident with certain friends who would try getting schrenk out of prison i could manage what they would do to me but if the inconceivable had happened and ignatov had told them i was an agent from london then theyd take me through the full routine as theyd taken schrenk and i didnt know for certain if i could stand up to it as hed managed to do because i wasnt fresh in the field and the tensions of the last operation were still flickering in the nerves i could break and if i broke i could blow london the whole of what i knew there said the woman in front of me and leaned forward in her black shawls to gaze at the bright glass coffin with the exhibit inside it either the preserved body or an effigy it was impossible to tell she began weeping quietly but the line wouldnt stop for anyone and i had to nudge her as the man behind me was nudging me we went down the steps and made for the huge rectangle of the doorway passing between the guards and reaching daylight the snow fell softly over the square and over the dark moving figures bringing its silence to the scene i stayed with a group talking to the woman and her son she was still weeping quietly but he took no notice the nearest policemen were fifty yards away i could hear their voices under the dark sky when do you expect to get your licence i asked viktorovich in sewage engineering i steered the two of them to the left towards the history museum keeping my head down to talk to the boy and holding the paper wad against the wound with my hand covering most of it because the blood must have soaked through by this time when they give it to me the boy said ive passed my exams its a question of time he looked around him at the huge museum and the gilded domes one day im going to live here you know that but you need a visa and you cant get a visa without a job here and you cant get a job here without a visa he kicked at the snow thrusting his bare knuckly hands into his pockets the woman stopped weeping and gave a sigh fumbling among her shawls for a handkerchief it was beautiful she rid beautiful i held her arm keeping her in a straight line for the museum through the gap between the two policemen i watched the ground look at this snow the boy said i forgot to cover the tractor before we left this morning the policeman on the left was questioning someone i could hear his voice it was the other one on the right who came suddenly across to us the leather of his new boots creaking you he said papers vader within a minute there were five or six of them round me forming a circle his face they kept telling each other the first one had raised his arm and held it like that until a captain came up the heels of his polished black boots clinking on the hard surface i think they were ironcapped his face captain the first one said what have you done to your face the captain pulled my hand away and stared at the wound i fell against some railings outside my apartment when his breath steamed against my face an hour ago when an hour ago did you have an accident yes i slipped on the snow did you have an accident in your car others came up behind them i caught a glimpse of the woman in the shawls staring at me with her bright eyes shocked when did he have the accident it was another captain hes lying how did he tear his coat papers show me your papers i could feel blood trickling on my chin the wound had opened when the captain had pulled my hand away kapista kirov that tells us nothing they came closer gathering round like boys whod found an injured animal more of them came and one of them said he is the man i saw running away from the car are you sure i was there of course im sure they all started talking at once capsule take him along four of you march people stood perfectly still in the falling snow watching us as we walked past them towards the roadway three black ravens had already pulled up alongside the kerb their engines were still running the rear doors of the nearest one swung open with a bang and i got to it when they hustled me inside it was in my hand by the time i sat down on the padded bench the rear doors slammed and the steel bar was dropped across outside four of them sat with me watching me but not talking i dont understand i told the captain i fell against some railings youre making a mistake perhaps i went on talking to him explaining that i wasnt the man they wanted he shrugged at intervals the box was in my hand but i hadnt decided yet i couldnt get the capsule out while i was sitting here they were watching me the whole time dzerzhinsky square through the barred windows and the childrens world department store then just opposite lubyanka i had no information the choice was simply beads or tails black or white ignatov had known i was an agent and had told them so or he hadnt if he had known and had told them then i risked betraying london when they brought the pressure on and my system began overloading if i wanted to avoid that risk i would have to take the capsule within the next few seconds and blow the fuse you can open up the captain called out hands hit the steel bar upwards against the rear doors once inside lubyanka i would be closely watched and meticulously searched if they were doing their job they would know there were two critical points at which an active intelligence agent is liable to take his capsule within minutes of his arrest and when the interrogation began breaking him woodison had done it so had racklaw so had fane the pressure had got too much not just the pressure of their last arrest and interrogation but of all the other arrests and interrogations theyd been through since theyd first gone eagerly into the field as younger men brandishing their unbruised innocence the pressure is accumulative out the captain told me two of the men dropped from me rear of the van and two stayed behind a dozen more were waiting for me outside and two patrol cars swung through the heavy gates pulling up alongside and spilling their crews there was another decision i had to make within the next few seconds if i didnt take the capsule i must get rid of it was he driving that pobeda he says he fell against some railings get orlov here he was in the van that crashed come onout march i dropped to the ground and made my first decision if i became certain three days from now four days five that i couldnt protect london there was the other way of blowing the fuse orlov is this the man you saw running from the pobeda yes captain his face peered into mine this is the one bloody fool id come out of the smash like a bat out of hell and he didnt have time to take anything in because the ran had rolled over he wanted the kudos get him inside there was a drain grid at one side of the steps and i let it drop and waited to hear if it made any sound metal on metal that would be audible above the tramp of their boots captain i said loudly exasperated youre making a mistake i dont think so but we shall see greenpainted walls passages doorways uniformed clerks a smell of leather black tobacco gun oil and the ancient smells that breathe from the walls of old buildings search him in there and then bring him to my office is colonel vader in the building yes captain tell him we have the suspect in room barred windows and the smell of sweat and damp uniforms and my own fear good evening my name is vader good evening colonel kapista kirov he was in uniform but without a cap would you like to smoke i shook my head and he put the packet away he was a short square man with red hair on his head in his nostrils and on the backs of his hands his face was heavily freckled and his eyes were honeycoloured a luminous amber his hands were square and spadelike and moved when he spoke spreading out on the table or pushing at its edge his nails were short and well trimmed and there were no nicotine stains on his fingertips i found i was interested in him because he was probably going to be the man who would force me to decide in three days from now four days five whether i must kill myself he tilted his chair back and the light cast the shadows of his brows against his face so that he looked as if he were frowning suddenly but i dont think he was he had an amiable face well composed contemplative he looked the kind of man i could have soldiered with in a different world but there was the risk here of deceiving myself i was also dangerous and had been known to kill this wasnt his office we were sitting in it was one of the so his hands pushing at the table your name is not kirov and your papers are false weve been through the main computer kapista mikhail kirov born in skvira in the ukraine died at the age of seven months of pneumonia you should have bought some better shoes he smiled comfortably they too had their little jokes shoes meant walking papers ie passport but my papers werent forged they were false and he knew that london doesnt forge anything if it can get the real thing and put a photograph on it it saves all the fussing about with sized safety paper and fugitive dyes and watermarks and perforations and datecoded numerals but the problem with using genuine papers is that a good computer can dig through the historical records and find the grave requiescat in pace i said mm oh he smiled dutifully the thing was i couldnt lie and i couldnt tell the truth i had to say nothing in the silence i noticed the marks on the table narrow parallel striations i wondered what they were id like you to tell me vader said about yourself he was different i began listening theres not much to tell i said all the same id like to hear it well i slipped on the snow and hit my face against some railings your people picked me up thinking i was someone else that wasnt my fault he watched me with his head slightly on one side like an amiable ginger cat very well you slipped on the snow and hurt yourself but what are you doing with false papers what is your real identity i cant tell you that colonel it would mean letting someone down letting someone down in russian the idiom is perhaps ambiguous betraying them it was as far as i could go he knew i wasnt kapista mikhail kirov and he knew i was the man whod come out of that crash and run for cover but that was all he must know yes he said easily i understand that but we want to know all about you and we shall succeed in doing that as im sure you are aware but i thought we might start like this with just the two of us talking around a table he leaned forward slightly and his leather belt creaked i dont consider this a waste of time i regard it as a gesture of hospitality we are a hospitable people he leaned back again i appreciate that i said he hadnt looked behind me yet at the little screen he was handling this on his own so far there wasnt a lot i could do to change the pattern he was going to give me a chance of talking freely then if i chose not to he was going to force me or have me forced i could speed things up or delay them but not by much it wasnt that i hadnt been prepared for this croder had pitched me into the field with fight cover at short notice and id known what to expect if i got caught this talking of hospitality vader said would you like a drink a little vodka not now i would be happy to join you you go ahead if youd like something yourself he shook his head smiling im rather too fond of it be said in a stage whisper and the smile became a chuckle there was no point in speeding things up but there was a point in delaying things there might somewhere in the next few days be a chance of getting out of this alive just a chance in a thousand but it wasnt going to be fun delaying things because it would give me a lot more time to anticipate what they would finally do to me if that chance never came which intelligence branch are you in vader asked with polite interest what makes you think im in intelligence oh false papers an attempt at surveillance an attempt to avoid arrest a reluctance to betray your cell good heavens ive been through all that myself plenty of times the smile relaxed london are you the problem i said with security people is that they see everything from their own specialized point of view i suppose thats true of most people what i mean is betrayal isnt confined to the intelligence services one can betray a friend oh agreed also of course oneself he pushed his redhaired hands across the surface of the table watching them as a human creature for example youve no wish to suffer pain but if the ego decides you shall submit to it that would be a kind of betrayal wouldnt you say his hands stopped moving i supposed by this time bracken would have started worrying extension would have reported no signal at eightfifteen ninefifteen tenfifteen so forth i wondered when hed tell london shapiro gone quiller gone not really their day the red lamp over the board for scorpion would still be on but one day theyd have to switch it off that man whod been on the stool would reach up and flick the lever and go on sucking on his bloody chewinggum and tilson would go padding quietly back to the caff in his plaid slippers and bury his face in a cup of tea we got this from the foreign office just now di have located q in one of the potma complex camps no tried twenty years better put out the light were getting into philosophy i told vader if i decide to go the whole way rather than let down my friend thats what ill finish up doing for a few seconds we watched each other across the table then he leaned back tilting the chair under him as you know intelligence agents hold a certain degree of what shall we say sympathy for one another especially for their opposite numbers a grudging regard mm thats understandable surely we share the same kind of experience so im inclined to put myself in your place at the moment because ive actually been there once or twice he looked up at me apologetically though i have to admit that i was never in your exact predicament what i want you to understand is that i dislike the idea of your having to submit to indignities even though you may choose to let it happen i really do dislike it very much he leaned forward again and spoke earnestly id see myself there in your place that is why im offering you this chance of doing all the talking around a table you see he really wanted an answer of course i said id feel the same way myself im sure he smoothed the surface of the table im quite sure like the walls and the door the table was green with the wood grain showing through in places especially where the long narrow striations had formed also he said i want you to know that im a family man i have a charming wife and two pretty daughters ten and twelve years old with red hair did you guess he threw back his head and laughed about this so you see underneath the uniform theres just an ordinary man like yourself with very human instincts this is another reason why i hope youll save us both a lot of misery surely you understand yes i said i understand then lets make a fresh start he tilted his head in curiosity who are you this was the first phase who are you he screamed and brought the flat of his hand crashing against the table who are you i cant tell you the chair toppled and hit the floor as i got up and faced him his rage had got me on to my feet because he was towering over me and i thought he might lash out and i had to be ready in this mood he could half kill me if i let him your identity your identity i demand to know your identity the amber eyes burned in his face this was the second phase and id been expecting it because it was a classic procedure and hed been so bloody cosy the first time that i knew he was going to do this the next time we met but it still took some handling because his rage wasnt spurious he wasnt a man who liked being blocked are you english his hand hit the table again are you from london answer me the table was rocking i moved away from it wary hed be strong and fast and well trained and i didnt know his breaking point the point when hed lose his control he was working for mother russia and for mother russia hed smash a million englishmen against the wall answer me the blood had left my face i could feel it it had gone to the muscles and the adrenalin was ready the organism was triggered and what i had to do now was watch him watch his every move in case he lost control and wanted blood for the sake of blood tell me who you are tell me his wide leather belt came off so fast i was into a knife stance but he brought it down across the flat top of the table with a sound that cracked through the confines of the small bare room and i reacted the edge of my hand was lined up with the carotid nerve of his neck and the mental rehearsal was already over and the hand was ready to lift and strike with the accuracy of an automaton you were carrying false papers and you were following one of our citizens and you tried to avoid arrest and now you refuse to explain your actions he took two paces towards me and i sank an inch lower solidifying the stance do you know how many years that would get you in a forced labour camp do you i would let him take one more step if i let him come closer than that he could do some damage the element of surprise was on his side when you dont know when the opponent is going to attack theres no real problem you just have to wait but when you dont know if hes going to attack it can be very difficult because youre liable to let the hairspring off the hook and get to him first and it might not be necessary i didnt want to break his clavicle or paralyse him by going in too fast they wouldnt like me for that he started shouting again bringing the belt cracking down for emphasis stopping to glare at me with his eyes narrowed to slits and his teeth bared how do we know what harm you might not be planning against our country how do we know what appalling danger you might not be placing our citizens in this man you were following did you intend to kill him did you the belt snaked down and left another weal across the top of the table the sweat was bright on his face under the white light trickling to the edge of his collar he was following the prescribed routine but he also believed in what he was saying this was his city his country and i was an unknown danger i could see his point of view who was this man you were following when i heard that i didnt believe it who was he his rage was genuine and he couldnt think clearly enough to use subterfuge yet he couldnt be serious about this i just didnt believe it answer me the belt sent a sliver of wood flying from the table i dont know i said it was the first time id spoken and the sound of someone elses voice got through to him and he stood still and stared at me what are you standing like that for he asked with suspicion are you thinking of attacking me his wide chest heaved under his uniform as his lungs worked to recover oxygen do you know what they would do to you for attacking a colonel of the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnos for attacking him physically in his own headquarters they would have you shot he was being very russian anyone who can read a newspaper knows that once youre inside the headquarters of the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnost on the wrong end of the banana youre not going to come out looking all that fit but i wasnt interested in that i was getting terribly interested in this thing about the man id been following because vader didnt seem to know his name or mine it was unbelievable the first time hed asked me who i was i knew id have to start listening because this was a different approach they usually want you to feel they know everything about you what i couldnt believe was that ignatov had made a phone call in the street and told them to pick me up and theyd done that but they didnt know his name and they didnt know mine something wrong there of course id get shot i told him and turned away and folded my arms but what dyou think im going to do if you start putting that fucking belt of yours across me just stand there he dropped it on to the table and started walking from one wall to the other his squaretoed boots landing flat on the floor with no spring in them his arms held slightly forward like a bears as if he were looking for something to break for some kind of life to crush out he was my height and heavier and all muscle and he could kill me in an even match but i didnt think it was even because theyre exceptionally fussy at norfolk they dont send you into the field unless you can take on a tank and get the tracks off without a lot of deep breathing who were you following he swung round hitting a fist into a palm back on that track fascinating how the hell should i know i asked him i was following him to find out who he was i dont have to accept that you bloody well do he started walking again from wall to wall he must have seen a lot of this place look at that table why did you want to find out who he was who put you on to him it was difficult because we didnt really have a topic for conversation he knew i was some kind of agent because we get to recognize the signs in one another my behaviour in this room confined with a kgb colonel who was ready to flay me alive was totally different from the behaviour of an innocent tourist whod slipped on the snow and got snatched by mistake because hed injured his face you cant do this to me i want my lawyer here ill have you charged with wrongful arrest so forth this man knew i was an agent but as an agent i couldnt tell him anything and he understood that and he was annoyed because he was trying to build a reputation as a red hot interrogator who could get information out of anyone they sent to him and without having to throw him to the downs to work over because that takes a lot of time if you want to go after all the information hes got in his brain you cant rush things its no good just poking a red hot needle into his urethra and saying now talk because hell either pass out or scream unintelligible things and the most you can do is get one word out of him at a time one name one target one key to one code youve got to spend days at it with some of them vader stopped walking and picked up the belt hed lost a lot of his colour and the sweat was drying on him and there was foam at the comers of his mouth i will ask you one more time who are you kapista kirov i told you the computers have gone on the blink it wasnt a lie and it wasnt the truth and he knew that it was all i was going to tell him nothing like saying it looks as if were going to get some more rain again very well the belt hit the table and the sound went round the walls like an explosion you realize we shall get this information from you in the end dont you of course you do we shall use every method available to us every technique every refinement we shall show you no mercy you understand me yes very well bring on the clowns rainbows the rat sat preening its whiskers i watched it it sat with its rear paws spread on the ground their tips visible at the edge of the grey fur body the front paws worked rhythmically pulling each fine whisker through the toes from the root to the tip it hadnt seen the snake i watched the snake it was rockstill coiled in a perfect ring with the angular head slightly lifted and pointing in the direction of the rat the distance between them was about three feet the snake was large and i could see that its length was quite sufficient to carry the jaws that far when it struck the rat was facing at rightangles to the snake its round black eyes reflected the environment in miniature i think it saw the snake in terms of light reception by the retinae but didnt know what it was the brain interpreted it as a rock formation or just a pattern of light and shade otherwise it wouldnt be sitting there i detected movement now in the snake though it was so slow that it was almost an illusion the pointed head was drawing back millimetre by millimetre across the coils the neck flexing to keep the head pointing directly at the rat at the same time the coils were tensing as the muscular energygathered and flowed preparing for the whiplash speed of the strike the rat was oblivious of this movement once it turned its head for an instant but away from the snake catching some small sound that escaped me then it went on preening i watched quietly wondering if then the snake struck like a whip and the rat wake up the rat tried to leap but wake up wake up i swung my head up and opened my eyes and called out all right im awake now why dont you bugger off blinding light are you awake yes bugger off the light was above the door and angled downwards a flood bulb in it so that there was nowhere in the cell where i could get away from it the glare hid the small sliding panel immediately below the light so that i couldnt see him watching me it was the third time hed woken me up third or fourth it didnt matter but id have to start counting things like that because some of them would be important call it the third time and start counting from there bloody snake id dreamed about that before i suppose it was that long leather belt whipping through the air at the table where was vader now sleeping theyd taken my watch and there wasnt a window only a ventilation grille near the ceiling clamped across a square of darkness that didnt mean it was night necessarily this was a close confinement chamber for sleep deprivation and disorientation so they would have fixed the grille accordingly the metabolic clock pulsing in my system told me it was midnight give or take an hour but that wasnt reliable because id fallen asleep three times three or four three yes a man screamed suddenly from somewhere close and i sat listening to him with the sweat springing on my skin ignore ignore and do some work of course theyd started with an advantage today was wednes no yes wednesday and on monday id still been in england hanggliding over the cliffs and from the time when norton had escorted me to london that bastard croder had had me on a pinball table berlin hanover leipzig moscow and the only sleep id had was a couple of hours on the mountainside after lie truck had crashed and a few hours at the safehouse last night five or six hours in sixtyfour not enough and if id known the rat was going to sit there i would have look out its going to strike again wake up i am awake i cant you tell when someones asleep or awake for christs sake you were falling asleep i go and screw yourself then the man started screaming again next door and i had to listen to it until it was cut off abruptly and all i could hear was my own breathing bastards do some work oh yes well the terribly interesting thing is this they dont know my name and they dont know ignatovs unbelievable i mean what did he say when he phoned them theres a man in a pobeda tagging me pick him up that wouldnt have been enough to trigger all that action a whole fleet of police cars and militia theyd have asked him who i was and why it was so important but ignatov hadnt known he didnt know anything about me so what had he told diem what information had he given them to persuade them to throw all that action at me he didnt have any information sweating i was starting to sweat because of the cerebration and the heat of the floodlight all right thats one thing take the other these people here dont know ignatovs name either or anything about him except that he made a phone call from a public box what had he shown that militia man to get a salute what name had he given over the phone he couldnt have given them any name or vader would know it and believe me he wouldnt have asked me for that mans name unless hed wanted it it wasnt part of the technique or a feint question because he was in a rage at the time piping hot so there you are an unknown man rings up the security forces and tells them to pick up another unknown man and that is precisely what they do in full force and with no questions asked unbelievable i suppose that was why vader was so bloody annoyed but dont forget one thing old boy this isnt so funny it looks like a judas operation a judas somewhere in brackens team out to blow me successfully not funny bracken ought to be told vader old horse can i use your phone turn round what turn round face the light why dont you buzz off you come in here my son and ill go for your throat and youll never know your eyes popped out before you snuffed im getting cross im getting cross i yelled at the light repeat that watch it watch it did i use english then i am a russian citizen i speak only russian i will repeat that oh shut up will you yes id said it in english and the bastard bad caught it he might not recognize english but hed heard something foreign this was getting dangerous perhaps it was time to blow the fuse i had the whole of london in my head inside this sweating brightlyilluminated skull names duties operations di liaison signals codes the whole thing it was time to think about the fuse but before i did that i ought to tell bracken he had a judas in moscow whod blown me just as hed blown schrenk a judas working through ignatov footsteps or it could be ignatov himself thatd shake them by god i need all info on natalya fyodarova senior clerk kremlin office companion of subject before arrest also dl info on pyotr ignatov party member often in subjects company no other details known shake them rigid was bracken trying to get a signal to me while i was sitting here in this bloody place re info requested ignatov is one of our people state reason for request no reason really except that i dont like being blasted off the street nor did schrenk signal ends query if ignatov is a judas working inside brackens operation why dont the kgb know about him thats a nasty one hed been coming out of the telephone box not looking around him in the beginning beginning to snow with the icecream waving about in the air the air trying to catch watch it wake up wake up i got on to my feet and threw a wheelkick at the door controlling it enough to make a noise without hurting my foot does that sound as if im asleep keep away from the door voices they were talking id forgotten about the footsteps i backed away from the door because this could be interesting it could be someone else wanting to talk to me and i felt murderous and i might decide to take someone with me a halffist into the thyroid with enough force to kill a matter of seconds and nothing they could do in time to save him watch that too emotion was dangerous because theyd got a red lamp over a board marked scorpion in london and the executive in the field for the operation was holed up in a disorientation cell in lubyanka prison and hed have to get out and if he couldnt even control his emotions hed never make it so start thinking with the brain instead of the gut this is life or death bolts drawing back two men one of them beckoned you will come with us they walked on each side of me along the greenpainted corridor and stopped outside a door halfway along assume clowns now wont you sit down different room id rather stand i need some exercise id est i am not sleepy different room or just a different table this one with a plain surface with no belt marks on it need to observe more efficiently i ought to know whether this is a different room or only a different table i expect you do he said apologetically im not responsible for everything that goes on here you must understand otherwise he spread out his hand your accommodation would be different he waited for me to say something but i couldnt think of anything i had to detach myself from him and work out my own game while he worked out his making contact only when i needed information i had to start thinking and if possible acting the emotional phase was over theyd taken me quite a long way into sleep deprivation and produced an initial reaction childishness the urge to attack them they were probably going to take me much deeper they hadnt started using this particular technique with the intention of stopping halfway but from now on i would have to work out the necessary defences im afraid i rather lost my temper colonel vader said i do hope youll forgive me he paused but i didnt say anything we people have too lively a sense of the dramatic perhaps make a lot of noise with a rueful laugh let off a lot of steam mm look at our music look at our grand opera you see what i mean he stepped rhythmically from wall to wall declining to sit down since i wouldnt he had manners give him that i began pacing too for the exercise and because it would express freedom of movement but i went from left to right while he went from right to left it would look ridiculous if both of us went the same way prince igor i said always admired it lot of fire thats exactly what i mean he said in relief and turned to me with a laugh of understanding as a matter of fact i dont remember much about what i said to you and all i hope is that it was nothing too offensive he spread his hand again put it down to an unseemly outburst of russian temperament mm as if speaking to a nonrussian noted bit hard on the table i said and he laughed boyishly deep from the chest we went on walking like two prisoners in an exercise yard talking to each other across an invisible wall he walked neatly with his hands folded behind his back and his polished boots clumping down solidly on the parquet floor heel and toe together its difficult for you he said and stopped suddenly swinging the chair on his side halfway round and resting one boot on it facing me with his intelligent amber eyes and quite frankly you know its difficult for me too i went on walking but turned to look at him from time to time he was being quite civilized and that quiet murderous rage id felt in the detention cell had evaporated why dont you make it easier i asked him not meaning to be funny a full colonel must carry quite a bit of clout in this place my dear fellow i only wish i could i say that quite sincerely hed lowered his voice and i had to stop walking to listen i had the strange urge to swing my chair halfway round and rest one foot on it but that too would be ridiculous as if there were only one of us here and a mirror the problem he said quietly is that i would need your cooperation and youre proving how shall i put it rather hesitant i compromised and swung the chair round and sat on it with my arms folded along its back so that i could face him his smile was tentative as he waited for me to comment on that and his expression was perfectly genuine it occurred to me that if i admitted what he already suspected that i was in fact from london he might reciprocate by youre idling asleep youre not thinking straight hes not perfectly genuine and hes not being civilized and he doesnt have any manners and if you admit youre from london youre right in the shit so start waking up hed begun to blur in front of me swaying back and then forward i got into focus again and he stopped this was one of the classic techniques interrogation sessions alternating between friendliness and hostility to get you so confused you started blurting things out and you always believe if ii never work because youre too bloody smart that he said with quiet charm is the problem problem we would require your cooperation if we were to make things easier for you he stood away from the chair and took a pace or two deliberating coming back if you could overcome your hesitation you see we might arrange something to our mutual advantage another rueful laugh im sorry to have to beat about the bush like this but i cant trust you until you trust me he sat on the chair backwards just as i was sitting as if in sympathy not in sympathy arrangement i asked him kept having to refocus yes his honeycoloured eyes played directly on to my own for a moment as he deliberated again you know what im going to do im going to take a risk to show we can be just as sincere as i know you would really like to be im going to trust you he sat back a little regarding me with open candour now how does that sound i allowed an appropriate period of hesitation before i spoke generous he sat back and slapped his big square hands together pleased as a boy im delighted you think so i really am delighted yes im being generous i freely admit it with his head tilted slightly as if hed suddenly seen me in a new light you know i was certain wed find a way of putting our heads together if we tried now this arrangement he hesitated a fraction then went on im going to put it to you quite frankly theres someone we want to find very badly and if you were able to tell us whets he is wed bring him in and exchange him for you wed let you go he leaned forward confidentially his name is schrenk i tilted my chair back watching him he was waiting for me to say something but i didnt want to commit myself without thinking it over and he got impatient and stood up and whirled his sabre slovo o polku igoreve you said you always admired it remember he threw out his chest and began singing his voice wake up wake up i jerked my head back sorry blinding light you must stay awake yes ill do that i sat straighter on the stool and let my head go back against the wall he knew what i was doing but it was all right because i had to keep my eyes open so hed know if i dozed off again with my head back the light was fierce a burning disc that wavered at the rim as if i were staring into the sun but at the same time i could slip into a kind of halfsleep somewhere between the alpha and theta waves without losing too much awareness theyd let me take off my jacket and i was sitting with my arms resting on my thighs with the sweat trickling down to the elbows i was soaked with it because of the lamps heat and the stress going on in the organism my head was a ball floating in the sea of light drifting and bobbing with the images going on inside it his name is schrenk that threw me yes threw me completely so they hadnt got him so where was he i think it was okay the way i reacted i mean by not reacting shook my head dont know him but threw me really bracken ought i to know vader old boy mind if i use your blower no idea of what time now day night anything maybe night now it seemed worse diurnal rhythms very slow cortical vigilance down way down down wake up wake up shouting in the glare sorry wake now reticular formation lagging yes the process thoroughly understood tell you everything you need to know at norfolk bloody place wish i was wish i was there dogs barking somewhere hate those bloody things id begun hearing them same time when id seen the fish swimming in the light all colours of rainbow swimming round and round and round and wake up wake up oh shit i straightened up again and felt for the wall with the back of my head and then took it off again because i had to do some thinking i was leaving it late now i knew theyd got me they were going to trot me along to vader again and i wouldnt be able to take any more id just go to sleep and theyd keep on waking me up and finally theyd bring on the clowns and id start talking without even knowing what i was doing blow london no go capsule but that was down the drain so id have to do it the other way bite through the median cubital artery and wait sixty seconds finis lorenz had done it in chile when the terror squads had strung him upside down from a swing in a childrens playground he didnt want to play any more messy but then he wasnt going to have to clear it up finito one little problem though they never left me alone even when i asked for the lav they stood there with the door open in case i shoved my head in never left me alone watching me now man up there with his eyes in the hole behind the hot bright light bastards lea me alone lea me alone you bastards all i want is sixty seconds bite and then spurt spurt spurt and london safe man screaming next door me screaming no other man shuddup screaming cant stand it sweet jesus i want to sleep wake up and think think about london its the last chance but they wont lea me alone watching me all the time i could do it in sixty seconds but they keep going round and round and rainbows round and wake up wake up yes yes wake now sleep softly go sleep london what yes all right do it in the room with the table only the two of us vader and me energy of rage and finish him off and then bite the artery bite bite before anyone comes can do that yes can do that wake up yes wake up yes remember london rage so this was the place was it id thought it was going to be some other place so often the street outside the hotel africa in tunis when the car had gone up or ten fathoms down at longitude and latitude in the waters off hong kong or in that hot stinking room on the amazon when shed found me there and gone on squeezing the trigger no not in any of those places here in a city under snow in a bleak greenpainted room twelve feet by fourteen with a door two feet eleven inches wide and a window five feet three inches high and nothing in it but a lamp and two chairs and a table and the man the last man i would ever see the man who didnt know i was the last man he himself would ever see we had a jot in common i dont want to die oh its you is it snivelling little organism starting to panic shut up it wont hurt we can get out of here if we try oh really the light shone down this wasnt the table with the smooth top it was the one with the narrow marks on it the two guards had only just gone out shutting the door vader was standing under the window watching me with the blank stare of the predator that contemplates the prey without emotion his honeycoloured eyes unblinking and his big square hands iii hanging by his sides his booted feet set in a balanced stance ready for instant movement he was a strong man and young for his rank the room was so quiet that i could hear the faint rustling creak of his leather belt as he breathed my patience is exhausted all on one note and with the words drawn out his mouth moving like a trap the sound went into my head and beat there hammering i hadnt been ready for it and my nerves werent too good it made me blink and he noticed it i saw it in his eyes the satisfaction of the victor in the presence of the vanquished sleep dont take any london remember london my head came up a fraction and i was warned it had been dropping degree by degree as the soporific wave had crept over me despite the shock of his voice london yes do you understand the voice of a bull roaring out of the barrel chest and drumming in the room think about what has to be done it has to be done in the next sixty seconds or i wont have the strength left i dont want to die shuddup i had to take him down and i had to do it with all the speed i could manage and with all the force standing here thinking about it i could believe i would never do it but i knew from experience what the mind can make the body do if enough depends on it i wasnt worried about that vader was mine unless hed had my specific style of training the enemy was in myself in my emotions in the undisciplined tides of feeling that can stifle logic and inhibit action moira is that your own code five hundred roses for moira to be delivered only after she has been informed by the bureau where was she now the tides of feeling yes that would have to be ignored because they were irrelevant and dangerous take him down and with as little force as necessary so that i would find the strength let him comeclose first i have given you every possible chance of cooperating and you have refused he began walking dropping his boots squarely on the worn parquet walking towards me do you happen to enjoy the kind of interrogation you will receive at the serbsky institute mm he stopped within three feet of me it wasnt close enough are you a masochist sleep dear god let me sleep he was blurring again in front of me his thick body swaying gently backwards and forwards sending me to wake up come on wake up answer me yes keep him talking keep him close i cant think straight thats all too tired i heard the words slurring couldnt quite recognize the voice too tired and you think that is all thats going to happen to you do you rehearse a preliminary shankutsu my left foot behind his right heel with a spinning nagashi at the jodan level my right fingers hooking for the eyes then the handedge to the throat half an inch above the khaki serge collar then the work on myself at the median cubital artery rehearse no i know whats going to happen to me rehearse shankutsu nagashi eyes and the handedge then why do you refuse to cooperate shouting at me as if i were fifty yards away his voice roaring inside my skull told you i said id betray a friend friend he pulled one of the chairs away from the table and sent it crashing into a corner of the room one of its legs flying off and hitting the barred window what friend he came closer his amber eyes staring into my face you mean schrenk he came right up to me do you mean your friend schrenk he was close enough and i shifted my left foot and got the nagashi spinning and in the next tenth of a second i saw surprise beginning in his eyes as he started pitching back with my foot blocking his heel before i formed the clawhand and raked at his face he wasnt off balance yet but his arm swung up and he lost the last of his equilibrium and the strike missed my head and he fell hard harder than i was ready for with my fingers too far from his eyes and my hand going sat and moving fast to bridge the gap and swing down for the throat with enough force to toll but something crashed and i was on top of him and striking much too short as the door hit the wall and they took me from behind pulling my arms back and locking them so that i had to stop moving no go it was no gorage burning inside my skull rage and the hot bright light my head had been dropping on to my chest and at first i had pulled it up again from habit to avoid that bloody mans voice up there where the light was then i had let it rest there my head and nothing had happened he hadnt yelled at me to wake up i might even have slept but i didnt know for how long not long the urge to drop my head again and sleep and go on sleeping was overwhelming but i couldnt do that i had to work rage against myself of course for getting it wrong for not thinking for not realizing they must have a closedcircuit television camera behind the dark glass of the window they wouldnt be so stupid as to leave one of their colonels in there with people who might not like him theyd been worried about him but hed just said im all right and walked out of the room without looking at me as if i didnt exist as if i hadnt just tried to kill him i got the point hed been obliged to brush off a fly we hadnt known each other for long but wed learned things about each other and hed learned i had a streak of pride and was therefore sensitive work yes i let my head fall again and waited but the man didnt shout i shut my eyes and waited again but nothing happened he might not be there he might not be watching me the median cubital artery runs down the inside of the arm and its easy to reach it with the mouth but the action is obvious so i took off my shoe and lobbed it up at the light and made sure it missed the butt before i caught it stop that what do you think youre doing message received its too bloody bright i said and sat down again on the stool and put my shoe on and turned round to face the wall and let my head go down that seemed to be all right because he didnt say anything i was to be watched but not forced to stay awake or face the light what had he said the serbsky institute where the clowns worked when there was nothing in here i could drain into there were only the walls and the floor and this stool and the lamp i was sitting with my back to him now and i could fold my arms and let my head go down heavy with sleep until my mouth was against the inside of one wrist and he might not see the movement of my jaws from behind but once it started flowing thered be a gallon and a half and there was nothing to drain into hed see it dripping on to the floor and hed have time to come in here and use the pressure point and call for help and vader would ask for a transfusion because he wasnt finished with me yet hed only just started they wanted to find schrenk and they thought i knew where he was i could feel the heat of the lamp on the back of my head my shadow was clear cut swelling and contracting against the wall as i swayed an inch forward an inch back trying to stay awake trying to think it became a slow rhythm and at some time i must have slept still more or less upright on the stool backwards and forwards rocking like an animal in a cage the footsteps came out of a dream and into reality thudding from the distance along the corridor outside my cell then voices i stayed where i was it was comfortable here against the wall with my companionable shadow this had become my home my querencia this place defined by my shadows height and my shadows width was part of my identity now they mustnt out mustnt take me away stand up out i hadnt heard them opening the door i suppose id been asleep dreaming about identity when i looked round i saw colonel vader there with three other men two of them in uniform he stood gazing in at me with that predatory stare for a moment then a look of disgust came to his face he stinks i put him under a shower and find some sort of clothing for him and dont be long about it he turned and went out he shouldnt have said that come on out i went with them along the corridor to the prisoners ablutions a stone floor and zinc basins and open toilets and a row of showers the water freezing hitting me like a burst of glass fragments shrinking my head and roaring in my ears he shouldnt have said that the block of abrasive soap scouring my skin the face wound burning and throbbing but my eyes resting soothed at last after the glare of that blinding light a strip of sacking for a towel and my hair still wet when they took me away and threw me a sweater to wear instead of my shirt it had been soaked in sweat and that was why hed said what he had correction that was the excuse my whole body tingling and most of the torpor gone from my mind remember london come on in here back in the cell again not mine this time a smaller one with no window a slatted bench with one leg at an angle and bloodstains across the top and repeated on the wall the smell of the human animal that had been in here schrenk there was no means of knowing there were fifty of these cells in the groundfloor block wait here no option they slammed the door and locked it i realized yes that with my shirt like that i was stinking to high heaven but he shouldnt have pointed it out he had done it to humiliate me crossing the dividing line between the area where the captor and the captive are two civilized men and the area where one is a man and the other has become a pig its a critical stage in the business of interrogation and he had introduced it deliberately i knew that but it didnt make any difference i walked from wall to wall in the narrow cell seven paces and back from the door to the window drops of water still fell from my wet hair and i pulled off the sweater theyd given me and tousled my head with it putting it on again and feeling the dampness against my chest and my back the lamp in here was a naked bulb of low wattage and gave no heat i began shivering and walked faster there wasnt anything else i could do i could see his eyes every time i moved towards the door watching from the oblong panel above it they came for me soon afterwards three plainclothes men and vader still in uniform and now wearing a greatcoat and peaked cap is he washed yes colonel bring him then hurry it was some time in the night pilot lamps were burning along the corridors and the big high windows were dark with a seepage of neon light from the streets along their frames tell this man where we are taking him grekov one of them spoke from beside me we are taking you to the serbsky institute he was a squat man in a dark coat i could smell tobacco on him the two others had an air of higher rank walking in front of us one on each side of vader tell him he will now be interrogated under extreme physical duress you will now be interrogated under extreme physical duress grunted the man beside me but the sense of it didnt get through to me i was thinking of the other thing vader had said the man beside me was armed i could smell the gun oil they would all be armed they walked in step with vader but i didnt follow the rhythm once as we passed the main offices near the entrance to the building the squat man looked down and gave my foot a quick little kick to get me into step but i didnt do what he wanted has he heard of the serbsky institute grekov have you heard of the serbsky institute i didnt answer vader would have to ask me himself repeat the question hove you heard of the serbsky institute answer they bothered me with their voices i needed to think but i had heard yes of the serbsky institute of forensic psychiatry its an old granite building with iron gates and armed sentries containing mostly political wards where those straying from the party line are submitted to special diagnosis and subsequent treatment one of the techniques involves wrapping the patient in wet canvas and as it slowly dries he is asked if he feels ready to change his heretical views or confess or reveal whatever he is there to reveal i didnt know how schrenk had held out against that without losing his mind maybe hed lost it and it was an animal that had escaped not schrenk at all have you heard of thats enough grekov he probably doesnt understand the question colonel then one of the big doors swung back and we went down the steps into the snow the city had changed since id been brought in here the slate roofs and parapets were white under the black sky with the greenish neon glowing on it theatrically the snow was soft under our feet as we reached the black saloon the man called grekov opened one of the rear doors and told me to get in vader went round to the other side another man was right behind me and as i climbed in he gave me a push and got in after me slamming the door i was now wedged between him and vader with the two others in front grekov at the wheel the windows were all closed and the doorlocks down when grekov started the engine and switched on the headlights the guards at the main gates swung one of them open and we drove through i could hear chains clinking on the tyres the snow was still falling and dzerzhinsky square was covered there was no traffic i couldnt see a clock but i was watching for one the heater was now blowing and the chill of my wet hair began warming i had strange feelings about the man beside me he shouldnt have said that i knew it was part of the routine but that didnt make any difference he shouldnt have said it this comprised most of my feelings about him but there were other things id seen him as a friendly cultivated man and as a brute in a towering rage and these roles had alternated so that my attitude towards him had started to be ambivalent hed got closer than he knew to burrowing into my mind while it was half submerged in sleep i think in another twentyfour hours he would have got me blurting things out between hallucinations i even believe he might have known how close hed come to success but what he couldnt take was the way id attacked him and actually got him on to the floor before the guards had come in it had hit a major nerve in him deep in the psyche and all he lived for now was to see me under treatment at the serbsky institute to hear me scream when the clowns went to work i believe he was that sensitive i too am a sensitive man one of the chains was slightly loose and kept hitting the underneath of the wing producing a hollow sound like a drummer tapping for the dead i could see the gold domes of st basils now in red square and the clock in spassky tower at too sharp an angle to let me read it the city was beautiful tonight its floodlit domes and spires and minarets half lost in the veils of falling snow i was seeing it as id never seen it before like a tourist with time to spare colonel vader was holding himself away from me as much as he could and letting me know it i didnt stink any more but i was still untouchable the pig thing that has been squatting there in its cage mired in its own dirt and unable to urinate or defaecate without begging permission that was his picture of me now and he wanted me to know it he wasnt prepared even to talk to me without using grekov as a sanitizing intermediary i didnt mind what he did now it would be insignificant compared to what he had done what he had said when hed come into my cell i dont think he realized that grekov drove quite fast considering the state of the streets i suppose the snow wasnt deep yet and there were the chains on the tyres and he knew his way it wouldnt have been possible without the chains because the car would have gone straight on with the front wheels locked over at one stage i caught sight of vaders face in the fraction of a second distorting as the rear wheel went over it but the rest wasnt easily remembered because everything went so fast i think one of them had a gun out before i reached the steering wheel but there wasnt any shot the initial move wasnt complicated i had to hit the back of the seat to produce the necessary momentum and get to the wheel as soon as i could my right foot smashed into the face of the man on that side and i felt the softness caving in but my main concern was to reach that wheel and wrench it over my shoulder hit the back of the drivers head and pitched him forward and then the chains bit and the car lurched and lost traction and slid and then lurched again with the chains gouging into the road surface and swinging us halfway round before it rolled the speed at this time wasnt much less than the eighty kph id seen on the speedometer just before i began moving and the roll took us through most of the deceleration phase and lasted until the rear end hit a street lamp and the windscreen blew out in a shower of glass someone had begun screaming and it took me a little time to realize it was the man whod put a stranglehold on me id broken his thumb to make him release it it was soon after this that i saw the gun in someones hand but i wasnt worried because he couldnt use it we were in the middle of a storm and the car was still moving fast enough to kill the lot of us if it hit another street lamp at the wrong angle it was sliding on its side at this time and the front end was coming round in a flurry of snow as it ploughed the surface and id have to wait before i tried getting dear because i could get an arm or a leg trapped between the bodywork and the road someone was yelling something about not letting me get away and i used his voice as a guide and found his throat and used a halffist with a short thrust and felt it break the cartilage at this stage i began noticing blood quite a lot of it shining with an odd purplish colour because of the neon lights someone must have been trapped by the weight of our bodies against the glass of a window as it shattered on impact with the road it would be the man whod been yelling inside the storm of the vehicle there was the storm of vaders rage he was in first class condition and had kept most of his orientation when the car had rolled and he was the worst thing i had to contend with because it depended a lot on chance whether any of us got out of the wreck but vader wanted to kill me and he knew how to do it and he knew where i was conscious imagery was sporadic and the sequence of events so fast that the brain had to select and analyse as best it could id actually glimpsed vaders face three or four times but thered been no particular expression on it until now when i suddenly saw it very close and immediately above me part of my mind was occupied with data to do with the engine which had been screaming under full throttle with the gears knocked into neutral the scream was now dying away as the fuel emptied from the carburettor and the cylinders began starving i could smell the stuff and was alerted if the car caught fire i would get out without waiting for the speed to decrease the main cerebral area was occupied with the splitsecond sight of vaders face as he in turn saw mine and recognized it his was totally animal as i suppose mine was teeth bared and the eyes luminous the nostrils wide and the scalp drawn back totally primitive i only saw him for this small fraction of a second before the car hit something again and we were tumbled all of us into a different order but his hands knew where i was and they came for me working for my throat and doing it so fast that i wasnt ready i used a fourfinger eye dart with both hands but missed and tried again and missed again and felt softness close to me and went for that with one knee and got it right his hands came away and i waited but he couldnt find me again because the car was rolling for the last time and the rear window burst and sent glass flying against our faces there was nothing he could have done to me in any case nothing listen i want you to understand something they were taking me to the serbsky institute to throw me into another cell and put me through the most exquisite physical and mental agony that has ever been devised by modern neurotic man and i was frightened of that but i wasnt frightened enough because theres always release from agony and its certain the organism finally seeks to be insensate in death so i dont think the fear of what they were going to do to me was enough to give me the incentive and the speed and the strength and the manic force i needed to take the action i did it was humiliation working through rage that committed me to taking that action in one instant of explosive dementia that had been building up in the psyche since he had come into my cell and said what he did so there was nothing he could have done to me i would have stopped him he shouldnt have said that i think i shouted at him as the car pitched against a kerb stone and rolled again i think i tried to tell him what had happened that he had said something wrong that i was a sensitive man and quick to take offence i heard my voice shouting something and it was to him so perhaps that was what i was saying then the car rolled again and i could smell the petrol fumes and feel them pricking against my eyes so i looked for the space where the windscreen had been my hands were sticky with blood and they slipped on the edge of the instrument panel as i used it for purchase but i managed to kick back against the seat squab and get the momentum i needed the car was still in motion when i slid across the bonnet and grabbed the windscreen pillar to save myself as it bounced for the last time and turned over on to its side this was when i caught a glimpse of vaders face again hed got out through one of the side windows and timed it badly because of the rolling movement and went down with his legs still inside and his hands trying to stop the impact as the car turned over on him his head was just in front of the rear wheel and there was still a certain amount of forward motion perhaps hed been trying to follow me out i dont know i began running snowball im getting out i said and he stopped dead and stood there watching me under the trees you cant do that i came back to him hands in the pockets of the torn coat bruises all over me the blood on my face sticking to the woollen scarf id put on under the fur hat my nerves still on the jump even after ten hours sleep if you could call it sleep jerking my eyes open every five minutes because i could still hear that bastard yelling at me from the panel over the door and now bracken trying to tell me what i could do and what i couldnt do this isnt my field i told him i need to work alone thered been two signals for me when id got back to the safehouse one in cypher one in code theyd been worried stiff because i hadnt reported so id called bracken by silent line at the embassy asking for an rdv that was four oclock this morning and now it was six at night and i was shaking with bad dreams and no use to london any more only a danger hed have to understand that what do you mean he asked me you need to work alone there are too many people involved one of them blasted me off the street id never seen him so still in the car last night hed been like a cat in a sack and id thought it was because he was nervous maybe i didnt know him very well he wasnt moving a muscle now and he must be half out of his mind after what id just said what happened he asked me i told him about ignatov and he stood thinking about it while i listened to those bloody children on the far side of the trees id seen them on my way into the park making a slide on the snow their voices unnerved me it sounded as if they were screaming ignatov bracken said quietly not really to me hes a judas someone who knows me youd better find who he is before he does something else i wished bracken would start walking again but he just went on standing there under the black winter trees appalled i felt sorry for him hed been thrown out here at a minutes notice just as i had and he didnt know half the contacts who were working for him he couldnt do this wasnt his field either he directed penetration operations through foreign embassies he wasnt moscow a judas he said on his breath so now you know why im getting out in surprise he said did your cover stand up no you mean they just let you go no they put me into lubyanka he watched me as if he were watching a fuse burning scared of what i was going to say next none of this was his fault it was croders the brilliant and persuasive croder chief of the london directorate you will receive every possible support so forth i shouldnt have listened to him but he knew how much i was prepared to do for a man like schrenk you got out bracken said tonelessly of lubyanka no they were taking me to the serbsky institute but mere was an accident i kept seeing that mans face under the wheel you always seem to remember the rotten bits one of their intelligence colonels got killed possibly two so you know what my chances are if i spend any time in the open street therell be a full scale hunt ordered and ive got a scar on my face you can see for miles so its a dead end are you getting the message i want out i stood listening to the thin distant screams of the children and the moan of the trams along soldatskaja ulica and someone saying he stinks put him under a shower a dangerous thing to have said the only satisfaction id had since i came out of london his face under the wheel was this why schrenk had been bitter after they put him through the same kind of thing was it really so impersonal after all ignatov for us what i turned to look at him london would ask you to get ignatov for us bracken said i hardly recognized his voice any more he was watching this mission being blown right out of his hands and he hadnt begun thinking of the repercussions londons already asked too much i told him they pulled me off leave too soon i wasnt ready for the stress quietly he said croder mentioned that yes and you mentioned it yourself got a good memory but it was all i could do not to walk away and leave him the whole bloody mess to look after because hed used the same tone as croder had and looked at me in the same way wondering if i was getting too old now too scared what were they trying to do push me over the edge were all of us quite aware he said in a low voice of how much were asking of you look its no big deal bracken i took on the job when i knew i wasnt ready for it and that was my fault but i need to work alone so that i car be absolutely sure that no ones going to judas me into lubyanka without any warning you cant expect anyone to work like that i turned and started walking through the trees and he had to come with me i needed movement i was frozen stiff standing there picking over the bits of a broken mission i wasnt used to it and i didnt know how to handle it and neither did bracken id agree to get ignatov for you and pull out afterwards but the streets are too dangerous now i would have asked you to meet me at the safehouse but im not even sure its safe any more i we tramped together through the snow the blind leading the blind the trees were darker here and i felt less exposed i have another safehouse for you bracken said and i thought oh christ hes not going to give up i would also guarantee that in future your only contact in moscow would be myself i didnt say anything i wasnt interested if theres a judas in the local network bracken said having to make himself say it make himself believe it we have to find him you do i dont hes your pigeon the snow kicked up from our shoes men over there three men over there keep an eye you know where to find him bracken said we dont i cant look for him not in the streets dont you have his address no they looked like businessmen officials of some kind but not in uniform they were walking towards the frozen pond and i watched them theyre all right bracken said dont worry those people yes theyre all right he walked closer to me protectively you think im paranoid or something i moved away from him bloody nursemaid id got the wrong director i should have been given ferris if youve just come out of lubyanka bracken said under your own steam youll feel a bit paranoid for a while we can accommodate that the three men were moving away from us towards the gates of the park they hadnt even seen us youll accommodate anything i do i said even if i shit down the chimney as long as i get ignatov for you right thats right he moved closer to me and got into step no go i said youll have to get him yourself what i want from you is a ticket home and i dont care what plane it is i said it to give him something to think about instead of thinking about ignatov he couldnt get me on a plane out of this city theyd lost schrenk and theyd lost kirov and theyd lost one of their colonels and theyd be looking for me under every stone i cant do that bracken said his voice was low and steady and id been thinking hed got over the worst of the shock but i wasnt sure now he could be containing it and bulldozing his way to some kind of terrain we could operate in a man like croder wouldnt call in a man who buckled at the knees at the first blow you have to stay in moscow he went on reasonably until we can get you clear without any risk that might not be for some little time he was walking more slowly how do you feel about schrenk how do i fed he was graders only argument wasnt he you wouldnt have agreed to take this one on for someone you didnt respect you have a lot of respect for schrenk and croder knew that i slowed and said not that way im sorry this way bloody children oh i simply meant bracken said carefully that im going to do everything i can to pull schrenk out if its not too late we need him out because hes a danger to leningrad but i dont mean that i want him out because i respect him too he waited five seconds i thought youd like to know oh for christs sake spare me the auld lang syne im going to be lucky to get out of this place alive let alone take someone else with me what makes you so sure hes in moscow anyway it was in the briefing information well the k havent got him i know that there were more children not far away and i hoped to christ they werent going to start screaming like that man in the cell repeat bracken stopped dead again to watch me they thought i knew where he was they offered me an exchange deal dezinformatsiya no they havent got him and they want him as badly as we do in a moment bracken said if hes free why hasnt he reported i didnt say he was free id say he was dead he shut off again for a time then killed how should i know they chewed him up in there and he just about got away with his skin and then someone did a snatch on him at the clinic in hanover and it wasnt the kgb and there hasnt been a squeak from him since and thats all i know its all anyone knows hit me on the side of my head without any warning and exploded in a white shower all over bracken and he laughed boomingly and bent down and got some snow and pressed it hard and slung it back at them laughing all the time good cover while i stood there with my nerves screaming through my head not a terribly good sign scared of a snowball now maybe if i could get some sleep tonight some real sleep without that bastard yelling at me from all right bracken was watching me closely yes im all right come on he said and began walking the other way look im going to be in signals with london most of the night and ill ask for a complete screening background on every man weve got in moscow if theres the slightest doubt about any of them ill get them recalled and kept out of here ours is the only operation weve got running in this field he was talking briskly confidently and for a moment he got me thinking he wasnt worried meanwhile ive got three people working on your last signal although the present findings are that there are seventeen pyotr ignatovs resident in moscow not that it means a lot because if hes a judas in our group hell be using an alias obviously one of the ten natalya fyodorovas in this city works in a personnel department of the kremlin which could match your info shes described as attractive and possibly a swallow for the kgb were still digging and youll have anything we turn up he was walking closer again nudging my arm sometimes trying to make contact and pull me out of the aftershock im going to find out if schrenk is still alive but first i want to nail this judas before he can wipe us out in moscow but if you feel theres nothing more you can do for us at this stage i can smuggle you into the embassy and get you taken care of one of the girls has had nursing experience and of course you i didnt say i wanted a nurse no dont misunderstand me the streets are dangerous i told him through my teeth i dont know how long i could last he stopped again his hand on my arm i quite realize that why dont you come in for a while and think it over youll be perfectly safe at the embassy then see how you feel in the morning i looked away theres no time to hole up you know that we could send for someone else to come out he stood watching me with the light of the city bouncing off the snow and reflecting in his eyes wed quite understand he said gently if you asked us to do so croder had spoken like that they knew how to keep me running as long as my feet could move youre risking london i told him if you keep on pushing me you know drat theyre looking for me and they wont stop till they find me we know what the risks are bracken said quietly and what we have to do about them he spoke with confidence and my mind opened a degree to what he was saying but if you could do just one thing for me wed all be so much safer i need to get a look at this man ignatov without his seeing me so that i can tell you whether or not hes working in our cell do you think you could arrange that somehow i stood listening to the moan of the trams at the far side of the park and the chugging of a concrete mixer where a night crew was putting up a new apartment complex the voices of the children had stopped perhaps theyd gone home now i wished they were still here in the park even though they reminded me of screaming theyd taken their innocence with them and just for this moment i needed it as a touchstone bracken was waiting his large face patient as he watched me and this time i knew he wouldnt speak again before i did id need another safehouse and another cover and another car i wrote the car off we began walking together over the snow id need another coat this ones too far gone for mending and it attracts too much attention i can see to all that bracken said youd have to send the doctor from the embassy to the safehouse we kept to the path or what we could see of it knowing it led to the gates to fix my face some kind of dressing to stop it bleeding that attracts attention too that can be done bracken said i could see the dark hump of his car parked in the shadow of trees outside the park and had an urge to run there and use its cover id have to get over that if youve got a spare capsule at the embassy you can let me have it be on the safe side didnt you draw one i suppose he knew it was required procedure for moscow yes i lost it we were nearing the gates and the snow took on a chill glitter under the street lamps i wondered if i could trust him and thought i could id never know if i were wrong bracken i said yes he leaned towards me dont tell croder you had to talk me into going on but i didnt he said and touched my arm for a moment as we crossed to the car tag zoya masurov a body like petrified smoke in her black sweater and black thighboots her hair blackest of all and drawn away from her pale ivory face her eyes smouldering in the charred silk of their brows and lashes taking you in and giving you nothing back reminding me of helda last seen at the edge of a minefield on the east german border though this woman was harder and would have no mercy would kill you if you were an enemy and kill for you if you were a friend but she held most of it in and it was only when you went close to her that you sensed the undercurrents and felt their pull there is no need to bring a doctor here shed told bracken i am a doctor she worked on me when bracken had gone taking a small black cauldron of boiling water up to the room on the top floor the one right at the end like the one at gorskys place because were safest there its the required location what should i look for she asked me splinters metal glass glass what contaminants what was in the glass nothing it was a car crash are you the upravdom here yes there wasnt much light from the bulb overhead and she was using a big hand lamp that must have come out of a railway sale her black eyes narrowed as she looked for the glint of glass swabbing and exploring and swabbing again never looking at me looking always at the wound i am the upravdom yes but also a doctor though no longer in the registry of course since they removed my name after nearly thirteen years the fragments cutting sometimes as she moved the steel probe her body held perfectly still and only her hands working the small veins in her temple thrown into relief by the backwash of the enormous lamp the sweep of one eyelash sending shadow across her brow that was at the hospital in smolensk the big new one they built after the war it was there that they found me doing something unforgivable the room was warm and this woman was healing me and bracken had given me his guarantee no one but himself in the field with me so i was slowly coming down from the nervous high of the aftershock and beginning to think i had a chance of doing some work in this city and getting out of it alive but i still didnt know how i could have asked him what i had to seep it from croder that id needed persuasion croder meant nothing to me they found me using american antibiotics she said we didnt have anything at that time for sickle cell anaemia and they wouldnt allow the import of gh because romania isnt loyal to the master state but i had a friend at the consulate and he got me the drugs from sloan kittering kettering is it and i was found using them and so here i am the upravdom of an apartment block in moscow with instructions to report on the residents here if they commit any infraction of the rules she threw the swab into a metallined box and prodded again i winced and she laughed and said you can feel it better than i can see it thats just what i want and a happy christmas to you too i said and she laughed again and had to hold the probe away for a minute she had sharp white teeth like an animals and it occurred to me that it i ever introduced her to the blueeyed fairhaired natalya fyodorova this woman would eat her alive it amuses me she said deep in her throat the way men cant stand pain its to get sympathy even when we know there isnt a dogs chance did you appeal she broke her laugh halfway appeal against the medical brass i didnt know you were listening oh yes i was listening the place was reeking of alcohol by the time shed finished and i stood at the other side of the room from the mirror and took a look shed put in a row of new sutures and covered the wound with a long strip of elastic dressing and it didnt look too bad in here though it wouldnt do for the street will it start bleeding again no she was packing her things together in the big medical bag not unless you open it again as you did last time there was a bloodied swab on the linoleum and i dropped it into the woodstove what did they tell you about me you are for safe keeping she said what else nothing else theres a hunt on i said and looked through the grimy window to the lamps in the street below theyre looking for a man with a scar if i run out of luck and someone follows me here are you fully organized i mean cover background instructions yes she swung the bag over one shoulder like a knapsack but if that isnt enough i have a sawnoff shotgun and some grenades london wouldnt know about that and youd like to use them wouldnt you yes she said slowly i would like to use them as soon as shed gone i got out the material bracken had given me the capsule was in the regulation tin box and the report was in digraphic code key using amber light for the first two lines in the grid with x separating the double letters it wasnt new and it wasnt fast but it was almost unbreakable of ten natalya fyodorovas in m one in personnel office kremlin j attractive possible parttime swallow still tracing of seventeen pyotr ignatovs none linked with intelligence field or police none suspect still tracing no details of subjects arrest though probably in open reasons given for application for post of aip his interest in dissident affairs and possibility of his proving useful in that area no inconsistency seen since subject is jewish and has contacts in m state what link nat fyo and pyot ign if any destruct i opened the stove and watched it burn it was about the least informative signal id ever received from a director in the field with the operation half blown and the subject probably dead i think bracken could have got me a lot more if london hadnt been standing on his hands i didnt like the way hed said we know what the risks are and we know what to do about them they shouldnt know any more at this stage than that a judas had started working through the moscow cell and blowing the executives one by one but croder was running this thing and he wouldnt tell even bracken any more than he had to know and i had the feeling that something even bigger than the threat to leningrad was involved or that in the last twentyfour hours the threat to leningrad had developed into a threat of something bigger something on a vaster scale than an interintelligence skirmish it wasnt my business a shadow executive for the bureau is a ferret and theyd put me down the hole and i hadnt found schrenk and now they wanted ignatov so id have to go down the hole again and find him and bring him in for bracken to look at and it was a quarter past eight when i put the capsule away and got the secondhand astrakhan coat theyd dug up for me and put it on and went downstairs and through me deserted hallway and out into the lamplit snow d i could see the archway of spassky gate at one end of the drivingmirror the lights on each side of it had gone from red to green as three cars and a plain van had driven into the kremlin during the past ten minutes i was waiting for a car to come through from the other direction the mudbrown syrena shed said he would come soon after five oclock and it was now three minutes to the hour did you tell him my name i had asked her at one stage shed broken down and cried that was last night ive told you i havent seen him i havent seen him shaking against the railings of the apartment block her face wet and her thin shoulders hunched forward her small gloved hands gripping the ironwork its all right i told her but i thought you were lying why should i lie she swung round to face me furious i want you to find him dont you understand she meant helmut schrenk he was all she could think about and that was what i had to work on there was no point in telling her i thought he was dead syrena spassky gate not brown not there were thousands of them all over the city the clock in the tower began chiming why should i give you away to ignatov blowing into her handkerchief shaking her hair back soot on her gloves from the railings somebody did it got her attention and she stared at me in the acid light of the lamps what happened he tried to get me arrested but hes not in the police no hes in the transport division one of the chauffeurs for the politburo are you sure of course she wiped her face half turned away from me you didnt tell me much you see the first time we met all im trying to do is find helmut i didnt trust you before what makes you trust me now she leaned back against the railings and closed her eyes exhausted from the anger and hope and uncertainty after these last months id started her thinking about him again and it had disrupted her life i trust you now because i want to because i have to theyre good enough reasons listen natalya i want to find ignatov do you know where he lives no we always met at the cafe or the skating rink places like that but i can find out exactly where he works another syrena mud brown not the dock in the tower had stopped chiming i watched the mirror can you find out tonight no i dont have the keys of the office is there anyone you can contact whoever has the keys tell them you want to catch up on some work she thought for a moment and then said i could ask the security men to let me in with no dont do that i stood closer to her listen the kgb wants to find helmut too think of it as a race they get to him first or i do its partly up to you who wins keep away from ignatov and dont change your daily routine dont tell anyone about me and dont tell anyone theres a hope of finding helmut try to forget him as much as you can otherwise you might give yourself away and him all understood yes her mouth was trembling she was going to cry again but not out of anger this time but just because she was out of her depth and didnt know what to do didnt know whom to mist didnt know if shed ever see helmut again this girl wasnt a swallow she was just another young muscovite with a mother and father and friends and a job and the most clandestine thing she knew how to do was to march with the cafe crusaders through dreams of freedom in the long night where freedom was dead ivan was arrested shed told me before i left her what for handing out leaflets outside the courtroom three days youll see him again but keep away from the cafe and dont hand out any leaflets yourself i may need to see you again if i dont find ignatov d turning to the right as it came through spassky gate i started the engine and moved away from the kerb shed said he normally took razina ulica and i turned right and slowed and saw him go across the intersection and turned left when the lights changed and took up the tag with two cars and a taxi in the space between us the mercedes was four cars behind i knew how good ignatov was in the street hed used his mirror when id tagged him before and it had got me into lubyanka so this was strictly a red sector i was in id be secure all the time we were on the move but if he stopped anywhere in an open street id have to make sure he didnt speak to a militia man and if he went to a telephone box id have to leave him there and get the pobeda into some kind of cover there was no reason why he should suspect the tag this was a different car with a different number and hed never seen me closer than a streets width away and this was the rush hour and there were a dozen pobedas in sight of him at any given minute but hed blown me the last time and he could do it again if i gave him the ghost of a chance i didnt think he had a transmitter with a concealed antenna because this was the same syrena he was driving and two days ago hed had to get out and telephone to trigger the action mirror the mercedes was now three spaces behind me and in front of a truck with a high profile and after that i couldnt see anything but if a police patrol wanted to come up on me for any reason hed overtake the rest and close me in i could only relax when there was a righthand street within sight for use as an escape road but this was oversensitive because my image was clean and i didnt think ignatov had a transmitter after lubyanka bracken had said youll feel a bit paranoid for a while we crossed the first ring road at and the second one five minutes later and followed kazakov ulica eastwards with no significant change in the pattern except for some shunting when ignatov went through the lights at yellow and i had to get the spacer vehicles behind me and close the distance and v then hang back and wart for some new ones to cover me in his mirror hed seen me once or twice but hed seen a lot of cars behind him as we all headed for the suburbs and the rake of my windscreen was reflecting the street lamps and he couldnt see my face i dont think he was going through on the yellow because hed discovered the tag natalya had said he was a chauffeur for the politburo so hed be used to storming along the chaika lane at the wheel of a government zil and going through on the red with the policeman stopping the cross traffic and he must feel frustrated on his offduty runs in the syrena and a right turn to take us across the river at the radio ulica bridge two minutes later three spacers two taxis and a small van with the mercedes keeping station behind me the road surface was fair with sand across the snow and not too many ruts forming as yet this astrakhan coat smelt bloody awful god knew where brackens people had got it from it reeked of black tobacco and borsht and camphor balls this weeks unrepeatable bargain out of the railway workers union secondhand store id put it at fifteen rubles i wound down the window and let the freezing air come in slowing he was slowing and peeling off to the right at the fork opposite the park and i saw the pumps of a fillingstation and slowed with him and took the same turn because if i went straight on and took two rights id come back on him from the opposite direction and hed get a close look at my face when i passed him at that point hed be on my left and the cheek wound would be on the other side but my image was an eightyeight per cent security risk on an inverted scale id made a count while i was waiting for him to come through spassky gate and one out of eight men on the pavement had been wearing his scarf as i was to cover each side of his face against the cold ignatov was observant and hed recognize me if he saw me twice he was stopping at the end of the queue for the pumps and i made a halfturn and pulled up with a parked truck for cover and waited at this angle the mirror gave me a square centimetre of critical reflection the forward half of the syrenas drivingwindow and ignatovs head and one shoulder after thirty seconds he opened the door and got out and i shifted my head to keep his reflection in sight the back of his dark fur coat and the lower half of his head then the image disappeared and i had to risk looking round he was going across the tarmac area towards the telephone box i watched him bodily changes sweat blood leaving the skin awareness of pulse panic trying to set in its a trap he did this before when shuddup bloody organism weve got to get out of here shuddup he went into the telephone box and i saw the dark of his shoulder and the pale blur of his face behind the steamy glass he knew the number he wasnt using the book the nerves were tingling as the adrenalin came into the bloodstream and the muscles felt alert instinct told me to get out while there was a chance of finding cover and going to ground before the patrol cars arrived and logic supported this hed led me a long way two days ago before hed stopped to telephone and hed led me a long way now id performed a model tag from spassky gate this evening but id done as well two days ago and hed seen me and set the trap just as he was doing now so i got out of the car and walked the length of the truck and reached the shadows behind the buildings and watched him from there the box was in full light under one of the tall gooseneck lamps the snow reflecting it upwards in a wash of radiance but i could still see only the indistinct image of his face as he stood halfturned towards the buildings i think he nodded once before he put the phone back and came out he couldnt see me in the shadows and i moved the woollen scarf away from my ears and listened to the sounds of the traffic trying to be selective trying to pick out a distant siren or the snow chains of a vehicle moving fast ignatov stood looking towards the river the way wed just come he might be watching the lights over there or the stream of southbound traffic or the tail end of the pobeda and its number plate i couldnt see at this distance when the queue moved up to the pumps he got back into the syrena and kept his place and when the queue moved again and he was alongside the end pump he got out again and stood watching the traffic i went on listening the cold air was numbing to the ears after the warmth of the scarf and the cheek wound was sensitive it was seven minutes since hed come out of the telephone box and his tank had been filled and he was paying the attendant i could still hear nothing unusual in the traffics sound it didnt mean they werent on their way with the snow on the streets theyd take longer to get here and thered be no particular hurry because if hed given them the location theyd close in from a dozen directions and block my way out when he got back into his car i would have to make the decision but the organism was feverish with apprehension e adrenals were releasing epinephrine and constricting the blood vessels and the liver was releasing glucose for the motor energy the skeletal muscles were firming and strengthening and the pulse was strong and fast but it might not be enough to save me if i made the wrong decisionhe was getting back into his car i went on listening and heard no change in the traffic sound the last thing i did before going back to the pobeda was to feel my waistband under my coat to make sure the small rectangular tin was still there ignatov waited for a slot in the traffic stream and found one and sped up and i followed watching the mirror and the side streets and the reflections in the windows and bodywork of the cars ahead of me watching for the first sign of a flashing light the mercedes came into the mirror twice before ignatov led me eastwards again alongside the park then i lost it for a while the sweating had stopped but i was chilled with it and my mouth tasted bitter the organism was having to deal with the superfluous adrenalin and the muscles were fretting for action there wasnt going to be any hed phoned somebody else who his wife or a friend or a woman anyone it could be anyone telling them he was going to be a little late tonight because of the snow ignore at he slowed and took a side street and slowed again and i held back until he turned sharply into the entrance of an underground car park it was alongside an apartment block and i drove straight past to make a check and then came back and stopped and doused the lights and got out and started walking fast over the snow halfway along the street i heard an engine the and a door open as i reached the black mouth of the entrance and went down the ramp breaking into a run across the dry concrete because it wouldnt matter if he heard me coming the place was cavernous with concrete columns standing at intervals their pattern merging into the darkness the slam of a car door came but the echoes bounced the sound from wall to wall and i couldnt locate it then a flashlight came on and its beam swung and focused on my eyes blinding me i began walking into the beam but it went out and i stopped dead waiting for the dazzling afterimage to clear i think he was some fifty feet ahead of me midway between two of the columns i heard movement but it wasnt distinct enough so get a fix on i waited ten seconds but there was only silence now ignatov i said i need to talk to you he didnt answer i couldnt tell if he had a gun it was pitch dark in this area and the click of a safety catch wouldnt necessarily carry this distance if he had a gun and wanted to hold me off he would have to put his flashlight on again to take aim if he decided i was too dangerous then he would simply fire but hed have to use the flashlight even to do that because the entrance was no longer behind me and i wasnt showing a silhouette i stood listening perfectly still except for my head i was turning my head to the left until my right ear was facing ignatovs last estimated position the right ear feeds aural input to the left hemisphere of the brain where the logical analysis of crude sound is made i picked up nothing at all after thirty seconds something drove past the entrance along the street and the sound came into the cavernous dark and set up diminishing vibrations the acoustics were strange in here with the concrete columns breaking up the sound patterns and reflecting their remnants i thought some kind of movement had been made when the sound had come down from the street i wasnt sure ignatov we need to talk my own voice sounded odd its echoes overlapping i went forward using taichi steps long and infinitely slow keeping my feet slightly tilted to avoid the sound of flat contact sole floor i took ten paces and stopped i thought he was somewhere between where i stood now and forty feet away a few minutes ago id estimated his distance from me as fifty feet and id just moved thirty allowing for a margin of error of twenty and doubling it then he moved and i heard him and span into the fightinghorse stance and waited total silence i went on waiting i thought i was close to him now perhaps very close in the far distance i could see the rectangular patch of light made by the street lamps above ground but there was no light here if i could move to one side and work round him in a half circle i could bring his silhouette in line between me and the entrance but he might be trying to do that himself and might be succeeding at any time now the shot would come if he were going to shoot my scalp was drawn tight and i could feel the slight lifting at the hair on my head ignatov could be within an inch of me now and might detect me first i didnt know what kind of training he had whether he knew how to strike lethally working by touch alone it was difficult to move now with any safety the dark itself felt hazardous a degree of sensory deprivation was setting in and my nerves heard movement where there was none a few seconds ago i had heard the faintest rustling to my left and i had moved one hand out in the hope of making contact and identifying his attitude and striking before he could but he wasnt there it wasnt any good listening for his breathing hed be controlling it as i was controlling mine i moved again with the underwater slowness of taichi and took two paces before i felt something touching my elbow it was to my left if it was ignatov standing beside me he would make his move at once so i threw up a guard and used a very short controlled knifeedge with the left foot and struck solid bruising it flat of my left hand yes a concrete column i hit the floor immediately doubling in silence in case he was close enough to use the sounds id made as a bearing i began thinking he must have gone he wore rubbersoled shoes thered been no footsteps just before hed switched on the flashlight he could have gone far enough during the passage of the vehicle in the street to move out of earshot but that was dangerous thinking i got up slowly watching the rectangle of light in the distance in case he moved across it silence i took two paces slowly undulating and stopped then i heard him draw breath suddenly beside me because of the shock of proximity id come up on him in the total darkness and a grunt sounded as he stifled a shout and i clawed with my left hand to find the shape of the target and felt softness the curled wool of his coat all i needed he struck out with the flashlight and it grazed my head before i brought him down with a crescent sweep and caught him before he hit the ground he didnt learn anything from this he thought there was still a chance and tried to unbalance me and i stopped him with a lowpower swordhand against the carotid dont do anything i told him we need to talk he didnt say anything i found the flashlight and switched it on lighting his face he was still in shock and his head was lolling so i helped him upright and he stood swaying a little dazzled by the light i moved it down out of his eyes but he still didnt seem to understand the position because he jerked suddenly and hooked for my face with his stubby fingers putting a lot of force into it and getting close before i blocked with a jodan and centreknuckled the medial nerve with enough depth to paralyse ignatov i said dont do that he was quiet again sagging against me for a time with the local paralysis affecting his system through the nervous meridians when i was sure he understood the position i raised the flashlight to shine full on his face and looked round well i asked no bracken said from the shadows ive never seen him before hes not in my cell hes not the judas shadow then who was he was very difficult to work with he kept trying to get away and i had to trip him and catch him before he could hit the ground or the concrete column that was somewhere near us if i didnt catch him each time he was going to hurt himself because he had absolutely no idea how to fall what did you tell them i asked him again he wouldnt answer and that was another thing that made it difficult i had to ask him everything two or three times and then work on a nerve until he got the message but even then i didnt know when he was lying ive never met anybody so difficult what did you tell them when you went into that phone box it was to tell my wife i would be late not that time i mean two days ago on wednesday you phoned the police and they tried to pick me up what did you tell them i didnt tell them anything i oh come on ignatov used a centreknuckle on the medial he hated that what did you tell them i was getting annoyed because someone might come in here and make things awkward bracken had gone five minutes ago all hed needed was a dose look at ignatov and it was too dangerous for him to stay where the action was because he was ostensibly a member of the british embassy staff and they could throw him out of the country if he came under any kind of suspicion ignatov wasnt answering youd never seen me before in your life and you went into a phone box and called the police and they came right away so what did you tell them it was not me what do you mean it wasnt you come on i did what i was ordered he crouched over hugging his arm because it had needed another jab to get that much out of him but it sounded interesting who had ordered him the judas ignatov i said i want you to understand the position i can do a lot of things to you that would make you give me the answers i want but it could cripple you for life and i dont see any point do you he was still bent over trying to get some of the feeling back into his left arm id been leaving his right arm alone for the moment in case i wanted him to drive me anywhere i didnt know what was going to happen yet im going to get the answers out of you in any case so why damage yourself he was breathing much too hard for a man of maybe thirtyfive or forty though he was a bit overweight and of course he was nervous its harder to make them understand when they havent had any training because theyve never learned what you can do to them have you my children ignatov three yes three children he said it quickly because this was where his heart was in his family all right do you want them to have to push you about in a wheelchair you want them to help feed you listen to what im saying use your imagination a wheelchair something went past along the street and a faint rhomboid of light swept across the columns and faded out i didnt want anyone to come in here until id got what i needed from him so well start again who ordered you to get me picked up in the street i gave him five seconds and then covered him in fast light blows with a lot of control and the focus on the nerve centres so that he didnt even know what was happening then i had to wait until he could stand upright again that was nothing ignatov i didnt touch your face and i didnt touch your groin im going to work on those next who ordered you he whispered a name but i didnt catch it because his system was in shock who say it again zubarev what was that zubarev yes he nodded and went on nodding like one of those dolls with a weight in its head yes some more light came and this time it got very bright and the concrete columns stood out row after row of them as the car came down the ramp and turned and parked with its nose against the wall the light spreading and dimming and then going out i put one arm round ignatovs throat and left it there while we waited he got the message this time and didnt try to do anything about it a flashlight beam came on at the far end of the garage and i watched it bobbing towards the iron staircase in the corner but it was promised one of them was saying it was promised very cut up because her boss had said they could have two tickets for the circus if they reached their work goal for the month and hed broken his promise and now theyd have to spend the evening playing dominoes with the borisenkos next door a bloody shame but at least theyd shown me the public telephone in the corner by the staircase i hadnt seen it before give me your wallet i told ignatov and he reached inside his coat and i watched his hand when it came out hold this torch normal papers plus party membership card plus identification as an official driver to the politburo and a special traffic pass into the kremlin and certain designated areas in the city of moscow as specified in the amendment to the control of vehicular movement nothing else in the way of privilege documents but that one would probably rate a salute from a militia man yes no little book with names in no sign of any zubarev were going to make a phone call i told him it was like trying to move a bear he didnt know which way to walk he wasnt used to this sort of thing but that wasnt my fault he shouldnt have blasted me off the street like that were going to call zubarev i said didnt know his number oh yes you do i told him and whipped a very light reverse swordhand against the larynx tell him youre coming to see him and if he objects tell him its very urgent insist on it do you understand he stood trying to get his breath and i had to wait for a minute because i wanted him to sound reasonably normal on the phone i only had one kopeck on me with a lot of bigger change have you got a kopeck i asked him he found one moving slowly and i watched his hand again when it came out he only lets me go there he said with a slight wheeze at prearranged times were going to prearrange it i put the two kopecks into the slot ignatov you gave me a lot of trouble i dont mind what i have to do to you remember the wheelchair i gave him the phone in the close bright light of the torch i watched his face and his eyes he was staring at the printed board behind the telephone as if he were reading its instructions but he wasnt he was staring at the possibility of saying something to zubarev that would warn him and at the possibility of hurling himself at me and throttling me before i could do anything about it this was natural enough but i waited for him to turn his head and look at my eyes and in my eyes i let him see without any shadow of doubt that i was the angel of death he looked away and dialled the number which i noted and committed to memory he asked for a woman first and i reacted and moved my hand in a threat and he whispered that zubarev never came to the telephone himself misha he said with slow care watching me this is pyotr i am coming to see him tell him that i heard her voice young strong husky positive she would tell him she was saying was he coming right away yes i am coming now i prodded him and he said tell him it is very urgent misha tell him i must come there was nothing wrong she wanted to know in the light of the torch his flat featureless face struggled with the question and he managed to get a note of reassurance into his voice there is nothing wrong no but i must come she said she would tell him neither of them had mentioned his name he looked at me and i nodded and he hooked the receiver back light swept suddenly across the columns and i turned my back to the entrance as a car came down the ramp and swung at right angles and stopped i moved ignatov away from the staircase and talked to him as we walked across to his car passing a halfseen man and saying good evening to him when hed started up the iron staircase i told ignatov to get into his car on the passengers side and then i took his scarf and tied his wrists to his ankles and shut the door on him and went round to the drivers side he hadnt seen me tagging him from the kremlin and he didnt know the number of the pobeda but hed see it if we used my car instead of his and once hed seen the number plate he could blast me off the street again the minute he got to a telephone he sat awkwardly beside me with his knees drawn up to his chin his squat body swaying as i turned the car through the columns and pulled up near the entrance and reached across him and opened his door for a moment ignatov i told him if you try to attract attention in the street by shouting out or falling against the steering wheel you might alert a militia man or a police patrol if you did that id have to leave you behind and id do that by opening your door like this and giving you a push i used a fair amount of force so that he rocked half off his seat then i grabbed him and pulled him back and he sat with his breath hissing out youd hit your head on the road because you wouldnt be able to save yourself you understand yes yes i understand what are the names of your children yuri irina and tania his head swung to look at me because the question had surprised him you want to see them again i said and pulled his door shut and drove up the ramp into the street you must take care of yourself yes he said and i heard emotion in his voice i understand i turned into the street without slowing down too much and he rolled against the door with a thump and rolled back i wanted him to know how extraordinarily helpless the human body can be without the use of hands or feet the evening rush hour was nearly over and the first set of lights was green hes at the pavilion i said to ignatov is that right yes i drove northwest along soldatskaja ulica feeling the onset of depression of all the questions in my head i thought i had the answer to one and i didnt like it ignatov was a professional driver and would have been trained to watch his mirror when he was at the wheel of those big black shiny zils because the members of the elite politburo must not be followed about but he hadnt discovered my tag on the way from spassky gate this evening he had seen the pobeda several times but hadnt realized it was following him specifically certainly id taken pains to do the job efficiently but then id taken similar pains two days ago and hed known i was there behind him and there on purpose it had been daylight then and this evening it had been dark but this city was bright by night and visibility was good so there was an additional factor involved which had led him to discover the first tag and not the second i thought i knew what it was i had probably known for a long time right at the back of the mind where we put things we dont want to look at but it would have to be brought into the light and looked at and that was going to be painful i would almost rather be going to lubyanka again in good heart and filled with the fierce animal instinct to fight and survive than to tins place filled with depression and unable to do anything about it depression is unreachable the slow death of the spirit whats your wifes name i asked ignatov the lights changed to red at an intersection and i put out a hand as he swayed forward again id had to do it several times to stop him hitting his face on the windscreen galya he said and looked at me wondering why i had asked and perhaps hearing something in my voice the depression what does she do she teaches the ballet at the centre for the arts the lights went green and he swayed back on his seat does she teach your children we were almost there but i wanted this journey to last a long time and i wanted to talk to this man about his wife and his children and the ballet lessons she teaches our two girls he said his voice wary suspecting some kind of trap irina and tania yes he said surprised that id remembered but like most people i remember most things and especially those things id rather forget i suppose yuri thinks itd be sissy for him to learn does he yes thats perfectly right as if id discovered a profound truth but the wariness was still in his voice the fear that i was building up this little edifice of human intimacy only so that i could knock it down he didnt have the trust in innocence those children had had in the park he was silent but i saw he was watching my reflection in the windscreen i think he was beyond trying to do anything to help himself now or to stop my going to see zubarev id found his weakness or his strength whichever you want to call it but this didnt mean he wouldnt kill me if i gave him the chance and if he believed he had to for his childrens sake or of course for his own the lights were green for us at the turning into baumanskaja and i didnt have to stop though i would have liked to stop and turn back and never meet zubarev the pavilion block was on our left now and i turned past it and found the car park at the rear where id explored the environment on foot two days ago the snow was thick here with the tracks of vehicles making ruts that tugged at the wheel as i drove through the entrance the building was quite large with a blank wall facing us and the headlights throwing the shadows of the parked cars against it a man was walking towards us from the building going across to his car and our headlights held him frozen for an instant before i switched them off he looked transfixed like a wild creature caught in the dazzle of lights along a country road and his shadow was enormous on the wall behind him grotesque and distorted with one thin shoulder held low like a broken wing and his body twisted to one side is that zubarev i asked the man beside me yes i watched as the figure moved on again hobbling towards the car deadlock he looked up at me from the drivingseat oh he said its you id gone across to his car quite quickly to stop him driving away he watched me steadily for a moment his pale eyes narrowed and his small gnomes head slightly on one side even sitting down his body was twisted with the left shoulder held low and noticeably still he was trying to think what it would be best to do and i couldnt have helped him even if id wanted to id only just got here in time i think hed panicked suddenly while he was waiting for us to arrive and decided to get out in case ignatov brought someone with him an example of the type of intuition we develop in the field as a natural aid to survival but he couldnt just drive off now that hed seen me there was a question of pride involved the most he could do would be to pretend he was just popping out for some cigarettes but he didnt bother we both knew the position what about a little drinkie he said with a sudden lopsided smile all right i stepped back to let him get out of the car he did it clumsily though he tried not to let anything show and i looked away in time to save him embarrassment perhaps this was why ignatov had been impressed by my talk of a wheelchair hed seen what it looked like to be half crippled dr steinberg hadnt told me his patient was as bad as this hed just said he tended to hobble he slammed the door of his car is that ignatov youve got over there yes ill go and get him schrenk peered across at the humped shape in the syrena got him trussed up have you he gave a dry snigger leave him there hell be all right oh no you dont hell get bored out here i said with no one to talk to i went back to the syrena and got out my pocket knife and cut through the scarf the knots were there for life i said quietly to ignatov dont do anything silly will you remember you want to see the children again and galya yes i understand he shook the stiffness out of his legs and came with me towards the building evening pyotr schrenk said in russian where did you find our friend another dry little laugh totally without humour ignatov said nothing but stared at the ground as the three of us walked across the rutted snow schrenk slipped a couple of times and i remembered i mustnt help him even if he actually fell i knew him that well other things were coming back to me in flashes of memory a plastic chess set on the corner table of the caff where he used to challenge people waiting there like a spider a girl with black hair and smoky eyes and an intimate way of laughing seaweed draped over one naked shoulder on the beach at brighton a black jensen interceptor with an antiradar unit deafening jazz records an ashtray made out of a piston and stuffed with butts and the way his fingers moved over the bomb that time stroking it like a baby rabbit shapiro schrenk signal bracken i have the objective not yet we went slowly over the snow i could feel ignatovs concern that schrenk might slip and lose his balance and break an arm he kept close to him his head turned looking down i could also feel ignatovs awareness that be mustnt help him if he fell he had tried to help him before and been told never to do that never to do it again i felt these infinitesimal vibrations flowing between us and carrying their intelligence things were sensitive tonight i felt schrenks rage hows london we always ask that dockers on strike i told him he laughed again whinnying softly perhaps when people laughed to cover panic or fright or rage the sound was in some way inhibited leaving nothing to show but a rictus good old london he said and led us to the heavy metal door in the middle of the building his room was on the ground floor at the rear either because it was the best he could find or because he couldnt manage the stairs and didnt want to get trapped in the lift or perhaps this was the best he could afford the london funding having been cut off when hed left moscow for hanover consideration steinberg hadnt said his patient was as bad as this had they worked him over again after theyd picked him up in hanover i didnt think so it hadnt been the kgb we all stopped not far along the passage the number on the door was a ignatov had seemed to hold back a little on our way from the car park and id let him know i had noticed it and didnt like it ignatov had to stay with me until i was ready to let him go if id left him out there he would have got help from the next good citizen to come into the car park and he would have said it was a prank on the part of some hooligans to leave him tied up like this and he would have gone straight to a telephone and blown me leave him there schrenk had told me hell be all right oh no you dont he opened the door of his room it hadnt been locked hello sweetheart he said in russian i didnt go after all met an old friend of mine she was a plump peasant girl sturdy and vital and with her skin still glowing from the country air a girl recently come to the big city to fulfil her dreams of concrete towers and grinding underground trains this is misha schrenk said she gave me both her hands warm and damp from the kitchen bobbing and saying she was pleased to meet any friend of viktors konstantin i said konstantin pavlovich she bobbed again and then kissed schrenk on the cheek to show me she adored him while his bright eye watched me over her shoulder daring me to judge him for shacking up with a girl like this reminding me of other times between missions when the field executives amused themselves by comparing one anothers fortunes christ old boy that was an absolute stunner you were with last night and where did she get the bentley it occurred to me in this moment of contemplation as schrenks eye stared into mine that nothing in a girl could be much more stunning than adoration misha smelt of stewed cabbage and so did the room she hurried across to the comer and clanked the lid of a black iron pot on the stove letting out steam whatll it be schrenk asked me he always spoke to me in english and to the others in russian i dont think he was deliberately ignoring security i think he felt that security wasnt neccessary because one of us was totally in the others power md was therefore harmless it was probably true though neither of us knew which one would be the survivor because ibis was what we were going to have to work out ill have some beet juice i told him and he asked misha pour me a glass while he hobbled across to the plywood able under the window and got himself some vodka waving e bottle to ignatov who said he would like a small one yes it was all very sociable though i knew i was in much greater danger here in this room than id been inside lubyanka cheers said schrenk and tilted his glass he was having to use so much control that he looked like a halfbroken robot going through its mechanical gestures i couldnt tell whether the slight trembling of his limbs was due to his injuries under torture or to the rage that was in him the only human thing about him was the brightness of his eyes but even that was feverish i thought he wasnt far from the edge of a breakdown cheers i said and we drank together ignatov moved half a pace and i got annoyed because hed had quite enough warning i went across to the door and turned my back to it and looked at him until he looked down sipping his drink i didnt want to put a spark to the tension here by saying anything to him directly but the fact was that if he tried to get out of this room id kill him i couldnt afford to let him into the streets again the only hope i had of doing anything for bracken without losing my life was to take other lives if i had to they ought to know that i shouldnt have to keep telling them like to sit down schrenk asked me there was only one small settee hardly big enough for two people there was a chair near the window but it was piled with books and magazines and some knitting i supposed the girl was doing a nice warm scarf for viktor perhaps in the name of adoration im all right here i told him he sat down on the settee with a slight twisting motion that hed become unaware of and no longer tried to cover misha moved nearer to him and was going to sit down too but he motioned her away with a little jerk of his head that she understood even though he didnt actually look at her she went back to the stove likes to mother me he said with a twist of his thin mouth im a crashed pilot you understand suitable cover for the state those bastards left me in he drank some vodka lights swept across the window from the car park it had been from this window that he must have seen me two days ago checking out the environment she seems a nice girl i said and she obviously looks after you well i was aware of the clock ticking it was a small grandfather type tilted with one side resting on a wad of folded paper to keep the pendulum going schrenk had always liked clocks and of course had used quite a few of them in his work did you tell this man to blow me i asked him schrenks small head jerked slightly he hadnt been ready to talk business quite so soon and i suppose at the back of his mind hed been hoping wed never have to he got off the settee with a sudden lopsided movement and stood looking away from me for a moment while he fought for control i had to dont you know that i saw misha at the stove swing her head to look at him snooping round here like that i want people to leave me alone he stood shaking unable to face me hating me for making him put up some kind of defence against the indefensible i knew youd be able to look after yourself wherever they put you i think youve proved that misha came across the room and took a cigarette from the black and yellow packet and lit it and gave it to him as she must have done so many times there was habit in her movements did you tell him who i was i asked him no he drew the smoke in deeply no what instructions did you give him what did he tell the police when he phoned them he couldnt answer right away though i saw he was trying hed wanted me to call him all the bastards under the sun for doing a thing like that for blasting me off the street as if wed never worked together or been close to death together as if wed never learned to trust each other i would have made it easier for him if id gone across to him and smashed him against the wall and i think he was still waiting for me to do that he told them he said at last that you were helmut schrenk he tried to laugh but it turned into a coughing fit and he bent over drawing in smoke with the air and making it worse until the girl went over to him and held his thin shaking body i should have thought of that i should have realized why theyd come at me so fast and with so many men and why colonel vader had been so annoyed when hed realized i wasnt schrenk i had to get you out of the way he said between the spasms of coughing i had to get you locked up so that you couldnt he broke off interrupted by a fresh paroxysm and lost his train of thought but it obviously didnt work yesi saidit worked he turned to face me at last his eyes bloodshot and the cigarette trembling in his hand and his body twisted with the effort of keeping upright what happened they took me into lubyanka he went on staring at me you were lucky is that all they did to you he meant my face ignatov was moving what is it youve got to do i asked schrenk that needs me out of the way and how much is the kgb going to pay you the colour was leaving his face in something like a whisper he said you think id work for them if you could do what you did to me you could do anything he crumpled as if id hit him his head went down and his eyes clenched shut and he stood there sagging like a puppet under invisible wires and for a moment i felt the sweetness of revenge coming into me and warning me and then when it was over i was able to think more clearly and remember that this wasnt schrenk at all it was the remains of the man they had worked on in lubyanka help him to sit down i said in russian to the girl ignatov moved again it seemed a long time before schrenk was on the settee looking up at me dragging on the new cigarette misha had lit for him you think id work for them you dont seem to be working for us any more i suppose he said and dragged more smoke in hungry for it i suppose you think i blew leningrad do you no its still intact that doesnt tell you anything ignatov moved again and this time vanished behind my field of vision he was working his way towards the door behind me i got very annoyed and swung round with a facehigh backhammer fist and he hit the door with a crash and bounced off and brought down a stack of shelves with cheap ornaments on them and i watched them disintegrating on the threadbare carpet while the girl screamed ignatov was staring up at me blood trickling on his temple dont you ever listen i asked him it was very quiet there didnt seem to be any noise in the whole of the building bad security i hadnt got any more control than schrenk misha was hurrying across to help ignatov her face shocked as she passed me one of those coy little hummel figurines with gold paint on it and its toes turned in toppled off the remains of the shelves and broke on the floor so i hadnt chalked up a total failure what did he do schrenk asked me irritably tell him if he tries to leave this room im going to kill him he wont listen to me pyotr schrenk said in russian keep away from the door and clear up that mess then he looked at me again and said in soft astonishment work for them apparently it had been on his mind oh come on i said impatiently its happened before he looked shocked not anyone from our show theres a first time for everything then he was on his feet again moving very fast considering his condition i tell you im not a defector the veins were standing out on his temples and he was staring at me with the last control over his rage slipping away do you understand that in a moment i said i dont understand anything yet i was hoping you could help me misha went over to him and tried to make him sit down again but he didnt even know she was there he just went on staring at me his thin body trembling detsky mir he said softly detsky mir with his mouth twisting into a hateful smile ignatov was looking up at him his hands full of broken china and the girls face had gone blank i didnt know what schrenk was talking about either detsky mir was a big shopping centre that was all childrens world no one spoke i listened to the slow tick of the dock in the comer and the sounds that had come into the building again id been expecting someone along here knocking on the door because ignatov had made a lot of noise with the china and misha had screamed but nobody came family fight schrenk was getting over his rage but there was something else there just as intense he stayed on his feet and he brought the words out with the whole of his body twisting and crouching over them as if he were whittling them away one by one with a razorsharp knife his eyes never left my face i had time inside lubyanka to think about childrens world all those soft cuddly animals and toy trains and ribbons for little girls i had a lot of time i was beginning to pick up a thread childrens world is right opposite lubyanka in dzerzhinsky square in lubyanka there are no windows along the top floor because the top floor is only a facade bordering an open space under the sky with a machinegun positioned in each corner it is the exercise yard for the prison id passed childrens world on my way to the prison when theyd picked me up in red square i spent a lot of my time schrenk said whittling the words out trying to see some connection some connection between those two places i had more time in there you see than you did and youve got to think of something havent you when they start work schrenk prided himself on his ability to survive the most gruelling interrogation by the use of practised and convincing disinformation croder had said we tested him at norfolk and even hypnosis couldnt break him down that is the sort of man he is but we dont know how bad the position is because we dont know how much he gave away nothing hed given away nothing not even leningrad let atone london now he was here in this squalid little room staring at me wanting me to know something important his maimed body trembling with the remnants of his rage and with something else that i didnt understand that was why i was listening carefully and finally i got it he said i got a connection going between childrens world and lubyanka it worried me you see i mean its like having one of our prisons with its execution chamber right across the street from harrods could only happen in moscow couldnt it typically russian slightly short on good taste he got himself a cigarette before misha could do it for him and flicked the match away i had to think up a connection yes wandering a bit am i no ignatov had finished clearing up and was squatting on a tea chest near the grandfather clock watching schrenk not understanding a word but listening to the sharp dry sibilants that cut through the silence theyre so clever these days arent they at making mechanical toys i mean that monkey you know that beats the two little brass cymbals together when you wind it up thats old hat now but im not thinking of anything more complicated surely they could make a small doll with trousers and a moustache to show hes a man and hang him upside down from a kind of trapeze with another doll beside him also in trousers and with bushy black eyebrows slanting down towards the middle to make him look fierce and a wooden stick in his hand you see what i mean it shouldnt be too difficult i think he was trying to laugh at this point or the laugh was just coming naturally because of his macabre sense of humour im not sure whatever it was it ended in more coughing because of the cigarette smoke i suppose his lungs were in a pretty bad way with the ashtrays always full then he said when he could youd wind him up and hed move the wooden stick up and down beating the bare feet of the doll whos hanging upside down from the trapeze im sure he said and the laughter started now and i hope i lever hear a sound like that again im sure all the little boys would tug their mummies along there to buy one in this country itd be a smash hit dont you think the laughter went on the strangest sound i have ever heard from a human throat a kind of soft yelping like the cry of an animal caught in a trap i saw misha staring at him her plump hands going slowly to her face while ignatov watched him with his thick grey mouth slightly open his eyes bewildered schrenk stood in a crouch as the breath came out of his body in spasms his eyes were squeezed almost shut with the glint of tears showing you see he said painfully i finally succeeded in making a connection a connection between childrens world and that other world across the square i could finally believe they existed within a stones throw of each other of course theres always the funny side to these things isnt there i mean quite a lot of good citizens are taken inside lubyanka for interrogation sometimes for days on end if they prove obstinate as you well know ash dropped from his cigarette and he brushed it clumsily off his jacket so you can easily imagine a young mother worried about the fact that her jewish husband has disappeared buying her little boy the funny mechanical toy hes been pestering her for then when he keeps on asking where daddy is she can tell him not to worry about him just go and play with his toy he began laughing again in soft little yelps dont you think thats an absolute absolute scream but when he swung his head up to look at me i saw the hatred burning in his eyes with a white hot flame then i understood his rage wasnt against me it was against that jackbooted crowd of thugs in lubyanka and the regime in which they operated and the order of command that structured it from the omnipotent politburo down to the cocky little militia men in the streets dr steinberg had been surprised that i hadnt grasped that most obvious of facts that when you damage a man as they had damaged schrenk with your bare hands and with special implements and with humiliation you will engender in what remains of him the most murderous hate it does after all become personal i could believe him now schrenk wasnt a defector misha had got him to sit down again on the settee and for a moment sat with him her head against his shoulder and her hand cupping his cheek she looked at me with her face questioning then withdrew into herself as she remembered what i had done to ignatov work for them schrenk said bitterly he shook off the girl and stared at me what does he say she pleaded to ignatov what is it about this lubyanka and this detsky mir i dont know he said broodingly why did the man hit you like that should i get the police you know better he said than to get the police schrenk patted the girls hand theres nothing to worry about sweetheart but your viktor would like some tea would you make some tea for us theres some in the samovar she said eagerly sensing a return to normal that would be very nice she hugged him in relief and i saw pain flicker across his face then she bounced off the settee and ran across to the urn leaving him staring at me weve got a mission on the board i said and im the executive in the field guess what they want me to do he brushed ash off his knees tell them ill make my report when im ready im not ready yet the objective i said patiently is to get you out of russia sorry i cant help you he drained his glass of vodka and put it on to the rickety little stool at the end of the settee getting it wrong and letting it fall to the carpet ignatov ambled forward to pick it up for him leave it there of course viktor i can pick things up for myself dont you know that i was forgetting we watched schrenk double over and feel for the glass his hand swinging like a hook till his fingers connected with the rim then he put the glass back on to the stool with ostentatious care though it rattled to the trembling of his hand before he could stop it you mean i asked him youre staying in moscow ive got friends here if theyre anything like this son of a bitch here then youre welcome to them he laughed and said hes not too fond of you either why do they want me out of russia they want to debrief you on the interrogation i could tell him so much and no more he was going to lie when it suited him and he was going to do it convincingly and if i shot questions at him i was going to get as much out of him as theyd got out of him in lubyanka all i could do was feel my way softly into the rage into the silently roaring battlefield theyd made of his mind and hope to intercept a few signals when he was off his guard and try to come out alive and get the message to bracken they want to give you some leave youve earned that god knows ill pay my own way he said and fumbled in the black and yellow packet for another cigarette it meant nothing at all it was just a spark coming out of the volcano i had to find a way of reaching him natalya hopes to see you again at the edge of my vision field i saw misha turn her head to listen natalyas dangerous schrenk said at once dont forget that he didnt ask me how id got on to her he knew that when id come into the field i would have started by contacting his friends noted i said but shes got her heart in the right place theyre all worried about borodinski it was an oblique shot and i got a hit though he kept most of his control certainly theyre worried about borodinski dyou think hell get off get off no control now hell get life you know that i took it further theres a lot of protests going on protests theyre not protests for gods sake theres only one thing those bastardsll listen to then he angled his head and watched me steadily youre not interested in borodinski no go ignatov moved and i whipped a glance at him but he was only helping the girl with the tray of tea the room was full of comfortable sounds the clinking of cups on saucers and the slow tick of the dock but the company was wrong give schrenk a few more days in here and hed wire himself to that clock and blow the whole building apart thank you sweetheart he said and took his cup from her the thing is his head turning to me i want to be left alone for a bit ive done enough for london for the moment youve said that yourself i applied for a job here as an aip but you know what happens to an application in that bloody place its like a snake trying to scratch its arse can never quite find it he sipped some tea so you see i dont want anyone coming here you or bracken or anyone else and that makes it difficult doesnt it he didnt look at me when he said that he wasnt going to enjoy this and neither was i but it was something we had to do had to work out misha brought some tea for me standing directly between schrenk and me with her plump countrygirls body and whispering who is natalya only an acquaintance i whispered back but of course she didnt believe me it makes it difficult schrenk said because when you leave here youre going to signal bracken and tell him where to find me and i dont want that i noticed the colour was leaving his face as he sat squinting through the smoke and his voice took on a forced quality as he made himself tell me the rest the kgb must be hunting you pretty hard if you gave them the slip in lubyanka so when you leave here im going to blow you as i did before and theres no way you can stop me then his head went down sorry pendulum the clock ticked we listened to it no one spoke he liked docks he liked the measured inevitability of time and the events it would bring he liked watching fuses burn id seen him do that he liked mechanics automatic relays timed release units delayed detonation devices even to bridge the philosophical gap between lubyanka and childrens world hed had to invent a mechanical toy it might be logical though dangerously mistaken to think he was therefore predictable so that one knew what he was going to do next where was the telephone he dragged on his cigarette pulling the smoke deep into his lungs he needed it more than food he needed it more than life because he was dying of it but hed got things to do first and i was in his way hed need a telephone ignatov and misha were absolutely quiet they hadnt understood what schrenk had said to me but they had seen what an effort it had cost him to say it and they had seen his head go down like that as he had quietly offered the executioners apology sorry there is a way i said i could stop you i could leave them both dead and the girl in shock when i left here no he said there isnt but we dont have to go into that would he need a telephone though ignatov might not be his only contact he might have a dozen of them one in the next apartment one in the apartment opposite any number of them there was something he had to do and he might have got a whole cell established to help him do it theyre hunting pretty hard i said for you too he got up impatiently twisting his body upright and holding it stiffly for a moment before he started pacing the worn carpet but that isnt the position is it youre not going to have me picked up your objective is to keep me out of their hands i didnt mean that i meant that you might not have much longer before they find you anyway you must have left a trail and this isnt a safehouse you can get a knock on the door any minute i tried to forget what this man had done to me and what he was going to do again if i couldnt stop him i came out here to get you safely home and with a bit of luck i can do it you dont need moscow any more he came up to me quietly one thin leg swinging slightly more than the other as he tried not to hobble and looked into my face and said with his eyes bright but moscow needs me it was the first indication id had that his mind had been affected that there was more going on inside him than a hurricane of rage it stopped me dead come on home i said youre too dose to it all you can always come back if you want to humouring me with his eyes burning oh my god yes that fitted too they hate it when you refuse to believe theyre napoleon not really i said he watched me with his bright eyes for a moment his small gnomes head on one side you have to go now he said and hobbled away from me across the threadbare carpet hes leaving he told ignatov in russian dont do anything stay where you are yes viktor where was the telephone thered be one in the front hallway a pay phone if i went through there i could pull out the wire but schrenk knew id think of that because hed think of it himself this wasnt a halftrained novitiate i was having to deal with i think youre making a mistake i told him one more wont do me any harm youre relying on me not to get you picked up the minute they arrest me ignatov was halfway between the door and the window nursing his temple the girl was over by the stove i began noting other things because the trap was closing now and the organism was aware of the need to escape but i didnt think i was going to be able to do that schrenk was a professional and he knew he had the advantage you wont get me picked up he said and turned to face me squinting above his cigarette theyd start work on me again and this time they might break me and then id have to blow london im perfectly safe in your hands ignatov wasnt moving he was watching schrenk trying to understand what he was saying misha stood rocking on her black strapped shoes her hands to her face waiting watching the man she adored and ready to claw my eyes out if i tried to hurt him youre perfectly safe in my hands i said till they start work on me again and break me and ask me to tell them where you are as they did before this time ill have the answer and ill have to give it to them he said immediately thats all right i wont be here we watched each other we werent telling each other anything we didnt already know each wanted the other to know hat he knew the scene going on in this tawdry little room in a moscow suburb was the exact epitome of the cold war the war that is kept cold by the ceaseless efforts of intelligence force to assure the opposition that nothing can be done in secret that no attack can be made without an immediate counterattack the danger cannot be contained simply by finding out what the opposition is doing the opposition must be informed that it is known we knew this and we had to go through the situation point by point in an attempt to contain the danger we also knew we had to fail it was going to be his life or mine he wasnt going to have me picked up hed only wanted to know my thinking and id told him he couldnt risk making a phone call when i left here because it wouldnt give him time to get out when the kgb closed in and found him in the same net he couldnt afford to let me leave here alive give yourself a bit of time i said to think ive done all the thinking theres no special hurry yes he said there is the clock ticked with a rhythm that was slightly off balance it needed a wad of paper a sixteenth of an inch thinner or a sixteenth of an inch thicker to equalize the swing of the pendulum perhaps it worried him sometimes in the night disturbing his sense of mechanical precision perhaps every morning he added a thickness of paper to the wad or removed a thickness to equalize the rhythm it would be like him to do that i could see him doing it with his thin body twisted as he crouched at the base of the grandfather clock with misha watching him as a mother watches a small boy i knew him quite well and this made it so much worse for me to do what i would have to do if i didnt do it i wouldnt leave here alive what happens if i find him but cant get him out the lamplight sending the rain pattern creeping in rivulets down croders face his dark hooded eyes glancing away as he instructed me bestowing on me the powers of an executioner that would make it easier for you all we want is his silence there was then no impediment i had sanction from on high and there would be no record made of the incident the file on scorpion would simply note mission accomplished as per instructions physically there was no problem offered i could reach him in three steps and use a swordhand to the larynx with killing power and there would be nothing he could do because he didnt have enough speed left enough strength left to defend himself it would occupy perhaps four seconds of my time then i could go home get out of this bloody place and try to forget mission accomplished good for you old horse you did it again and two months leave on the sussex coast with helena a dozen gardenias you shouldnt be so extravagant two months to forget the twisted thing on the floor with the black bruise on the throat and the sound of a girl screaming the comfortable smell of boiled cabbage god damn their eyes this man had done good work for them time and again put his life in hazard for them time and again stood up to that hellish assault on his psyche in lubyanka without breaking without exposing leningrad or london and now they were asking me to leave him on the floor like a bit of rubbish wed thrown out god damn their eyes mine not to reason why of course the ferret in the field obeys orders and goes down the hole and comes up again if hes lucky leaving behind him those unnameable things in the dark that he had to deal with dear god how long ago was it when theyd said to me if you decide to go into the field youll have to bear in mind the fact that youll be asked to do things youll find it hard to do we dont mean dangerous things you seem all right on that score we mean dirty things rotten things that may well give you nightmares afterwards were just giving you fair warning you understand so that youll know what youre going into if thats what you finally decide mine but to do or die yes quite if i didnt kill schrenk he would have to kill me i knew that things can get very basic in the end phase of a mission croder would probably laugh if he knew my thoughts his rats teeth nibbling with secret amusement my dear fellow the issue is cut and dried surely you see that its impossible for you to get this man out of russia if he refuses to go and if he stays here hell get picked up again and this time theyll get everything out of him youve said so yourself are you really saying that one mans life is worth the entire leningrad cell and possibly the security of the bureau as well you must be indulging in some sort of sentimentality and that can be highly dangerous the rats teeth nibbling and the hooded eyes looking away besides the mans a complete wreck now we could never put him into the field again good reason good logic but lord hear my prayer and damn their eyes he was watching me squinting through the smoke of his cigarette with an expression i couldnt quite read he was looking at me almost as if hed never seen me before though it wasnt exactly that got it yes as if he were never going to see me again how would he try to kill he couldnt do it himself and ignatov was no use to him he probably had a dozen people not far away a clique of fanatical dissidents lying low in readiness for a coup hed set the whole pack on me once i was outside there in the dark he seemed very confident so id have to get in first give him a last chance i was sent out here to find you i told him and the tightness in my throat distorted the words slightly i was told to pull you out i understand that and you understand why of course he began pacing again one thin leg swinging an inch farther than the other like the pendulum of the clock that must worry him too but he couldnt do anything about it they dont want me to be put under interrogation again because next time i might have to blow the whole works i understand that i a bit too loudly i said then for christs sake give it a minutes thought will you think out the implications he looked at me sharply and away again and went on with his pacing i wanted him to think this out for himself i didnt want to have to tell him the instant before i had to do it final considerations reluctance to do it in front of the girl because she adored him possibility of getting her to leave the room ask her to fetch something tell schrenk to send her away for a moment other thought intruding for sale jensen interceptor only miles fitted antiradar unit all refinements also classic jazz records and player the plastic chess set would remain in the caff and the other things like tennis racquets and skis and karate swords would be offered up and down the corridors in offduty hours theres usually a jumble sale when someone fails to come back because were loners most of us and not the kind of people who have relations to leave things to were born alone and we die alone and no one really notices at the bureau a prerequisite of our service is that we agree not to exist ive told you schrenk said ive done all the thinking he brought his pacing to a clumsy halt between the window and the small victorian writingdesk in the corner but what you mean is if you cant pull me out of moscow youve got instructions to do the other thing that right yes he nodded perfectly logical i moved at once but the inertia cost me time and he was much closer to the writingdesk than i was and his lunge for the top drawer was accurate and he had the gun in his hand and the safety catch off before i was anywhere near careful he said i looked at his face and stopped dead the desk was still rocking on its thin varnished legs and the drawer was sticking out at a slight angle with its brass handle swinging to stillness there was something else in the drawer but i couldnt see it dearly from this distance it was just one of a hundred items of data that were bombarding the consciousness and there wasnt enough time to examine it in addition to this the emotional block was inhibiting reason id lost back off a bit schrenk said youre too close i did what he told me never carry a gun do you his hand was absolutely steady thats a mistake peripheral vision ignatov had moved away from the wall where hed been standing with a handkerchief pressed to his temple he was looking at schrenk and waiting for instructions misha hadnt moved but i could hear her tremulous breathing she was a country girl and not used to the big city with its tall concrete towers and the grinding underground trains and men who were ready to kill each other in the warmth of a groundfloor apartment with the comfortable smell of boiled cabbage in the air sweetheart schrenk said would you get me another cigarette he didnt take his eyes off me the girl moved out of my sight and then came back lighting a cigarette from the crumpled paper packet and handing it to him taking away the butt of the old one and dropping it into the ashtray will everything be all right she asked him close to tears everything will be all right sweetheart yes dont worry my left eyelid had begun flickering and without thinking about it i was breathing more deeply there wasnt going to be any action because things had passed beyond that stage you cant rush a gun and i wasnt going to try the only conceivable chance was in getting behind ignatov and using him as a shield but there was schrenk behind that thing shapiro not some halftrained amateur and he wanted me out of his way had some good times didnt we he drew deeply on the cigarette remember rosita i didnt say anything he wasnt making sense tenerife tell you something i took her out the night before old templer flew in what a gal he began wheezing with quiet laughter his thin body shaking with it but his gun hand remained perfectly steady poor old templer he was going to take her out that night but of course those bastards he began coughing but managed to control it the range was fifteen feet and he knew i could move very fast remember that bloody bomb in the consulate in cairo got the motto out didnt we he giggled again good times we had some good times then he straightened up as far as he could and his tone was serious we could do a deal if you like i began listening carefully what deal i think ignatov must have moved at this point though he was outside my vision field schrenk said to him sharply pyotr stay where you are if you move any closer hell try to use you as a shield cant you see that stay exactly where you are in english he asked me are you interested i dont know yet pretty simple if you agree to abort the mission ill let you go home its not on always so bloody obstinate he said in annoyance dont you know the alternative yes you think theres a chance he shook his head im not going to have you picked up again you know that its too risky you might get away as you did before you know what ive got to do he was losing his colour and there was a certain stiffness coming into his body as if he were readying himself to do something that would need a lot of effort on his part a lot of determination i could feel my eyelid flickering again and wondered if it showed its always been an embarrassment spell it out for me i told schrenk we dont want any misunderstandings youre so right all i want you to do is to go back to london without telling them where i am or even that you found me i want to be left alone in a moment i saidyoud take my word he looked surprised of course you think you know me that well oh yes im not risking anything i thought about it yes you are they could pick me up again and grill me and i know where to find you concerned he asked quickly havent you got a capsule yes then youd have to use it that would be part of the deal he waited impatiently i watched him trying to read the truth in his eyes in his face in the set of his angular body in the steadiness of the hand that held the gun i believed he meant what he was saying i was certain he did you know what im offering you he said quietly my life yes his face was bloodless now at least it was going to mean something to him when he finally had to pump that thing and watch my body go reeling back in a series of jerks id at least have an epitaph to go out with someone cared but that didnt have to happen i could take him at his word and walk out of here and report to bracken and have the cell move in there were six of them fully trained and they could take schrenk and get him out of the country and put him back into a clinic and go on working on him the best specialists the best attention until one fine day he could walk without hobbling and stand up straight and go and see that girl in brighton again take her out in his jensen interceptor and then one day one day say to me you broke your word to me that time in moscow and its a bloody good thing you did or i wouldnt be here now he was half out of his mind and needed protecting from himself he was mixed up with a bunch of wildcat dissidents planning some kind of protest that was going to land him inside lubyanka again or flat on his back in the street with his head in the gutter and the young pofaced militia men standing arrogantly over him kicking him idly with their polished boots until the transport arrived you have to use every means to complete a mission and the object of scorpion was to get this man out of moscow and i could do it without any problem without lifting a finger yes i accept the deal and youve got my word on it the rest would be up to bracken and his team and they wouldnt have any problem either once schrenk was subdued and in their care croder had lined up support facilities that would get them across the frontier at an hours notice bracken had told me so the thinking schrenk said heavily is for you to do not me but i havent got a lot of time quite frankly im going to give you another minute sixty seconds i think thats fair the gun was aimed at my forehead he was a first class shot and could drop me where i stood without any pain he was a humane man sixty seconds that was a long time more time than i really needed a generous man i heard the tick of the clock we all heard it the other two hadnt understood anything of what wed been saying but they could sense what this silence meant wed both stopped talking and he was holding the gun perfectly still i looked at it carefully it was a mm smith and wesson and would carry eight shots in the magazine schrenk would only use one tick took the idea occurred to me that if i remained staring into the barrel of that thing i would perhaps see the nose of the bullet travelling towards me in the final microsecond of life as young chepstow had possibly seen it when hed been sitting at the cafe table drinking his last cup of coffee in phnom penh a couple of years ago thinking perhaps it was a bee tick tock schrenk was very pale now and there was something coming into his eves a kind of blankness i suppose he was having to blank out his mind and leave it clear of any philosophical considerations that might finally get in the way of what he had to do which was to squeeze the first nicotinestained finger of his right hand by a simple command to the motor nerves tick tock how long had he said sixty seconds but he wouldnt fire without some kind of warning he wouldnt expect me to know when the sixty seconds were up perhaps he was counting was i expected to count as well schrenk do you want me to count because it was no go if i gave him my word i would have to keep it it didnt matter if he were half out of his mind and needed protecting from himself so forth those arguments were rational but not admissible it wasnt for me to judge him now hed worked damned hard for our people and kept us safe all of us leningrad and london all of us while theyd been trying to break him in lubyanka and hed earned our trust my trust tick tock i really do wish youd get that bloody thing what i was not going to do was walk out of here and tell bracken i was aborting the mission and ask him to give me safe passage back to london with my tail between my legs wish youd get that bloody thing to tick evenly its getting on my nerves call it pride would you not enough guts to face the fact that for the first time in my life im failing a mission i dont give a damn what you call it its none of your bloody business must i suppose be up by now sixty seconds arent long tick flickering left eyelid flickering sweat running down wet on the palms the face wound throbbing the pulse rate high small round barrel and i suppose i suppose that if in point of fact i finally glimpse the pointed lead nose of the bullet its going to look quite large two inches from the centre of my forehead large enough to blot his whole face out of sight tock id say thats about it q i took a breath all right no deal his eyes widened slightly why not for gods sake thats none of your bloody business he went on staring for another second or two i didnt think youd be such a bastard making me do a thing like this his tone had gone dead you should have thought of that before in a moment he nodded and kept the gun on me while he felt for the drawer of the writingdesk with his left hand and found it and took the thing out the thing id seen before it was a silencer and he fitted it to the gun the distance was still something like fifteen feet almost the width of the room the window was obliquely behind him and the door was three or four feet to my left and out of sight ignatov was over by the wall and the girl was on the other side near the kitchen area the only thing in the centre of the room was the short velvetcovered settee there was nothing in the environment i could use for survival in the half second it would take schrenk to fire nothing no hard feelings i hope i hardly recognized his voice he stood there with his body twisted and the left shoulder down the sweat shining on his thin agonized face as he stared at me not at my eyes but slightly above them making no contact giving me the chilling idea that i was a lifeless object nothing he could communicate with its your own conscience i told him thats all youll get all i expected mind turning round you mean you havent got the guts to do it while im looking at you i seemed to be breathing cold air in the warmth of the room my lungs gradually contracting my body shrinking i didnt watch schrenk any more i wanted to forget him if i could in the last instant i watched the heavy shape of the silencer im not going to shoot he said i just want you to turn round of course i could refuse but the organism was thinking for itself and i had the instinctive knowledge that if i didnt turn round hed have to shoot anyway so i turned round pyotr he said i heard ignatov moving away from the wall yes viktor take this gun i heard the strange voice saying in russian and go outside with him keep the gun in the pocket of your coat so that no one else will see it the voice stopped and i heard the effort he was having to make to go on with what he was saying this man is extremely clever and he will take risks because his life is at stake you must keep a good distance between him and yourself take him out to your car and when he is inside it shoot him dead there was another pause and when schrenk spoke again there was anger in his voice as if he had to work up some kind of resentment against me to go through with this drive him as far as the river if you want to ask boris and dmitriy to go with you but id prefer you to go alone you dont have to use any weights in the river all you have to do is to make sure he is found a long way from here you understand yes viktor a change in ignatovs voice too it sounded strong now and deeper he said to me open the door the senses had become acute i heard misha whispering so softly that i didnt catch the words some kind of prayer i was quite moved and had a sudden hatred of schrenk for doing this in front of her for being so coarse he could have sent her out slightly short on good taste i thought as i opened the door and wondered who had said that where id heard it pyotr if he makes any attempt to get away shoot at once and to kill yes viktor then i heard a long shuddering breath and schrenk spoke softly in english good times shoot he fired six rapid shots at short range into the spine and the impact pitched my body forward in a series of jerks as the chips of bone and cartilage from the shattered vertebrae were forced out through the rib cage in an explosion of blood and plasma as my face hit the snow i thought schrenk you bastard i hope they burn you for this have to do better gutthink wouldnt help me i listened to his footsteps along the corridor behind me i estimated the distance at something like six feet not nearly dose enough to do anything in safety we kept on walking towards the door leading to the car park at the rear he fired directly into the back of the head and the brain matter burst and splattered against the walls in a welter of skull fragments there was no more time for conscious thought even of moira even of roses life was simply present then absent executive deceased have to do much better yes a normal reaction to awareness of imminent death with the imagination running wild but gutthink useless and dangerous survival possible only through rational thought brainthink man in a worn brown overcoat and hornrimmed glasses good evening comrade ignatov good evening they say its going to snow again surely weve had enough a chance obviously to move extremely fast and get the man in the brown overcoat between me and the gun but ignatov might have fired precipitately and shot him by accident keep walking i quickened the pace a little he had the gun in the pocket of his coat otherwise the other man would have seen it he couldnt take accurate aim like that but it didnt make a lot of difference at this range he could hit me lethally with three or four shots shifting the aim according to the visible point of impact i didnt know if hed handled firearms before but it seemed likely schrenk wouldnt leave me in the bands of an amateur open the door his voice was heavy its tone entirely changed by his possession of a killing instrument there had been no power in his voice before no authority now there was both and something else something like anticipation id pictured the end of the world for him too often with his three children asking galya where daddy had gone and now he had the end of my own world in his hands and he was impatient for it once the eight lumps of spinning metal had gone burrowing into me he would be safe again and go home to galya and the children you could see his point the night air was freezing after the heat of the apartment the heavy door slammed shut behind us over that way he was closer i thought or it might simply be that the wall of the building was projecting his voice forward and making it sound louder i would have to watch things like that his mudbrown syrena was obliquely to our right not far from the entrance to the car park and facing this way i hadnt locked it after id got him out the street lamps cast a sick greenish light across the area and the albedo was high the reflections bouncing off the cellulose of the parked cars and the blanket of ground snow shadows were sharp pyotr if he makes any attempt to get away shoot at once and to kill but he was going to do that anyway as soon as we reached his car so i didnt have much to lose he fired into the neck and i felt the spine explode steady one two three twelve cars in the far corner a pickup truck thirteen objects of good cover but too far away the nearest car at least twenty feet from where i was walking we were crossing an open space no one in sight a long way off the drone of a tram no sound of other traffic the evening rush hour was over and in this city by night the streets are almost empty what would she do with them make for the car the syrena authority in his tone the authority of death itself five hundred were an awful lot theyd fill the whole flat and what could she do with them afterwards change the water every day sit and stare at them what pretty roses i listened to his footsteps on the snow behind me i seemed to be crunching more than he was perhaps he was walking in the hollows i was leaving putting his feet exactly where i had placed mine it would look rather comic like a couple of ducks on their way to the pond picking their feet up and putting them down at orderly intervals but there was no one here to see he would be the last person on earth i was going to see a doughfaced plodding man with a wife and three little children and a gash on his temple and a gun in his keep walking the sound of his voice jarred my nerves why had he said that had i been slowing i must have perfectly understandable as schrenk would have said squinting through the cigarette smoke you dont run to your funeral which is your car i asked him you know which one it is its the brown syrena near the entrance i nodded and walked onjust sit and stare at them for gods sake after twentyfour hours she wouldnt even be able to stand the smell because it would remind her of what had happened shed go out and get stinking that was all shed do or take her lotus up the ml flat out in the dark with the headlights swallowing up the night and everything she could ever remember of me and when she got back to the flat shed just think oh my god what am i going to do with all these bloody roses the snow crunched under our shoes i think one of my shoes was leaking or some snow had got in over the top my left foot felt wet useless enough sensory data if you like i began turning my head very gradually so that i could trap the sounds from behind me in the auricle of the right ear his footsteps loudened slightly i estimated he was still a good six feet behind me so that there was no chance of turning on him but i kept my head slightly to one side exposing the right ear to the auditory source for the left hemisphere to process i could hear his breathing now he was a heavy man too well fed by his loving wife so in fact the rose thing wasnt really going to work out after allit was just a grandiose gesture a juvenile urge to make an impression from out here in the neverending dark it would have been subtler to send one rose one sublime and perfect rose to remember me by not an ostentatious barrowload ignatov old boy do you mind if i just phone harrods before we wind up the evening something like laughter a long long way down in the psyche a neural reaction perhaps while the slow cold wave went down the spine and the sweat gathered and ran the reaction of the beast that smells the slaughterhouse he was squeezing his finger at every step we took and i could feel the impact and hear the shrill jangling of the nerve system as the organism took the shock i believe ive got another thirty seconds to live but theres nobody i can tell were born alone and we die alone and no one really notices headlights swung across the facade of the building opposite and sparked light from the windows sound of a vehicle smell of exhaust gas the syrena the man behind me said oh yes sony i hadnt meant to go off course it was the organism again not wanting to go near that particular car because it was a hearse the headlights swung in a half circle and i saw the vehicle turning in from the street a small dark moskvich bumping over the ruts with its snow chains clanking and the bodywork rattling a kind of mad toy that some joker had wound up and sent into the car park to raise a laugh it obliterated the slight sounds ignatov was making and of course i couldnt see him because he was behind me and for a moment the idea came to me that he wasnt there any more that id let my nerves get out of hand to the point where id imagined him it was an enormous relief and i took a deep breath and remembered the reports of people who had come back from the edge of death they all said the same thing first you panic then you try to do something about the situation then when you realize its all up you get a feeling of euphoria as the organism anaesthetizes the final awareness of death but i wasnt at that stage yet and id better wake up to the fact that ignatov was in fact still behind me and all he had to do was stumble a bit on the frozen ruts and his finger would tighten and id be finished ignatov i said you didnt understand what we were saying did you viktor and i no the little moskvich rattled to a halt a dozen yards away and its lights went out he offered me a deal i said over my shoulder he said hed let me leave moscow if i gave him my word not to tell anyone where he is dont turn round he said and i could hear that he meant it i suppose the moskvich was worrying him it might be a friend of schrenks or someone he knew and they might come over for a chat i refused the deal i said but i think that was unwise id like to reconsider i wanted time the syrena he said there was a note of warning in his voice if viktor knew i was ready to accept the deal hed prefer it that way weve worked together you know he must have told you more than anything i wanted tune he told me nothing a man got out of the moskvich and crunched across the snow he didnt look in our direction in the quiet of the night the distant tram went on droning my senses had become finely tuned in the last few minutes and i was acutely aware of the environment viktor and i are good friends i said over my shoulder thats why we all had a drink before we started talking its just that he thinks i want to stop this little protest hes going to make you know about borodinski you can quite understand how i feel about it now id like to reconsider the deal he offered me i want to talk to him again my voice sounded odd in the silence of the car park the voice of a man talking to himself viktor would come down very hard on you if he ever found out i was finally ready to do the deal with him time give me time but it meant nothing except that a drowning man was grasping at straws worse fabricating them out of thin air ignatov didnt bother to answer the syrena was twenty feet away from me now and i was walking straight towards it with my head still turned i couldnt tell if hed come any closer to me i didnt think so i think he was still walking in my footprints hoping to keep the deep snow out of his shoes fifteen feet ten the car stood broadside on the passengers door was closed just as id left it when id cut the scarf from his wrists and ankles and let him get out the keys would still be in the ignition i hadnt been concerned about them at the time because id seen that the man hobbling across the car park was schrenk open the door ignatov said from behind me his voice faded a little as he spoke hed stopped to keep a safe distance between us when i opened the door thought was becoming rarefied and reality slipped out of focus i nearly asked him who was going to drive the syrena looked bigger than it had before a large brown container for the body snow covering its roof like a white pall and a dead mans face in the window my own reflection take him out to your car and when he is inside it shoot him dead the night was totally still i could feel the cold creeping into my left foot and smell the faint residue of the exhaust gas the moskvich had left on the air a long way off i could see the glint of a gold dome one of the churches with an illuminated red star at the tip of a spire beyond it the sky was black in the immediate environment i saw my pale reflection in the window of the syrena and ignatovs crooked shadow across the bodywork there was no one else in the car park so he would have taken the gun from his pocket by now in order to shoot accurately open the door he told me again his voice was still heavy and authoritative and there was something else there now distinct but difficult to define i think it was akind of awe my heightened awareness told me that he had never killed a man before i opened the door and the snow fell away get in i did as he told me he was still six feet away from the side of the car and he wouldnt come any closer in case i tried to attack him at the last minute i was right the gun was now in his hand and i saw him lift it to eye level and hold it forward so that he could line up the sights wind the window down he said hurry he wanted to get it done with before anyone else drove into the car park i turned the cheap aluminium handle and the window went down in a series of jerks sticking on the rubber flanges and then freeing shut the door the keys were still in the ignition and i tugged them out as i dragged the door shut and flung them hard into his face and kicked away from the door to give me the impetus for a horizontal dive that took me dear of the steering wheel with my right fist punching the horn to provide sound shock and my left hand wrenching at the drivers door handle and the main force of the momentum sending me through the gap as the door burst open and the retaining strap broke and the panel smashed back against the bodywork the first shot ruffled the sleeve of my coat and shattered the window hed shouted something maybe a cry of alarm because of the horn and the soft wet phutt of the silencer came an instant afterwards i was into the snow and lurching on to my feet and losing balance and trying to find it again if i went underneath the car id be a sitting duck so i feinted to the right with my head and shoulders visible to him through the shattered window and dropped and span the other way with the sickening rush of a dose shot fanning my temple there was a row of cars immediately behind the syrena and i went hard for cover and slipped on the snow and crashed down and dug my heels in and went forward again and reached the front end of a snowcovered pobeda before he loosed the third shot and hit a headlamp and sprayed me with glass and fired again and hit my shoulder before i could use full cover the mm smith and wesson had eight shots in the magazine and hed used four and id have to remember to go on counting because that could become critical if i lived through the next few minutes he was taking it badly he was a family man and too well fed and id been picking away at his nerves ever since id got him alone in the underground car park threatening to pitch him out of the syrena on our way here so forth the work id done on his carotid and medial nerves had worried him and the strike id used on him in schrenks apartment must still be giving him pain he now knew me well enough to realize that if he slipped on the snow and i got to him before he could aim and fire i might kill him out of hand a professional hunter would have used this experience to his own advantage and move well away from the quarry and take careful aim before putting in the final accurate shot this man was not a professional hunter he was afraid of the creature he had to exterminate and his fear confused him hed already wasted four shots half the entire magazine but of course he only needed one even a lucky one to drop me cold id lost sight of him and that was dangerous but he wouldnt know that i was crouched under cover of the pobeda and all he had to do was lie flat and take aim and smash one of my ankles to subdue me and stop me running but he hadnt thought of that because of his fear he was thinking more about being attacked than attacking me i was beginning to know him then i saw his face and as the gun flashed my shoes slipped and dug in and i went sideways and then forwards hurling myself towards the car immediately behind and feeling the bite as a bullet scored a neck muscle and smashed into the bodywork of the car alongside i ran hard but it was open ground and my feet were slipping as the cold air pumped into my lungs and froze the neck wound as i lunged for the pickup truck in the corner and slipped again and hit the front wing and went down with one foot dragging and my back exposed i could hear him following and i think he slipped once and went down because his breath grunted out and there was a scuffling sound then i was behind the truck and moving towards its rear backing and facing the way id come i couldnt hear him now blood was seeping into the collar of my coat from the neck wound the shoulder had been oozing and filling the sleeve but there was no artery hit or i would have weakened by this time my left arm was still usable and there was no other damage i stood in a half crouch listening to the silence he would be close to the truck on the other side from here i could see the open ground id run across and he wasnt there he had two more shots left in the magazine and he might be aware of that he wouldnt like it but hed now have to stalk me at close range and make sure of a lethal hit when he fired next i didnt want to lie flat and sight for his feet underneath the truck because id be too vulnerable if he rushed me i had to rely on auditory cues alone for information but they wouldnt be very strong his breathing and the brittle sound of the snow when he moved for the moment i heard nothing the night was grave quiet the snow was fresh in the lee of the truck and i scooped it into my hands and compressed it making a snowball kneading it until it was heavy and ironhard i would need to blind him or hit the wound on his temple if i were going to do any good but thered be no time to aim before he fired and he wouldnt fire until i was securely in his sights he had learned from the uselessness of those six shots i waited with the snowball gradually melting through my fingers he was moving now i heard the faint crunching of snow from the front of the truck it was a risk but i dropped flat and sighted along the underside of the truck and saw his face and the blossoming flash of the shot and heard the fluting rush of air against my jaw as i twisted over and reached for the tailboard and pulled myself up with my left hand slipping because of the blood my shoulder flaring with sudden pain as i flexed it the bullet had lodged there close to the bone seven but i was scared now because he was getting close and he knew hed have to make it for certain with the last shot i lowered my feet to the snow again because he wouldnt shoot to maim at this stage the snowball was resting on the surface and i picked it up and pressed it harder and put it on the metal footrest below the tailboard and stopped and made another one and held it ready listening he didnt move i thought i could see the top of his head a dark patch in the corner of the trucks windscreen but i was sighting through the rear window of the cab and the image was indistinct it could be the driving mirror or the corner of a roof in the distance the whole truck was sliding to one side and then lifting silently watch it and i fell forward against the tailboard and took a deep breath until the scene steadied losing more blood than id thought getting lightheaded i tried to drop sat again to see where his feet were but the scene started rocking badly and i straightened up and held the snowball against the neck wound to slow the bleeding something below me and i looked down blood on the snow black in the acid light of the street lamps nothing else to attract the attention no sound from him he mustnt know he mustnt know about the blood because i couldnt do much to stop it until i was out of range and all hed have to do was to wait it out until it left my brain quietly draining while the scene shifted and swung and turned over on me and i hit the snow and he came to stand over me phutt finis i would have to make him fire again for the last time he hadnt moved yet or i would have heard his shoes on the dry snow he would be waiting for me to move first waiting and listening he was righthanded and if he moved he would circle the truck anticlockwise with his gunhand leading but he didnt move it worried me i made another snowball a bigger one black and white in the green unearthly glow of the street lamps blood and snow pressing it harder the dark stain spreading across its surface as the truck tilted and went down dipping and rising and oh christ im leaving it too late steadying a deep breath i would have to find him in the next sixty seconds while there was enough blood left to feed the brain ignatov where are you the pain flaring again in the shoulder as i fell sat and stared into the narrow gap between the trucks chassis and the snow he wasnt there the ball of ice freezing my hand the scene shifting again as i got to my knees and then to my feet he wasnt there that was all right i could go now and try to get someone to look at my watch what youre doing and think for gods sake think because hes towering over me stark against the street lamps with his feet on the step of the cab and the gun coming into the aim at short range snowball all the strength i had left and it flew upwards against the flash and struck his face but i was spinning round and going down again hitting the snow and bouncing with the pain bursting in the shoulder and the trucks angular shape rocking against the sky and the blood coming into my head again and bringing consciousness back scaring me because there were sudden intervals of amnesia and i couldnt remember if that was the seventh or the eighth shot but he didnt fire again and i managed to grab his foot as he dropped from the metal step and tried to start running he came down full length and i put him out with a neck strike that would leave him alive because all i had to do was to stop him going to the nearest telephone before i could get clear the keys of the syrena took a long time to find in the snow two or three blackouts the shoulder burning alive but found them the keys all right i called the embassy from the underground garage and got bracken direct at ext speech code for schrenk apt pavilion baumanskaja told him theyd have to be quick and pick me up then i walked through the concrete columns and up the ramp and found the pobeda where id left it got in and sat wailing might hit something if i drove any more i hoped they wouldnt be long blood on the phone down there whole trail of it someone might notice dizzy and getting thirsty singing in the ears dark coming and going hurry midnight for gods sake leave me alone i told them hes all right a voice said who is i hit out and felt an arm and heard something crash on to the floor steady someone said it sounded like bracken open your eyes this was in russian a womans voice id beard it before somewhere eyes then i saw her swaying from side to side leaning over me melting into some kind of shadow and taking shape again i remembered her now cant you keep still i asked her she laughed deep in her throat raging thirst can he sit up i saw bracken now place stank of chemicals they helped me but only on one side the other side was peculiarly numb am i in bed for gods sake take it easy bracken said i let them pull me upright and when they werent ready far it i swung my legs over and stood up and they caught me as the wall swung round and hit me full in the face when was that i asked them an hour ago bracken was trying to sound cheerful he was sitting hunched on a brownpainted crate below the window his big blunt face lit by the street lamps outside and the glow of the stove the woman was leaning against the wall watching me with her arms folded black sweater and slacks raven black hair eyes like slow coals zoya you are for safe keeping a lot of it was coming back ive got a thirst like a wooden god she laughed and swung a jug over a glass the room looked like a hospital ward bowls and towels and instruments all round the bed a sickly stink in the air i drank three glasses of tepid water and lay back again and then the whole thing hit me bracken did you find him he shook his head slowly no but then we didnt expect to i shut my eyes and something inside my head kept saying all that for nothing all that for nothing why not i asked him you phoned at i got three men there by hed had fifteen minutes to get out quite long enough shit you did your best my eyes came open time for epitaphs is it there were half a dozen pillows and a couple of them rolled on to the floor but i kept moving and got my legs over the edge of the bed she came at me fast but i said leave me alone for christs sake im all right now my left arm was in a sling and i couldnt feel anything on that side it didnt interest me all i could think about was that bastard schrenk id nailed him at his base and now we were about as dose to him as wed been when id first got into moscow why had i let him reach that gun because i hadnt wanted to kill him id been holding off taking things right to the brink chancing my own life and trying to save his sometimes you learn the hard way take it easy bracken said and got off the crate to hold me up time is it now i asked him and wobbled about leaning on him when i had to nearly twelve twelve what oh night he must rest zoya said angrily i suppose she was waiting for me to fall over going to be right out of luck two lumps of metal lying on a bloodied swab in one of the basins i said what are those they both went into the same shoulder bracken said the woman began clearing the stuff away obviously not prepared to speak to us any more did you find ignatov no what about the girl what girl there was a girl there misha the apartment was empty when our people got there he steadied me as i moved my feet weak as chewed string bloody infuriating someone was outside the door and we all froze by habit and zoya opened it standing close in the gap a man spoke in russian and she nodded and went out shutting the door croders on his way here bracken said and i jerked my head to look at him croder things have been moving look why dont you sit down for a bit how did he get into moscow patiently he said you mean croder i let him lower me on to the crate and i put my head back against the wall and waited until the throbbing eased off it was the first time id ever heard of a control coming right into the target area from london and now it had to be croder and he was going to find his executive in the field looking just about as useful as something the cat had coughed up and there was nothing i could do about it whats he doing in moscow i asked bracken going to help us out want another drink you dont need any help for gods sake hed pulled me off the street and gotme into the safehouse at a minutes notice even ferris couldnt have done any better fill me in will you ive been in signals with london for the past twelve hours they did you know croder was coming out here yes uninformation jesus i his orders they blew gorsky by the way he didnt want to talk about croder gorsky the man at the first safehouse a good man reliable did schrenk think i was there presumably the kgb raided the place an hour ago schrenk wasnt going to leave me alone that was all right the next time id follow instructions all we want is his silence do it for gorsky mind getting me some water coming up i was drinking it when the door opened and croder came in a thin scarecrow in the heavy military coat his skulls head catching in the light from the corridor and then darkening in shadow as he moved farther into the room picking his way through the cluttered furniture as if through a minefield halting in front of me at last and staring down with his black hooded eyes what happened schrenk tried to kill him bracken said where is schrenk we lost him again the skin drew taut across the pale pointed face and the hooded eyes blinked once it was like watching a lizard but i felt a strange sensation of comfort with someone like this here coldblooded and totally dedicated we wouldnt make any more mistakes he heard the door click shut and turned with a quick swing of his shoulders it was zoya coming back he looked at bracken again how many do we have left in the cell its still intact six of them how are they deployed two are watching schrenks last known base and two are watching an apartment block where schrenks lieutenant lives with his family pyotr ignatov one mobile liaison one signals croder swung back to look down at me i assume youre not operational i was so annoyed that i got on to my feet before bracken could try to help me this time it didnt feel too bad im short on protein thats all there wasnt time to eat he lost blood zoya said in thick accents i could not make any transfusion here of course he is weak croder looked at her are you a doctor yes there are two bullets and a third wound he needs to rest he came out of a general anaesthesia an hour ago can he handle protein yet perhaps in liquid form but you are taking risks he has lost blood quite a lot and so he is weak the conditions were sterile but i cannot guarantee there will be no infection have you any liquid protein croder was into fast fluent russian i have chicken broth yes give him some if you will i sat down on the crate again sliding my back against the wall and feeling the left shoulder gradually coming to life the room span slowly for a while and then croder came back into focus perched on the end of the bed zoya went out and he asked bracken whats security like in this place as good as youll get he said in moscow she even keeps weapons here we dont want those croder looked back at me i dont wish to press you but id like your report on schrenk just jive me the salient points if you feel up to it there was still some fog in my head but i thought i could work out a summary i took a minute and then said hes gone half out of his mind they roughed him up too much in lubyanka and hes jewish hes made some friends among the dissidents hes out for revenge and hes rationalizing it thinks hes crusading for the cause just my impressions i had to wait for a bit because i was out of breath croder watched me still as a reptile his black eyes brooding dont hurry he said he blew me off the street he said he had to get me out of his way didnt want anyone to know where he was wants to be left alone i tried to remember what else schrenk had said with the cigarette smoke curling past his narrowed bloodshot eyes and his body twisted to face me he said theres only one thing the bastards will listen to by which he meant it was no good just protesting against oppression id say theres something he wants to do and very badly id say hes become a dangerous fanatic i stopped again to get my breath something else he said moscow needs me i was trying to talk him into pulling out with us and that was his answer degree of megalomania i suppose do you think so asked croder i thought about it its hard to say i mean hes still a very capable operator he could do a lot of damage if he wanted to quite so then the door opened and we all looked round it was zoya bracken i said does schrenk know this address no dont worry all very well schrenk had just blown gorskys safehouse and if he knew about this one hed send in the kgb and thered be nothing we could do theyd get the london director the director in the field and the executive all in one bag it didnt bear thinking about zoya had brought me a can of selfheating soup us army issue god knew where shed got it from she poured it into a thick white cup and gave it to me would you say croder asked in his cold thin tones that schrenk has got a cell together possibly theres this man ignatov and he mentioned two other people boris and dmitriy its either a cell or some kind of wildcat group of revolutionary dissidents croder said nothing for a moment then began speaking in formal russian to zoya you did a splendid job with this mans injuries should have mentioned it before im most indebted to you doctor it was good to work again he gave a slight bow now if youll excuse us we have to debrief him i understand she looked at me critically as she turned to leave take care of him please he is still weak she took away the selfheating can and quietly closed the door croder sat with his head halfturned listening to her footsteps growing fainter along the passage then he swung round to look at me i want to get a picture of schrenk in my mind as clearly as you can give it would you say hes totally unbalanced by his experiences in lubyanka do you feel his imagination has run wild and that he sees himself as the shining liberator of oppressed russian jewry that sort of thing or would you on the other hand say that hes still in full possession of his professional expertise and capable of mounting a sensitive operation with the help of an organized cell please consider carefully because this is important they were both watching me in the silence and i leaned my head back against the wall and shut my eyes remembering all i could of schrenk the ravaged face and the crippled body with its rage contained like a furnace that strange laughter that had led to those fits of coughing when the force of his hate had threatened to choke him the chilling diatribe about detsky mir and its mechanical toys when i felt ready i opened my eyes and said i dont think hes unbalanced in the normal sense i think hes been given a direction ive never seen such hate in a man and hes turned it into a driving force which is typical of him id certainly say hes in full possession of his talents and could get a cell together i dont believe he sees himself as a shining liberator but im pretty sure hes capable of liberating borodinski for instance by leading an armed raid on the courthouse and getting him out i left it at that croder wrinkled his thin brows did he mention doing such a thing no it was just an example i see he studied his skeletonic hands i dont think hes interested in borodinski but the rest of the picture youve given me ties in with the information weve received that he means to assassinate the chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet leonid brezhnev i got off the crate and on to my feet bracken came to help me but i said no im all right i took a few steps keeping dose to the wall and began feeling stronger the thing was i couldnt just go on sitting there not now i went on shuffling between the furniture making quite a lot of progress and when i turned round i saw that croder was standing up now watching me he said thinly you think he can do it dont you yes you didnt hesitate no croder looked at bracken what do you think i think this is all we needed croder said to me i should explain that weve had various information coming in some of it to bracken some of it by signal to london thats why i decided to fly out he was standing perfectly still i noticed like a perched bird of prey he didnt need to pace up and down or light a cigarette to transfer his tension he could handle it internally the information we had was from fairly reliable sources but the informants werent close to schrenk as you have been frankly i was hoping youd tell me that he was half out of his mind and a broken reed since your considered opinion is quite otherwise then we shall have to take action he looked at me very directly as hed looked at me in the airport in berlin you say you tried to talk schrenk into pulling out of moscow and that he refused is that correct more or less is it correct or isnt it standing perfectly still his shoulders hunched in his oversize military coat his black eyes fixed on me yes and i waited for it then why didnt you follow my instructions bracken looked away i couldnt tell him the truth that id been going to do it three paces and a swordhand to the larynx a matter of four seconds i couldnt tell him that because itd sound like a lie i still thought i could talk him into pulling out did you indeed and what happened he got to a gun you let him do that the room had begun swinging slightly and i found my right hand on the back of a padded chair croder stood facing me with that eerie stillness of his and i wanted to go and smash his face in you werent there i said to him were you it makes no difference surely oh yes it does if you want to know what the executives are up against why dont you come out and do their bloody job for them youd learn a tot the echoes seemed to go on for a long time in the silence i heard bracken clearing his throat but he didnt speak the fault croder said icily is partly mine i know your reputation youre ready enough to do dangerous things even foolhardy things but youre not ready to do unpleasant things when will you learn that in our trade a conscience is a luxury i held on hard to the back of the chair thinking out what id say that schrenk wasnt expendable that in the army he would have got the vc for holding out as he had in lubyanka that killing in cold blood is not the same as killing in a rage other things crossed my mind but in the end i said nothing because i knew croder was right in principle and was now proved right in fact we hadnt got a crippled lunatic on our hands wed got a man perfectly capable of assassinating the head of the russian state something i wanted to know are you suspending me he looked me over if you think your services can be of any further value id appreciate your staying in if theres anything unpleasant to be done i shall do it myself that is why im here he turned away come and sit down bracken told me get your strength up might need it i got across to the painted crate without much bother but the shoulder was really coming back to life a good sign but a bloody nuisance give me some information for gods sake i told him fill me in id been out cold for three hours and he said hed been in signals with london the whole time he glanced at croder who nodded our information bracken said had been coming in for quite a time and from more than one source we quite a time some few weeks he said awkwardly thats why it was decided to send you out here one of the reports said that schrenk faked his abduction at the hanover clinic with the help of his friends he meant us to assume the kgb had got him back inside lubyanka so that wed give up and leave him atone i wasnt told of this until today but the first reports croder cut in werent directly from our own people they were from the underground dissident faction and passed to london for raw intelligence analysis the dissidents believed that schrenk was acting officially and with the backing of the british secret service revolutionary fervour always has an element of insanity as im sure you know i began going cold if id been given this information i said i would have eliminated schrenk the minute i found him croder wheeled on me the instructions were already there i told you specifically in berlin that all we required was his silence perfectly true thank you there was still some of the chicken broth left in the cup and i finished it feeling all right bracken asked i managed something like a laugh how would you feel dont worry well find him i looked at croder i suppose youve considered warning the soviets of course it would be suicidal the situation at this moment is that an attempt on brezhnevs life might be made and might succeed if it succeeds the interests of russian dissidents will suffer unimaginably in terms of reprisals since some of the action group are bound to be caught but if we even leaked a warning to russian security the repercussions could be disastrous not only for the jewish dissidents but for eastwest relations even if no attempt were made at all his feet had come together and he was standing perfectly still again his black eyes brooding those two possibilities are unfortunately not the worst the worst possibility is that schrenk might make an attempt and succeed and be discovered and identified as a western agent when he stopped speaking the room was intensely quiet not long ago when it was known in the united states that oswald had offered his services to the kgb shortly before he assassinated president kennedy the kgb themselves were terrified that one of their number might have instructed him to do so and that the americans might find out i can imagine few situations that could push us closer to the brink of world war and that is the situation we are now faced with here in moscow the intense quiet came back into the room the shock of what croder was saying had left my head strangely numbed and i didnt have any particular thoughts except perhaps this is an awful lot to handle even with croder running things in the field an awful lot when do you think this idea began i asked croder in schrenks mind bracken was turning his head but not to look at me thats hard to say hed applied for the post of agentinplace a few months ago so it seems that he was then involving himself with the dissidents i would think that his experiences in lubyanka not only left him outraged but determined on taking revenge and finally the jewish dissident cause provided him with the necessary rationale bracken and i both had our heads turned to listen and now croder heard it too someone was coming along the passage outside and we waited our eyes on the door it would of course be zoya it had to be zoya because if it were anyone else we were wiped out its always like this in a safehouse youll stop with half the toothpaste on the brush or your shoelace half tied while you listen facing the door but tonight our nerves were strung tight because we were the three major components of a mission cooped up together in one small room and we wouldnt stand a chance in hell if we got raided knocking on the door i sensed bracken jerk his head a degree but he didnt speak it was croder who spoke his cold voice perfectly steady who is it zoya come in she opened the door and i heard bracken let out his breath i suppose he was closer to this thing than i was hed been in signals with london and london would be panicking hed also had croder on his back and the knowledge that unless we could do something the life of the soviet chief of state could be running out there are two men zoya said did they give the parole midnight red please have them come up they are english she said croder nodded and she went out we have six people croder told me to support you in the field i have asked two of them to come here for briefing they are shortlidge and logan do you know them no not by those names logan was an aip in bangkok bracken said liaising with the embassy when you yes got him have any of them worked in the field no combat trained three of them have been through norfolk bracken said theyre contact and liaison outside of their post duties they can tag oh yes fair enough i guaranteed you full support croder said i appreciate it the bastard meant that he hadnt sold me short despite the fact that id let him down by neglecting to kill schrenk or perhaps he didnt mean that perhaps i was being paranoic because of the size of this thing we had to handle and because of the time factor we had no idea of the deadline and schrenk could be going in at any minute including now then they came in shortlidge and logan both typically nondescript men with quiet voices and pokerface reactions to what croder told them all he missed out was the bit about the chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet he used the word coup every time the situation then is that we have no idea when the coup is planned to take place and we have no idea where what we have to do is to find our way in and our target for surveillance is of course this man ignatov he looked at bracken how many are watching for him two the other two are watching the pavilion building they never left there i assume no sir shortlidge you can join them and make enquiries after a woman named misha i said and described her then croder went through the whole of the briefing again and we repeated paroles countersigns and contact modes until wed got it right we were to dispense with signals through the embassy he gave me an ultravox walkietalkie told me that bracken and the six members of the cell would keep in contact by that medium alone using speech code only and using the air with extreme discretion on street mobility logan told me weve got most of the blood off the inside of your pobeda and shes tanked up we didnt have time to find new plates so weve altered the old ones and rubbed some mud on dont forget to lose your papers bracken told us hed be based here at the safehouse since he wouldnt be able to enter or leave the embassy without surveillance croder and i would wait here with him until we got a signal from the field what was the street like i asked logan looked clean enough three cars this side of the intersection all facing towards it truck outside the warehouse opposite with a lot of snow on it nobody moving the militia work east and west across the intersection and their nearest phone is a hundred yards west of there it was one am when he and shortlidge left us by that time i felt ready to eat solids and zoya brought me some goats milk cheese and black bread is there some pain she asked me yes that is good and a happy birthday to you too i said and she laughed because it was becoming our favourite joke the left shoulder was throbbing to the rhythm of the pulse but it was only muscle and tissue pain ignatov hadnt hit bone if i dont see you again i told zoya you did a great job and i want to thank you of course youll see me again she said and left us bracken was getting increasingly nervy and couldnt keep still i did some walking about myself and tried out the arm for movement as far as the sling allowed the shoulder flared up but the pain was confined to that area the nerves and muscles through the tower arm to the fingers were unaffected and id be able to drive a car with the sling off croder stood still for most of the time keeping clear of the window and taking a few short steps occasionally and coming to a stop with his feet together and standing still again his thin neck buried in the collar of the military coat his dark eyes impassive sometimes we heard sounds from inside the house and turned our faces to tie door the stove began losing its heat after a while but we didnt put any more wood on i went over the street scene as logan had given it three cars parked this side of the intersection a truck in the other direction so forth i went over the briefing pattern contact modes signals the whole thing i was getting thirsty because of the anaesthetic and the saltiness of the cheese and kept going to the tap over the basin and coming away with the taste of chlorine in my mouth we didnt talk much though bracken began voicing his nerves after a while i dont see how he can expect to do anything on that scale and get clear i dont imagine for a moment croder said thinly that he can get clear what concerns me is that he might reveal his identity if he is discovered to be a london agent i hesitate to consider he stopped and in a moment said so quietly that we barely heard him but weve already gone into that i thought about schrenk he wont want to live once hes gone in croder turned his head you dont think so he was quite an athlete before tennis champ goodlooking lots of girls now hes a wreck this is a suicide run in a moment croder said bleakly so we have that aspect to contend with too i didnt say anything there wasnt anything we could do about it a potential assassin who means to get clear after the act will take a lot of care and might finally baulk at the risks but a kamikaze will go right in for the kill with nothing to lose we grew quiet again and every five minutes croder took his few short steps and halted again his deaths head staring at the wall bracken lit a cigarette and then began chain smoking just before three oclock we got a signal zil driving was more difficult than id thought the left arm worked all right with the sling off but i was still feeling the loss of blood and i got into three frontend skids over the snow before i reached the rendezvous because of partial blackouts within ten minutes of leaving the safehouse i passed seven militia patrol cars one of which made a uturn and followed me for five blocks before it peeled off presumably in answer to a radio call the whole environment was strictly a red sector because the number plates of the pobeda werent legible and traffic was so thin at this time of night that i was liable to get pulled up by the police just to relieve their boredom the operation could blow at any given minute and croder knew that but all he could do now was run the whole thing into the ground if he had to because of the time factor we didnt know when schrenk was going in the signal had specified a warehouse in losinoostrovskaja ulica alongside the main rail line between belokamennaja and cerkizovo stations and i reached there at and slid the pobeda across the ruts into the shadow of the building and cut the engine and wound the window down and waited checking for sound and movement it wasnt likely to be a trap but if schrenk picked up my trail hed come for me himself instead of leaving it to ignatov i knew that there was a train rolling somewhere north and west of the warehouse and its sound made a blanket for aural cues in the immediate vicinity and that was dangerous i would have preferred to leave the car and get into more flexible cover but the contact had to show himself first and it was a safe principle so i stayed where i was listening to the train and trying to pick up closer sounds something was changing in the visual pattern on the other side of the car and i watched it a door along the wall of the warehouse was coming open someone was standing there but i did nothing until a torch was flashed on and off three times one long and two short then i got out of the car and walked across the snow with a trickle running through the spine because a night rdv is always risky a signal can be intercepted and you can find yourself walking straight into an ambush midnight red i countersigned and he flashed the light briefly over my face and then his own and i recognized shortlidge he led me into the warehouse and shut the door then switched on the torch and swung the beam across piles of broken crates and sacking and loose timber until it focused on the black zil limousine ok yes i said fill me in ci was watching area i and saw ignatovs car come up two men got out and went into the apartment block one of them could have been ignatov but id only got your verbal description one of them came out in about half an hour not ignatov too young and too thin a dark chap we how was he walking walking quite normally he wasnt crippled hobbling no all right go on two of us tagged him here and he stayed fifteen minutes and then left logans still on the tag and were reporting by radio i was told to stay here and show you this lot i gazed across at the brilliantlypolished zil did you see what he was doing in here no he locked the door after him how did you get in afterwards picked the lock its a tumbler did he bring anything with him nothing too big for his pockets take anything away not that i saw he wasnt carrying anything he was moving his feet up and down his hands stuffed into his pockets there was no heating on in this place and a freezing draught was blowing across the floor the building was old and looked abandoned above our heads there was a gap of light where the roof had started caving in under the weight of the snow and the whole place creaked various smells were distinguishable rotting timber damp sacking sour grain petrol and rubber i went on staring at the big black limousine not comfortable with it all right i told shortlidge i want you to keep watch outside ill be here about an hour wheres your car round the back can i use this torch help yourself theres one in the pobeda glove pocket if you want one listen if you cant see the door to this place from your car sit in mine i want you to warn me if anyone comes but keep out of the action if anything starts understood he considered this moving his feet up and down what about if youre up against it ill look after myself your job is to get a signal back croders instructions ok he left me i stood listening to the creaking of the building feeling the cold draught numbing my ankles as i stared at the big black zil it was probably going to be all right but even schrenk was human and could make a mistake and it was a minute before i was ready to go across to the thing and start work long wheelbase four doors central committee moii number plates immaculate bodywork and chrome i shone the torch through one of the windows brushed vinyl club seats thick blue carpeting two telephones builtin tape deck air conditioning vents and controls cocktail cabinet woodgrain panelling dark blue nylon curtains at the rear windows a thick glass division between the front and rear seats separating the passengers from the chauffeur and escort i began underneath fetching some sacking from a pile near the wall and spreading it on the dirt floor and sliding inwards on the flat of my back with the torch in my right hand the general layout was massive but clean with crossbraced box section chassis members and two enormous exhaust silencers running half the length of the car i checked ledges niches and junctions inching my left hand along the topside of every component the sweet beginning because the organism was confined and wouldnt be able to help itself if anything went wrong wouldnt even know about it except for a microsecond of cataclysm careful old boy dont touch the wrong thing amusement in his tone as he watched me his eyes narrowed against the smoke of the cigarette bugger off i went over the rear axle casing propeller shaft tunnel flywheel housing crankcase flanges and trays while the building creaked and the draught chilled my bones and the bastard began laughing softly with that awful laugh of his that turned to coughing because of the cigarette smoke youre taking a chance old boy i suppose you know that yes i knew that he was human and he might have lost some of his cunning when theyd halfkilled him in that bloody place and i couldnt be sure that my hand wouldnt at some time touch a badly assembled trip mechanism or set off a toosensitive rocking device or break a circuit when i opened a door and triggered the interior lamps taking a chance yes and i couldnt get his voice out of my head i stopped after ten minutes and lay listening with the torch switched off and the stink of oil in the air the draught shifting and fretting and freezing the skin four vehicles had gone past the warehouse and each time id switched off the torch because this building wasnt lightproof five minutes ago a train had rolled slowly alongside its vibration setting up a buzzing in one of the zils headlamps youre pushing your luck old boy you shuddup i wiped my hands on the sacking and got out from underneath and opened the drivers door doing it quickly because there was a russian roulette factor in play schrenk was working in foreign terrain and he couldnt be a hundred per cent certain of his components or materials however competently he assembled them in twenty minutes i was finished with the interior lifting out the seat cushions and the carpets checking the cocktail cabinet telephones tape deck air conditioning vents and the tipup seats most of this time was spent in checking the recess behind the facia panel in the forward compartment working with extra care among the wiring terminals and fuse boxes theres only one thing those bastardsll listen to a bomb he was so good at them id watched him rigging a bang more than once sitting over the bloody thing and crooning like a witch his thin nicotinestained fingers stroking and fondling and fiddling the pliers paring the insulation and making the loop in the copper cable his fingertip spinning the brass terminal free as if he were playing with a toy his pale eyes bright and his mouth touched with a faint gioconda smile anyone would think id said to him once it was a baby rabbit hed looked up quickly thats all they are old boy baby rabbits a soft chuckle until they go up of course then theyre tigers i pulled the bonnet lock and went through the engine compartment taking nearly half an hour because of all the subsidiary tanks reservoirs chambers and small boxed components a lot of them were labelled but i had to identify the rest by following the cables pipes and linkages to find out which system they served then i shut the bonnet and opened the boot and checked the spare wheel the first aid box and emergency tool kit the torch battery was running low by this time but id almost finished now didnt find anything old boy it could of course be packed inside the upholstery or the roof fining or the door panelling anywhere like that but a major search with tools would take time and at this stage id prefer to report to croder and get his instructions until we knew the overall picture we didnt necessarily want schrenk to know wed found the zil and we didnt necessarily want to immobilize it he could have alternative procedures planned i started on a final check before the torch was too dim covering the areas behind the radiator grille inside the wings and under the bodywork valances another freight train was rolling through but the warehouse was a soundbox and when the door creaked i froze and waited concealed by the zil light flashed from a torch you there yes someone coming i went over to the door keep inside and stay hidden i told shortlidge he moved for the pile of crates and i shut the door and got behind it and waited the train was still rumbling but i could hear footsteps over the brittle snow outside and then a key in the door it was turned sharply three times he was surprised to find it was already unlocked id have liked to have a final word with shortlidge because i didnt know whether hed follow my orders and stay out of the action or decide to get mixed up in it and risk two deaths and no signal to base but he was a fully trained aip with a curtaincountry post and i stopped worrying and watched the door it opened cautiously and a man came in and snapped a light on and i used the right hand and searched him for weapons while he was still out and then got some snow and packed his face with it till he came to then i began asking questions the rdv was for the road bridge over the jauza where stromynka ulica crosses it from east to west and croder was waiting for me when i got there bracken and another man with him a black mercedes parked in the cover of shadow this is fenshaw good evening they made room for me in the car and fenshaw stayed behind the wheel looking edgy the was facing south but there was enough room to make a onepoint turn and get out north if we had to the river flowed past us under the street lamps i could see the glint of broken ice drifting on the radio id asked bracken why we had to meet in the open and he said croder wanted to keep within shortdistance radio range of three points the safehouse the warehouse and area where they were watching for schrenk at the pavilion apartment block where is ignatov croder asked me now shortlidge took him to his base blindfolded did you contact logan yes he and marshal are guarding the zil all right i had to make a lot of effort to sort out what i had for him because sleep was trying to black me out theyre setting up a high explosive action timed for six oclock tonight inside the walls of the kremlin i checked the zil as far as i could without dismantling anything and when i left there it was clean superficially this could tie in with what ignatov told me that the explosive hadnt arrived yet do you think he was lying no id had to work on ignatovs nervous system again but i dont think that would have been enough without additional persuasion so id reminded him what his wife and children would feel like when they heard hed been found dead is he to drive the zil no a man named morosov also a central committee chauffeur i dont think schrenk would trust ignatov with the end phase hes not a professional schrenk plans to radiodetonate the charge himself two minutes after brezhnev goes aboard the zil at the steps of the grand palace where the presidium will meet the car is to be handed over to brezhnevs personal chauffeur ten minutes beforehand ostensibly following a maintenancecheck road test the chauffeurs not in the act and is down for sacrifice i was trying to get the whole report into order but there were memory gaps and i was aware of them and knew theyd have to be bridged this man morosov croder said whats his motivation hes a dissident they all are except ignatov i think schrenk is blackmailing him into cooperating judging by his subservience blackmailing him hes a trusted functionary hed only have to steal a tankfill of petrol for his own car to get ten years in the camps id say schrenk caught him out in something the rest of them are dissidents you think yes the borodinski trials created a lot of anger and theyre coming out into the open now i shut my eyes and tried to remember other things but the dark came riding over me and i jerked my head up take your time i heard croders voice bracken opened a door to let the cold night air come in i could hear the river now and the discordant ringing of the ice floes as they touched together on the surface theres a fourcar motorcade when brezhnev travels he always goes in one of four zils with two motorized units of the guards directorate leading and following my mind switched have you got any closer to schrenk a little we have a contact i sat up straighter oh really we can now stop the zil operation croder said carefully but the hanger is that the moment schrenk knows we can do that he might switch to an alternative plan we must therefore conceal the fact that were on to the zil for as long as we can not easy from the moment he starts missing ignatov precisely our main target then remains schrenk himself bracken asked if we find him is quiller to go in croder let a couple of seconds go by i dont think he was hesitating i think he was deciding how to phrase it no i shall expect him to help us locate and subdue schrenk but i shall not expect him to do anything more than that schrenk he said with a note of warning must be considered strictly expendable i trust that is understood the smell of the river came through the open door the smell of dead fish and diesel oil and rotting wood drive him as far as the river schrenk had said in front of me as if i hadnt been there as if i were already dead you dont have to use any weights in the river all you have to do is to make sure hes found a long way from here do you have anything more for us croder asked me my head jerked up what no yes theres a reception at the american embassy this was bloody important and id nearly missed it out and three other central committee people are going there with brezhnev from the kremlin by separate motorcade kosygin andropov and kirilenko whats his idea bracken asked if he doesnt hit brezhnev hell at least hit one of the others croder turned to me what type of explosive were they going to use composition c plastic in sheet form four rectangular slabs to fit under the cushions of the zil and twentyfive kilograms of steel ball bearings distributed between the plastic and the cushions my god bracken said quietly this is schrenk all right yes bloody great military grenade if the four of them came down the steps to their cars together after the meeting he could hit the whole lot i shut my eyes again and let my head sink down id told them all id got out of ignatov i wanted to sleep and let croder and the rest of them take over did you ask him if there was an alternative plan ready to go bracken wanted to know yes he said he didnt know of any was that the truth croder asked i think so listen you tried to blow my head off out there in that car park you think that doesnt mean anything to me you start lying and by god im going to leave you here for dead im not lying i want to see my children again the broken sheets of ice touched together on the rivers surface bringing the sound of muted bells i think he was telling the truth i told croder but that doesnt mean schrenk hasnt got an alternative operation planned precisely is there anything more you have to tell us i took my time to think in case i missed anything no very well he nodded to bracken and they both got out of the car take him to base he told fenshaw and ask the woman to look after him then i want you to come back here and pick us up periods of waking and sleeping the smell of wood smoke and antiseptic and the rough woven blanket at one time the sound of metal on metal and i was halfway out of the bed before i was fully awake something crashing on to the floor it is all right she came over at once and held my arms with her strong fingers looking into my face i was just putting some more wood on the stove oh good of you the room was cold how do you feel she picked up the beaker of water id knocked over i was dreaming thats all the big black zil going up bursting like a chrysanthemum you should be in hospital zoya said leaning over me i am worried about infection you worry i said while i sleep at some other time i saw the cold grey light of the new day defrosting the grime of the window and had a run of coherent thoughts for the first time since fenshaw had brought me back here it was possible that everything would be all right provided we could find schrenk croder could stop the zil operation at any time he chose logan and marshal were guarding it at the warehouse and could smash the distributor or pour dirt in the carburettor whenever they got the instructions ignatov was also under guard if schrenk hadnt got an alternative lined up there was a chance that everything was going to be all right dreams again with the soft discordant chimes of the ice on the nightrunning river the soft wet phutt of the silenced gun blood on the snow thenlater i woke to find bracken leaning over me speaking softly and with the fear of god in his voice theyve shot logan and marshal he said and taken the zil scarecrow the winter night had come down half an hour ago and the sky was now starless snow had started falling again before noon and was now beginning to settle as the evening temperature dropped below zero ccharlie heading west on sticharevskaja ring road i checked the time again ccharlie was croder there were seven of us out four of the original cell with croder bracken and myself making up the number logan and marshal had died instantly in the shooting and an ambulance had picked up their bodies after an anonymous telephone call from bracken that had been at this morning nearly twelve hours ago since that time croder had kept the whole cell working to locate schrenk and had failed nothing had been seen of the zil i picked up the set aable going east on krasnocholmskaja now crossing river bridge the snow came out of a black sky hazing across the taller buildings and covering the roofs of vehicles until they began blending with the background traffic was easing as the rush hour neared its end a few trucks were using chains again and sand crews had just appeared at the major intersections croder had said if we havent found either schrenk or the zil by five oclock this evening we shall begin patrolling the outer ring road in the hope of sighting the zil on its way to the kremlin his face had been pale and his head sunk i into the collar of his overcoat we shall maintain constant i radio contact and aable will be prepared to go into action if we sight the zil what action he may take will depend on the circumstances and his own discretion but whatever happens we have to realize that the zil may explode without warning at any time it may be triggered with a timing device or schrenk nay choose to detonate the charge by radio beam sacrificing the driver we dont know this is a lastditch stand and i expect every conceivable effort to be made to avert disaster ive already pointed out to you that the disaster we have to avert does not simply concern the explosion of a motorcar in a crowded city but concerns the explosion of a totally unpredictable situation on an international scale thank you gentlemen that is all id asked bracken if they were going to reconsider the idea of warning the guards directorate by an anonymous phone call a few minutes before the four leading members of the politburo got into their motorcades hed just said god knows thats up to london not us we knew that croder was in signals with london hourly through a timed system of public phone box calls to the embassy we also knew that croder was personally against the risk of exposing a plan to assassinate the soviet chief of state by warning his security forces in time without making every conceivable effort to block schrenk on his run in and get control of the zil there is of course the other thing bracken had told me privately that zil might already be inside the kremlin if it is theres nothing we can do with the bridge behind me i watched the mirror for a few seconds longer than normal because a militia patrol was coming up fast and i started looking for an immediate right turn the volga stayed in the minor for ten seconds and then overtook and left me behind a minute later i caught up with it again at the kamensciki street junction slowing behind a mess of vehicles trying to make their way past some sort of accident by the metro station i saw a stovein radiator with rusty water blowing out of it and a moskvich draped halfway across the kerb sirens had started up from the opposite direction the surface was tricky in places now because the ruts were getting lost under the new snowfall and you couldnt use them to steer with i was keeping my speed down to a little below the limit and checking the mirror the whole time there shouldnt be any tags but if i missed sighting the zil ahead of me i might see it in the mirror and send out a fix on the radio we shall expect it to be crossing the ring road croder had told us at the briefing towards the kremlin but that doesnt mean it might not have to make a right turn on to the ring road itself and follow it for a time until it can turn left watch for that i hated croder and i pitied him i pitied him because hed run a reasonably effective mission up to the point where id failed to kill schrenk and in less than twenty minutes from now he looked like seeing the mission being blown out from under him through none of his own fault and i hated him because the fault was going to be mine and hed taken pains to let me know it all right then not hate guilt ggeorge im making west along samotocnaja just passing the circus building shortlidge he was keeping station a mile behind croder who would now be moving south and west somewhere near the planetarium calling ggeorge repeat signal radio reception was strengthening and fading as we circled the centre of the city the new steelbraced constructions affecting the signal wed been told to mention a landmark when we could as well as the streets name we knew them by now wed spent two hours with the maps shortlidge was repeating his voice sounded dead he was the one whod found logan and marshal hed known them for three years and had worked closely with logan on the yugoslavian spybust thing when half the foreign aips in moscow were being smoked out of their holes logan had a wife a young iceskater working her way up through the city championship teams and shortlidge was going to have to tell her what had happened i used the set again aable im going north leaving narodnaja with the kotelniceskaja hotel on my left where is ffreddie now no one came on the air for almost a minute then croder began asking for a signal we didnt get one calling ffreddie location please no answer croder went off the air ffreddie was wilson and either his set was out or hed skidded on the snow or the police had pulled him in for something at i saw a black limousine half a block ahead of me and the set was in my hand a couple of seconds later but i didnt signal yet it could be a chaika i pulled out and got past some of the traffic in front of me with the front wheels shifting across the ruts of packed snow and the rear end breaking away and correcting and breaking away again until i had to start slowing for the lights chaika finding a slot in the righthand line of traffic and pulling over it was a chaika not a zil bbertie proceeding south and west along bolshaja just past the gorkogo intersection the hotel peking on my right did we lose ffreddie i checked the time at aable to ccharlie this is the deadline croder came back straight away ccharlie we continue until further orders the lights in front of me went green and i got going again the deadline was because ignatov had said the zil was to be handed over to the chief of states personal chauffeur ten minutes before brezhnev was to board the car outside the grand palace and it was a fiveminute run from the ring road to the kremlin t this time of the evening the pickup time was six oclock so this was zero and the seven of us were circling the target area and the radio was silent and i was beginning to sweat because schrenk was a professional and has enough hate burning inside him to carry this thing through to the final blast and if he succeeded the headlines would carry the shock around the world because i had failed to carry out the instructions zero plus one and too late eedward going north on ckalova and just crossing karlmarx the snow drifted out of the dark sky eddying in the slipstream of the car ahead of me it was becoming mesmeric and i wound the window down and let the freezing air come in taking deep breaths of it id slept for nearly four hours after id got back from the warehouse but the blood loss was still a problem in less than a minute the left shoulder was numbed by the draught and i put the window up again but went on breathing consciously until the haze went out of my head if id been given this information i would have eliminated schrenk the minute i found him but the instructions were already there the snow swirled against the windscreen there was of course a chance that schrenk had made a mistake or the stuff hadnt arrived in time or the zil had come unstuck in the snow but he was highly talented and theyd crippled him and he knew what he wanted to do and it wasnt particularly difficult with that amount of feverish dedication driving him history was liberally punctuated with successful assassinations and he wasnt trying to do anything new this was why i looked to my left at every intersection sometimes seeing the glow of a golden dome through the snow haze that was where we would see the column of smoke going up a few minutes after six oclock the traffic was thinning now as the citys population flowed from the factories and offices to the apartment blocks in the suburbs ddonald ive got a zil ccharlie calling ddonald give your location im heading north and coming up to uljanovskaja the police let him through on the red light the zil is moving west on uljanovskaja now and going fast did you see the number plates no it was broadside on when it went past did it have any land of escort no it went through the lights on its own ccharlie calling aable where are you i hit the button aable im at obucha and the lights are red theres a leftturn arrow and im waiting for it now two seconds went by from your present location can you intercept the zil before it reaches the kremlin the map had been open on the passengers seat since wed started patrolling and i looked at it now it depends on what speed he makes i cant go across the lights as he can but ive got a chance of cutting him off at the solanka intersection the leftturn arrow went green and i gunned up and took the intersection in a controlled slide across the ruts and got the pobeda straight and settled down aable moving west towards the boulevard ring light traffic orders stay on the air and report progress ccharlie calling all other stations all other stations remain listening but do not signal unless emergency repeat do not signal unless emergency break pattern and head for aable with all speed i was coming up on two taxis and a truck and pulled over to pass but the ruts were deep and i lost the rear end as the steering dug in and the momentum set up a swinging action left to right left to right until i changed down and put a lot of power on and broke the rhythm one of the taxis using the horn because id swung too close croder dropped the call sign now from this point thered only be his voice and mine on the air what is your direct route to the kremlin due west by podkolokolnyj solanka and razina present location crossing the boulevard ring the trees stood on either side white with snow against the iron sky the lights were changing to amber and i kept my speed constant and crossed over and gunned up a little because theyd put sand down here the inner boulevard signal was at red and i switched my headlights full on and kept going and crossed the intersection and heard a whistle blow i am now on podkolokolnyj traffic police alerted because i crossed on the red but my rear plate is illegible acknowledged i hadnt intended to take the intersections on the red because the police would use their radios and id be initiating a collision course with the nearest mobile patrol but the zil would now be curving northeast across ustjinskij prospekt and heading for the major fork at solanka and it was the only chance of my cutting him off because if he got there first i wouldnt be able to catch him and there were no other oblique streets where i could gain on him by using angles location podkopajevskij on my right im pasting the junction now acknowledged he would want to say more than that but he left the air clear for my signals he would want to say that i should make every conceivable effort to reach the solanka fork before the zil because that was the only hope we had left he would want to say that there was a red lamp burning at the top left comer of the board for scorpion in london and that the lamp must go out when the mission had succeeded not because it had failed a taxi was pulling away from the kerb and doing it too wide and i touched the brakes and got nothing so i used the wheel and angled the front end out of the ruts and straightened again overcorrecting and hooking fix rear bumper of the taxi i watched it in the mirror sliding against the kerb and bouncing and craning to a stop with the front wheels locked hard over location passing ivanovskij on my right and approaching the fork at solanka acknowledged ccharlie to all other stations keep heading for aable at the solanka fork as fast as you can if necessary ignore traffic lights the nearest to me would be eedward last locating south of me on the ring road at uljanovskaja and he would have made an illegal uturn and come back to the intersection and turned right to follow the zil ddonald had been farther to the north and would have turned west and south and would reach the solanka fork soon after eedward bracken had last signalled from the other side of the ring road and would be coming east and rounding the walls of the kremlin but he had more distance to cover in five minutes from now the zil could be in the centre of three or four converging cars and it wouldnt be heading for the kremlin at this time unless it had the explosive on board and that could be dangerous composition c was relatively insensitive to impact but if the zil crashed it could falsetrigger the detonation device if i sighted the zil id need to make a signal location solanka fork approaching fast lights at red i could hear a siren somewhere id run the red at the boulevard intersection and hit the taxi soon afterwards and the policeman whod blown the whistle could have walkietalked the network to put a car on me or it could be ffreddie in trouble after his failure to acknowledge or it could be just an accident somewhere in the icy streets and nothing to do with us the lights were still at red and i took the solanka fork on the low side of fifty kph with the front end stable enough in the ruts to take me close along the nearside kerb with a chance of bringing the wheel over hard if i had to putting the pobeda into a frontwheel skid and breaking the ruts to slow the momentum if anything came through on the green from the main fork road to my left i wasnt risking a broadside collision because the fork road had the only right of way and the traffic would merge at fortyfive degrees but i flicked the headlights to full again and started watching the lefthand outside mirror crossing solanka lights at red the zil wasnt there we began hitting the crossruts and the front end lost its line and cocked over and wouldnt come back but the wheels had some resistance left and i waited and then hit the brakes as we ploughed into the loose sand alongside the kerb and the pobeda shook itself straight as the nearside rear wheel hit and bounced and got traction as i gunned up and settled down again with a number bus a hundred yards ahead of me and nothing this side of it but a taxi it was no go no sign of the zil im across the mirror zil correction ive got the zil now ive got the zil it was behind me crossing the fork on the green with its headlights full on and coming up fast croders voice came faintly through bad static but with a lot of control repeat please repeat signal i hit the button again ive got the zil behind me at fifty yards and closing up on me fast listen i want the others to hold off tell them to hold of we cant risk crashing the zil its a live bomb i switched to listen and heard him acknowledge and then start telling all stations to support the scene but keep clear of the zil he repeated and asked for acknowledgement and the others began coming in as the siren started up again from somewhere in the immediate area another one joining it the network had been alerted to something and the patrols were closing in the bus was moving slowly in the nearside lane and i checked the mirror and pulled out in the path of the limousine behind me in this city the zils and chaikas normally drive on full headlights for the police to let them through the intersections but this one began using the horns when it saw me pull out according to ignatov it would have the politburo chauffeur morosov at the wheel and he wasnt used to other vehicles getting in his way and tonight he was running two minutes late and his rendezvous was ultrapriority i began slowing there was still a clear lane on my offside and i waited for him to take it the zil was massive and could break through the ruts of snow and keep its steering stable enough to make a lot of speed through streets like these and if i let him go past me id lose him without any chance at all of catching him again this was strictly a onetime operation because he now had a straight run to the kremlin and the police would let him through every light through the snow haze ahead of me i could see the bright gold domes of st basils church at the south end of red square we were less than a mile from the kremlin now and time was running out the zil was shaping to overtake its dark mass filling the mirror its horns were still blaring and its headlights blinding and i had to use my left hand as a shield against the window glass while i kept on slowing and watched the shadow of my own car on the road ahead of me if the zil pulled to the left or right id see the angle change when it stopped hooting i could hear the sirens again their howl loudening as they neared the area i hit the tit ive still got the zil behind me and im blocking it were approaching razina ulica several sirens going theyve been getting nearer the zil began using its horns again and i saw the angle of the pobedas shadow change shifting to the left as the limousine started pulling out to the right lane in another attempt to get past i pulled out too blocking him again and bringing the speed down to less than forty kph we were past the bus now but there were two taxis and a truck ahead of us on the far side of razina ulica the major street that ran at right angles across our path at this point i was moving into a situation that looked strictly shutended if i kept on across razina the zil would turn left and head directly for the kremlin but if i turned left on to razina it would keep straighten and use the left turn at kujbyseva and reach the kremlin that way whichever i did the zil could peel off and get dear morosov was an experienced driver and would know every minor turning if i tried to cut him off the zil could go through every light and the instant its image was seen by the guards at spassky gate they would change the signals to green and let him through so i would have to stop him in the next thirty seconds and id have to do it without making him crash because there was enough explosive on board to wreck half the block location solanka and razina intersection im going to try stopping the zil its massive shape was right behind me with its horns strident and its lights dazzling as i made three rapid feints to the left right and left as we reached the intersection morosov reacted instantly swerving to the right left and right to overtake and as he swung to the right for the last time i gunned up and went for him nosing across his front end and forcing him to slow and then throttling into a rearwheel slide and coming back across him and feeling the pobeda tilt suddenly as the weight of the limousine made oblique contact the horns had stopped now because he was having to use both hands on the wheel and i heard the sirens again there was sand on the surface here but the snow had packed into ice underneath it and for a moment i lost the pobeda as it reacted to the impact and swung full circle and hit the kerb and came off again still swinging but i was still on the right side of the limousine and got enough traction back to nose across its path and this time morosov braked too hard and started sliding the black polished bodywork veering across my windscreen as it corrected and slid again with its huge momentum taking it in a series of swings that sent it glancing against the pobeda three times before it lost the surface and swung full circle its speed gone and its rear wheels spinning as morosov tried to find traction and failed the pobeda was down to crawling speed and i hit the door open and got out and began running pitching down once on the gritty ice before i got to the zil and wrenched at the drivers door the sirens were coming in and a dazzle of light flooded the street as the heavy door swung open and morosov brought a revolver into the aim and began firing too late and too high the explosions hammered against my eardrums as i used my right hand in a rising fork strike and got the gun clear and hooked him off balance on to the roadway he tried to get up and i chopped twice and dropped him and climbed into the zil the engine was still running and i slammed the door and found the throttle and teased the rear wheels into motion as a black patrol car came in from solanka with its siren going the zil was on the move but the surface was tricky and i had to keep tapping the throttle to use the power of the huge engine to take me in a series of swings before i could straighten up and give it the gun id rammed the radio into the pocket of my coat when id abandoned the pobeda but there wasnt time to use it as the limousine got up speed and i swung left at the first intersection and brought the power on and settled down the minor grew bright but id got a hundredyard lead and swung left again to work my way back to the ring road and away from the kremlin time check i began thinking about schrenk he couldnt be far away i tugged the radio out of my pocket and hit the button aable to ccharlie location approaching solanka fork road from south i am now on board the zil has anyone seen schrenk has anyone seen schrenk the lights were still in the mirror but there was no siren calling aable you have three of us in your immediate area anyone identifying schrenk report immediately i watched the mirror the car behind me wasnt trying to close up it was probably ddonald or eedward but it could be schrenk who is behind me who is behind me schrenk had planned to radiodetonate the charge and the only way he could do that was to join the zil on its way in to the kremlin and then peel off and circle the area and wait for the zil to come back through spassky gate but schrenk was a man to cover his risks and he would have done that ddonald calling im following the zil i acknowledged and turned right and headed for the boulevard ring sirens were loudening from the left and a flood of light came into the limousine as i crossed the intersection schrenk would have covered his risks and made sure the zil would blow even if something stopped him doing it by radio beam i knew that i knew him well the ruts of the snow were sending the big front wheels too far to the nearside and i brought them out and felt the rear end go and had to throttle up and break the ruts to get any bite from the treads my speed was a rising sixty kph and there were two vehicles ahead of me in the nearside lane a patrol car came in from the left and its lights filled the interior again its siren was wailing and i throttled up to clear it as the driver tried to cross my bows near the solanka fork road there was no time to think but id have to schrenk would have covered his risks and the only way to be quite sure the zil would blow would be to time the charge and he would have timed it for five or ten minutes after six oclock when the soviet chief of state would be on board time check the sweat broke out on me and i had the urge to slide the limousine into the kerb and get out and run for my life but i couldnt do that because i wasnt certain of the facts and if i abandoned the zil and it didnt blow it would remain an appalling danger on the open streets of the city i would have to blow it myself calling ddonald ddonald the zil could explode by timer at any minute keep your distance my scalp was shrinking and my palms were wet on the wheel id have to blow it myself and that meant crashing it and i was trying to remember where id passed the construction site on the way from the ring road ddonald acknowledging ccharlie calling all stations keep your distance from the zil id passed the big construction site not far from the boulevard ring after turning on to obucha ulica and heading west i made for there now the night was full of sirens wailing as other police patrols began focusing on the area i saw two cars going fast across the inner boulevard ring and a third in a controlled slide coming from the south and turning in my direction it was past me before the driver recognized the image of the zil behind my headlights and the note of the siren died away behind me two cars now in my mirror ddonald and a smaller moskvich possibly schrenk he would have been looking out for the zil and once hed seen it hed track it by cutting through some of the minor streets and my scalp contracted again because hed come out of lubyanka half crazed and if he realized id taken over this thing from morosov he might use his radio beam to detonate in a final access of rage i crossed the outer boulevard ring at dose on seventy kph and saw a group of cranes poking into the night sky over to the north i was going too fast for the intersection but the surface had sand on it and i brought the speed down and swung left at the next side road and straightened up with lights moving into the mirror again and the sirens loudening the patrols hadnt got an accurate fix on me yet but itd be a matter of minutes now before they found me and closed in red lights and i ran them and cut it close and had to lock over to avoid a patrol car storming through on the green but the front wheels of the limousine went into a skid and the offside wing clouted the patrol car and sent it spinning full circle across the intersection with its headlights sweeping the buildings and flashing once across my eyes before i got the zil straight and saw the construction site coming up through the haze of snow lights came into the mirror again and stayed there closing on me i tilted the glass to cut the dazzle who is behind me who is behind me it wasnt a police car the sirens were still some way off who is behind me the light continued to flood the interior of me zil all stations graders voice came who is following the zil there was no answer then it could only be schrenk he had picked up the zil near his planned rendezvous point and lost it and come up on it again and now he was sitting there either he was aware that id taken over the wheel or he was wondering why morosov had gone off course away from the kremlin i think if hed thought morosov was still at the wheel he would have started using his horns by now signalling the zil to stop he wasnt doing that he wasnt even flashing his lights aable calling i think schrenk is behind me now im at obucha going north from the outer boulevard ring and trying to reach the construction site im going to crash the zil in an attempt to detonate the charge keep your distance keep your distance the lights were still behind me calling ccharlie theres a car on the tail of the zil and it must be schrenk watch out for him i couldnt increase speed on this surface and the building site was too close now for me to use the side streets in the hope of shaking him off he was sitting there watching the big shape of the zil his gnomes head on one side and his thin body twisted against the seat his eyes narrowed in the backwash of the headlight what was in his mind old times sitting there watching me take the dream out of his hands the grandiose dream of making a statement in the name of the oppressed and in the name of the man theyd taken inside lubyanka and half destroyed this is what you have done to me now ill show you what i can do to you he was watching me now with one hand on the wheel and the other on the radio detonator old times old times what else could he be thinking there was nothing left for him to do now but turn his rage on me and nothing i could do to stop him time check if schrenk had timed the charge he wouldnt have left it later than because the american embassy was a tenminute run from the kremlin so this was zero and he didnt even have to squeeze his transmitter all he had to do was wait when the zil blew he would go too he was well within range and he knew that but this would be the way hed choose nothing i could do the black cranes grew against the snow haze and the headlights swept across the rubble this side of the excavation crater as i put the zil at the truck ramp and gunned up again with the wooden safety rail dead ahead i waited until the speed rose as the rear wheels got a grip on the rough terrain and then i hit the shift into neutral and pushed the door wide open and dropped and rolled and sensed the weight of the huge car sliding past me towards the crater as i went on rolling with a blaze ofpain burning in the left shoulder and the snow flying up before i hit rubble and crashed to a stop and got up and began running i heard the zil going through the rail and breaking it up as it reached the craters edge and tilted over and for an instant i swung round and saw its headlights filling the hollow as the dark figure of a man began moving across the wasteland from the car that had come in alongside perhaps he thought he could get to the zil and disarm it in time because hed worked hard on this and he didnt want to see it all come to nothing or perhaps like a small boy who couldnt keep away from fire hed come here to watch the tiger i dont know nor will i ever know he was still moving towards the crater at a hobbling run when the night broke into thunder and in the blinding shock of light i saw him silhouetted for a moment against the fiery curtain of snow his small shape flung upwards by the blast like a scarecrow in the wind i turned and threw myself down and felt the shuddering of the ground under me as the air roared past in a heated wave tearing at my coat and bringing a hail of debris whining through the night the steel shrapnel was now moving outwards from the crater crackling across the facade of the buildings opposite and smashing windows then headlights swung in from the street and a car neared me its wheels bouncing across the rubble i got on to my feet and a door came open and i heard bracken calling to me to get in the end
