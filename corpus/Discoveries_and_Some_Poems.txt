discoveries and some poems contents introduction by henry morley sylva timber or discoveries some poems to william camden on my first daughter on my first son to francis beaumont of life and death inviting a friend to supper epitaph on salathiel pavy epitaph on elizabeth l h epitaph on the countess of pembroke to the memory of my beloved master william shakespeare to celia the triumph of charis in the person of womankind ode praeludium epode an elegy introduction ben jonsons discoveries are as he says in the few latin words prefixed to them a wood sylva of things and thoughts in greek greek text which has for its first meaning material but is also applied peculiarly to kinds of wood and to a wood from the multiplicity and variety of the material contained in it for as we are commonly used to call the infinite mixed multitude of growing trees a wood so the ancients gave the name of sylvae timber trees to books of theirs in which small works of various and diverse matter were promiscuously brought together in this little book we have some of the best thoughts of one of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of english literature the songs added are a part of what ben jonson called his underwoods ben jonson was of a northcountry family from the annan district that produced thomas carlyle his father was ruined by religious persecution in the reign of mary became a preacher in elizabeths reign and died a month before the poets birth in ben jonson therefore was about nine years younger than shakespeare and he survived shakespeare about twentyone years dying in august next to shakespeare ben jonson was in his own different way the man of most mark in the story of the english drama his mother left poor married again her second husband was a bricklayer or small builder and they lived for a time near charing cross in hartshorn lane ben jonson was taught at the parish school of st martins till he was discovered by william camden the historian camden was then second master in westminster school he procured for young ben an admission into his school and there laid firm foundations for that scholarship which the poet extended afterwards by private study until his learning grew to be swornbrother to his wit ben jonson began the world poor he worked for a very short time in his stepfathers business he volunteered to the wars in the low countries he came home again and joined the players before the end of elizabeths reign he had written three or four plays in which he showed a young and ardent zeal for setting the world to rights together with that high sense of the poets calling which put lasting force into his work he poured contempt on those who frittered life away he urged on the poetasters and the mincing courtiers who set their hearts on topknots and affected movements of their lips and legs that these vain joys in which their wills consume such powers of wit and soul as are of force to raise their beings to eternity may be converted on works fitting men and for the practice of a forced look an antic gesture or a fustian phrase study the native frame of a true heart an inward comeliness of bounty knowledge and spirit that may conform them actually to gods high figures which they have in power ben jonsons genius was producing its best work in the earlier years of the reign of james i his volpone the silent woman and the alchemist first appeared side by side with some of the ripest works of shakespeare in the years from to in the latter part of jamess reign he produced masques for the court and turned with distaste from the public stage when charles i became king ben jonson was weakened in health by a paralytic stroke he returned to the stage for a short time through necessity but found his best friends in the best of the young poets of the day these looked up to him as their father and their guide their own best efforts seemed best to them when they had won ben jonsons praise they valued above all passing honours man could give the words my son in the old poets greeting which as they said sealed them of the tribe of ben h m sylva rerum et sententiarum quasi greek text

when a beggar suddenly grows rich he commonly becomes a prodigal for to obscure his former obscurity he puts on riot and excess consilia no man is so foolish but may give another good counsel sometimes and no man is so wise but may easily err if he will take no others counsel but his own but very few men are wise by their own counsel or learned by their own teaching for he that was only

man must be furnished with a universal store in himself to the knowledge of all nature that is the matter and seedplot there are the seats of all argument and invention but especially you must be cunning in the nature of man there is the variety of things which are as the elements and letters which his art and wisdom must rank and order to the present occasion for we see not all letters in single words nor all places in particular discourses that cause seldom happens wherein a man will use all arguments consiliarii adjunct probitas sapientia the two chief things that give a man reputation in counsel are the opinion of his honesty and the opinion of his wisdom the authority of those two will persuade when the same counsels uttered by other persons less qualified are of no efficacy or working vita recta wisdom without honesty is mere craft and cozenage and therefore the reputation of honesty must first be gotten which cannot be but by living well a good life is a main

ascribing all to their instruction as an ambassador to his master or a subject to his sovereign seasoning all with humanity and sweetness only expressing care and solicitude and not to counsel rashly or on the sudden but with advice and meditation dat nox consilium a for many foolish things fall from wise men if they speak in haste or be extemporal it therefore behoves the giver of counsel to be circumspect especially to beware of those with whom he is not thoroughly acquainted lest any spice of rashness folly or selflove appear which will be marked by new persons and men of experience in affairs modestia parrhesia and to the prince or his superior to behave himself modestly and with respect yet free from flattery or empire not with insolence or precept but as the prince were already

ipse labor a differentia inter doctos et sciolos wits made out their several expeditions then for the discovery of truth to find out great and profitable knowledges had their several instruments for the disquisition of arts now there are certain scioli or smatterers that are busy in the skirts and outsides of learning and have scarce anything of solid literature to commend them they may have some edging or trimming of a scholar a welt or so but it is no more impostorum fucus imposture is a specious thing yet never worse than when it feigns to be best and to none discovered sooner than the simplest for truth and goodness are plain and open but imposture is ever ashamed of the light icunculorum motio a puppetplay must be shadowed and seen in the dark for draw the curtain et sordet

frontless folly often goes beyond her bounds but impudence knows none non nova res livor envy is no new thing nor was it born only in our times the ages past have brought it forth and the coming ages will so long as there are men fit for it quorum odium virtute relicta placet it will never be wanting it is a barbarous envy to take from those mens virtues which because thou canst not arrive at thou impotently despairest to imitate is it a crime in me that i know that which others had not yet known but from me or that i am the author of many things which never would have come in thy thought but that i taught them it is new but a foolish way you have found out that whom you cannot equal or come near in doing you would destroy or ruin with evil speaking as if you had bound both your wits and natures prentices to slander and then came forth the best artificers when you could form the foulest calumnies nil gratius protervo lib indeed nothing is of more credit or request now than a petulant paper or scoffing verses and it is but convenient to the times and manners we live with to have then the worst writings and studies flourish when the best begin to be despised ill arts begin where

vile he is upbraidingly called a poet as if it were a contemptible nickname but the professors indeed have made the learning cheap railing and tinkling rhymers whose writings the vulgar more greedily read as being taken with the scurrility and petulancy of such wits he shall not have a reader now unless he jeer and lie it is the food of mens natures the diet of the times gallants cannot sleep else the writer must lie and the gentle reader rests happy to hear the worthiest works misinterpreted the clearest actions obscured the innocentest life traduced and in such a licence of lying a field so fruitful of slanders how can there be matter wanting to his laughter hence comes the epidemical infection for how can they escape the contagion of the writings whom the virulency of the calumnies hath not staved off from reading sed seculi morbus nothing doth more invite a greedy reader than an unlookedfor subject and what more unlookedfor than to see a person of an unblamed life made ridiculous or odious by the artifice of lying but it is the disease of the age and no wonder if the world growing old begin to be infirm old age itself is a disease it is long since the sick world began to dote and talk idly would she had but doted still but her dotage is now broke forth into a madness and become a mere frenzy alastoris malitia this alastor who hath left nothing unsearched or unassailed by his

interpreter and his chief negociation was to confer or practise with archy the principal fool of state about stealing hence windsor castle and carrying it away on his back if he can lingua sapientis potius quam loquentis a wise tongue should not be licentious and wandering but moved and as it were governed with certain reins from the heart and bottom of the breast and it was excellently said of that philosopher that there was a wall or parapet of teeth set in our mouth to restrain the petulancy of our words that the rashness of talking should not only be retarded by the guard and watch of our heart but be fenced in and defended by certain strengths placed in the mouth itself and within the lips but you shall see some so abound with words without any seasoning or taste of matter in so profound a security as while they are speaking for the most part they confess to speak they know not what of the two if either were to be wished i would rather have a plain downright wisdom than a foolish and affected eloquence for what is so furious and bedlam like as a vain sound of chosen and excellent words without any subject of sentence or science mixed optanda thersites homeri whom the disease of talking still once possesseth he can never hold his peace nay rather than he will not discourse he will hire men to hear him and so heard not hearkened unto he comes off most times like a

longthinking man before he speaks and epaminondas is celebrated by pindar to be a man that though he knew much yet he spoke but little demacatus when on the bench he was long silent and said nothing one asking him if it were folly in him or want of language he answered a fool could never hold his peace c for too much talking is ever the index of a fool dum tacet indoctus poterit cordatus haberi is morbos animi namque tacendo tegit a nor is that worthy speech of zeno the philosopher to be passed over with the note of ignorance who being invited to a feast in athens where a great princes ambassadors were entertained and was the only person that said nothing at the table one of them with courtesy asked him what shall we return from thee zeno to the prince our master if he asks us of thee nothing he replied more but that you found an old man in athens that knew to be silent amongst his cups it was near a miracle to see an old man silent since talking is the disease of age but amongst cups makes it fully a wonder argute dictum it was wittily said upon one that was taken for a great and grave man so long as he held his peace this man might have been a counsellor of state

cernuntur vitia quam virtutes there is almost no man but he sees clearlier and sharper the vices in a speaker than the virtues and there are many that with more ease will find fault with what is spoken foolishly than can give allowance to that wherein you are wise silently the treasure of a fool is always in his tongue said the witty comic poet c and it appears not in anything more than in that nation whereof one when he had got the inheritance of an unlucky old grange would needs sell it d and to draw buyers proclaimed the virtues of it nothing ever thrived on it saith he no owner of

of the vulgar is more drawn and held with newness than goodness we see it in fencers in players in poets in preachers in all where fame promiseth anything so it be new though never so naught and depraved they run to it and are taken which shews that the only decay or hurt of the best mens reputation with the people is their wits have outlived the peoples palates they have been too much or too long a feast claritas patriae greatness of name in the father ofttimes helps not forth but overwhelms the son they stand too near one another the shadow kills the growth so much that we see the grandchild come more and oftener to be heir of the first than doth the second he dies between the possession is the thirds eloquentia eloquence is a great and diverse thing nor did she yet ever favour any man so much as to become wholly his he is happy that can arrive to any degree of her grace yet there are who prove themselves masters of her and absolute lords but i believe they may mistake their evidence for it is one thing to be eloquent in the schools or in the hall another at the bar or in the pulpit there is a difference between mooting and pleading between fencing and fighting to make arguments in my study and confute them is easy where i answer myself not an adversary so i can see whole volumes dispatched by the umbratical doctors on all sides but draw these forth into the just lists let them appear sub dio and they are changed with the place like bodies bred in the shade they cannot suffer the sun or a shower nor bear the open air they scarce can find themselves that they were wont to domineer so among their auditors but indeed i would no more choose a rhetorician for reigning in a school than i would a pilot for rowing in a pond amor et odium love that is ignorant and hatred have almost the same ends many foolish lovers wish the same to their friends which their enemies would as to wish a friend banished that they might accompany him in exile or some great want that they might relieve him or a disease that they might sit by him they make a causeway to their country by injury as if it were not honester to do nothing than to seek a way to do good by a mischief injuria injuries do not extinguish courtesies they only suffer them not to appear fair for a man that doth me an injury after a courtesy takes not away that courtesy but defaces it as he that writes other verses upon my verses takes not away the first letters but hides them beneficia nothing is a courtesy unless it be meant us and that friendly and lovingly we owe no thanks to rivers that they carry our boats or winds that they be favouring and fill our sails or meats that they be nourishing for these are what they are necessarily horses carry us trees shade us but they know it not it is true some men may receive a courtesy and not know it but never any man received it from him that knew it not many men have been cured of diseases by accidents but they were not remedies i myself have known one helped of an ague by falling into a water another whipped out of a fever but no man would ever use these for medicines it is the mind and not the event that distinguisheth the courtesy from wrong my adversary may offend the judge with his pride and impertinences and i win my cause but he meant it not to me as a courtesy i scaped pirates by being shipwrecked was the wreck a benefit therefore no the doing of courtesies aright is the mixing of the respects for his own sake and for mine he that doeth them merely for his own sake is like one that feeds his cattle to sell them he hath his horse well dressed for smithfield valor rerum the price of many things is far above what they are bought and sold for life and health which are both inestimable we have of the physician as learning and knowledge the true tillage of the mind from our schoolmasters but the fees of the one or the salary of the other never answer the value of what we received but served to gratify their labours memoria memory of all the powers of the mind is the most delicate and frail it is the first of our faculties that age invades seneca the father the rhetorician confesseth of himself he had a miraculous one not only to receive but to hold i myself could in my youth have repeated all that ever i had made and so continued till i was past forty since it is much decayed in me yet i can repeat whole books that i have read and poems of some selected friends which i have liked to charge my memory with it was wont to be faithful to me but shaken with age now and sloth which weakens the strongest abilities it may perform somewhat but cannot promise much by exercise it is to be made better and serviceable whatsoever i pawned with it while i was young and a boy it offers me readily and without stops but what i trust to it now or have done of later years it lays up more negligently and oftentimes loses so that i receive mine own though frequently called for as if it were new and borrowed nor do i always find presently from it what i seek but while i am doing another thing that i laboured for will come and what i sought with trouble will offer itself when i am quiet now in some men i have found it as happy as nature who whatsoever they read or pen they can say without book presently as if they did then write in their mind and it is more a wonder in such as have a swift style for their memories are commonly slowest such as torture their writings and go into council for every word must needs fix somewhat and make it their own at last though but through their own vexation comit suffragia suffrages in parliament are numbered not weighed nor can it be otherwise in those public councils where nothing is so unequal as the equality for there how odd soever mens brains or wisdoms are their power is always even and the same stare a partibus some actions be they never so beautiful and generous are often obscured by base and vile misconstructions either out of envy or illnature that judgeth of others as of itself nay the times are so wholly grown to be either partial or malicious that if he be a friend all sits well about him his very vices shall be virtues

face god in his creatures not as the philosopher the creature of glory reads him but as the divine the servant of humility yet even he must take care not to be too curious for to utter truth of god but as he thinks only may be dangerous who is best known by our not knowing some things of him so much as he hath revealed or commanded it is not only lawful but necessary for us to know for therein our ignorance was the first cause of our wickedness veritas proprium hominis truth is mans proper good and the only immortal thing was given to our mortality to use no good christian or ethnic if he be honest can miss it no statesman or patriot should for without truth all the actions of mankind are craft malice or what you will rather than wisdom homer says he hates him worse than hellmouth that utters one thing with his tongue and keeps another in his breast which high expression was grounded on divine reason for a lying mouth is a stinking pit and murders with the contagion it venteth beside nothing is lasting that is feigned it will have another face than it had ere long as euripides saith no lie ever grows old nullum vitium sine patrocinio it is strange there should be no vice without its patronage that when we have no other excuse we will say we love it we cannot forsake it as if that made it not more a fault we cannot because we think we cannot and we love it because we will defend it we will rather excuse it than be rid of it that we cannot is pretended but that we will not is the true reason how many have i known that would not have their vices hid nay and to be noted live like antipodes to others in the same city never see the sun rise or set in so many years but be as they were watching a corpse by torchlight would not sin the common way but held that a kind of rusticity they would do it new or contrary for the infamy they were ambitious of living backward and at last arrived at that as they would love nothing but the vices not the vicious customs it was impossible to reform these natures they were dried and hardened in their ill they may say they desired to leave it but do not trust them and they may think they desire it but they may lie for all that they are a little angry with their follies now and then marry they come into grace with them again quickly they will confess they are offended with their manner of living like enough who is not when they can put me in security that they are more than offended that they hate it then i will hearken to them and perhaps believe them but many now adays love and hate their ill together de vere argutis i do hear them say often some men are not witty because they are not everywhere witty than which nothing is more foolish if an eye or a nose be an excellent part in the face therefore be all eye or nose i think the eyebrow the forehead the cheek chin lip or any part else are as necessary and natural in the place but now nothing is good that is natural right and natural language seems to have least of the wit in it that which is writhed and tortured is counted the more exquisite cloth of bodkin or tissue must be embroidered as if no face were fair that were not powdered or painted no beauty to be had but in wresting and writhing our own tongue nothing is fashionable till it be deformed and this is to write like a gentleman all must be affected and preposterous as our gallants clothes sweetbags and nightdressings in which you would think our men lay in like ladies it is so curious censura de poetis nothing in our age i have observed is more preposterous than the running judgments upon poetry and poets when we shall hear those things commended and cried up for the best writings which a man would scarce vouchsafe to wrap any wholesome drug in he would never light his tobacco with them and those men almost named for miracles who yet are so vile that if a man should go about to examine and correct them he must make all they have done but one blot their good is so entangled with their bad as forcibly one must draw on the others death with it a sponge dipped in ink will do all comitetur punica librum spongia a et paulo post non possunt multae liturae una litura potest cestius cicero heath taylor spenser yet their vices have not hurt them nay a great many they have profited for they have been loved for nothing else and this false opinion grows strong against the best men if once it take root with the ignorant cestius in his time was preferred to cicero so far as the ignorant durst they learned him without book and had him often in their mouths but a man cannot imagine that thing so foolish or rude but will find and enjoy an admirer at least a reader or spectator the puppets are seen now in despite of the players heaths epigrams and the scullers poems have their applause there are never wanting that dare prefer the worst preachers the worst pleaders the worst poets not that the better have left to write or speak better but that they that hear them judge worse non illi pejus dicunt sed hi corruptius judicant nay if it were put to the question of the waterrhymers works against spensers i doubt not but they would find more suffrages because the most favour common vices out of a prerogative the vulgar have to lose their judgments and like that which is naught poetry in this latter age hath proved but a mean mistress to such as have wholly addicted themselves to her or given their names up to her family they who have but saluted her on the by and now and then tendered their visits she hath done much for and advanced in the way of their own professions both the law and the gospel beyond all they could have hoped or done for themselves without her favour wherein she doth emulate the judicious but preposterous bounty of the times grandees who accumulate all they can upon the parasite or freshman in their friendship but think an old client or honest servant bound by his place to write and starve indeed the multitude commend writers as they do fencers or wrestlers who if they come in robustiously and put for it with a deal of violence are received for the braver fellows when many times their own rudeness is a cause of their disgrace and a slight touch of their adversary gives all that boisterous force the foil but in these things the unskilful are naturally deceived and judging wholly by the bulk think rude things greater than polished and scattered more numerous than composed nor think this only to be true in the sordid multitude but the neater sort of our gallants for all are the multitude only they differ in clothes not in judgment or understanding de shakspeare nostrat augustus in hat i remember the players have often mentioned it as an honour to shakspeare that in his writing whatsoever he penned he never blotted out a line my answer hath been would he had blotted a thousand which they thought a malevolent speech i had not told posterity this but for their ignorance who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most faulted and to justify mine own candour for i loved the man and do honour his memory on this side idolatry as much as any he was indeed honest and of an open and free nature had an excellent phantasy brave notions and gentle expressions wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped sufflaminandus erat a as augustus said of haterius his wit was in his own power would the rule of it had been so too many times he fell into those things could not escape laughter as when he said in the person of caesar one speaking to him caesar thou dost me wrong he replied caesar did never wrong but with just cause and such like which were ridiculous but he redeemed his vices with his virtues there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned ingeniorum discrimina not in the difference of wits i have observed there are many notes and it is a little maistry to know them to discern what every nature every disposition will bear for before we sow our land we should plough it there are no fewer forms of minds than of bodies amongst us the variety is incredible and therefore we must search some are fit to make divines some poets some lawyers some physicians some to be sent to the plough and trades there is no doctrine will do good where nature is wanting some wits are swelling and high others low and still some hot and fiery others cold and dull one must have a bridle the other a spur not there be some that are forward and bold and these will do every little thing easily i mean that is hard by and next them which they will utter unretarded without any shamefastness these never perform much but quickly they are what they are on the sudden they show presently like grain that scattered on the top of the ground shoots up but takes no root has a yellow blade but the ear empty they are wits of good promise at first but there is an ingenistitium a they stand still at sixteen they get no higher not you have others that labour only to ostentation and are ever more busy about the colours and surface of a work than in the matter and foundation for that is hid the other is seen not others that in composition are nothing but what is rough and broken quae per salebras altaque saxa cadunt b and if it would come gently they trouble it of purpose they would not have it run without rubs as if that style were more strong and manly that struck the ear with a kind of unevenness these men err not by chance but knowingly and willingly they are like men that affect a fashion by themselves have some singularity in a ruff cloak or hatband or their beards specially cut to provoke beholders and set a mark upon themselves they would be reprehended while they are looked on and this vice one that is authority with the rest loving delivers over to them to be imitated so that ofttimes the faults which be fell into the others seek for this is the danger when vice becomes a precedent not others there are that have no composition at all but a kind of tuning and rhyming fall in what they write it runs and slides and only makes a sound womens poets they are called as you have womens tailors they write a verse as smooth as soft as cream in which there is no torrent nor scarce stream you may sound these wits and find the depth of them with your middle finger they are creambowl or but puddledeep not some that turn over all books and are equally searching in all papers that write out of what they presently find or meet without choice by which means it happens that what they have discredited and impugned in one week they have before or after extolled the same in another such are all the essayists even their master montaigne these in all they write confess still what books they have read last and therein their own folly so much that they bring it to the stake raw and undigested not that the place did need it neither but that they thought themselves furnished and would vent it not some again who after they have got authority or which is less opinion by their writings to have read much dare presently to feign whole books and authors and lie safely for what never was will not easily be found not by the most curious not and some by a cunning protestation against all reading and false venditation of their own naturals think to divert the sagacity of their readers from themselves and cool the scent of their own foxlike thefts when yet they are so rank as a man may find whole pages together usurped from one author their necessities compelling them to read for present use which could not be in many books and so come forth more ridiculously and palpably guilty than those who because they cannot trace they yet would slander their industry not but the wretcheder are the obstinate contemners of all helps and arts such as presuming on their own naturals which perhaps are excellent dare deride all diligence and seem to mock at the terms when they understand not the things thinking that way to get off wittily with their ignorance these are imitated often by such as are their peers in negligence though they cannot be in nature and they utter all they can think with a kind of violence and indisposition unexamined without relation either to person place or any fitness else and the more wilful and stubborn they are in it the more learned they are esteemed of the multitude through their excellent vice of judgment who think those things the stronger that have no art as if to break were better than to open or to rend asunder gentler than to loose not it cannot but come to pass that these men who commonly seek to do more than enough may sometimes happen on something that is good and great but very seldom and when it comes it doth not recompense the rest of their ill for their jests and their sentences which they only and ambitiously seek for stick out and are more eminent because all is sordid and vile about them as lights are more discerned in a thick darkness than a faint shadow now because they speak all they can however unfitly they are thought to have the greater copy where the learned use ever election and a mean they look back to what they intended at first and make all an even and proportioned body the true artificer will not run away from nature as he were afraid of her or depart from life and the likeness of truth but speak to the capacity of his hearers and though his language differ from the vulgar somewhat it shall not fly from all humanity with the tamerlanes and tamer chains of the late age which had nothing in them but the scenical strutting and furious vociferation to warrant them to the ignorant gapers he knows it is his only art so to carry it as none but artificers perceive it in the meantime perhaps he is called barren dull lean a poor writer or by what contumelious word can come in their cheeks by these men who without labour judgment knowledge or almost sense are received or preferred before him he gratulates them and their fortune another age or juster men will acknowledge the virtues of his studies his wisdom in dividing his subtlety in arguing with what strength he doth inspire his readers with what sweetness he strokes them in inveighing what sharpness in jest what urbanity he uses how he doth reign in mens affections how invade and break in upon them and makes their minds like the thing he writes then in his elocution to behold what word is proper which hath ornaments which height what is beautifully translated where figures are fit which gentle which strong to show the composition manly and how he hath avoided faint obscure obscene sordid humble improper or effeminate phrase which is not only praised of the most but commended which is worse especially for that it is

wit when to favour it i have known a man vehement on both sides that knew no mean either to intermit his studies or call upon them again when he hath set himself to writing he would join night to day press upon himself without release not minding it till he fainted and when he left off resolve himself into all sports and looseness again that it was almost a despair to draw him to his book but once got to it he grew stronger and more earnest by the ease his whole powers were renewed he would work out of himself what he desired but with such excess as his study could not be ruled he knew not how to dispose his own abilities or husband them he was of that immoderate power against himself nor was he only a strong but an absolute speaker and writer but his subtlety did not show itself his judgment thought that a vice for the ambush hurts more that is hid he never forced his language nor went out of the highway of speaking but for some great necessity or apparent profit for he denied figures to be invented for ornament but for aid and still thought it an extreme madness to bind or wrest that which ought to be right stili eminentia virgil tully sallust it is no wonder mens eminence

claris oratoribus i have known many excellent men that would speak suddenly to the admiration of their hearers who upon study and premeditation have been forsaken by their own wits and no way answered their fame their eloquence was greater than their reading and the things they uttered better than those they knew their fortune deserved better of them than their care for men of present spirits and of greater wits than study do please more in the things they invent than in those they bring and i have heard some of them compelled to speak out of necessity that have so infinitely exceeded themselves as it was better both for them and their auditory that they were so surprised not prepared nor was it safe then to cross them for their adversary their anger made them more eloquent yet these men i could not but love and admire that they returned to their studies they left not diligence as many do when their rashness prospered for diligence is a great aid even to an indifferent wit when we are not contented with the examples of our own age but would know the face of the former indeed the more we confer with the more we profit by if the persons be chosen dominus verulamius one though he be excellent and the chief is not to be imitated alone for no imitator ever grew up to his author likeness is always on this side truth yet there happened in my time one noble speaker who was full of gravity in his speaking his language where he could spare or pass by a jest was nobly censorious no man ever spake more neatly more pressly more weightily or suffered less emptiness less idleness in what he uttered no member of his speech but consisted of his own graces his hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss he commanded where he spoke and had his judges angry and pleased at his devotion no man had their affections more in his power the fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an end scriptorum catalogus a cicero is said to be the only wit

eloquence grows backward so that he may be named and stand as the mark and greek text of our language de augmentis scientiarum julius caesar lord st alban i have ever observed it to have been the office of a wise patriot among the greatest affairs of the state to take care of the commonwealth of learning for schools they are the seminaries of state and nothing is worthier the study of a statesman than that part of the republic which we call the advancement of letters witness the care of julius caesar who in the heat of the civil war writ his books of analogy and dedicated them to tully this made the late lord st alban entitle his work novum organum which though by the most of superficial men who cannot get beyond the title of nominals it is not penetrated nor understood it really openeth all defects of learning whatsoever and is a book qui longum note scriptori proroget aevum a my conceit of his person was never increased toward him by his place or honours but i have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only proper to himself in that he seemed to me ever by his work one of the greatest men and most worthy of admiration that had been in many ages in his adversity i ever prayed that god would give him strength for greatness he could not want neither could i condole in a word or syllable for him as knowing no accident could do harm to virtue but rather

which was called a calamity prove the beginning and cause of a mans happiness and on the contrary that which happened or came to another with great gratulation and applause how it hath lifted him but a step higher to his ruin as if he stood before where he might fall safely vulgi mores morbus comitialis the vulgar are commonly ill natured and always grudging against their governors which makes that a prince has more business and trouble with them than ever hercules had with the bull or any other beast by how much they have more heads than will be reined with one bridle there was not that variety of beasts in the ark as is of beastly natures in the multitude especially when they come to that iniquity to censure their sovereigns actions then all the counsels are made good or bad by the events and it falleth out that the same facts receive from them the names now of diligence now of vanity now of majesty now of fury where they ought wholly to hang on his mouth as he to consist of himself and not others counsels princeps after god nothing is to be loved of man like the prince he violates nature that doth it not with his whole heart for when he hath put on the care of the public good and common safety i am a wretch and put off man if i do not reverence and honour him in whose charge all things divine and human are placed do but ask of nature why all living creatures are less delighted with meat and drink that sustains them than with venery that wastes them and she will tell thee the first respects but a private the other a common good propagation de eodem orpheus hymn he is the arbiter of life and death when he finds no other subject for his mercy he should spare himself all his punishments are rather to correct than to destroy why are prayers with orpheus said to be

accumulation to his majestys deserved praise that men might openly visit and pity those whom his greatest prisons had at any time received or his laws condemned de princ adjunctis sed vere prudens haud concipi possit princeps nisi simul et bonus lycurgus sylla lysander cyrus wise is rather the attribute of a prince than learned or good the learned man profits others rather than himself the good man rather himself than others but the prince commands others and doth himself the wise lycurgus gave no law but what himself kept sylla and lysander did not so the one living extremely dissolute himself enforced frugality by the laws the other permitted those licenses to others which himself abstained from but the princes prudence is his chief art and safety in his counsels and deliberations he foresees the future times in the equity of his judgment he hath remembrance of the past and knowledge of what is to be done or avoided for the present hence the persians gave out their cyrus to have been nursed by a bitch a creature to encounter it as of sagacity to seek out good showing that wisdom may accompany fortitude or it leaves to be and puts on the name of rashness de malign studentium there be some men are born only to suck out the poison of books habent venenum pro victu imo pro deliciis a and such are they that only relish the obscene and foul things in poets which makes the profession taxed but by whom men that watch for it and had they not had this hint are so unjust valuers of letters as they think no learning good but what brings in gain it shows they themselves would never have been of the professions they are but for the profits and fees but if another learning well used can instruct to good life inform manners no less persuade and lead men than they threaten and compel and have no reward is it therefore the worst study i could never think the study of wisdom confined only to the philosopher or of piety to the divine or of state to the politic but that he which can feign a commonwealth which is the poet can govern it with counsels strengthen it with laws correct it with judgments inform it with religion and morals is all these we do not require in him mere elocution or an excellent faculty in verse but the exact knowledge of all virtues and their contraries with ability to render the one loved the other hated by his proper embattling them the philosophers did insolently to challenge only to themselves that which the greatest generals and gravest counsellors never durst for such had rather do than promise the best things controvers scriptores more andabatarum qui clausis oculis pugnant some controverters in divinity are like swaggerers in a tavern that catch that which stands next them the candlestick or pots turn everything into a weapon ofttimes they fight blindfold and both beat the air the one milks a hegoat the other holds under a sieve their arguments are as fluxive as liquor spilt upon a table which with your finger you may drain as you will such controversies or disputations carried with more labour than profit are odious where most times the truth is lost in the midst or left untouched and the fruit of their fight is that they spit one upon another and are both defiled these fencers in religion i like not morbi the body hath certain diseases that are with less evil tolerated than removed as if to

intempestiva men that talk of their own benefits are not believed to talk of them because they have done them but to have done them because they might talk of them that which had been great if another had reported it of them vanisheth and is nothing if he that did it speak of it for men when they cannot destroy the deed will yet be glad to take advantage of the boasting and lessen it adulatio i have seen that poverty makes me do unfit things but honest men should not do them they should gain otherwise though a man be hungry he should not play the parasite that hour wherein i would repent me to be honest there were ways enough open for me to be rich but flattery is a fine picklock of tender ears especially of those whom fortune hath borne high upon their wings that submit their dignity and authority to it by a soothing of themselves for indeed men could never be taken in that abundance with the springes of others flattery if they began not there if they did but remember how much more profitable the bitterness of truth were than all the honey distilling from a whorish voice which is not praise but poison but now it is come to that extreme folly or rather madness with some that he that flatters them modestly or sparingly is thought to malign them if their friend consent not to their vices though he do not contradict them he is nevertheless an enemy when they do all things the worst way even then they look for praise nay they will hire fellows to flatter them with suits and suppers and to prostitute their judgments they have liveryfriends friends of the dish and of the spit that wait their turns as my lord has his feasts and guests de vita humana i have considered our whole life is like a play wherein every man forgetful of himself is in travail with expression of another nay we so insist in imitating others as we cannot when it is necessary return to ourselves like children that imitate the vices of stammerers so long till at last they become such and make the habit to another nature as it is never forgotten de piis et probis good men are the stars the planets of the ages wherein they live and illustrate the times god did never let them be wanting to the world as abel for an example of innocency enoch of purity noah of trust in gods mercies abraham of faith and so of the rest these sensual men thought mad because they would not be partakers or practisers of their madness but they placed high on the top of all virtue looked down on the stage of the world and contemned the play of fortune for though the most be players some must be spectators mores aulici i have discovered that a feigned familiarity in great ones is a note of certain usurpation on the less for great and popular men feign themselves to be servants to others to make those slaves to them so the fisher provides bait for the trout roach dace c that they may be food to him impiorum querela augusties varus tiberius the complaint of caligula was most wicked of the condition of his times when he said they were not famous for any public calamity as the reign of augustus was by the defeat of varus and the legions and that of tiberius by the falling of the theatre at fidenae whilst his oblivion was eminent through the prosperity of his affairs as that other voice of his was worthier a headsman than a head when he wished the people of rome had but one neck but he found when he fell they had many hands a tyrant how great and mighty soever he may seem to cowards and sluggards is but one creature one animal nobilium ingenia i have marked among the nobility some are so addicted to the service of the prince and commonwealth as they look not for spoil such are to be honoured and loved there are others which no obligation will fasten on and they are of two sorts the first are such as love their own ease or out of vice of nature or selfdirection avoid business and care yet these the prince may use with safety the other remove themselves upon craft and design as the architects say with a premeditated thought to their own rather than their princes profit such let the prince take heed of and not doubt to reckon in the list of his open enemies principum varia firmissima vero omnium basis jus haereditarium principis there is a great variation between him that is raised to the sovereignty by the favour of his peers and him that comes to it by the suffrage of the people the first holds with more difficulty because he hath to do with many that think themselves his equals and raised him for their own greatness and oppression of the rest the latter hath no upbraiders but was raised by them that sought to be defended from oppression whose end is both easier and the honester to satisfy beside while he hath the people to friend who are a multitude he hath the less fear of the nobility who are but few nor let the common proverb of he that builds on the people builds on the dirt discredit my opinion for that hath only place where an ambitious and private person for some popular end trusts in them against the public justice and magistrate there they will leave him but when a prince governs them so as they have still need of his administrations for that is his art he shall ever make and hold them faithful clementia machiavell a prince should exercise his cruelty not by himself but by his ministers so he may save himself and his dignity with his people by sacrificing those when he list saith the great doctor of state machiavell but i say he puts off man and goes into a beast that is cruel no virtue is a princes own or becomes him more than this clemency and no glory is greater than to be able to save with his power many punishments sometimes and in some cases as much discredit a prince as many funerals a physician the state of things is secured by clemency severity represseth a few but irritates more a the lopping of trees makes the boughs shoot out thicker and the taking away of some kind of enemies increaseth the number it is then most gracious in a prince to pardon when many about him would make him cruel to think then how much he can save when others tell him how much he can destroy not to consider what the impotence of others hath demolished but what his own greatness can sustain these are a princes virtues and they that give him other counsels are but the hangmans factors clementia tutela optima he that is cruel to halves saith the said st nicholas b loseth no less the opportunity of his cruelty than of his benefits for then to use his cruelty is too late and to use his favours will be interpreted fear and necessity and so he loseth the thanks still the counsel is cruelty but princes by hearkening to cruel counsels become in time obnoxious to the authors their flatterers and ministers and are brought to that that when they would they dare not change them they must go on and defend cruelty with cruelty they cannot alter the habit it is then grown necessary they must be as ill as those have made them and in the end they will grow more hateful to themselves than to their subjects whereas on the contrary the merciful prince is safe in love not in fear he needs no emissaries spies intelligencers to entrap true subjects he fears no libels no treasons his people speak what they think and talk openly what they do in secret they have nothing in their breasts that they need a cypher for he is guarded with his own benefits religio palladium homeri euripides the strength of empire is in religion what else is the palladium with homer that kept troy so long from sacking nothing more commends the sovereign to the subject than it for he that is religious must be merciful and just necessarily and they are two strong ties upon mankind justice the virtue that innocence rejoiceth in yet even that is not always so safe but it may love to stand in the sight of mercy for sometimes misfortune is made a crime and then innocence is succoured no less than virtue nay oftentimes virtue is made capital and through the condition of the times it may happen that that may be punished with our praise let no man therefore murmur at the actions of the prince who is placed so far above him if he offend he hath his discoverer god hath a height beyond him but where the prince is good euripides saith god is a guest in a human body tyranni sejanus there is nothing with some princes sacred above their majesty or profane but what violates their sceptres but a prince with such a council is like the god terminus of stone his own landmark or as it is in the fable a crowned lion it is dangerous offending such a one who being angry knows not how to forgive that cares not to do anything for maintaining or enlarging of empire kills not men or subjects but destroyeth whole countries armies mankind male and female guilty or not guilty holy or profane yea some that have not seen the light all is under the law of their spoil and licence but princes that neglect their proper office thus their fortune is oftentimes to draw a sejanus to be near about them who at last affect to get above them and put them in a worthy fear of rooting both them out and their family for no men hate an evil prince more than they that helped to make him such and none more boastingly weep his ruin than they that procured and practised it the same path leads to ruin which did to rule when men profess a licence in government a good king is a public servant illiteratus princeps a prince without letters is a pilot without eyes all his government is groping in sovereignty it is a most happy thing not to be compelled but so it is the most miserable not to be counselled and how can he be counselled that cannot see to read the best counsellors which are books for they neither flatter us nor hide from us he may hear you will say but how shall he always be sure to hear truth or be counselled the best things not the sweetest they say princes learn no art truly but the art of horsemanship the reason is the brave beast is no flatterer he will throw a prince as soon as his groom which is an argument that the good counsellors to princes are the best instruments of a good age for though the prince himself be of a most prompt inclination to all virtue yet the best pilots have needs of mariners besides sails anchor and other tackle character principis alexander magnus if men did know what shining fetters gilded miseries and painted happiness thrones and sceptres were there would not be so frequent strife about the getting or holding of them there would be more principalities than princes for a prince is the pastor of the people he ought to shear not to flay his sheep to take their fleeces not their the soul of the commonwealth and ought to cherish it as his own body alexander the great was wont to say he hated that gardener that plucked his herbs or flowers up by the roots a man may milk a beast till the blood come churn milk and it yieldeth butter but wring the nose and the blood followeth he is an ill prince that so pulls his subjects feathers as he would not have them grow again that makes his exchequer a receipt for the spoils of those he governs no let him keep his own not affect his subjects strive rather to be called just than powerful not like the roman tyrants affect the surnames that grow by human slaughters neither to seek war in peace nor peace in war but to observe faith given though to an enemy study piety toward the subject show care to defend him be slow to punish in divers cases but be a sharp and severe revenger of open crimes break no decrees or dissolve no orders to slacken the strength of laws choose neither magistrates civil or ecclesiastical by favour or price but with long disquisition and report of their worth by all suffrages sell no honours nor give them hastily but bestow them with counsel and for reward if he do acknowledge it though late and mend it for princes are easy to be deceived and what wisdom can escape where so many courtarts are studied but above all the prince is to remember that when the great day of account comes which neither magistrate nor prince can shun there will be required of him a reckoning for those whom he hath trusted as for himself which he must provide and if piety be wanting in the priests equity in the judges or the magistrates be found rated at a price what justice or religion is to be expected which are the only two attributes make kings akin to god and is the delphic sword both to kill sacrifices and to chastise offenders de gratiosis when a virtuous man is raised it brings

ears unskilful to hear lies or have those things said of me which i could truly prove of them they objected making of verses to me when i could object to most of them their not being able to read them but as worthy of scorn nay they would offer to urge mine own writings against me but by pieces which was an excellent way of malice as if any mans context might not seem dangerous and offensive if that which was knit to what went before were defrauded of his beginning or that things by themselves uttered might not seem subject to calumny which read entire would appear most free at last they upbraided my poverty i confess she is my domestic sober of diet simple of habit frugal painful a good counseller to me that keeps me from cruelty pride or other more delicate impertinences which are the nursechildren of riches but let them look over all the great and monstrous wickednesses they shall never find those in poor families they are the issue of the wealthy giants and the mighty hunters whereas no great work or worthy of praise or memory but came out of poor cradles it was the ancient poverty that founded commonweals built cities invented arts made wholesome laws armed men against vices rewarded them with their own virtues and preserved the honour and state of nations till they betrayed themselves to riches amor nummi money never made any man rich but his mind he that can order himself to the law of nature is not only without the sense but the fear of poverty o but to strike blind the people with our wealth and pomp is the thing what a wretchedness is this to thrust all our riches outward and be beggars within to contemplate nothing but the little vile and sordid things of the world not the great noble and precious we serve our avarice and not content with the good of the earth that is offered us we search and dig for the evil that is hidden god offered us those things and placed them at hand and near us that he knew were profitable for us but the hurtful he laid deep and hid yet do we seek only the things whereby we may perish and bring them forth when god and nature hath buried them we covet superfluous things when it were more honour for us if we would contemn necessary what need hath nature of silver dishes multitudes of waiters delicate pages perfumed napkins she requires meat only and hunger is not ambitious can we think no wealth enough but such a state for which a man may be brought into a premunire begged proscribed or poisoned o if a man could restrain the fury of his gullet and groin and think how many fires how many kitchens cooks pastures and ploughed lands what orchards stews ponds and parks coops and garners he could spare what velvets tissues embroideries laces he could lack and then how short and uncertain his life is he were in a better way to happiness than to live the emperor of these delights and be the dictator of fashions but we make ourselves slaves to our pleasures and we serve fame and ambition which is an equal slavery have not i seen the pomp of a whole kingdom and what a foreign king could bring hither also to make himself gazed and wondered at laid forth as it were to the show and vanish all away in a day and shall that which could not fill the expectation of few hours entertain and take up our whole lives when even it appeared as superfluous to the possessors as to me that was a spectator the bravery was shown it was not possessed while it boasted itself it perished it is vile and a poor thing to place our happiness on these desires say we wanted them all famine ends famine de mollibus et effoeminatis there is nothing valiant or solid to be hoped for from such as are always kempt and perfumed and every day smell of the tailor the exceedingly curious that are wholly in mending such an imperfection in the face in taking away the morphew in the neck or bleaching their hands at midnight gumming and bridling their beards or making the waist small binding it with hoops while the mind runs at waste too much pickedness is not manly not from those that will jest at their own outward imperfections but hide their ulcers within their pride lust envy illnature with all the art and authority they can these persons are in danger for whilst they think to justify their ignorance by impudence and their persons by clothes and outward ornaments they use but a commission to deceive themselves where if we will look with our understanding and not our senses we may behold virtue and beauty though covered with rags in their brightness and vice and deformity so much the fouler in having all the splendour of riches to gild them or the false light of honour and power to help them yet this is that wherewith the world is taken and runs mad to gaze on clothes and titles the birdlime of fools de stultitia what petty things they are we wonder at like children that esteem every trifle and prefer a fairing before their fathers what difference is between us and them but that we are dearer fools coxcombs at a higher rate they are pleased with cockleshells whistles hobbyhorses and such like we with statues marble pillars pictures gilded roofs where underneath is lath and lime perhaps loam yet we take pleasure in the lie and are glad we can cozen ourselves nor is it only in our walls and ceilings but all that we call happiness is mere painting and gilt and all for money what a thin membrane of honour that is and how hath all true reputation fallen since money began to have any yet the great herd the multitude that in all other things are divided in this alone conspire and agree to love money they wish for it they embrace it they adore it while yet it is possessed with greater stir and torment than it is gotten de sibi molestis some men what losses soever they have they make them greater and if they have none even all that is not gotten is a loss can there be creatures of more wretched condition than these that continually labour under their own misery and others envy a man should study other things not to covet not to fear not to repent him to make his base such as no tempest shall shake him to be secure of all opinion and pleasing to himself even for that wherein he displeaseth others for the worst opinion gotten for doing well should delight us wouldst not thou be just but for fame thou oughtest to be it with infamy he that would have his virtue published is not the servant of virtue but glory periculosa melancholia it is a dangerous thing when mens minds come to sojourn with their affections and their diseases eat into their strength that when too much desire and greediness of vice hath made the body unfit or unprofitable it is yet gladded with the sight and spectacle of it in others and for want of ability to be an actor is content to be a witness it enjoys the pleasure of sinning in beholding others sin as in dining drinking drabbing c nay when it cannot do all these it is offended with his own narrowness that excludes it from the universal delights of mankind and oftentimes dies of a melancholy that it cannot be vicious enough falsae species fugiendae i am glad when i see any man avoid the infamy of a vice but to shun the vice itself were better till he do that he is but like the pientice who being loth to be spied by his master coming forth of black lucys went in again to whom his master cried the more thou runnest that way to hide thyself the more thou art in the place so are those that keep a tavern all day that they may not be seen at night i have known lawyers divines yea great ones of this heresy decipimur specie there is a greater reverence had of things remote or strange to us than of much better if they be nearer and fall under our sense men and almost all sorts of creatures have their reputation by distance rivers the farther they run and more from their spring the broader they are and greater and where our original is known we are less the confident among strangers we trust fortune yet a man may live as renowned at home in his own country or a private village as in the whole world for it is virtue that gives glory that will endenizen a man everywhere it is only that can naturalise him a native if he be vicious deserves to be a stranger and cast out of the commonwealth as an alien dejectio aulic a dejected countenance and mean clothes beget often a contempt but it is with the shallowest creatures courtiers commonly look up even with them in a new suit you get above them straight nothing is more shortlived than pride it is but while their clothes last stay but while these are worn out you cannot wish the thing more wretched or dejected poesis et pictura plutarch poetry and picture are arts of a like nature and both are busy about imitation it was excellently said of plutarch poetry was a speaking picture and picture a mute poesy for they both invent feign and devise many things and accommodate all they invent to the use and service of nature yet of the two the pen is more noble than the pencil for that can speak to the understanding the other but to the sense they both behold pleasure and profit as their common object but should abstain from all base pleasures lest they should err from their end and while they seek to better mens minds destroy their manners they both are born artificers not made nature is more powerful in them than study de pictura whosoever loves not picture is injurious to truth and all the wisdom of poetry picture is the invention of heaven the most ancient and most akin to nature it is itself a silent work and always of one and the same habit yet it doth so enter and penetrate the inmost affection being done by an excellent artificer as sometimes it overcomes the power of speech and oratory there are divers graces in it so are there in the artificers one excels in care another in reason a third in easiness a fourth in nature and grace some have diligence and comeliness but they want majesty they can express a human form in all the graces sweetness and elegancy but they miss the authority they can hit nothing but smooth cheeks they cannot express roughness or gravity others aspire to truth so much as they are rather lovers of likeness than beauty zeuxis and parrhasius are said to be contemporaries the first found out the reason of lights and shadows in picture the other more subtlely examined the line de stylo pliny in picture light is required no less than shadow so in style height as well as humbleness but beware they be not too humble as pliny pronounced of reguluss writings you would think them written not on a child but by a child many out of their own obscene apprehensions refuse proper and fit words as occupy nature and the like so the curious industry in some of having all alike good hath come nearer a vice than a virtue de progres picturae picture took her feigning from poetry from geometry her rule compass lines proportion and the whole symmetry parrhasius was the first won reputation by adding symmetry to picture he added subtlety to the countenance elegancy to the hair lovelines to the face and by the public voice of all artificers deserved honour in the outer lines eupompus gave it splendour by numbers and other elegancies from the optics it drew reasons by which it considered how things placed at distance and afar off should appear less how above or beneath the head should deceive the eye c so from thence it took shadows recessor light and heightnings from moral philosophy it took the soul the expression of senses perturbations manners when they would paint an angry person a proud an inconstant an ambitious a brave a magnanimous a just a merciful a compassionate an humble a dejected a base and the like they made all heightnings bright all shadows dark all swellings from a plane all solids from breaking see where he complains of their painting chimaeras by the vulgar unaptly called grotesque saying that men who were born truly to study and emulate nature did nothing but make monsters against nature which horace so laughed at the art plastic was moulding in clay or potters earth anciently this is the parent of statuary sculpture graving and picture cutting in brass and marble all serve under her socrates taught parrhasius and clito two noble statuaries first to express manners by their looks in imagery polygnotus and aglaophon were ancienter after them zeuxis who was the lawgiver to all painters after parrhasius they were contemporaries and lived both about philips time the father of alexander the great there lived in this latter age six famous painters in italy who were excellent and emulous of the ancients raphael de urbino michael angelo buonarotti titian antony of correggio sebastian of venice julio romano and andrea sartorio parasiti ad mensam these are flatterers for their bread that praise all my oraculous lord does or says be it true or false invent tales that shall please make baits for his lordships ears and if they be not received in what they offer at they shift a point of the compass and turn their tale presently tack about deny what they confessed and confess what they denied fit their discourse to the persons and occasions what they snatch up and devour at one table utter at another and grow suspected of the master hated of the servants while they inquire and reprehend and compound and dilate business of the house they have nothing to do with they praise my lords wine and the sauce he likes observe the cook and bottleman while they stand in my lords favour speak for a pension for them but pound them to dust upon my lords least distaste or change of his palate how much better is it to be silent or at least to speak sparingly for it is not enough to speak good but timely things if a man be asked a question to answer but to repeat the question before he answer is well that he be sure to understand it to avoid absurdity for it is less dishonour to hear imperfectly than to speak imperfectly the ears are excused the understanding is not and in things unknown to a man not to give his opinion lest by the affectation of knowing too much he lose the credit he hath by speaking or knowing the wrong way what he utters nor seek to get his patrons favour by embarking himself in the factions of the family to inquire after domestic simulties their sports or affections they are an odious and vile kind of creatures that fly about the house all day and picking up the filth of the house like pies or swallows carry it to their nest the lords ears and oftentimes report the lies they have feigned for what they have seen and heard imo serviles these are called instruments of grace and power with great persons but they are indeed the organs of their impotency and marks of weakness for sufficient lords are able to make these discoveries themselves neither will an honourable person inquire who eats and drinks together what that man plays whom this man loves with whom such a one walks what discourse they hold who sleeps with whom they are base and servile natures that busy themselves about these disquisitions how often have i seen and worthily these censors of the family undertaken by some honest rustic and cudgelled thriftily these are commonly the offscouring and dregs of men that do these things or calumniate others yet i know not truly which is worse he that maligns all or that praises all there is as a vice in praising and as frequent as in detracting it pleased your lordship of late to ask my opinion touching the education of your sons and especially to the advancement of their studies to which though i returned somewhat for the present which rather manifested a will in me than gave any just resolution to the thing propounded i have upon better cogitation called those aids about me both of mind and memory which shall venture my thoughts clearer if not fuller to your lordships demand i confess my lord they will seem but petty and minute things i shall offer to you being writ for children and of them but studies have their infancy as well as creatures we see in men even the strongest compositions had their beginnings from milk and the cradle and the wisest tarried sometimes about apting their mouths to letters and syllables in their education therefore the care must be the greater had of their beginnings to know examine and weigh their natures which though they be proner in some children to some disciplines yet are they naturally prompt to taste all by degrees and with change for change is a kind of refreshing in studies and infuseth knowledge by way of recreation thence the school itself is called a play or game and all letters are so best taught to scholars they should not be affrighted or deterred in their entry but drawn on with exercise and emulation a youth should not be made to hate study before he know the causes to love it or taste the bitterness before the sweet but called on and allured entreated and praised yea when he deserves it not for which cause i wish them sent to the best school and a public which i think the best your lordship i fear hardly hears of that as willing to breed them in your eye and at home and doubting their manners may be corrupted abroad they are in more danger in your own family among ill servants allowing they be safe in their schoolmaster than amongst a thousand boys however immodest would we did not spoil our own children and overthrow their manners ourselves by too much indulgence to breed them at home is to breed them in a shade whereas in a school they have the light and heat of the sun they are used and accustomed to things and men when they come forth into the commonwealth they find nothing new or to seek they have made their friendships and aids some to last their age they hear what is commanded to others as well as themselves much approved much corrected all which they bring to their own store and use and learn as much as they hear eloquence would be but a poor thing if we should only converse with singulars speak but man and man together therefore i like no private breeding i would send them where their industry should be daily increased by praise and that kindled by emulation it is a good thing to inflame the mind and though ambition itself be a vice it is often the cause of great virtue give me that wit whom praise excites glory puts on or disgrace grieves he is to be nourished with ambition pricked forward with honour checked with reprehension and never to be suspected of sloth though he be given to play it is a sign of spirit and liveliness so there be a mean had of their sports and relaxations and from the rod or ferule i would have them free as from the menace of them for it is both deformed and servile de stylo et optimo scribendi genere for a man to write well there are required three necessaries to read the best authors observe the best speakers and much exercise of his own style in style to consider what ought to be written and after what manner he must first think and excogitate his matter then choose his words and examine the weight of either then take care in placing and ranking both matter and words that the composition be comely and to do this with diligence and often no matter how slow the style be at first so it be laboured and accurate seek the best and be not glad of the froward conceits or first words that offer themselves to us but judge of what we invent and order what we approve repeat often what we have formerly written which beside that it helps the consequence and makes the juncture better it quickens the heat of imagination that often cools in the time of setting down and gives it new strength as if it grew lustier by the going back as we see in the contention of leaping they jump farthest that fetch their race largest or as in throwing a dart or javelin we force back our arms to make our loose the stronger yet if we have a fair gale of wind i forbid not the steering out of our sail so the favour of the gale deceive us not for all that we invent doth please us in conception of birth else we would never set it down but the safest is to return to our judgment and handle over again those things the easiness of which might make them justly suspected so did the best writers in their beginnings they imposed upon themselves care and industry they did nothing rashly they obtained first to write well and then custom made it easy and a habit by little and little their matter showed itself to them more plentifully their words answered their composition followed and all as in a wellordered family presented itself in the place so that the sum of all is ready writing makes not good writing but good writing brings on ready writing yet when we think we have got the faculty it is even then good to resist it as to give a horse a check sometimes with a bit which doth not so much stop his course as stir his mettle again whether a mans genius is best able to reach thither it should more and more contend lift and dilate itself as men of low stature raise themselves on their toes and so ofttimes get even if not eminent besides as it is fit for grown and able writers to stand of themselves and work with their own strength to trust and endeavour by their own faculties so it is fit for the beginner and learner to study others and the best for the mind and memory are more sharply exercised in comprehending another mans things than our own and such as accustom themselves and are familiar with the best authors shall ever and anon find somewhat of them in themselves and in the expression of their minds even when they feel it not be able to utter something like theirs which hath an authority above their own nay sometimes it is the reward of a mans study the praise of quoting another man fitly and though a man be more prone and able for one kind of writing than another yet he must exercise all for as in an instrument so in style there must be a harmony and consent of parts praecipiendi modi i take this labour in teaching others that they should not be always to be taught and i would bring my precepts into practice for rules are ever of less force and value than experiments yet with this purpose rather to show the right way to those that come after than to detect any that have slipped before by error and i hope it will be more profitable for men do more willingly listen and with more favour to precept than reprehension among divers opinions of an art and most of them contrary in themselves it is hard to make election and therefore though a man cannot invent new things after so many he may do a welcome work yet to help posterity to judge rightly of the old but arts and precepts avail nothing except nature be beneficial and aiding and therefore these things are no more written to a dull disposition than rules of husbandry to a soil no precepts will profit a fool no more than beauty will the blind or music the deaf as we should take care that our style in writing be neither dry nor empty we should look again it be not winding or wanton with farfetched descriptions either is a vice but that is worse which proceeds out of want than that which riots out of plenty the remedy of fruitfulness is easy but no labour will help the contrary i will like and praise some things in a young writer which yet if he continue in i cannot but justly hate him for the same there is a time to be given all things for maturity and that even your country husbandman can teach who to a young plant will not put the pruningknife because it seems to fear the iron as not able to admit the scar no more would i tell a green writer all his faults lest i should make him grieve and faint and at last despair for nothing doth more hurt than to make him so afraid of all things as he can endeavour nothing therefore youth ought to be instructed betimes and in the best things for we hold those longest we take soonest as the first scent of a vessel lasts and the tint the wool first receives therefore a master should temper his own powers and descend to the others infirmity if you pour a glut of water upon a bottle it receives little of it but with a funnel and by degrees you shall fill many of them and spill little of your own to their capacity they will all receive and be full and as it is fit to read the best authors to youth first so let them be of the openest and clearest a as livy before sallust sidney before donne and beware of letting them taste gower or chaucer at first lest falling too much in love with antiquity and not apprehending the weight they grow rough and barren in language only when their judgments are firm and out of danger let them read both the old and the new but no less take heed that their new flowers and sweetness do not as much corrupt as the others dryness and squalor if they choose not carefully spenser in affecting the ancients writ no language yet i would have him read for his matter but as virgil read ennius the reading of homer and virgil is counselled by quintilian as the best way of informing youth and confirming man for besides that the mind is raised with the height and sublimity of such a verse it takes spirit from the greatness of the matter and is tinctured with the best things tragic and lyric poetry is good too and comic with the best if the manners of the reader be once in safety in the greek poets as also in plautus we shall see the economy and disposition of poems better observed than in terence and the latter who thought the sole grace and virtue of their fable the sticking in of sentences as ours do the forcing in of jests fals querel fugiend platonis peregrinatio in italiam we should not protect our sloth with the patronage of difficulty it is a false quarrel against nature that she helps understanding but in a few when the most part of mankind are inclined by her thither if they would take the pains no less than birds to fly horses to run c which if they lose it is through their own sluggishness and by that means become her prodigies not her children i confess nature in children is more patient of labour in study than in age for the sense of the pain the judgment of the labour is absent they do not measure what they have done and it is the thought and consideration that affects us more than the weariness itself plato was not content with the learning that athens could give him but sailed into italy for pythagoras knowledge and yet not thinking himself sufficiently informed went into egypt to the priests and learned their mysteries he laboured so must we many things may be learned together and performed in one point of time as musicians exercise their memory their voice their fingers and sometimes their head and feet at once and so a preacher in the invention of matter election of words composition of gesture look pronunciation motion useth all these faculties at once and if we can express this variety together why should not divers studies at divers hours delight when the variety is able alone to refresh and repair us as when a man is weary of writing to read and then again of reading to write wherein howsoever we do many things yet are we in a sort still fresh to what we begin we are recreated with change as the stomach is with meats but some will say this variety breeds confusion and makes that either we lose all or hold no more than the last why do we not then persuade husbandmen that they should not till land help it with marl lime and compost plant hopgardens prune trees look to beehives rear sheep and all other cattle at once it is easier to do many things and continue than to do one thing long praecept element it is not the passing through these learnings that hurts us but the dwelling and sticking about them to descend to those extreme anxieties and foolish cavils of grammarians is able to break a wit in pieces being a work of manifold misery and vainness to be elementarii senes yet even letters are as it were the bank of words and restore themselves to an author as the pawns of language but talking and eloquence are not the same to speak and to speak well are two things a fool may talk but a wise man speaks and out of the observation knowledge and the use of things many writers perplex their readers and hearers with mere nonsense their writings need sunshine pure and neat language i love yet plain and customary a barbarous phrase has often made me out of love with a good sense and doubtful writing hath wracked me beyond my patience the reason why a poet is said that he ought to have all knowledges is that he should not be ignorant of the most especially of those he will handle and indeed when the attaining of them is possible it were a sluggish and base thing to despair for frequent imitation of anything becomes a habit quickly if a man should prosecute as much as could be said of everything his work would find no end de orationis dignitate greek text metaphora speech is the only benefit man hath to express his excellency of mind above other creatures it is the instrument of society therefore mercury who is the president of language is called deorum hominumque interpres a in all speech words and sense are as the body and the soul the sense is as the life and soul of language without which all words are dead sense is wrought out of experience the knowledge of human life and actions or of the liberal arts which the greeks called greek text words are the peoples yet there is a choice of them to be made for verborum delectus origo est eloquentiae a they are to be chosen according to the persons we make speak or the things we speak of some are of the camp some of the councilboard some of the shop some of the sheepcote some of the pulpit some of the bar c and herein is seen their elegance and propriety when we use them fitly and draw them forth to their just strength and nature by way of translation or metaphor but in this translation we must only serve necessity nam temere nihil transfertur a prudenti b or commodity which is a kind of necessity that is when we either absolutely want a word to express by and that is necessity or when we have not so fit a word and that is commodity as when we avoid loss by it and escape obsceneness and gain in the grace and property which helps significance metaphors farfetched hinder to be understood and affected lose their grace or when the person fetcheth his translations from a wrong place as if a privy councillor should at the table take his metaphor from a dicinghouse or ordinary or a vintners vault or a justice of peace draw his similitudes from the mathematics or a divine from a bawdy house or taverns or a gentleman of northamptonshire warwickshire or the midland should fetch all the illustrations to his country neighbours from shipping and tell them of the mainsheet and the bowline metaphors are thus many times deformed as in him that said castratam morte africani rempublicam and another stercus curiae glauciam and cana nive conspuit alpes all attempts that are new in this kind are dangerous and somewhat hard before they be softened with use a man coins not a new word without some peril and less fruit for if it happen to be received the praise is but moderate if refused the scorn is assured yet we must adventure for things at first hard and rough are by use made tender and gentle it is an honest error that is committed following great chiefs consuetudo perspicuitas venustas authoritas virgil lucretius chaucerism paronomasia custom is the most certain mistress of language as the public stamp makes the current money but we must not be too frequent with the mint every day coining nor fetch words from the extreme and utmost ages since the chief virtue of a style is perspicuity and nothing so vicious in it as to need an interpreter words borrowed of antiquity do lend a kind of majesty to style and are not without their delight sometimes for they have the authority of years and out of their intermission do win themselves a kind of grace like newness but the eldest of the present and newness of the past language is the best for what was the ancient language which some men so dote upon but the ancient custom yet when i name custom i understand not the vulgar custom for that were a precept no less dangerous to language than life if we should speak or live after the manners of the vulgar but that i call custom of speech which is the consent of the learned as custom of life which is the consent of the good virgil was most loving of antiquity yet how rarely doth he insert aquai and pictai lucretius is scabrous and rough in these he seeks them as some do chaucerisms with us which were better expunged and banished some words are to be culled out for ornament and colour as we gather flowers to strew houses or make garlands but they are better when they grow to our style as in a meadow where though the mere grass and greenness delight yet the variety of flowers doth heighten and beautify marry we must not play or riot too much with them as in paronomasies nor use too swelling or illsounding words quae per salebras altaque saxa cadunt a it is true there is no sound but shall find some lovers as the bitterest confections are grateful to some palates our composition must be more accurate in the beginning and end than in the midst and in the end more than in the beginning for through the midst the stream bears us and this is attained by custom more than care of diligence we must express readily and fully not profusely there is difference between a liberal and prodigal hand as it is a great point of art when our matter requires it to enlarge and veer out all sail so to take it in and contract it is of no less praise when the argument doth ask it either of them hath their fitness in the place a good man always profits by his endeavour by his help yea when he is absent nay when he is dead by his example and memory so good authors in their style a strict and succinct style is that where you can take away nothing without loss and that loss to be manifest de stylo tracitus the laconic suetonius seneca and fabianus the brief style is that which expresseth much in little the concise style which expresseth not enough but leaves somewhat to be understood the abrupt style which hath many breaches and doth not seem to end but fall the congruent and harmonious fitting of parts in a sentence hath almost the fastening and force of knitting and connection as in stones well squared which will rise strong a great way without mortar periodi obscuritas offundit tenebras superlatio periods are beautiful when they are not too long for so they have their strength too as in a pike or javelin as we must take the care that our words and sense be clear so if the obscurity happen through the hearers or readers want of understanding i am not to answer for them no more than for their not listening or marking i must neither find them ears nor mind but a man cannot put a word so in sense but something about it will illustrate it if the writer understand himself for order helps much to perspicuity as confusion hurts rectitudo lucem adfert obliquitas et circumductio offuscat a we should therefore speak what we can the nearest way so as we keep our gait not leap for too short may as well be not let into the memory as too long not kept in whatsoever loseth the grace and clearness converts into a riddle the obscurity is marked but not the value that perisheth and is passed by like the pearl in the fable our style should be like a skein of silk to be carried and found by the right thread not ravelled and perplexed then all is a knot a heap there are words that do as much raise a style as others can depress it superlation and overmuchness amplifies it may be above faith but never above a mean it was ridiculous in cestius when he said of alexander fremit oceanus quasi indignetur quod terras relinquas a but propitiously from virgil credas innare revulsas cycladas b he doth not say it was so but seemed to be so although it be somewhat incredible that is excused before it be spoken but there are hyperboles which will become one language that will by no means admit another as eos esse p r exercitus qui caelum possint perrumpere a who would say with us but a madman therefore we must consider in every tongue what is used what received quintilian warns us that in no kind of translation or metaphor or allegory we make a turn from what we began as if we fetch the original of our metaphor from sea and billows we end not in flames and ashes it is a most foul inconsequence neither must we draw out our allegory too long lest either we make ourselves obscure or fall into affectation which is childish but why do men depart at all from the right and natural ways of speaking sometimes for necessity when we are driven or think it fitter to speak that in obscure words or by circumstance which uttered plainly would offend the hearers or to avoid obsceneness or sometimes for pleasure and variety as travellers turn out of the highway drawn either by the commodity of a footpath or the delicacy or freshness of the fields and all this is called greek text or figured language oratio imago animi language most shows a man speak that i may see thee it springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us and is the image of the parent of it the mind no glass renders a mans form or likeness so true as his speech nay it is likened to a man and as we consider feature and composition in a man so words in language in the greatness aptness sound structure and harmony of it structura et statura sublimis humilis pumila some men are tall and big so some language is high and great then the words are chosen their sound ample the composition full the absolution plenteous and poured out all grave sinewy and strong some are little and dwarfs so of speech it is humble and low the words poor and flat the members and periods thin and weak without knitting or number mediocris plana et placida the middle are of a just stature there the language is plain and pleasing even without stopping round without swelling all wellturned composed elegant and accurate vitiosa oratio vasta tumens enormis affectata abjecta the vicious language is vast and gaping swelling and irregular when it contends to be high full of rock mountain and pointedness as it affects to be low it is abject and creeps full of bogs and holes and according to their

the second and a third distemper is deceit or the likeness of truth imposture held up by credulity all these are the cobwebs of learning and to let them grow in us is either sluttish or foolish nothing is more ridiculous than to make an author a dictator as the schools have done aristotle the damage is infinite knowledge receives by it for to many things a man should owe but a temporary belief and suspension of his own judgment not an absolute resignation of himself or a perpetual captivity let aristotle and others have their dues but if we can make farther discoveries of truth and fitness than they why are we envied let us beware while we strive to add we do not diminish or deface we may improve but not augment by discrediting falsehood truth grows in request we must not go about like men anguished and perplexed for vicious affectation of praise but calmly study the separation of opinions find the errors have intervened awake antiquity call former times into question but

level de optimo scriptore cicero now that i have informed you in the knowing of these things let me lead you by the hand a little farther in the direction of the use and make you an able writer by practice the conceits of the mind are pictures of things and the tongue is the interpreter of those pictures the order of gods creatures in themselves is not only admirable and glorious but eloquent then he who could apprehend the consequence of things in their truth and utter his apprehensions as truly were the best writer or speaker therefore cicero said much when he said dicere recte nemo potest nisi qui prudenter intelligit a the shame of speaking unskilfully were small if the tongue only thereby were disgraced but as the image of a king in his seal illrepresented is not so much a blemish to the wax or the signet that sealed it as to the prince it representeth so disordered speech is not so much injury to the lips that give it forth as to the disproportion and incoherence of things in themselves so negligently expressed neither can his mind be thought to be in tune whose words do jar nor his reason in frame whose sentence is preposterous nor his elocution clear and perfect whose utterance breaks itself into fragments and uncertainties were it not a dishonour to a mighty prince to have the majesty of his embassage spoiled by a careless ambassador and is it not as great an indignity that an excellent conceit and capacity by the indiligence of an idle tongue should be disgraced negligent speech doth not only discredit the person of the speaker but it discrediteth the opinion of his reason and judgment it discrediteth the force and uniformity of the matter and substance if it be so then in words which fly and escape censure and where one good phrase begs pardon for many incongruities and faults how shall he then be thought wise whose penning is thin and shallow how shall you look for wit from him whose leisure and head assisted with the examination of his eyes yield you no life or sharpness in his writing de stylo epistolari inventio in writing there is to be regarded the invention and the fashion for the invention that ariseth upon your business whereof there can be no rules of more certainty or precepts of better direction given than conjecture can lay down from the several occasions of mens particular lives and vocations but sometimes men make baseness of kindness as i could not satisfy myself till i had discharged my remembrance and charged my letters with commendation to you or my business is no other than to testify my love to you and to put you in mind of my willingness to do you all kind offices or sir have you leisure to descend to the remembering of that assurance you have long possessed in your servant and upon your next opportunity make him happy with some commands from you or the like that go abegging for some meaning and labour to be delivered of the great burden of nothing when you have invented and that your business be matter and not bare form or mere ceremony but some earnest then are you to proceed to the ordering of it and digesting the parts which is had out of two circumstances one is the understanding of the persons to whom you are to write the other is the coherence of your sentence for mens capacity to weigh what will be apprehended with greatest attention or leisure what next regarded and longed for especially and what last will leave satisfaction and as it were the sweetest memorial and belief of all that is passed in his understanding whom you write to for the consequence of sentences you must be sure that every clause do give the cue one to the other and be bespoken ere it come so much for invention and order modus brevitas now for fashion it consists in four things which are qualities of your style the first is brevity for they must not be treatises or discourses your letters except it be to learned men and even among them there is a kind of thrift and saving of words therefore you are to examine the clearest passages of your understanding and through them to convey the sweetest and most significant words you can devise that you may the easier teach them the readiest way to another mans apprehension and open their meaning fully roundly and distinctly so as the reader may not think a second view cast away upon your letter and though respect be a part following this yet now here and still i must remember it if you write to a man whose estate and sense as senses you are familiar with you may the bolder to set a task to his brain venture on a knot but if to your superior you are bound to measure him in three farther points first with interest in him secondly his capacity in your letters thirdly his leisure to peruse them for your interest or favour with him you are to be the shorter or longer more familiar or submiss as he will afford you time for his capacity you are to be quicker and fuller of those reaches and glances of wit or learning as he is able to entertain them for his leisure you are commanded to the greater briefness as his place is of greater discharges and cares but with your betters you are not to put riddles of wit by being too scarce of words not to cause the trouble of making breviates by writing too riotous and wastingly brevity is attained in matter by avoiding idle compliments prefaces protestations parentheses superfluous circuit of figures and digressions in the composition by omitting conjunctions not only but also both the one and the other whereby it cometh to pass and such like idle particles that have no great business in a serious letter but breaking of sentences as oftentimes a short journey is made long by unnessary baits quintilian but as quintilian saith there is a briefness of the parts sometimes that makes the whole long as i came to the stairs i took a pair of oars they launched out rowed apace i landed at the court gate i paid my fare went up to the presence asked for my lord i was admitted all this is but i went to the court and spake with my lord this is the fault of some latin writers within these last hundred years of my reading and perhaps seneca may be appeached of it i accuse him not perspicuitas the next property of epistolary style is perspicuity and is oftentimes by affectation of some wit ill angled for or ostentation of some hidden terms of art few words they darken speech and so do too many as well too much light hurteth the eyes as too little and a long bill of chancery confounds the understanding as much as the shortest note therefore let not your letters be penned like english statutes and this is obtained these vices are eschewed by pondering your business well and distinctly concerning yourself which is much furthered by uttering your thoughts and letting them as well come forth to the light and judgment of your own outward senses as to the censure of other mens ears for that is the reason why many good scholars speak but fumblingly like a rich man that for want of particular note and difference can bring you no certain ware readily out of his shop hence it is that talkative shallow men do often content the hearers more than the wise but this may find a speedier redress in writing where all comes under the last examination of the eyes first mind it well then pen it then examine it then amend it and you may be in the better hope of doing reasonably well under this virtue may come plainness which is not to be curious in the order as to answer a letter as if you were to answer to interrogatories as to the first first and to the second secondly c but both in method to use as ladies do in their attire a diligent kind of negligence and their sportive freedom though with some men you are not to jest or practise tricks yet the delivery of the most important things may be carried with such a grace as that it may yield a pleasure to the conceit of the reader there must be store though no excess of terms as if you are to name store sometimes you may call it choice sometimes plenty sometimes copiousness or variety but ever so that the word which comes in lieu have not such difference of meaning as that it may put the sense of the first in hazard to be mistaken you are not to cast a ring for the perfumed terms of the time as accommodation complement spirit c but use them properly in their place as others vigor there followeth life and quickness which is the strength and sinews as it were of your penning by pretty sayings similitudes and conceits allusions from known history or other commonplace such as are in the courtier and the second book of cicero de oratore discretio the last is respect to discern what fits yourself him to whom you write and that which you handle which is a quality fit to conclude the rest because it doth include all and that must proceed from ripeness of judgment which as one truly saith is gotten by four means god nature diligence and conversation serve the first well and the rest will serve you de poetica we have spoken sufficiently of oratory let us now make a diversion to poetry poetry in the primogeniture had many peccant humours and is made to have more now through the levity and inconstancy of mens judgments whereas indeed it is the most prevailing eloquence and of the most exalted caract now the discredits and disgraces are many it hath received through mens study of depravation or calumny their practice being to give it diminution of credit by lessening the professors estimation and making the age afraid of their liberty and the age is grown so tender of her fame as she calls all writings aspersions that is the state word the phrase of court placentia college which some call parasites place the inn of ignorance d hieronymus whilst i name no persons but deride follies why should any man confess or betray himself why doth not that of s hierome come into their mind ubi generalis est de vitiis disputatio ibi nullius esse personae injuriam a is it such an inexpiable crime in poets to tax vices generally and no offence in them who by their exception confess they have committed them particularly are we fallen into those times that we must not auriculas teneras mordaci rodere vero b remedii votum semper verius erat quam spes c sexus faemin if men may by no means write freely or speak truth but when it offends not why do physicians cure with sharp medicines or corrosives is not the same equally lawful in the cure of the mind that is in the cure of the body some vices you will say are so foul that it is better they should be done than spoken but they that take offence where no name character or signature doth blazon them seem to me like affected as women who if they hear anything ill spoken of the ill of their sex are presently moved as if the contumely respected their particular and on the contrary when they hear good of good women conclude that it belongs to them all if i see anything that toucheth me shall i come forth a betrayer of myself presently no if i be wise ill dissemble it if honest ill avoid it lest i publish that on my own forehead which i saw there noted without a title a man that is on the mending hand will either ingenuously confess or wisely dissemble his disease and the wise and virtuous will never think anything belongs to themselves that is written but rejoice that the good are warned not to be such and the ill to leave to be such the person offended hath no reason to be offended with the writer but with himself and so to declare that properly to belong to him which was so spoken of all men as it could be no mans several but his that would wilfully and desperately claim it it sufficeth i know what kind of persons i displease men bred in the declining and decay of virtue betrothed to their own vices that have abandoned or prostituted their good names hungry and ambitious of infamy invested in all deformity enthralled to ignorance and malice of a hidden and concealed malignity and that hold a concomitancy with all evil what is a poet poeta a poet is that which by the greeks is called greek text a maker or a feigner his art an art of imitation or feigning expressing the life of man in fit measure numbers and harmony according to aristotle from the word greek text which signifies to make or feign hence he is called a poet not he which writeth in measure only but that feigneth and formeth a fable and writes things like the truth for the fable and fiction is as it were the form and soul of any poetical work or poem what mean you by a poem poema a poem is not alone any work or composition of the poets in many or few verses but even one verse alone sometimes makes a perfect poem as when aeneas hangs up and consecrates the arms of abas with this inscription aeneas haec de danais victoribus arma a and calls it a poem or carmen such are those in martial omnia castor emis sic fiet ut omnia vendas b and pauper videri cinna vult et est pauper c horatius lucretius so were horaces odes called carmina his lyric songs and lucretius designs a whole book in his sixth quod in primo quoque carmine claret d epicum dramaticum lyricum elegiacum epigrammat and anciently all the oracles were called carmina or whatever sentence was expressed were it much or little it was called an epic dramatic lyric elegiac or epigrammatic poem but how differs a poem from what we call poesy poesis artium regina poet differentiae grammatic logic rhetoric ethica a poem as i have told you is the work of the poet the end and fruit of his labour and study poesy is his skill or craft of making the very fiction itself the reason or form of the work and these three voices differ as the thing done the doing and the doer the thing feigned the feigning and the feigner so the poem the poesy and the poet now the poesy is the habit or the art nay rather the queen of arts which had her original from heaven received thence from the hebrews and had in prime estimation with the greeks transmitted to the latins and all nations that professed civility the study of it if we will trust aristotle offers to mankind a certain rule and pattern of living well and happily disposing us to all civil offices of society if we will believe tully it nourisheth and instructeth our youth delights our age adorns our prosperity comforts our adversity entertains us at home keeps us company abroad travels with us watches divides the times of our earnest and sports shares in our country recesses and recreations insomuch as the wisest and best learned have thought her the absolute mistress of manners and nearest of kin to virtue and whereas they entitle philosophy to be a rigid and austere poesy they have on the contrary styled poesy a dulcet and gentle philosophy which leads on and guides us by the hand to action with a ravishing delight and incredible sweetness but before we handle the kinds of poems with their special differences or make court to the art itself as a mistress i would lead you to the knowledge of our poet by a perfect information what he is or should be by nature by exercise by imitation by study and so bring him down through the disciplines of grammar logic rhetoric and the ethics adding somewhat out of all peculiar to himself and worthy of your admittance or reception ingenium seneca plato aristotle helicon pegasus parnassus ovid first we require in our poet or maker for that title our language affords him elegantly with the greek a goodness of natural wit for whereas all other arts consist of doctrine and precepts the poet must be able by nature and instinct to pour out the treasure of his mind and as seneca saith aliquando secundum anacreontem insanire jucundum esse by which he understands the poetical rapture and according to that of plato frustra poeticas fores sui compos pulsavit and of aristotle nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae fuit nec potest grande aliquid et supra caeteros loqui nisi mota mens then it riseth higher as by a divine instinct when it contemns common and known conceptions it utters somewhat above a mortal mouth then it gets aloft and flies away with his rider whither before it was doubtful to ascend this the poets understood by their helicon pegasus or parnassus and this made ovid to boast est deus in nobis agitante calescimus illo sedibus aethereis spiritus ille venit a lipsius petron in fragm and lipsius to affirm scio poetam neminem praestantem fuisse sine parte quadam uberiore divinae aurae and hence it is that the coming up of good poets for i mind not mediocres or imos is so thin and rare among us every beggarly corporation affords the state a mayor or two bailiffs yearly but solus rex aut poeta non quotannis nascitur to this perfection of nature in our poet we require exercise of those parts and frequent exercitatio virgil scaliger valer maximus euripides alcestis if his wit will not arrive suddenly at the dignity of the ancients let him not yet fall out with it quarrel or be over hastily angry offer to turn it away from study in a humour but come to it again upon better cogitation try another time with labour if then it succeed not cast not away the quills yet nor scratch the wainscot beat not the poor desk but bring all to the forge and file again torn it anew there is no statute law of the kingdom bids you be a poet against your will or the first quarter if it comes in a year or two it is well the common rhymers pour forth verses such as they are ex tempore but there never comes from them one sense worth the life of a day a rhymer and a poet are two things it is said of the incomparable virgil that he brought forth his verses like a bear and after formed them with licking scaliger the father writes it of him that he made a quantity of verses in the morning which afore night he reduced to a less number but that which valerius maximus hath left recorded of euripides the tragic poet his answer to alcestis another poet is as memorable as modest who when it was told to alcestis that euripides had in three days brought forth but three verses and those with some difficulty and throes alcestis glorying he could with ease have sent forth a hundred in the space euripides roundly replied like enough but here is the difference thy verses will not last these three days mine will to all time which was as much as to tell him he could not write a verse i have met many of these rattles that made a noise and buzzed they had their hum and no more indeed things wrote with labour deserve to be so read and will last their age imitatio horatius virgil statius homer horat archil alcaeus c the third requisite in our poet or maker is imitation to be able to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use to make choice of one excellent man above the rest and so to follow him till he grow very he or so like him as the copy may be mistaken for the principal not as a creature that swallows what it takes in crude raw or undigested but that feeds with an appetite and hath a stomach to concoct divide and turn all into nourishment not to imitate servilely as horace saith and catch at vices for virtue but to draw forth out of the best and choicest flowers with the bee and turn all into honey work it into one relish and savour make our imitation sweet observe how the best writers have imitated and follow them how virgil and statius have imitated homer how horace archilochus how alcaeus and the other lyrics and so of the rest lectio parnassus helicon arscoron m t cicero simylus stob horat aristot but that which we especially require in him is an exactness of study and multiplicity of reading which maketh a full man not alone enabling him to know the history or argument of a poem and to report it but so to master the matter and style as to show he knows how to handle place or dispose of either with elegancy when need shall be and not think he can leap forth suddenly a poet by dreaming he hath been in parnassus or having washed his lips as they say in helicon there goes more to his making than so for to nature exercise imitation and study art must be added to make all these perfect and though these challenge to themselves much in the making up of our maker it is art only can lead him to perfection and leave him there in possession as planted by her hand it is the assertion of tully if to an excellent nature there happen an accession or conformation of learning and discipline there will then remain somewhat noble and singular for as simylus saith in stobaeus greek text without art nature can never be perfect and without nature art can claim no being but our poet must beware that his study be not only to learn of himself for he that shall affect to do that confesseth his ever having a fool to his master he must read many but ever the best and choicest those that can teach him anything he must ever account his masters and reverence among whom horace and he that taught him aristotle deserved to be the first in estimation aristotle was the first accurate critic and truest judge nay the greatest philosopher the world ever had for he noted the vices of all knowledges in all creatures and out of many mens perfections in a science he formed still one art so he taught us two offices together how we ought to judge rightly of others and what we ought to imitate specially in ourselves but all this in vain without a natural wit and a poetical nature in chief for no man so soon as he knows this or reads it shall be able to write the better but as he is adapted to it by nature he shall grow the perfecter writer he must have civil prudence and eloquence and that whole not taken up by snatches or pieces in sentences or remnants when he will handle business or carry counsels as if he came then out of the declaimers gallery or shadow furnished but out of the body of the state which commonly is the school of men virorum schola respub lysippus apelles naevius the poet is the nearest borderer upon the orator and expresseth all his virtues though he be tied more to numbers is his equal in ornament and above him in his strengths and of the kind the comic comes nearest because in moving the minds of men and stirring of affections in which oratory shows and especially approves her eminence he chiefly excels what figure of a body was lysippus ever able to form with his graver or apelles to paint with his pencil as the comedy to life expresseth so many and various affections of the mind there shall the spectator see some insulting with joy others fretting with melancholy raging with anger mad with love boiling with avarice undone with riot tortured with expectation consumed with fear no perturbation in common life but the orator finds an example of it in the scene and then for the elegancy of language read but this inscription on the grave of a comic poet immortales mortales si fas esset fiere flerent divae camoenae naevium poetam itaque postquam est orcino traditus thesauro obliti sunt romae lingua loqui latina a l aelius stilo plautus m varro or that modester testimony given by lucius aelius stilo upon plautus who affirmed musas si latine loqui voluissent plautino sermone fuisse loquuturas and that illustrious judgment by the most learned m varro of him who pronounced him the prince of letters and elegancy in the roman language sophocles i am not of that opinion to conclude a poets liberty within the narrow limits of laws which either the grammarians or philosophers prescribe for before they found out those laws there were many excellent poets that fulfilled them amongst whom none more perfect than sophocles who lived a little before aristotle demosthenes pericles alcibiades which of the greeklings durst ever give precepts to demosthenes or to pericles whom the age surnamed heavenly because he seemed to thunder and lighten with his language or to alcibiades who had rather nature for his guide than art for his master aristotle but whatsoever nature at any time dictated to the most happy or long exercise to the most laborious that the wisdom and learning of aristotle hath brought into an art because he understood the causes of things and what other men did by chance or custom he doth by reason and not only found out the way not to err but the short way we should take not to err euripides aristophanes many things in euripides hath aristophanes wittily reprehended not out of art but out of truth for euripides is sometimes peccant as he is most times perfect but judgment when it is greatest if reason doth not accompany it is not ever absolute cens scal in lil germ horace to judge of poets is only the faculty of poets and not of all poets but the best nemo infelicius de poetis judicavit quam qui de poetis scripsit a but some will say critics are a kind of tinkers that make more faults than they mend ordinarily see their diseases and those of grammarians it is true many bodies are the worse for the meddling with and the multitude of physicians hath destroyed many sound patients with their wrong practice but the office of a true critic or censor is not to throw by a letter anywhere or damn an innocent syllable but lay the words together and amend them judge sincerely of the author and his matter which is the sign of solid and perfect learning in a man such was horace an author of much civility and if any one among the heathen can be the best master both of virtue and wisdom an excellent and true judge upon cause and reason not because he thought so but because he knew so out of use and experience cato the grammarian a defender of lucilius a cato grammaticus latina syren qui solus legit et facit poetas quintilian of the same heresy but rejected b horace his judgment of choerillus defended against joseph scaliger c and of laberius against julius d but chiefly his opinion of plautus e vindicated against many that are offended and say it is a hard censure upon the parent of all conceit and sharpness and they wish it had not fallen from so great a master and censor in the art whose bondmen knew better how to judge of plautus than any that dare patronise the family of learning in this age who could not be ignorant of the judgment of the times in which he lived when poetry and the latin language were at the height especially being a man so conversant and inwardly familiar with the censures of great men that did discourse of these things daily amongst themselves again a man so gracious and in high favour with the emperor as augustus often called him his witty manling for the littleness of his stature and if we may trust antiquity had designed him for a secretary of estate and invited him to the palace which he modestly prayed off and refused terence menander horace did so highly esteem terences comedies as he ascribes the art in comedy to him alone among the latins and joins him with menander now let us see what may be said for either to defend horaces judgment to posterity and not wholly to condemn plautus the parts of a comedy and tragedy the parts of a comedy are the same with a tragedy and the end is partly the same for they both delight and teach the comics are called greek text of the greeks no less than the tragics aristotle plato homer nor is the moving of laughter always the end of comedy that is rather a fowling for the peoples delight or their fooling for as aristotle says rightly the moving of laughter is a fault in comedy a kind of turpitude that depraves some part of a mans nature without a disease as a wry face without pain moves laughter or a deformed vizard or a rude clown dressed in a ladys habit and using her actions we dislike and scorn such representations which made the ancient philosophers ever think laughter unfitting in a wise man and this induced plato to esteem of homer as a sacrilegious person because he presented the gods sometimes laughing as also it is divinely said of aristotle that to seen ridiculous is a part of dishonesty and foolish the wit of the old comedy so that what either in the words or sense of an author or in the language or actions of men is awry or depraved does strangely stir mean affections and provoke for the most part to laughter and therefore it was clear that all insolent and obscene speeches jests upon the best men injuries to particular persons perverse and sinister sayings and the rather unexpected in the old comedy did move laughter especially where it did imitate any dishonesty and scurrility came forth in the place of wit which who understands the nature and genius of laughter cannot but perfectly know aristophanes plautus of which aristophanes affords an ample harvest having not only outgone plautus or any other in that kind but expressed all the moods and figures of what is ridiculous oddly in short as vinegar is not accounted good until the wine be corrupted so jests that are true and natural seldom raise laughter with the beast the multitude they love nothing that is right and proper the farther it runs from reason or possibility with them the better it is socrates theatrical wit what could have made them laugh like to see socrates presented that example of all good life honesty and virtue to have him hoisted up with a pulley and there play the philosopher in a basket measure how many foot a flea could skip geometrically by a just scale and edify the people from the engine this was theatrical wit right stage jesting and relishing a playhouse invented for scorn and laughter whereas if it had savoured of equity truth perspicuity and candour to have tasten a wise or a learned palate spit it out presently this is bitter and profitable this instructs and would inform us what need we know any thing that are nobly born more than a horserace or a huntingmatch our day to break with citizens and such innate mysteries the cart this is truly leaping from the stage to the tumbril again reducing all wit to the original dungcart of the magnitude and compass of any fable epic or dramatic what the measure of a fable is the fable or plot of a poem defined the epic fable differing from the dramatic to the resolving of this question we must first agree in the definition of the fable the fable is called the imitation of one entire and perfect action whose parts are so joined and knit together as nothing in the structure can be changed or taken away without impairing or troubling the whole of which there is a proportionable magnitude in the members as for example if a man would build a house he would first appoint a place to build it in which he would define within certain bounds so in the constitution of a poem the action is aimed at by the poet which answers place in a building and that action hath his largeness compass and proportion but as a court or kings palace requires other dimensions than a private house so the epic asks a magnitude from other poems since what is place in the one is action in the other the difference is an space so that by this definition we conclude the fable to be the imitation of one perfect and entire action as one perfect and entire place is required to a building by perfect we understand that to which nothing is wanting as place to the building that is raised and action to the fable that is formed it is perfect perhaps not for a court or kings palace which requires a greater ground but for the structure he would raise so the space of the action may not prove large enough for the epic fable yet be perfect for the dramatic and whole what we understand by whole whole we call that and perfect which hath a beginning a midst and an end so the place of any building may be whole and entire for that work though too little for a palace as to a tragedy or a comedy the action may be convenient and perfect that would not fit an epic poem in magnitude so a lion is a perfect creature in himself though it be less than that of a buffalo or a rhinocerote they differ but in specie either in the kind is absolute both have their parts and either the whole therefore as in every body so in every action which is the subject of a just work there is required a certain proportionable greatness neither too vast nor too minute for that which happens to the eyes when we behold a body the same happens to the memory when we contemplate an action i look upon a monstrous giant as tityus whose body covered nine acres of land and mine eye sticks upon every part the whole that consists of those parts will never be taken in at one entire view so in a fable if the action be too great we can never comprehend the whole together in our imagination again if it be too little there ariseth no pleasure out of the object it affords the view no stay it is beheld and vanisheth at once as if we should look upon an ant or pismire the parts fly the sight and the whole considered is almost nothing the same happens in action which is the object of memory as the body is of sight too vast oppresseth the eyes and exceeds the memory too little scarce admits either what is the utmost bounds of a fable now in every action it behoves the poet to know which is his utmost bound how far with fitness and a necessary proportion he may produce and determine it that is till either good fortune change into the worse or the worse into the better for as a body without proportion cannot be goodly no more can the action either in comedy or tragedy without his fit bounds and every bound for the nature of the subject is esteemed the best that is largest till it can increase no more so it behoves the action in tragedy or comedy to be let grow till the necessity ask a conclusion wherein two things are to be considered first that it exceed not the compass of one day next that there be place left for digression and art for the episodes and digressions in a fable are the same that household stuff and other furniture are in a house and so far from the measure and extent of a fable dramatic what by one and entire now that it should be one and entire one is considerable two ways either as it is only separate and by itself or as being composed of many parts it begins to be one as those parts grow or are wrought together that it should be one the first away alone and by itself no man that hath tasted letters ever would say especially having required before a just magnitude and equal proportion of the parts in themselves neither of which can possibly be if the action be single and separate not composed of parts which laid together in themselves with an equal and fitting proportion tend to the same end which thing out of antiquity itself hath deceived many and more this day it doth deceive hercules theseus achilles ulysses homer and virgil aeneas venus so many there be of old that have thought the action of one man to be one as of hercules theseus achilles ulysses and other heroes which is both foolish and false since by one and the same person many things may be severally done which cannot fitly be referred or joined to the same end which not only the excellent tragic poets but the best masters of the epic homer and virgil saw for though the argument of an epic poem be far more diffused and poured out than that of tragedy yet virgil writing of aeneas hath pretermitted many things he neither tells how he was born how brought up how he fought with achilles how he was snatched out of the battle by venus but that one thing how he came into italy he prosecutes in twelve books the rest of his journey his error by sea the sack of troy are put not as the argument of the work but episodes of the argument so homer laid by many things of ulysses and handled no more than he saw tended to one and the same end theseus hercules juvenal codrus sophocles ajax ulysses contrary to which and foolishly those poets did whom the philosopher taxeth of whom one gathered all the actions of theseus another put all the labours of hercules in one work so did he whom juvenal mentions in the beginning hoarse codrus that recited a volume compiled which he called his theseide not yet finished to the great trouble both of his hearers and himself amongst which there were many parts had no coherence nor kindred one with another so far they were from being one action one fable for as a house consisting of divers materials becomes one structure and one dwelling so an action composed of divers parts may become one fable epic or dramatic for example in a tragedy look upon sophocles his ajax ajax deprived of achilles armour which he hoped from the suffrage of the greeks disdains and growing impatient of the injury rageth and runs mad in that humour he doth many senseless things and at last falls upon the grecian flock and kills a great ram for ulysses returning to his senses he grows ashamed of the scorn and kills himself and is by the chiefs of the greeks forbidden burial these things agree and hang together not as they were done but as seeming to be done which made the action whole entire and absolute the conclusion concerning the whole and the parts which are episodes ajax and hector homer for the whole as it consisteth of parts so without all the parts it is not the whole and to make it absolute is required not only the parts but such parts as are true for a part of the whole was true which if you take away you either change the whole or it is not the whole for if it be such a part as being present or absent nothing concerns the whole it cannot be called a part of the whole and such are the episodes of which hereafter for the present here is one example the single combat of ajax with hector as it is at large described in homer nothing belongs to this ajax of sophocles you admire no poems but such as run like a brewers cart upon the stones hobbling et quae per salebras altaque saxa cadunt accius et

on the countess of pembroke underneath this sable hearse lies the subject of all verse sidneys sister pembrokes mother death ere thou hast slain another learned and fair and good as she time shall throw a dart at thee to the memory of my beloved master william shakspeare and what he hath left us to draw no envy shakspeare on thy name am i thus ample to thy book and fame while i confess thy writings to be such as neither man nor muse can praise too much tis true and all mens suffrage but these ways were not the paths i meant unto thy praise for silliest ignorance on these may light which when it sounds at best but echoes right or blind affection which doth neer advance the truth but gropes and urgeth all by chance or crafty malice might pretend this praise and think to ruin where it seemed to raise these are as some infamous bawd or whore should praise a matron what would hurt her more but thou art proof against them and indeed above the illfortune of them or the need i therefore will begin soul of the age the applause delight and wonder of our stage my shakspeare rise i will not lodge thee by chaucer or spenser or bid beaumont lie a little further off to make thee room thou art a monument without a tomb and art alive still while thy book doth live and we have wits to read and praise to give that i not mix thee so my brain excuses i mean with great but disproportioned muses for if i thought my judgment were of years i should commit thee surely with thy peers and tell how far thou didst our lily outshine or sporting kyd or marlows mighty line and though thou hadst small latin and less greek from thence to honour thee i will not seek for names but call forth thundering eschylus euripides and sophocles to us pacuvius accius him of cordoua dead to live again to hear thy buskin tread and shake a stage or when thy socks were on leave thee alone for the comparison of all that insolent greece or haughty rome sent forth or since did from their ashes come triumph my britain thou hast one to show to whom all scenes of europe homage owe he was not of an age but for all time and all the muses still were in their prime when like apollo he came forth to warm our ears or like a mercury to charm nature herself was proud of his designs and joyed to wear the dressing of his lines which were so richly spun and woven so fit as since she will vouchsafe no other wit the merry greek tart aristophanes neat terence witty plautus now not please but antiquated and deserted lie as they were not of natures family yet must i not give nature all thy art my gentle shakspeare must enjoy a part for though the poets matter nature be his heart doth give the fashion and that he who casts to write a living line must sweat such as thine are and strike the second heat upon the muses anvil turn the same and himself with it that he thinks to frame or for the laurel he may gain a scorn for a good poets made as well as born and such wert thou look how the fathers face lives in his issue even so the race of shakspeares mind and manners brightly shines in his wellturned and true filed lines in each of which he seems to shake a lance as brandished at the eyes of ignorance sweet swan of avon what a sight it were to see thee in our water yet appear and make those flights upon the banks of thames that so did take eliza and our james but stay i see thee in the hemisphere advanced and made a constellation there shine forth thou star of poets and with rage or influence chide or cheer the drooping stage which since thy flight from hence hath mourned like night and despairs day but for thy volumes light to celia drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss but in the cup and ill not look for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine but might i of joves nectar sup i would not change for thine i sent thee late a rosy wreath not so much honouring thee as giving it a hope that there it could not withered be but thou thereon didst only breathe and sentst it back to me since when it grows and smells i swear not of itself but thee the triumph of charis see the chariot at hand here of love wherein my lady rideth each that draws is a swan or a dove and well the car love guideth as she goes all hearts do duty unto her beauty and enamoured do wish so they might but enjoy such a sight that they still were to run by her side through swords through seas whither she would ride do but look on her eyes they do light all that loves world compriseth do but look on her hair it is bright as loves star when it riseth do but mark her foreheads smoother than words that soothe her and from her arched brows such a grace sheds itself through the face as alone there triumphs to the life all the gain all the good of the elements strife have you seen but a bright lily grow before rude hands have touched it have you marked but the fall o the snow before the soil hath smutched it have you felt the wool of beaver or swans down ever or have smelt o the bud o the brier or the nard in the fire or have tasted the bag of the bee o so white o so soft o so sweet is she in the person of womankind a song apologetic men if you love us play no more the fools or tyrants with your friends to make us still sing oer and oer our own false praises for your ends we have both wits and fancies too and if we must lets sing of you nor do we doubt but that we can if we would search with care and pain find some one good in some one man so going thorough all your strain we shall at last of parcels make one good enough for a songs sake and as a cunning painter takes in any curious piece you see more pleasure while the thing he makes than when tis made why so will we and having pleased our art well try to make a new and hang that by ode to the immortal memory and friendship of that noble pair sir lucius cary and sir henry morison i the turn brave infant of saguntum clear thy coming forth in that great year when the prodigious hannibal did crown his cage with razing your immortal town thou looking then about ere thou wert half got out wise child didst hastily return and madst thy mothers womb thine urn how summed a circle didst thou leave mankind of deepest lore could we the centre find the counterturn did wiser nature draw thee back from out the horror of that sack where shame faith honour and regard of right lay trampled on the deeds of death and night urged hurried forth and hurled upon th affrighted world sword fire and famine with fell fury met and all on utmost ruin set as could they but lifes miseries foresee no doubt all infants would return like thee the stand for what is life if measured by the space not by the act or masked man if valued by his face above his fact heres one outlived his peers and told forth fourscore years he vexed time and busied the whole state troubled both foes and friends but ever to no ends what did this stirrer but die late how well at twenty had he fallen or stood for three of his fourscore he did no good ii the turn he entered well by virtuous parts got up and thrived with honest arts he purchased friends and fame and honours then and had his noble name advanced with men but weary of that flight he stooped in all mens sight to sordid flatteries acts of strife and sunk in that dead sea of life so deep as he did then deaths waters sup but that the cork of title buoyed him up the counterturn alas but morison fell young he never fell thou fallst my tongue he stood a soldier to the last right end a perfect patriot and a noble friend but most a virtuous son all offices were done by him so ample full and round in weight in measure number sound as though his age imperfect might appear his life was of humanity the sphere the stand go now and tell out days summed up with fears and make them years produce thy mass of miseries on the stage to swell thine age repeat of things a throng to show thou hast been long not lived for life doth her great actions spell by what was done and wrought in season and so brought to light her measures are how well each syllabe answered and was formed how fair these make the lines of life and thats her air iii the turn it is not growing like a tree in bulk doth make men better be or standing long an oak three hundred year to fall a log at last dry bald and sear a lily of a day is fairer far in may although it fall and die that night it was the plant and flower of light in small proportions we just beauties see and in short measures life may perfect be the counterturn call noble lucius then for wine and let thy looks with gladness shine accept this garland plant it on thy head and think nay know thy morisons not dead he leaped the present age possessed with holy rage to see that bright eternal day of which we priests and poets say such truths as we expect for happy men and there he lives with memory and ben the stand jonson who sung this of him ere he went himself to rest or taste a part of that full joy he meant to have expressed in this bright asterism where it were friendships schism were not his lucius long with us to tarry to separate these twi lights the dioscouri and keep the one half from his harry but fate doth so alternate the design whilst that in heaven this light on earth must shine iv the turn and shine as you exalted are two names of friendship but one star of hearts the union and those not by chance made or indenture or leased out tadvance the profits for a time no pleasures vain did chime of rhymes or riots at your feasts orgies of drink or feigned protests but simple love of greatness and of good that knits brave minds and manners more than blood the counterturn this made you first to know the why you liked then after to apply that liking and approach so one the tother till either grew a portion of the other each styled by his end the copy of his friend you lived to be the great sirnames and titles by which all made claims unto the virtue nothing perfect done but as a cary or a morison the stand and such a force the fair example had as they that saw the good and durst not practise it were glad that such a law was left yet to mankind where they might read and find friendship indeed was written not in words and with the heart not pen of two so early men whose lines her rolls were and records who ere the first down bloomed upon the chin had sowed these fruits and got the harvest in praeludium and must i sing what subject shall i choose or whose great name in poets heaven use for the more countenance to my active muse hercules alas his bones are yet sore with his old earthly labours t exact more of his dull godhead were sin ill implore phoebus no tend thy cart still envious day shall not give out that i have made thee stay and foundered thy hot team to tune my lay nor will i beg of thee lord of the vine to raise my spirits with thy conjuring wine in the green circle of thy ivy twine pallas nor thee i call on mankind maid that at thy birth madst the poor smith afraid who with his axe thy fathers midwife played go cramp dull mars light venus when he snorts or with thy tribade trine invent new sports thou nor thy looseness with my making sorts let the old boy your son ply his old task turn the stale prologue to some painted mask his absence in my verse is all i ask hermes the cheater shall not mix with us though he would steal his sisters pegasus and rifle him or pawn his petasus nor all the ladies of the thespian lake though they were crushed into one form could make a beauty of that merit that should take my muse up by commission no i bring my own true fire now my thought takes wing and now an epode to deep ears i sing epode not to know vice at all and keep true state is virtue and not fate next to that virtue is to know vice well and her black spite expel which to effect since no breast is so sure or safe but shell procure some way of entrance we must plant a guard of thoughts to watch and ward at th eye and ear the ports unto the mind that no strange or unkind object arrive there but the heart our spy give knowledge instantly to wakeful reason our affections king who in th examining will quickly taste the treason and commit close the close cause of it tis the securest policy we have to make our sense our slave but this true course is not embraced by many by many scarce by any for either our affections do rebel or else the sentinel that should ring larum to the heart doth sleep or some great thought doth keep back the intelligence and falsely swears theyre base and idle fears whereof the loyal conscience so complains thus by these subtle trains do several passions invade the mind and strike our reason blind of which usurping rank some have thought love the first as prone to move most frequent tumults horrors and unrests in our inflamed breasts but this doth from the cloud of error grow which thus we overblow the thing they here call love is blind desire armed with bow shafts and fire inconstant like the sea of whence tis born rough swelling like a storm with whom who sails rides on the surge of fear and boils as if he were in a continual tempest now true love no such effects doth prove that is an essence far more gentle fine pure perfect nay divine it is a golden chain let down from heaven whose links are bright and even that falls like sleep on lovers and combines the soft and sweetest minds in equal knots this bears no brands nor darts to murder different hearts but in a calm and godlike unity preserves community o who is he that in this peace enjoys th elixir of all joys a form more fresh than are the eden bowers and lasting as her flowers richer than time and as timess virtue rare sober as saddest care a fixed thought an eye untaught to glance who blest with such high chance would at suggestion of a steep desire cast himself from the spire of all his happiness but soft i hear some vicious fool draw near that cries we dream and swears theres no such thing as this chaste love we sing peace luxury thou art like one of those who being at sea suppose because they move the continent doth so no vice we let thee know though thy wild thoughts with sparrows wings do fly turtles can chastely die and yet in this t express ourselves more clear we do not number here such spirits as are only continent because lusts means are spent or those who doubt the common mouth of fame and for their place and name cannot so safely sin their chastity is mere necessity nor mean we those whom vows and conscience have filled with abstinence though we acknowledge who can so abstain makes a most blessed gain he that for love of goodness hateth ill is more crownworthy still than he which for sins penalty forbears his heart sins though he fears but we propose a person like our dove graced with a phoenix love a beauty of that clear and sparkling light would make a day of night and turn the blackest sorrows to bright joys whose odorous breath destroys all taste of bitterness and makes the air as sweet as she is fair a body so harmoniously composed as if nature disclosed all her best symmetry in that one feature o so divine a creature who could be false to chiefly when he knows how only she bestows the wealthy treasure of her love on him making his fortunes swim in the full flood of her admired perfection what savage brute affection would not be fearful to offend a dame of this excelling frame much more a noble and right generous mind to virtuous moods inclined that knows the weight of guilt he will refrain from thoughts of such a strain and to his sense object this sentence ever man may securely sin but safely never an elegy though beauty be the mark of praise and yours of whom i sing be such as not the world can praise too much yet is t your virtue now i raise a virtue like allay so gone throughout your form as though that move and draw and conquer all mens love this subjects you to love of one wherein you triumph yet because tis of yourself and that you use the noblest freedom not to choose against or faith or honours laws but who could less expect from you in whom alone love lives again by whom he is restored to men and kept and bred and brought up true his falling temples you have reared the withered garlands taen away his altars kept from the decay that envy wished and nature feared and on them burns so chaste a flame with so much loyaltys expense as love t acquit such excellence is gone himself into your name and you are he the deity to whom all lovers are designed that would their better objects find among which faithful troop am i who as an offering at your shrine have sung this hymn and here entreat one spark of your diviner heat to light upon a love of mine which if it
