icarus icarus montgolfier wright ray bradbury he lay on his bed and the wind blew through the window over his ears and over his halfopened mouth so it whispered to him in his dream it was like the wind of time hollowing the delphic caves to say what must be said of yesterday today tomorrow sometimes one voice gave a shout far off away sometimes two a dozen an entire race of men cried out through his mouth but their words were always the same look look weve done it for suddenly he they one or many were flung in the dream and flew the air spread in a soft warm sea where he swam disbelieving look look its done but he didnt ask the world to watch he was only shocking his senses wide to see taste smell touch the air the wind the rising moon he swam alone in the sky the heavy earth was gone but wait he thought wait now tonight what night is this the night before of course the night before the first flight of a rocket to the moon beyond this room on the baked desert floor one hundred yards away the rocket waits for me well does it now is there really a rocket hold on he thought and twisted turned sweating eyes tight to the wall the fierce whisper in his teeth be certain sure you now who are you me he thought my name jedediah prentiss born college graduate licensed rocket pilot jedediah prentiss jedediah prentiss the wind whistled his name away he grabbed for it yelling then gone quiet he waited for the wind to bring his name back he waited a long while and there was only silence and then after a thousand heartbeats he felt motion the sky opened out like a soft blue flower the aegean sea stirred soft white fans through a distant winecolored surf in the wash of the waves on the shore he heard his name icarus and again in a breathing whisper icarus someone shook his arm and it was his father saying his name and shaking away the night and he himself lay small halfturned to the window and the shore below and the deep sky feeling the first wind of morning ruffle the golden feathers bedded in amber wax lying by the side of his cot golden wings stirred halfalive in his fathers arms and the faint down on his own shoulders quilled trembling as he looked at these wings and beyond them to the cliff father hows the wind enough for me but never enough for you father dont worry the wings seem clumsy now but my bones in the feathers will make them strong my blood in the wax will make it live my blood my bones too remember each man lends his flesh to his children asking that they tend it well promise youll not go high icarus the sun or my son the heat of one the fever of the other could melt these wings take care and they carried the splendid golden wings into the morning and heard them whisper in their arms whisper his name or a name or some name that blew span and settled like a feather on the soft air montgolfier his hands touched fiery rope bright linen stitched thread gone hot as summer his hands fed wool and straw to a breathing flame montgolfier and his eye soared up along the swell and sway the oceanic tug and pull the immensely wafted silver pear still filling with the shirmering tidal airs channeled up from the blaze silent as a god tilted slumbering above french countryside this delicate linen envelope this swelling sack of ovenbaked air would soon pluck itself free draughting upward to blue worlds of silence his mind and his brothers mind would sail with it muted serene among island clouds where uncivilized lightnings slept into that uncharted gulf and abyss where no birdsong or shout of man could follow the balloon would hush itself so cast adrift he montgolfier and all men might hear the unmeasured breathing of god and the cathedral tread of eternity ah he moved the crowd moved shadowed by the warm balloon everythings ready everythings right right his lips twitched in his dream right hiss whisper flutter rush right from his fathers hands a toy jumped to the ceiling whirled in its own wind suspended while he and his brother stared to see it flicker rustle whistle heard it murmuring their names wright whispering wind sky cloud space wing fly wilbur orville look hows that ah in his sleep his mouth sighed the toy helicopter hummed bumped the ceiling murmured eagle raven sparrow robin hawk murmured eagle raven sparrow robin hawk whispered eagle whispered raven and at last fluttering to their hands with a susurration a wash of blowing weather from summers yet to come with a last whir and exhalation whispered hawk dreaming he smiled he saw the clouds rush down the aegean sky he felt the balloon sway drunkenly its great bulk ready for the clear running wind he felt the sand hiss up the atlantic shelves from the soft dunes that might save him if he a fledgling bird should fall the framework struts hummed and chorded like a harp and himself caught up in its music beyond this room he felt the primed rocket glide on the desert field its firewings folded its firebreath kept held ready to speak for three billion men in a moment he would wake and walk slowly out to that rocket and stand on the rim of the cliff stand cool in the shadow of the warm balloon stand whipped by tidal sands drummed over kitty hawk and sheathe his boys wrists arms hands lingers with golden wings in golden wax and touch for a final time the captured breath of man the warm gasp of awe and wonder siphoned and sewn to lift their dreams and spark the gasoline engine and take his fathers hand and wish him well with his own wings flexed and ready here on the precipice then whirl and jump then cut the cords to free the great balloon then rev the motor prop the plane on air and crack the switch to fire the rocket fuse and together in a single leap swim rush flail jump sail and glide upturned to sun moon stars they would go above atlantic mediterranean over country wilderness city town in gaseous silence riffling feather rattledrum frame in volcanic eruption in timid sputtering roar in start jar hesitation then steady ascension beautifully held wondrously transported they would laugh and cry each his own name to himself or shout the names of others unborn or others longdead and blown away by the wine wind or the salt wind or the silent hush of balloon wind or the wind of chemical fire each feeling the bright feathers stir and bud deepburied and thrusting to burst from their riven shoulder blades each leaving behind the echo of their flying a sound to encircle recircle the earth in the winds and speak again in other years to the sons of the sons of their sons asleep but hearing the restless midnight sky up yet further up higher higher a spring tide a summer flood an unending river of wings a bell rang softly no he whispered ill wake in a moment wait the aegean slid away below the window gone the atlantic dunes the french countryside dissolved down to new mexico desert in his room near his cot stirred no plumes in golden wax outside no windsculpted pear no trapdrum butterfly machine outside only a rocket a combustible dream walting for the friction of his hand to set it off in the last moment of sleep someone asked his name quietly he gave the answer as he had heard it during the hours from midnight on icarus montgolfier wright he repeated it slowly so the questioner might remember the order and spelling down to the last incredible letter icarus montgolfier wright born nine hundred years before christ grammar school paris high school college kitty hawk graduation from earth to moon this day god willing august death and burial with luck on mars summer in the year of our lord then he let himself drift awake moments later crossing the desert tarmac he heard someone shouting again and again and again and if no one was there or if someone was there behind him he could not tell and whether it was one voice or many young or old near or very far away rising or falling whispering or shouting to him all three of his brave new names he could not tell either he did not turn to see for the wind was slowly rising and he let it take hold and blow him all the rest of the way across the desert to the rocket which stood waiting there
