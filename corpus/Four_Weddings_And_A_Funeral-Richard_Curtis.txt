best man the best man has to look after the bridegroom and give him the wedding ring the best man also has to be at the church on time but charles is never punctual he is not even awake yet the alarm clock rings loudly next to his bed he reaches out his hand turns it off and goes back to sleep the wedding is in the west of england which is at least two or three hours by car from london where charles lives some of his other friends are awake though theyll be at the wedding before charles in their large fine house tom and fiona are up and getting ready to go they are brother and sister and they come from a very rich family they are opposite types of people fiona is a tall elegant and clever woman tom is a happy but not very intelligent man tom enjoys his food and hes now eating a large breakfast while fiona chooses what to wear finally she zips herself into a smart dress she goes downstairs to the diningroom and the maid gives her a cup of black coffee she quickly drinks it and they set off its saturday so the traffic is not too bad but they mustnt delay any longer on their way out of london they call for gareth and matthew who live together in an attractive countrystyle house matthew is a cool but kind sympathetic person a scotsman in his thirties gareth is a large fat man of about fortyfive his hair is a little grey but his beard is still black he likes to wear quite elegant but very bright clothes he loves to joke and is often quite rude to other people gareth and matthew are boyfriends late youre late he shouts pointing at his watch but tom and fiona know gareth well and dont take any notice they are not as late as charles though who is still asleep finally the sun shines on to him through the bedroom curtains and he wakes up he takes the alarm clock off the table near his bed and looks at it oh god he says he is really awake this time charles is thirtythree years old goodlooking and always late he jumps out of bed and rushes in to scarletts bedroom charles and scarlett share a flat together they are friends but not lovers her room is a terrible mess there are clothes everywhere he picks up her red alarm clock and puts it under her nose she opens her eyes sleepily oh hell scarlett is twentyfive lively and a real london girl you can hear it in her voice shes certainly not from an upperclass family they hurry to get ready and run out to the car carrying some of their formal wedding clothes with them the car is charless and its very old the engine wont start oh god oh hell says charles right wed better take yours mine says scarlett but it only goes at forty miles an hour charles drives her car so fast along the motorway that it shakes it is a very small red car and its also very old and rusty the engine makes a terrible noise scarlett cant have looked after it very well what road are we looking for asks charles scarlett has a map but she hasnt looked at it yet she picks it up just as they pass a motorway exit sign i hope its not the b charles says when he sees the sign behind him scarlett finds the right place on the map its the b she says proudly damn says charles he suddenly puts his foot on the brake and starts to drive backwards along the motorway there is a lorry coming up fast behind them and there is nearly a terrible accident charles turns the car on to the exit road oh hell and damn he says again it is a beautiful sunny day not long after noon as they arrive at the small church in the peaceful countryside the church bells are ringing and all the other guests are already inside charles and scarlett jump out of the car charles hasnt finished dressing and neither has scarlett they quickly put on the rest of their wedding clothes for charles its a formal suit but scarlett is wearing a bright orange dress with purple around the waist and an orange hat to match charles tries to help her do it up at the back but the zip gets stuck hell hellish hell says charles pulling at the zip damn and hell says scarlett she tries to get his tie straight a very large smart car drives up behind them the bride is coming she gets out of the car in her beautiful white wedding dress one of her bridesmaids helps her they are both holding wonderful bunches of flowers oh no charles says and they begin to run towards the church they smile and wave at the bride as they pass her the church is full of flowers and all the women guests are wearing elegant hats charles and scarlett look around and finally see their friends fiona and tom gareth and matthew they go over to them fiona says to charles there is a sort of greatness in your lateness thanks charles replies i have to work hard at it you know scarlett sits down with them but charles puts a pink flower in the buttonhole of his jacket and walks on up the church to angus the bridegroom who is waiting nervously for his best man sorry sorry says charles theres no excuse i know ill kill myself afterwards if you like it doesnt matter says angus if you hadnt come tom would have taken your place thanks tom youre wonderful what a terrible haircut though charles jokes you havent forgotten the ring have you asks angus the best man is always given the ring to bring to the church no no of course not charles touches his pocket confidently but he is secretly alarmed where is the ring when angus isnt looking he searches for it in his pockets but they are all empty oh god he must have left it at home just then an attractive girl in a large black hat and white jacket walks into the church charles and several other guests turn to look at her late says charles i hate it when people are late hate it this makes angus smile a little and he seems less nervous now then the wedding music starts here we go says charles and angus turns round to look at his bride who is walking up the aisle towards him laura is holding on to her fathers arm and shes wearing a very expensive white wedding dress she has two little bridesmaids and one older bridesmaid a young woman called lydia oh isnt she beautiful breathes scarlett youre blind says fiona sharply she looks like a big white cake dear friends i am so happy to welcome you here today the priest begins the service welcome to our church on this wonderful day for angus and laura but charles is looking around him wondering what to do about the ring when he sees the girl in the black hat he starts to think about other things shes very attractive then he remembers that there is a more urgent problem everyone is singing now he tries to make one of his friends notice him but has no luck at last matthew looks at him charles points at his own ring finger and the pain on his face tells matthew what the problem is please help me charles silently makes the words with his lips matthew whispers to gareth but gareth holds out both hands to show that there is no ring on them he whispers to fiona and to several more friends too none of them is wearing a ring charles will be in big trouble the singing is coming to an end now scarlett is singing very loudly and enthusiastically but not very well matthew interrupts her scarlett whispers matthew she is their last hope she smiles back at him innocently when the priest begins to read the next words of the service matthew nods to charles yes theyve got something ill be back in a moment charles says to the groom who looks alarmed the priest continues to speak do you promise to love her while charles goes down the side of the church to find matthew angus the bridegroom is saying i do matthew hands something to charles and charles looks surprised at what matthew has given him its the best i could do whispers matthew charles rushes back to the front of the church do you have the ring asks the priest when he sees it he is quite surprised too angus puts the ring on to his brides finger it is in the shape of a large brightly coloured plastic heart while the happy couple are signing their names at the back of the church the brides sister and her boyfriend come forwards with a guitar to sing pop music its an old barry manilow song gareth holds his head in his hands then he pretends to shoot himself he is letting everybody know that it is one of the most terrible things he has ever heard at last its time to leave the church when the bride the groom and the guests walk out of the church they look very happy everybody is smiling and chatting charles catches up with the girl in the black hat outside thats a great hat he says thanks i bought it specially she smiles at him he can hear from her accent that shes american now its time for the wedding photos the photographer arranges the bride the groom and the family in groups for the different pictures a little boy spoils one of them when he tries to hide under the big skirts of the brides wedding dress he thinks its funny but the others dont charles and his friends all get together in their own group to chat theres matthew and gareth theres fiona and tom and of course the lively scarlett theres charless brother david too who is deaf and communicates in sign language using his hands and theres also bernard who is toms best friend he is like tom a kind man but not very clever tom enjoyed the wedding and so did bernard i thought it was good very good says tom what did you think oh yes good very good replies bernard scarlett says gareth what an amusing dress purple for the christian church and orange for the wild natural world just like the meaning of the wedding itself dont you think yes thats right says scarlett who doesnt really know what he means does anybody know asks charles who the girl in the black hat is they all look at her she is standing not far away talking to somebodys grandmother her names carrie says fiona shes pretty says charles awful girl says fiona shes american she used to work at vogue the fashion magazine she lives in america now and she only goes out with very smart elegant people so you can forget about her charles fiona is not completely serious its a good thing you told me says charles who knows this thanks the bride and groom leave the guests and get into their car they look very happy people wave at them as the car is being driven away right says gareth its time for the reception the guests have to walk through a farm to get to the reception it is very pretty but tom steps in some cow mess did any of you do this too he asks looking at his shoe typical says fiona only my brother could do that well said tom i might find love at the reception there might be a really nice girl there i dont want to spoil my good luck with a horrible smell he stops to clean his shoe and the others walk on towards the house the bride and groom and their families are standing outside in a line everybody has to shake their hands and congratulate them as they go past i never know what to say says fiona its easy just say you must be very proud matthew advises her thats what everyone says god no says fiona they walk up the line you must be very proud of your daughter says fiona as she shakes the hand of the brides father the reception is being held in a very large and smart tent on the grass at the front of the house it is full of flowers and looks very beautiful the guests are elegant too but in a comfortable not too rich way most of the men are wearing dark suits and a lot of the women have dresses with flowers on them the drinks are being served by waiters and waitresses and at the back of the tent the band is getting ready to play charles pushes through the crowd trying to find carrie but when he finally sees her she is already talking to a goodlooking man the rat says charles he goes back to the drinks table and takes two glasses of wine when he turns round again she is alone he offers her a drink oh hello he says brightly do you want one of these thank you carrie replies charles badly wants to talk to her but he cant think of anything to say ah mmm the situation is rather embarrassing for them both before he can think of something another man joins them this is john who is about thirtyeight but behaves like a man of sixty he is very formal hello charles he says ah hello dear john how are you this is carrie answers carrie for him im delighted to meet you my names john they are all silent for a moment who is going to speak first charles decides to be the first so john hows that lovely girlfriend of yours shes not my girlfriend now he replies stiffly oh dear well dont be sad i heard that she was still seeing old toby de lisle she needed two men you know she is now my wife says john even more stiffly the situation is now even more embarrassing than before excellent excellent says charles very uncomfortably may i congratulate you and is there the sound of little feet yet you know babies and all that no oh well plenty of time for that isnt there excuse me says carrie amused she walks away charles tells himself that he is a fool if he hadnt said those stupid things carrie wouldnt have gone and john wouldnt have been hurt he hits his head against a tree on purpose then tries to say hello to an old lady who is walking past she thinks he is crazy fiona has found a man called gerald to talk to he looks innocent but a bit strange too he is wearing a dark suit and a black pullover what do you do she asks him im studying to be a priest he answers good god says fiona do you do weddings not yet i will do later of course itll make me very nervous i can tell you he laughs uncomfortably thats just like the first time one has sex isnt it fiona says sweetly gerald is even more embarrassed now ah well i suppose so not so much mess though fiona continues but gerald cant reply at all now david has come over to talk to charles his brother charles knows sign language for the deaf very well and has communicated like this with david since they were children how are you doing david asks with his hands do you remember that time when we were playing with the engine on dads motor boat and my leg was almost cut off yes well this is worse somebody has been watching david a pretty girl with long red hair she is wearing a bright yellow hat her name is serena she points at david whos that boy over there in the grey suit she asks matthew his names david matthew answers hes very attractive isnt he she says yes ive always thought so why are they using their hands like that she asks he cant hear hes deaf says matthew oh good heavens silent but very attractive matthew continues and now the father of the bride tells everyone that dinner is being served he asks them to go into the tent and sit down they all find their way to their tables john sits down next to his wife not as happy with her as he was earlier now that he knows about toby de lisle carrie sits next to george another stiff and boring type of man who read a piece from the bible very loudly at the wedding service scarlett sits down next to a complete stranger and gives him a big kiss on the mouth hi my names scarlett dont let me drink too much i get much too friendly charles as best man has to sit on the top table with the family he sits down next to an old man who looks annoyed how do you do my name is charles dont be stupid the old man says angrily charles died twenty years ago well that must be a different charles are you telling me that i dont know my own brother charles can see that the old man is obviously mad no no of course not charles says hurriedly and tries not to have any more conversation with him dinner is served and everybody begins to eat laura the bride is very happy and laughs and talks with everyone near her even angus is smiling which is unusual for him in england it is a custom for the best man to make a speech and at last its time for charles to stand up he hits his glass loudly with a spoon and people stop eating and talking charles is nervous ladies and gentlemen im sorry to take you away from your conversation and the wonderful food but there are a few things that i need to say this is only the second time that i have ever been a best man i hope that i did the job well the first time well the bride and groom are still talking to me unfortunately though theyre not talking to each other but people say that im not guilty yes i did say in my speech that piers the groom had slept with paulas younger sister but paula knew this already she really did she was a bit surprised to hear that he had also slept with her mother but i dont think their violent twoday marriage broke up because of that i really dont think so most people burst out laughing at the joke carrie is one of them and some clap but there are a few straight faces but of course im here today to talk about angus and he has nothing to hide has he well thats what i thought at first people are still laughing as charles becomes serious for a moment id like to say that i do think very highly of people who get married like angus and laura marriage is a big step to take and i know i couldnt do it but i think its wonderful that they can now back to angus and those sheep everybody laughs and claps and then charles asks them to raise their glasses and drink to angus and laura after the formal dinner and speeches its time to dance the band plays and laura and angus as bride and groom are the first to come out on to the dance floor laura enjoys herself and dances in a very lively manner but angus moves stiffly perhaps hes never heard pop music before scarlett and tom dance together they are both enthusiastic dancers scarlett dances wildly and tom very badly but they enjoy themselves enormously gareth is dancing like a madman when i first saw gareth dance matthew tells charles i thought to myself people will be killed lives will be lost but charles is not really concentrating on what matthew is saying he is looking for carrie when he sees her she is already dancing with another man shes pretty isnt she matthew notices that charles is looking at her is it love this may be true but charles is surprised and alarmed to hear matthew say it oh good god no no its the man that shes dancing with i was at school with him im just trying to remember his name but well if one did meet somebody nice at a wedding are there men who could ask a girl to go out with them at once on the same day i mean if there are said matthew theyre not english exactly said charles i mean it usually takes me about three weeks to ask by about nine oclock its getting dark and the bride and groom are almost ready to leave laura has drunk a lot by now and she is enthusiastically kissing some of her distant cousins who she doesnt really know you know that i love you jean dont you she asks almost in tears she puts her arms around jean i love you i love you and mike very much ive never met you before but i love you both i really do dont worry says angus her new husband shes drunk well i hope she is or im in real trouble back in the tent lydia the young woman who was a bridesmaid at the marriage service is sitting with her head in her hands she looks depressed she is still wearing her bridesmaids dress and the flowers around her head hows it going lyds asks bernard awful just awful complains lydia oh dear whats the problem they promised me sex says lydia everybody said it if youre a bridesmaid youll get sex they said all the men will want you youll have to fight them off but has it happened no it hasnt nobody has been near me well look said bernard a little shy now i mean if you like i could dont be stupid bernard im not desperate answers lydia sharply no no of course not sorry i just thought bernard replies hurriedly when the bride and groom are finally ready to get in their car laura throws her bunch of flowers at the guests the person who catches it will be the next person to get married or so people believe scarlett raises her hand to catch it but fails fiona steps out of the way and lydia is the one who catches it the car has a string of tins tied to it and rude things written on it this is the custom at english weddings but when angus and laura open the door a large white sheep jumps out with a bell tied around its neck everybody laughs they all wave and shout goodbye as the happy couple are being driven away they are going on their honeymoon charles is sad though as he goes back into the tent the band is playing love is all around obviously he feels that its not true for him later on his group of friends begin to make their arrangements for the night where are you staying tonight charles asks tom scarlett and i are going to some pub the lucky boat something like that arent we all staying there well no the plan has changed the others are all coming back to my place nansys there you know our lovely old servant shell probably cook us some bacon and eggs when we get there and we could play some games would you like to come too yes excellent thanks very much is there a room for scarlett too oh of course weve got a hundred and thirtyseven rooms actually toms place is his family castle the house in london is not their only home tom asks charles are you the richest man in england oh no no i believe were number seven on the list well the queen comes first obviously and that richard branson man is doing very well with his pop music and his aeroplanes well excellent news im glad that youre coming ill go and tell scarlett suddenly carrie appears next to charles hi says charles surprised i thought youd gone no not yet i was just wondering where are you staying tonight well i was going to stay at some pub the lucky boat boatman carrie tells him the lucky boatman right but now im going to stay with some friends at their house well i say house but its really an enormous castle oh what a shame because im staying at the boatman oh says charles surprised again this is really a perfect invitation but he doesnt reply quickly enough he is unfortunately an englishman well it was nice to meet you though we didnt quite meet says carrie i liked your speech it was great thanks says charles he still finds it hard to say anything and they stand there silently together for a moment im going now carrie says no dont couldnt we meet each other now the evenings just starting they both look around at the tent which is now in quite a mess with bottles and chairs lying on the ground we both know thats a big lie says carrie and she walks away hell says charles the band has stopped playing but the brides sister and boyfriend are back with their guitar only four people are trying to dance now to their music which is not very lively others are kissing and a few really drunk people have fallen asleep one of the pairs that are kissing is bernard and lydia they are kissing very enthusiastically and lydia is quite breathless bernard she cries in surprise i didnt know that it could be like this god says gareth looking around at all the mess he hates the music that is being played what a disaster its time for the castle how about you tom are you drunk can you drive us safely of course of course says tom ive had nothing to drink the whole evening but when he stands up he nearly falls over he must have drunk more than he thinks the group of friends get into toms big car and they drive away through the quiet countryside under the stars theyre trying to sing but theyre finding the high bits quite difficult charles says tom can you stop the car tom brakes suddenly sorry charles apologises i think i will go to the pub but why asks tom ah charles is uncomfortable and doesnt know exactly what to say everyone makes a joke of it no seriously says charles im writing about pubs that have the word boat in their name my book will be the first on the subject do what you like says tom and charles jumps out he is now standing in the dark in the middle of a road somewhere in the countryside he suddenly feels very much alone and how is he going to find this pub hmm an odd decision says charles to himself he sets off in the opposite direction down the dark country road he does manage to find his way to the pub though by the time he arrives it is about one oclock in the morning it seems very quiet in the hotel reception where charles should check in charles is just about to ring the bell on the front desk when he sees carrie she is sitting peacefully in a large comfortable chair hello says charles she looks at him with a question in her eyes but she is smiling too there wasnt enough room for everybody charles lies so you said it was a castle carrie reminds him did i yes thats true it is a castle but its a very small one only one room upstairs and one room downstairs very rare they both enjoy the joke a waiter comes in and asks charles would you like a drink sir charles orders a drink for himself and one for carrie too but when he turns round there is no carrie where has she gone then george walks down the stairs he is the boring man who read loudly in church he is whistling and he seems happy charles understands youre here too says george hello says charles you havent seen carrie have you george is still speaking loudly who asks charles thinking fast carrie american girl lovely legs wedding guest nice smell no sorry answers charles damn i thought i had a good chance with her suddenly carries head appears above the sofa where she has been hiding she makes a terrible face to show that he had no chance with her at all only charles can see fortunately look if you see her could you tell her that im in my room asks george not very pleased yes yes says charles hoping that hell go away quickly but just then the waiter comes back with the two drinks one for you sir he says and one for the one for the road says charles brightly before the waiter can say lady actually i think id like a drink too can i join you yes lovely idea says charles unhappily another drink here and a cigar george calls out to the waiter no lets have a bottle well drink till daylight eh charles charles sits down on the sofa and george on a chair charles knows carrie is behind the sofa she is trying to escape lovely wedding says george yes says charles wondering how he can get away i was at school with anguss brother buffy excellent man though he liked little boys too much still it taught me a few of lifes lessons where do you know the bride and groom from angus and laura oh from university answers charles he is not exactly enjoying the conversation yes yes excellent place i didnt go to university myself though i work in the money markets you know what good are books there not much at all excuse me sir the waiter is back again he has a message for charles your wife asks you to go upstairs at once room twelve she said that you may be too drunk to remember the number my wife asks charles in surprise yes sir the waiter replies oh yes of course my wife charles says as he understands you must be drunk says george you cant even remember whether youve got a wife yes will you excuse me oh yes off you go good luck well i havent got a wife so ill go and look for that katie woman carrie says charles yes thats the one a fine girl i think i might be lucky there upstairs charles knocks on the door of number twelve he is quite nervous carrie opens it hi she says hello im sorry about that no thats fine it was impossible to get rid of him yes perhaps we should just wander about up here for a bit then go back down thats a thought says carrie i dont usually wander but i can wander if i need to do you wander a lot she is gently joking with him no says charles still nervous im not really a wanderer i dont usually wander a lot but well carrie says why dont you come in and wander here a little and then well see she leads him into the room its strange she says the bride and bridegroom didnt kiss in the church where i come from kissing is very popular is it yes i think youre right charles is speaking fast i think english people are probably more shy i always worry continues carrie that i would go too far in the church you know at the place in the marriage service where the groom can kiss the bride i might not stop at kissing how far is too far asks charles coming very close to her oh i dont know she gives him a very small kiss on the cheek that would be all right i think yes says charles that would be fine perhaps its not enough says carrie maybe this would be better she kisses him on the mouth yes but it might be dangerous to go further says charles nervous again then they kiss for a long time that might be too far says charles and this asks carrie it is a few minutes later and they are in bed making love do you think the priest might be a little bit worried about this yes says charles i think he might be they kiss again and spend the night together the pub is in the middle of the countryside it looks very peaceful in the morning carrie gets up first and packs when charles wakes up she is already zipping up her bag her face looks beautiful in the early morning light whats happening asks charles i have to go she answers but where to to america thats a tragedy he says but before i go when are you going to tell everybody carrie asks him tell everybody charles asks in surprise tell them what well youll tell them that were going to get married wont you get married he is alarmed now we slept together last night we made love so that means were getting married doesnt it well yes oh dear we need to think hard about this you know he says unhappily then suddenly he notices shes smiling oh youre joking he says thank god for a moment i thought i was in one of those awful films you know the kind where the woman spends a night with a man and murders him if he wont marry her no says carrie gently were not in one of those films but i think weve both missed a great chance here goodbye she leaves the room and charles lies down in the bed he looks thoughtful and confused chapter two the second wedding you are invited to the wedding of bernard and lydia at noon on august st at the church of st mary of the fields cripplegate london ec it is three months later and charless alarm clock is once again ringing by his bed charles stretches out his hand and turns it off he goes back to sleep again he likes to sleep until noon whenever he can scarlett is still asleep in her untidy bedroom some time later there is a loud shout from charless room he has woken up at last oh hell he jumps out of bed and runs in to scarlett dressed only in his underclothes oh god says scarlett when she looks at her clock they run out of the house before they have finished putting on their formal wedding clothes scarlett is trying to put on a silly pink dress with an enormous skirt but she cant zip it up right she is going to be a bridesmaid car or taxi she asks still running taxi says charles we wont be able to park the car they get to the corner of the street and start looking for a taxi but there isnt one anywhere well maybe the car is a better idea says charles they rush down another street to find scarletts car but when they get there it cant be moved scarlett must have parked it in the wrong place and the wheels have been locked by the police damn they both shout at once they will have to go on foot they run as fast as they can the service will start before we get there charles thinks to himself the skirts of scarletts silly pink dress fly up in the wind and as she runs a piece of the dress falls off charles is going to stop and pick it up but scarlett says leave it nobody will notice they run all the way to the church and as they get near they can hear the bells ringing loudly some of their friends are already there fiona matthew gareth and david sorry im late says charles the traffic was awful they all look at him nobody believes him at all yes well says charles now whos getting married today he reads the wedding card pretending that he doesnt know they all go into the church where the wedding is about to start a young priest comes in looking worried and nervous its father gerald who they met at the last wedding reception hes finished his studying and now hes a real priest today tom is best man he has remembered to bring the rings one each for the bride and groom he takes them out of his pocket and shows them to charles holding them up to his eyes like a pair of glasses charles smiles and waves at him as the wedding music starts the bride and her bridesmaids enter the church the bride of course is lydia who first kissed her bridegroom bernard at the last wedding reception there are four bridesmaids two are little girls and two are women one of them is scarlett as she walks up the aisle everyone can see her bright blue underclothes the piece of her dress that fell off has left a large hole in the back of her dress scarlett is still wearing her sunglasses too she looks quite strange she takes them off just as they reach the priest bernard is standing there by the priest waiting for his bride father gerald begins to read the words of the marriage service unfortunately because he is very nervous he gets some of the words wrong everybody bursts out laughing its his first wedding you see matthew whispers to charles hes a friend of the family ah excellent says charles he finds it very amusing father gerald calls bernard lydia by mistake and when he does get the grooms name right he doesnt know how to say bernards middle name its written st john and spoken as sinjun bernard geoffrey sijjjjjjern delaney says father gerald hurriedly everyone is smiling this is all very entertaining now as the priest speaks the bride and groom have to repeat the same words after him i bernard delaney says father gerald leaving out the st john part now do take you lydia jane hibbott to be my awful wedded wife this is not what he should say at all he is so nervous that hes getting the words mixed up to be my lawful wedded wife bernard says these are the words father gerald should have said thats right thats right says father gerald he doesnt know exactly what hes doing now but somehow they get to the end of the service well done shouts gareth clapping and the others copy him its like being at the theatre and after the service everybody congratulates the priest gerald is very pleased with himself and is smiling too now that its all over the reception is being held in an elegant london hotel the guests seem to be from rich upperclass families all the men are wearing formal wedding coats and the women are in expensive dresses lydia the bride is in an excellent mood she is laughing and kissing the guests as they arrive charles gareth and matthew have already found the drinks they are used to weddings and know exactly what to do do you know what i think about marriage asks gareth two people are in love they live together then suddenly they cant think of anything to say to each other theyre worried what are they going to do then the man has an idea what asks charles theyll get married and then theyve got something to talk about for the rest of their lives so people get married when they cant communicate properly any more is that what youre saying yes thats right tom tom the best man has come to join them hows the speech fine good i think something for everyone yes the jokes will raise a few smiles and there should be a few tears too tom says excellent says gareth its an interesting idea gareth says charles of course theres another idea some people think that weddings are about true love says matthew looking at gareth well thats a thought charles replies lightly but he has listened seriously charles is very confused about love and marriage at the moment the reception is very busy now full of welldressed guests who are drinking and chatting laughing and calling to one another charles is just fetching three more drinks when a voice says hi he turns round its carrie she looks wonderful hello says charles and nearly drops the drinks how are you asks carrie fine fine sorry im so surprised and so pleased to see you dont go back to america please wait here ill be back in two seconds ok ok she smiles he rushes back to the others thats yours and thats yours he says giving them their drinks see you in five hours has something happened asks gareth yes yes this is a great wedding you know but when he finds carrie again things dont go quite as he planned hi you look perfect in fact you probably are perfect how are you im really well charles id like you to meet hamish hamish and i are going to get married this is a horrible shock for charles but he tries to hide it excellent excellent im happy to meet you hamish lovely surprise to find carrie back in this country again hamish is an elegant and confident man of about fifty he is scottish yes well it wasnt easy i had to work hard she didnt want to come at first come on carrie dear i want you to meet james hes waiting for us over there hell think that i cant control you at all if we dont go and find him now he holds out his hand to carrie and she takes it ill see you later she says in a friendly way to charles as she walks away with hamish charles is shocked and very unhappy he is unhappy about carrie of course but why is he so very unhappy he doesnt quite understand himself at the moment he doesnt feel in the mood to join in with the party any more and he sits down alone later matthew comes up to talk to him how are you doing charles matthew asks actually not great says charles not great at all really i dont know whats happening here why am i always at weddings but never getting married what does it mean youre not smart enough says matthew or perhaps it could be because you havent met the right girl ah but is that right charles asks maybe i have met the right girl maybe i meet the right girls all the time maybe its me im the problem oh rubbish says matthew and then its time for dinner everyone has been told to look at a written table plan to find out where they have to sit it has all been organized very carefully come on says matthew youll probably meet your future wife at dinner charles looks at the table plan oh my god he says but doesnt tell matthew why he is so alarmed fiona is already sitting at another table next to an upperclass older woman who is wearing a bright blue dress and a bright blue hat her name is mrs beaumont are you married she asks fiona immediately no fiona answers do you prefer women asks mrs beaumont good god says fiona what made you say that well its a possibility these days isnt it mrs beaumont says and its an interesting one its very boring if you just say oh dear ive never found the right man fiona laughs quite right why be boring thank you says mrs beaumont well fiona continues i have met the right person you see but hes not in love with me until i stop loving him i cant get interested in other men bad luck says her new friend yes isnt it says fiona i did go with another girl once at school but it was only for about fifteen minutes i dont think that really means anything do you charles has now found his table and sits down with two men and four young women who are all attractive and about the same age as him his brother david is there too charles looks very embarrassed and uncomfortable hi says charles to one of the men hello im alistair you know veronica dont you yes says charles very nervous now yes hello vee hi nicki great to see you he can see carrie on another table shes laughing with matthew and gareth charles would much rather be at their table alistair seems to be giving them all a lesson on tea there are about four hundred different kinds of tea and all the fruit teas as well i took veronica out to india at christmas to see the places where they grow it excellent says charles you and veronica went to india together didnt you charles alistair asks thats right charles answers so veronica was once a girlfriend of charless charles was horrible says veronica i was really ill and he just joked all the time i was only trying to make you feel better vee oh youre that veronica says nicki which veronica veronica asks charlie what have you been saying shes worried too now but charles doesnt want to answer the question remember bombay he asks brightly nicki continues when charles and i were going out together so shes another old girlfriend of his he told me about this interesting journey hed taken round india with vomiting veronica yes i think thats right im sure thats what he called her did i really say that asks charles quickly no i dont think so oh come on charles says martha who is old girlfriend number three at the table you could never keep a secret youre hopeless charles is certainly in a horrible mess now martha thats not quite true im sure it is charles says nicki i remember another thing you told me martha continues about a girlfriend that you had called helena her mother liked you too she wanted to go to bed with you you told me that you didnt know what to do would it be rude to refuse her you asked yourself thats right adds nicki you said that they were both as fat as pigs mrs piggy and miss piggy i think perhaps says charles but the three girls are laughing loudly and theyre not listening to him finally the fourth girl who is sitting quietly next to him speaks weve both lost weight since then my mother and i she says taking another chocolate it is a disaster for charles but fortunately its now time for the speeches ah great speeches he says at least they cant talk about him any more until later everyone claps tom as he stands up yes when bernard told me he was getting married to lydia i congratulated him all his other girlfriends were real dogs you see and of course im delighted to see so many of them here this evening it is a terrible speech but tom thinks he is doing well so does gareth he seems to enjoy really awful things camilla is one of them its lovely to see you again camilla she was the first person who bernard wanted to marry she told him to go to hell its lucky for lydia that she did when the dinner and the formal parts of the reception are over charles and his friends are free to meet up again they find some comfortable sofas and sit down together to chat gareth is talking about the wedding dinner for once he is not being rude we had a lovely girl at our table carrie shes going to marry a man called hamish hes very rich and owns half of scotland so how are you he asks charles this is the wedding from hell charles answers old girlfriends everywhere ill probably meet henrietta next thatll really finish the day off for me hello charles a voice says from behind him its henrietta and of course shes also one of charless old girlfriends charles seems to have no luck at all today henrietta is a tall dark girl and she is usually quite attractive but now her face is white and she looks very unhappy charles is feeling bad but henrietta seems to feel even worse hello hen how are you says charles brightly trying to pretend that everything is all right he hopes that she did not hear his last few words she is silent for a moment then she bursts into tears oh hen says charles sympathetically helena jumps up from the sofa in a temper why cant you just leave her alone havent you hurt her enough she leads henrietta away charles gets up excuse me he says to gareth i think i am a walking disaster at the moment i think id better go away and be alone but not everyone is having a bad time david charless brother is talking to serena the pretty girl who was interested in him at the last wedding reception she has been hoping to meet him again and has started to learn sign language so that she can communicate with him she signs her name im serena david smiles sweetly at her hello he signs back im just learning says serena with her hands im probably making lots of mistakes she certainly is she signs tols instead of lots and nistakes instead of mistakes but david doesnt want to correct her he shakes his head and smiles again no perfect perfect he tells her would you like to dance yes that would be nice serena replies they go off together looking very happy charles is in a bedroom upstairs it seems to be empty the door was open but there was nobody inside just a suit hanging up on a cupboard door its dark now but he doesnt turn the light on he goes to the window and looks down on to the street below he just stands there quietly glad to be alone in a calm room but after a minute or two he sees carrie down there shes coming out of the hotel with hamish they have their arms around each other and look very happy they get into a taxi together charles watches them unhappily as they drive off he seems to be very depressed then the door opens and bernard and lydia come in kissing noisily they are so interested in each other that they dont notice charles they are still dressed for the wedding lydia in her brides dress and bernard in his suit this is their room the place where they are going to change into their other clothes before they go away on their honeymoon but theyre not ready to change yet they are about to have sex on the bed charles wonders how he can escape and he begins to try to walk from the window to the door very very quietly then suddenly lydia cries wait a minute this isnt good enough i want to see my lovely husband she turns on the light she is lying on top of bernard she still has her dress on but charles knows whats happening underneath it luckily they dont see charles but he cant get past them to the door then he sees another door nearer to him so he opens it and goes through it as fast as he can oh no its only a kind of very small washroom no more than a cupboard really theres almost no room in it for charles he waits there its very uncomfortable and it seems to him that he has to wait for hours downstairs the other guests are enjoying themselves several of them are dancing to the lively music scarlett is sitting in a strange place like charles upstairs shes under a table with one of the small bridesmaids they are both dancing to the music but only using their hands for the dancing movements have you got a boyfriend scarlett asks the little girl whose name is freda yes says freda whats his name dolph hes good at tabletennis and you no no boyfriend why not i dont know says scarlett a little unhappily when i like men they dont seem to like me they think im stupid then the ones who like me well i think theyre stupid i dont want to go out with them so that doesnt get me anywhere does it upstairs in the bedroom time passes lydia and bernard are still making love very noisily charles is sitting on the basin in the washroom he looks at his watch god are they going to finish soon he wonders if hed known they were going to take so long he wouldnt have hidden there oh i love my wife cries bernard ilovemyhusband screams lydia they finish after a quiet moment or two bernard says wed better go downstairs now i suppose charles nods yes yes he says silently to himself or says lydia we could wait a few minutes and start again no no charles shakes his head inside the cupboard he really cant stay there any longer so he opens the door he walks past lydia and bernard who are still lying on the bed they are amazed and stare at him in great surprise but he pretends that its not strange at all he holds up a pencil as he walks towards the door of the room i found it he says and goes out but his troubles are not over henrietta is outside charles we must talk she says firmly right right he says pleasantly is this a bad dream but he would rather talk to henrietta than stay in the bedroom with bernard and lydia they start walking downstairs together the thing is charlie ive spoken to lots of people about you oh god says charles and everyone agrees that youre in real trouble charles she continues seriously am i he asks you see you have one girlfriend after another but you dont love any of them you never let a woman get close to you at all no no hen its not like that says charles but its no good henrietta continues youre nice to them sweet to them you were sweet to me though you thought i was stupid i didnt yes you did you dont give people a chance whenever you have a new girlfriend you think i mustnt fall in love i mustnt get married hen you know me i dont think like that most of the time well i dont think at all oh charlie henrietta suddenly throws her arms around him the way you used to look at me i thought i thought that you were going to ask me to marry you but you were only thinking about how to leave me oh this is awful she walks away she is very upset charles just stands there he cant move actually he doesnt know what to do then he turns round and sees carrie behind him are you having a good time she asks him oh yes of course wonderful better than my fathers funeral really entertaining charles says i thought youd gone no hamish is going on the night train to edinburgh i just went with him to the station but i am leaving now do you want to come with me so charles and carrie drive off together through the latenight streets of london the taxi takes them to carries flat are you coming up for a drink she asks charles are you sure he asks he looks rather doubtful about the situation yes i think we can take a chance she jokes youre attractive but i can still refuse you no problem youre not so attractive you know charles is not feeling very confident after all the horrible things that have happened today so he doesnt share the joke ok yes great he says without a smile but as soon as they are together in carries flat its like the last time that they met they kiss and become lovers again they are both very happy to be with each other and they spend the night together but carrie is still going to marry hamish charles has left it all too late in the early morning charles gets up first he puts on his formal wedding suit again he doesnt have any other clothes with him he looks at carrie for a long moment and she looks back at him she is very beautiful they seem to be in love and charles doesnt want to go finally he turns and leaves the room quietly what would have happened to the couple if charles hadnt been so confused chapter three a free saturday it is nearly noon on saturday september the st charles is in bed asleep as usual the door opens and scarlett comes in carrying cups and plates and the morning letters good morning charles ive brought us some breakfast sorry the toasts a bit burnt she sits down on the edge of the bed charles wakes up scarlett pours the tea and spreads butter on the toast they eat breakfast together comfortably what are you going to do today she asks him well says charles today is a day without a wedding a free saturday the only thing that i have to do is to meet david i mustnt be late for him he picks up a large white envelope and opens it i think ill look for a job today says scarlett i heard about one the other day as a shop assistant you have to sell strange clothes to strange people i think id be good at it but charles isnt concentrating he is studying the card in the envelope he looks rather upset are you all right scarlett asks him its that girl carrie do you remember the american girl its the invitation to her wedding the invitation also tells guests the address of the shop where they can buy presents for the bride and groom this is another custom for some people in england it seems that charles is still going to spend his time today on weddings the shop is horribly expensive there are handmade carpets there is furniture from different parts of the world and the place is full of all kinds of unusual and beautiful things the shop assistant is also very elegant she looks down her nose at charles who is wearing an old shirt with his shorts and running shoes he doesnt look at all smart excuse me he asks her do you have the wedding list for banks hamish and carrie banks carrie banks is what carrie will be called after her marriage to hamish the assistant looks at charles with dislike certainly sir i can show you plenty of presents for about one thousand pounds ah says charles who is amazed but is trying not to show it what about presents for fifty pounds you can buy this one says the assistant she points to a lifesize wooden african man this says charles excellent you can buy it the assistant says nastily if you can find someone to pay the other three thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds charles smiles he is still being very polite and trying to look calm or we sell plastic bags for one pound fifty pence each she continues why dont you just buy thirtythree of them actually i think ill probably leave it thanks very much youve been very he was going to say helpful but it wouldnt be true as he turns round to go out of the shop carrie walks in what did you get she asks him smiling she looks very happy oh nothing nothing yet ive just been looking says charles it is once again a surprise to meet her he is always delighted to see her but he never knows what to say its nice to see you she says its nice to see you says charles its great getting presents says carrie she laughs why didnt i get married years ago has anybody bought the wooden african yet she asks the assistant the young man is thinking about it says the assistant icily polite charles nods thoughtfully trying to look as if this is a serious idea oh no says carrie who is quick to understand get me something small a teapot or something are you free for about half an hour yes i have to meet my brother but i can be a little bit late its a lie david will be annoyed if charles is late but he doesnt want to miss the chance to spend some time with carrie good she says come with me ive got to make an important decision she takes charles off to the dress shop where she plans to choose her wedding dress the most important thing she says is please dont laugh ok right says charles seriously the assistant brings dress after dress carrie takes each one away and tries it on each time when shes ready she comes out and shows charles the first dress is very complicated with full skirts what do you think she asks him lovely says charles isnt it a bit like a cake she asks him well says charles dont worry says carrie i thought so too but weve only just begun she comes out next in a very modern style of dress actually it is not really a dress at all its a suit with trousers a long open coat and a very small top sexy what do you think this time asks carrie youre joking says charles but its wonderful isnt it maybe next time the next dress is long in a country girl style like an old eighteenthcentury picture it is quite sweet but not right for carrie what do you think she asks again ah says charles i knew it she says smiling and goes behind the curtain to take it off then she comes out in a very simple but very sexy dress its a bit sexy she says if i was your husband id be so proud says charles and he means it but maybe youre right you dont want the priest to get too excited after carrie has chosen her dress they go to a cafe together to drink tea it has started to rain now marriage is strange says charles just one man and one woman no more lovers ever do you think youll stay faithful yes once im married carrie replies i told hamish that i would kill him if he goes with another woman so id better do the same i think and leave other men alone quite right says charles and ive had plenty of lovers in my life she continues have you asks charles surprised how many is plenty well oh i dont know says carrie a little bit embarrassed more than one tell me says charles there are no secrets between us now ive seen the wedding dress remember well says carrie and she starts to count on her fingers the first one of course you never forget it was nice number two he had too much hair on his back three four five number six was on my birthday in my parents bedroom which birthday asks charles quickly my seventeenth she answers seventeen you got to number six by your seventeenth birthday i grew up in the country its different there she says ok seven was good eight rather small that was a shock nine we were standing up against a gate never try it charles its very uncomfortable i wont he promises her seriously ten was wonderful really like heaven i hate him says charles eleven no good numbers twelve to seventeen were during my university years they were all nice intelligent boys but the sex wasnt much good eighteen broke my heart i couldnt forget him for years afterwards im sorry charles says i dont remember number nineteen but my girlfriend says that it did happen twice she shared my room so she should know twenty are we really at twenty god twentyone horrible i dont want to talk about him twentytwo well he was always falling asleep that was my first year in england i must apologize for england and englishmen says charles twentythree and twentyfour were together i wont forget that seriously asks charles but she wont answer him he is not sure how much of this is serious at all twentyfive was a lovely frenchman twentysix was an awful frenchman twentyseven was a mistake suddenly at number twentyseven you made a mistake asks charles can this really be true he kept on screaming says carrie simply i nearly gave up sex after that but spencer changed my mind for me he was number twentyeight then there was his father number twentynine spencers father charles repeats then thirty horrible thirtyone oh my god thirtytwo she pauses thirtytwo was lovely and then theres hamish number thirtythree so i was after hamish asks charles he really wants to know now no you were thirtytwo replies carrie and charles thinks about this thats it then says carrie less than madonna more than princess diana i hope what about you how many people have you slept with not as many as you charles answers i probably dont have enough time what do i do with my time actually i dont really know i work yes thats it work work and more work im always working late carrie laughs and suddenly they both stop talking there is a very serious silent moment something has happened and they both feel it i wish id phoned you says charles but you didnt ring me then he looks at his watch oh hell help me please im late again when they reach the cinema david is still waiting outside if it hadnt been his brother he would have probably have left by now charles is very very late david signs to him youre not my brother any more youre just some stupid fool that i once met carrie this is david my brother says charles this is carrie he signs hi says carrie we were buying a wedding dress for her charles signs thats a really poor excuse david replies whos she marrying they can now have a secret conversation because carrie doesnt understand sign language a real fool says charles how does a fool find a beautiful wife like her asks david carrie is waiting for a translation yes im just telling david that youre marrying hamish what a lucky man he said to me didnt you make love to her once asks david fortunately carrie still cant understand he wants to know where you are getting married charles pretends to translate in scotland carrie answers shes got lovely breasts says david and uses his hands to describe them oh lovely hills up there in scotland he says charles translates quickly why dont you come to the wedding carrie asks david id like some nice friends to come hamish is going to invite some awful people well youd better go in and see the film goodbye the brothers watch her as she walks away charles and david go into the cinema but suddenly charles changes his mind oh hell he says he runs out of the cinema and chases carrie up the steps david is left alone at the entrance to the cinema charles catches up with carrie by the river carrie sorry sorry oh this is stupid youve just bought your wedding dress but i wondered if there was any chance no obviously not ive only slept with nine women so why am i asking silly questions but i just wondered i really feel well let me say it more clearly like the man in the song or was it the man on television i think i love you would you perhaps like to no no of course not im a fool and he isnt excellent excellent lovely to see you must go now he turns to leave then adds damn that was very sweet says carrie she is smiling at him and looks very affectionate well i thought about it a lot you know i wanted to get it just right its important that ive said it what have you said exactly asks carrie i said that i think oh you know what i said charles is finding this very difficult youre lovely says carrie and kisses him for a minute they stand close together then carrie walks away she looks back at him one last time chapter four the third wedding you are invited to the wedding of hamish and carrie on september th in the church at glenthrist castle perthshire scotland it is already a cold wet autumn in scotland by the time of hamish and carries wedding the mountains and lakes look very beautiful but also very gloomy and grey charles arrives late as usual and tries to change quickly out of the warm heavy clothes that he put on for the journey he takes off his pullover and puts on his wedding coat before he steps out of the car the wedding is in the little church that belongs to hamishs castle the door of the church makes a loud noise as charles opens it sorry sorry he whispers everybody turns round to see whos there the little church looks charming the service has begun and carrie is standing with hamish and the priest at the front she looks lovely too serious but beautiful the priest asks hamish whether he will take carrie for his wife i do says hamish he asks carrie whether she is willing to take hamish for her husband i do answers carrie damn damn damn it to hell whispers charles as violently as he dares his last hope has disappeared the reception is in the fine castle that hamish owns as the guests walk there from the church they can hear special scottish music being played when they arrive they are welcomed by servants who are wearing formal scottish uniforms among the guests many of the men are wearing scottishstyle clothes too and some of the ladies are also dressed in the scottish style the bride the groom and the family are standing in a line the guests shake hands with them as they come in carrie is standing at the end of the line next to hamish charles congratulates carrie you look beautiful he says as he shakes her hand there is some lively scottish dancing in the middle of the room oh great says gareth its like one of those films its so scottish that it cant possibly be true he joins in the dancing enthusiastically dear friends he says a little later when his usual group of friends is standing together at the edge of the room none of us is married you know i was always proud of that not a wedding ring between us but now im getting older and its suddenly begun to make me sad id like to go to the wedding of someone who i really love well dont blame me says tom ive asked everybody that i know to marry me you havent asked me says scarlett a little sadly havent i asks tom in surprise no she shakes her head well scarlett would you like to marry me no thank you tom it was very nice of you to ask me well any time you like says tom kindly good man tom shouts gareth now why dont the rest of you do the same go and find husbands and wives for yourselves those are your orders for tonight but first well all drink to true love what about you fi tom asks his sister can you see a husband here oh get lost tom replies fiona true love they all raise their glasses tom takes the idea seriously he tries to talk to a pretty woman a lot of people actually meet their husbands and wives at weddings did you know that yes i met my husband at a wedding she answers him oh oh well says tom and drinks the rest of his wine very quickly look at that my glass is empty excuse me scarlett seems to be having better luck the person she is talking to is probably the bestlooking man at the wedding and hes not wearing scottish clothes hes american hello my names scarlett like scarlett ohara in gone with the wind but im much less trouble than she was whats your name my names rhett says the american no from the same story not really no not really he smiles my names chester youre a joker scarlett laughs when i meet americans i always think that theyre going to be boring but of course youre not boring are you youre lovely scarlett has to look up a long way when she talks to chester he is very tall and she is short it looks quite funny charles is hiding from henrietta but she soon finds him oh hi hen sorry i didnt come to talk to you because i really dont want an argument today im sure that weve got lots to talk about but not today hen not today did i behave badly last time henrietta asks it was quite frightening says charles like a murder film henrietta laughs she is in a good mood charles decides that hes safe with her today and so he goes on talking to her oh hen im depressed says charles what about you how are you well im quite happy actually she says ive got a new boyfriend and my weights down to almost nothing perhaps you were right hen says charles perhaps we should have got married god no says henrietta i dont want to marry your friends too specially fiona fiona loves you says charles fiona calls me duckface says henrietta ive never heard that says charles henrietta knows that hes lying come to lunch sometime she says give me a ring she gives him a gentle kiss on the cheek as she walks away fiona comes up to charles hows duck face she asks shes fine actually says charles not too mad at the moment ladies and gentleman says the best man the bride and groom hamish and carrie dance together in the middle of the room its a formal scottish dance and everybody claps them charles and fiona watch the happy couple with the other guests fiona puts her hand on charless shoulder and looks at him she can see that he looks sad you like this girl dont you charles asks fiona yes its a strange thing this love business when at last it happens and now shes marrying another man answers charles but what about you fifi have you met your future husband here no and i wont its not like that ive been in love with the same man for years have you charles asks in surprise whos that you charlie says fiona very lightly charles stops smiling he looks shocked fiona walks away and goes into a quieter room charles follows her it was always you ever since we first met says fiona i knew that from the first moment i saw you across a crowded room you know what they say but it doesnt matter we cant do anything about it thats life and were friends friends isnt bad you know its quite good really charles is upset and he feels her pain a few months ago he didnt know love but now he knows how it feels he is deeply sorry for her and takes her hand oh fi its not easy is it no but forget it it cant happen between us charlie just then matthew comes in fiona pretends that nothing has happened matthew dear she says brightly wheres gareth hes being rude to americans matthew answers how thoughtful of him gareth is dancing with an american woman she looks surprised as he turns her round fast and jumps about quite violently tom is dancing too and looking hopefully at every girl in the room he clearly hasnt found his future wife yet when its time for the speeches gareth comes back over to his friends very hot ladies and gentlemen fill your glasses please says the best man unusually the bride will make the first speech excellent says gareth i love this girl he looks at charles he knows about charless feelings for carrie now thank you says carrie as everybody claps her and thank you to those people whove flown in from the united states congratulations to the rest of you you came here even though you knew that all these terrible americans were coming too people laugh and charles looks at carrie with love my dear dad should be the one to give this speech but sadly hes not alive today if he was here i know what he would say lovely dress girl but why the hell are you marrying a man in a skirt they laugh again though hamish is not very pleased with this joke about scottish clothes my answer is carrie continues because i love him as john lennon said love is the answer and we all know that the guests clap loudly charles cant believe that he has been so stupid why did he let her go if he hadnt been so slow he would have been the groom here today oh one more thing says carrie someone here said that if things didnt go well with hamish he would be ready to take his place well thank you and ill let you know it is a very cheeky thing to say but hamish laughs loudly he begins to make his speech now very confidently hamish is not selfconscious he has had years of practice in public speaking suddenly there is a loud noise a kind of crash at the back oh dear someone doesnt agree with me he jokes no problem im used to that but the crash was gareth falling unconscious to the floor charles david and tom get to him quickly find a doctor says charles urgently while hamish is still speaking a doctor is found among the wedding guests he gives gareth a quick examination then they carry him into a quieter room and put him down gently on the ground charles is on his knees holding gareths head but its too late gareth is dead then he decides that he must find matthew quickly among the crowd of guests charles sees matthew and walks towards him just before he reaches him he stops its a hard moment then he moves forward takes matthews arm and whispers to him as he tells him about gareth they can hear the guests behind them begin to sing chapter five a funeral it is the day of gareths funeral it takes place in the town where gareths parents live a small and dirty town full of factories gareth didnt come from a rich family it is raining and grey and everyone looks very sad it is a big contrast to the three wonderful weddings matthew and gareths family are driven to the church in a large black car in front of them is the car with gareths coffin charles arrives at the church and sits down next to fiona putting his arm around her carrie is there too quiet and whitefaced at the back the atmosphere is very different from the atmosphere at the weddings everybody is wearing dark clothes and nobody is talking good morning the priest welcomes everybody welcome to you all on this cold day our service will begin in a few minutes but first weve asked gareths closest friend matthew to say a few words matthew steps forward and stands near the coffin it has beautiful flowers on it gareth preferred funerals to weddings one day i shall probably have a funeral he said but a wedding never people smile and begin to feel a little bit more comfortable i rang a few people and asked them about gareth what did they think about him what comes into their minds when they hear his name well a lot of people said fat and a lot more said terribly rude so very fat and very rude was the way that strangers described gareth but then some of you here rang me and said that you loved him you remember visiting gareth and how kind he was to his guests you remember what an adventurous cook he was fortunately the secrets of some of his dishes like duck with banana are lost for ever gareth really loved life i hope you will remember him specially for that how do i remember him i cant find the words im sorry so ive taken the words of that wonderful writer w h auden this is what i really want to say he reads from a book he was my north my south my east and west my working week and my sunday rest my noon my midnight my talk my song i thought that love would last for ever i was wrong after the service people meet and talk outside it was a very emotional funeral and everybody looks very sad the car with gareths coffin is driven away charles finds carrie its good of you to come he says but didnt it spoil your honeymoon oh it doesnt matter says carrie well do it another time you know that thing you said in the street yes im sorry about that charles says quickly no dont be sorry i liked it im glad that you said it she kisses him gently on the cheek then walks away he watches her would you like a walk charlie asks tom yes good idea ive never felt like that says tom not like matthew not that kind of love well i felt something for jilly when i was young jilly asks charles surprised our family dog tom explains yes says charles its strange isnt it weve all been friends for years and we never noticed that matthew and gareth were really married in their own way they have reached the river but it is not an attractive place there are factories all along the banks everything looks cold and gloomy charles is holding an umbrella as it is still raining its hardest for his parents says tom i hope i die before my children youre very confident that youll get married says charles but should we get married at all if we cant find the right person we saw today at the service that there can be a perfect marriage and if we cant be like gareth and matthew perhaps we should just forget the idea some of us wont get married at all i dont know charlie says tom thoughtfully i dont hope for the perfect marriage im not looking for thunder and lightning i just want a nice friendly girl who likes me too then well get married and be happy it worked for my parents well it did for years until they separated then i give you six months at the most tom replies charles you wont have to wait any longer than that itll happen before then youll see and maybe youre right maybe waiting for true love is quite useless chapter six the fourth wedding you are invited to the wedding of charles and on july th at st julians church smithfield london ec its charless wedding day but even now hes not awake his male friends gave him a special party last night and everybody drank too much the alarm clock rings charles turns it off he gets ready to go back to sleep again but then another bell rings and another what the hells happening he asks he looks around the room there are twenty or thirty alarm clocks in there with him tom has been sleeping next to him i decided that we mustnt be late he says brightly i like your hairstyle excellent for a wedding charless hair is a total mess he gets out of bed and goes into the kitchen still in his underwear matthew is already there hes going to be charless best man unlike charles he looks very smart matthew great says charles sleepily listen thanks for doing this today i wish gareth was here he knows what a hard time matthew has had recently hed like to be here too says matthew sorry were so late the others are just parking the car we thought that we could all go in toms car because its so big late is it so late asks charles yesits nine fortyfive charles cant believe it only fortyfive minutes until you say i do oh god i wanted the alarm to ring at eight oclock i told tom oh hell now scarlett comes in still in her nightdress her hair looks terrible too and she is yawning scarlett matthew says are you ready oh yes yes she answers sleepily just give me twenty seconds and she makes herself a cup of coffee they drive as fast as they can to the church charles is still putting on his tie when he gets out of the car whats the time he asks urgently honestly asks matthew you really want to know yes tell me please well says matthew its about ten to nine charles keeps on running towards the church then suddenly he realizes what matthew said you rats he shouts his friends all start laughing they changed the time on all those clocks if they hadnt played this joke charles would have been late for his own wedding theyve got plenty of time now so they get some coffee and drink it outside on the grass fiona decides to make a speech ill just say a little word she begins ive watched charless girlfriends come and go for years now i was worried that he would never get married but now everythings going to be fine unfortunately his bride is quite crazy but perhaps thats why he loves her so lets drink to charles and his beautiful girl on this sad day be happy and dont forget us thank you says charles to charles and duckface they raise their plastic coffee cups and drink thank you fiona for those few kind words about my future wife charles replies shes sent a message for you too charles pulls out a piece of paper and reads or pretends to read from it if any of you come near my house ill send the dogs out to get you everyone laughs and they set off for the church today perhaps for the first time ever charles wont be late john is one of the first guests to arrive hes the man whose wife was still seeing toby de lisle and hes actually henriettas brother hope my sister arrives he says to charles you cant have a wedding without a bride you know and why didnt you have a party last night oh but we did we did we didnt think it was a good idea says charles hurriedly john of course was not invited to the party you look lovely today fi charles says to fiona as they enter the church together shes wearing a smart jacket of red blue and other colours yes she replies i decided that i wouldnt wear black any more usually fiona chooses black or dark colours for her clothes from now on im going to wear bright colours and find somebody wholl fall in love with me thatll be different wont it youre a dear girl says charles and gives her a friendly kiss charles stays alone in the church he walks around and looks rather uncomfortable and nervous he doesnt look as happy as bridegrooms usually look on their wedding day outside the church scarlett and matthew are welcoming the guests as usual scarlett is wearing something strange this time its a formal wedding suit but made in a mans style it looks quite sweet on her but a little bit odd suddenly she screams chester has come her tall charming american from carrie and hamishs wedding she is delighted i thought that youd gone back to america she says excitedly without you he asks never and he gives her a big kiss an old man appears at the door its the crazy man who sat next to charles at the first wedding bride or groom matthew asks him so that he can show him where to sit the old man looks at him angrily im neither he says cant you see tom is looking after a young lady called deirdre bride or groom he asks her bride she says she looks like a nice girl very gentle and pretty but for tom its something more its love at first sight havent we met before he asks her yes we have about twentyfive years ago were cousins well distant cousins she smiles at him youre tom arent you so youre family wonderful well do sit here deirdre he says good god he tells himself as he walks away thunder and lightning charles is even more nervous now as he sees all the guests coming in good luck says the priest passing by lydia and bernard arrive together and charles goes over to welcome them how are you he asks very tired actually says bernard then charles suddenly sees carrie who has come alone he didnt have any idea that she was coming shes looking elegant but she seems to be in a quiet mood and a little sad hi he says you look lovely but then you always look nice at weddings she smiles at him hows hamish he asks oh hes fine i think she says you think asks charles surprised what do you mean he wasnt the right man for me after all she says youve left him we left each other she tells him she looks quite weak and charles leads her to a quiet place at the side of the church where they can talk when did this happen he asks her oh a few months ago march was hell but by april wed made all the decisions and it was ok i wont marry someone so old again she tries to turn it into a joke but obviously she is not very happy charlie calls matthew time to go yes yes im coming says charles not really listening to him but why didnt you ring me up well i thought about it carrie replies and i wanted to but things were so difficult then youd better go now ill see you later ill show you to your seat charles says we just didnt get it right did we if only wed been together at the right time yes we got it wrong carrie says sadly terrible awful says charles and he means it but its so lovely to see you well good luck says carrie finally its very easy you know getting married you just say i do whenever anyone asks you a question wed better go to the front matthew tells charles can you give me a moment matthew charles asks him of course says matthew who thinks that charles wants to go to the toilet but charles is no longer in the right mood for his wedding he goes into an empty side room and says dear god please forgive me for what i am going to say in your church damn damn damn and hell can i help you asks a sympathetic voice a priest steps out from behind a curtain in the same room where he was washing his hands it seems that the room was not empty oh no thanks says charles embarrassed i was doing some exercises you know for my voice this is a big church excellent i often do the same myself i use rather different words of course ill leave you alone now charles still cannot come back out into the church and tom and matthew are getting worried the brides arriving now says matthew a large black car has driven up to the church and henrietta gets out with her father she is dressed finely for the wedding in white with flowers in her hair well thats great says tom because weve lost the groom try to keep her outside for a bit says matthew ill go and look for charles matthew says charles brightly when he sees his best man he is very unhappy good to see you tell me what do you think about marriage well says matthew uncertain how to answer this i think that its really good if you love the other person with all your heart exactly says charles but ive been to so many weddings and now its my own wedding day and im still thinking what are you thinking about can i ask no no better not says charles tom is now standing at the church door talking to henrietta and her father im terribly sorry he says the service will be a few minutes late theres a problem with the flowers with the flowers asks henrietta what problem she clearly doesnt want any problems on her wellplanned wedding day henrietta gets annoyed very easily well says tom thinking hard they are making some people ill so we have to move them henrietta and her father look angry but they wait at the door people in the church are getting restless now too theyre wondering whats happening the bride must have arrived by now where is the groom i think they believed me tom tells scarlett he is pleased with himself people think im stupid you see so they dont realize that i can tell a clever lie david has now joined matthew and charles in the side room charles still wont go back into the church he is too unhappy and confused david hits the table to make a noise so that charles will notice him whats happening tell me he signs oh god charles signs back i just saw carrie she and hamish have separated charles its your wedding day david tells him whats your advice charles asks well you can do one of three things number one just get married as youve planned charles nods number two you can go back and say sorry no wedding today david continues i dont like that idea says charles whats number three number three signs david well i cant think what that is hell says charles there is a knock on the door and the priest comes in hello he says smiling are you ready to meet the enemy are we asks matthew its not really a joke at all everyone looks at charles yes says charles excellent he tries not to look at carrie as he walks to the front of the church and sits down the wedding music starts and charles and matthew stand up together the doors at the back open and henrietta proud and beautiful walks down the aisle with her father she pulls at her fathers arm she is annoyed with him dont hold me so tightly dad she whispers angrily the priest begins to read aloud the words of the wedding service as charles listens to the priests words he looks confused and worried the priest asks whether anyone thinks that charles and henrietta should not get married the question is in the wedding service because that is the law if either the bride or the groom is already married for example then someone may say that they are breaking the law usually of course no one answers the question but this time there is a loud noise david is knocking on his wooden church seat im sorry does someone want to speak the priest asks very surprised david puts up his hand yes what is it david of course cant speak aloud so he begins to sign to charles one second says charles as he signs back whats going on i thought of idea number three david tells him what will you translate translate what whats happening charles asks the priest charles what asks his bride he wants me to translate what hes saying says charles and what is he saying asks the priest he says i suspect that the groom is having doubts i suspect that he would like to delay the wedding i suspect that the groom really loves another woman signs david charles does not translate this its true isnt it charles think about it because its for the rest of your life charles its final so you must only marry the person who you love with all your heart and your trousers are undone it is a kind of joke but charles looks down at the zip on his trousers he is totally confused whats he saying asks the priest he suspects that the groom loves another woman answers charles and do you do you charles charles is silent for a moment everybody in the church looks shocked they are all staring at charles henrietta is staring at charles too she cant believe this is happening i do he replies in the words of the wedding service suddenly henrietta screams she throws down her flowers and hits charles hard in the eye he falls over and she hits and kicks him again she has really lost her temper this time she is very very angry and maybe a little crazy too some people rush to the front of the church to help charles other people try to stop henrietta attacking him the situation gets very confused the wedding is certainly not going to happen today back in charless kitchen later that afternoon everyone is still shocked outside it is pouring with rain and the thunder crashes in the sky my god says scarlett for once she doesnt really know what to say well says tom trying to be helpful at least we wont forget this wedding i mean a lot of weddings are the same arent they afterwards you cant remember them at all but this one was really different yes it didnt have a wedding service says matthew in a dry voice charles doesnt say anything he has a black eye poor girl says fiona no i really mean it poor girl ok shes not my favourite person in the world but youve done a terrible thing charles i think its quite unforgivable charles is shocked too he cant quite believe that he did this poor hen he says i dont even want to think about it its so awful but if you werent sure that you wanted to marry her on your wedding day then it was probably the right decision wasnt it tom asks usually fiona is rude about everything that tom says but now she simply says youre right tom and touches his cheek lovingly its a lovely dress says scarlett im sure itll be useful for parties i blame myself signs david what did he say asks matthew he says that he blames himself charles translates no shouts everyone together no you mustnt do that david yes they blame you too charles unkindly tells his brother the doorbell rings and everyone gets up no says charles ill answer it if theres a problem its my problem but its carrie at the door its pouring with rain and shes very wet hello she says hi god youre wet says charles come in no no im fine she replies im so wet that i cant get any wetter do you know what i mean she smiles at him but shes also very serious ok then ill come out charles says no please dont says carrie i just wanted to see if you were all right i wanted to make sure that you werent killing yourself or anything but charles steps out and joins her in the rain they stand together on the pavement and after a few seconds he is completely wet too it was wrong of me to come to the church this morning im sorry i can see that youre ok so id better go now no wait im to blame not you says charles i behaved really badly today but im sure about one thing now marriage is not right for me at all and i learnt another thing when i was standing there in the church i realized for the first time that i totally completely love one person with all my heart and that person wasnt my bride its the person whos here with me now in the rain is it still raining asks carrie i didnt notice in fact ive loved you since the first minute i saw you youre not suddenly going away again are you he asks in alarm no i might be washed away by the rain but im not going away again ok ok well go back in says charles but first can i ask you one thing do you think do you think that you could agree not to marry me after weve got dry again of course and after weve spent lots of time together do you think that you could agree not to be married to me for the rest of your life carrie looks at him her eyes very serious now do you he asks her i do she answers in the words of the wedding service they kiss and above in the stormy skies of london there is thunder and lightning for charles too and how does the future go well if we move forwards in time and take some more photos we see something like this a picture of henrietta at her wedding shes forgotten all about charles now shes marrying a handsome soldier hes wearing a uniform with a red jacket and shes laughing as they leave the church and heres a picture of charless brother david marrying serena they both look very sweet a good couple what about scarlett yes heres a picture of her shes getting married to chester her big american shes wearing something different as usual a white cowgirl hat theres a picture of tom and deirdre too taken at their wedding reception theyre outside toms enormous house toms black dog is in the photo too and deirdre is wearing the country girl wedding dress that carrie refused to buy heres one of matthew looking happy again hes found a new boyfriend hes younger than gareth about the same age as matthew theyre at a party together its good that matthew can leave all his old sadness behind and fiona whos she with well it seems to be prince charles theyre not exactly married yet but shes out with him in public he looks serious as usual but shes wearing an enormous pink hat and has got a big smile on her face charles and carrie are still not married at least there are no wedding photos so they cant have got married they must have kept their promise but they do have a baby a lovely little boy in our photo charles is pointing at the camera and carrie is smiling we can see that theyre very happy together and that theyre getting on fine without the sound of wedding bells the end
