walter besant the tree of knowledge henry james elizabeth gaskell the manchester marriage household words christmas mr and mrs openshaw came from manchester to settle in london he had been what is called in lancashire a salesman for a large manufacturing firm who were extending their business and opening a warehouse in the city where mr openshaw was now to superintend their affairs he rather enjoyed the change having a kind of curiosity about london which he had never yet been able to gratify in his brief visits to the metropolis at the same time he had an odd shrewd contempt for the inhabitants whom he always pictured to himself as fine lazy people caring nothing but for fashion and aristocracy and lounging away their days in bond street and such places ruining good english and ready in their turn to despise him as a provincial the hours that the men of business kept in the city scandalized him too accustomed as he was to the early dinners of manchester folk and the consequently far longer evenings still he was pleased to go to london though he would not for the world have confessed it even to himself and always spoke of the step to his friends as one demanded of him by the interests of his employers and sweetened to him by a considerable increase of salary this indeed was so liberal that he might have been justified in taking a much larger house than the one he did had he not thought himself bound to set an example to londoners of how little a manchester man of business cared for show inside however he furnished it with an unusual degree of comfort and in the wintertime he insisted on keeping up as large fires as the grates would allow in every room where the temperature was in the least chilly moreover his northern sense of hospitality was such that if he were at home he could hardly suffer a visitor to leave the house without forcing meat and drink upon him every servant in the house was well warmed well fed and kindly treated for their master scorned all petty saving in aught that conduced to comfort while he amused himself by following out all his accustomed habits and individual ways in defiance of what any of his new neighbours might think his wife was a pretty gentle woman of suitable age and character he was fortytwo she thirtyfive he was loud and decided she soft and yielding they had two children or rather i should say she had two for the elder a girl of eleven was mrs openshaws child by frank wilson her first husband the younger was a little boy edwin who could just prattle and to whom his father delighted to speak in the broadest and most unintelligible lancashire dialect in order to keep up what he called the true saxon accent mrs openshaws christian name was alice and her first husband had been her own cousin she was the orphan niece of a seacaptain in liverpool a quiet grave little creature of great personal attraction when she was fifteen or sixteen with regular features and a blooming complexion but she was very shy and believed herself to be very stupid and awkward and was frequently scolded by her aunt her own uncles second wife so when her cousin frank wilson came home from a long absence at sea and first was kind and protective to her secondly attentive and thirdly desperately in love with her she hardly knew how to be grateful enough to him it is true she would have preferred his remaining in the first or second stages of behaviour for his violent love puzzled and frightened her her uncle neither helped nor hindered the love affair though it was going on under his own eyes franks stepmother had such a variable temper that there was no knowing whether what she liked one day she would like the next or not at length she went to such extremes of crossness that alice was only too glad to shut her eyes and rush blindly at the chance of escape from domestic tyranny offered her by a marriage with her cousin and liking him better than any one in the world except her uncle who was at this time at sea she went off one morning and was married to him her only bridesmaid being the housemaid at her aunts the consequence was that frank and his wife went into lodgings and mrs wilson refused to see them and turned away norah the warmhearted housemaid whom they accordingly took into their service when captain wilson returned from his voyage he was very cordial with the young couple and spent many an evening at their lodgings smoking his pipe and sipping his grog but he told them for quietness sake he could not ask them to his own house for his wife was bitter against them they were not however very unhappy about this the seed of future unhappiness lay rather in franks vehement passionate disposition which led him to resent his wifes shyness and want of demonstrativeness as failures in conjugal duty he was already tormenting himself and her too in a slighter degree by apprehensions and imaginations of what might befall her during his approaching absence at sea at last he went to his father and urged him to insist upon alices being once more received under his roof the more especially as there was now a prospect of her confinement while her husband was away on his voyage captain wilson was as he himself expressed it breaking up and unwilling to undergo the excitement of a scene yet he felt that what his son said was true so he went to his wife and before frank set sail he had the comfort of seeing his wife installed in her old little garret in his fathers house to have placed her in the one best spare room was a step beyond mrs wilsons powers of submission or generosity the worst part about it however was that the faithful norah had to be dismissed her place as housemaid had been filled up and even if it had not she had forfeited mrs wilsons good opinion for ever she comforted her young master and mistress by pleasant prophecies of the time when they would have a household of their own of which whatever service she might be in meanwhile she should be sure to form a part almost the last action frank did before setting sail was going with alice to see norah once more at her mothers house and then he went away alices fatherinlaw grew more and more feeble as winter advanced she was of great use to her stepmother in nursing and amusing him and although there was anxiety enough in the household there was perhaps more of peace than there had been for years for mrs wilson had not a bad heart and was softened by the visible approach of death to one whom she loved and touched by the lonely condition of the young creature expecting her first confinement in her husbands absence to this relenting mood norah owed the permission to come and nurse alice when her baby was born and to remain and attend on captain wilson before one letter had been received from frank who had sailed for the east indies and china his father died alice was always glad to remember that he had held her baby in his arms and kissed and blessed it before his death after that and the consequent examination into the state of his affairs it was found that he had left far less property than people had been led by his style of living to expect and what money there was was settled all upon his wife and at her disposal after her death this did not signify much to alice as frank was now first mate of his ship and in another voyage or two would be captain meanwhile he had left her rather more than two hundred pounds all his savings in the bank it became time for alice to hear from her husband one letter from the cape she had already received the next was to announce his arrival in india as week after week passed over and no intelligence of the ship having got there reached the office of the owners and the captains wife was in the same state of ignorant suspense as alice herself her fears grew most oppressive at length the day came when in reply to her inquiry at the shipping office they told her that the owners had given up hope of ever hearing more of the betsyjane and had sent in their claim upon the underwriters now that he was gone for ever she first felt a yearning longing love for the kind cousin the dear friend the sympathizing protector whom she should never see again first felt a passionate desire to show him his child whom she had hitherto rather craved to have all to herself her own sole possession her grief was however noiseless and quiet rather to the scandal of mrs wilson who bewailed her stepson as if he and she had always lived together in perfect harmony and who evidently thought it her duty to burst into fresh tears at every strange face she saw dwelling on his poor young widows desolate state and the helplessness of the fatherless child with an unction as if she liked the excitement of the sorrowful story so passed away the first days of alices widowhood by and by things subsided into their natural and tranquil course but as if the young creature was always to be in some heavy trouble her ewelamb began to be ailing pining and sickly the childs mysterious illness turned out to be some affection of the spine likely to affect health but not to shorten life at least so the doctors said but the long dreary suffering of one whom a mother loves as alice loved her only child is hard to look forward to only norah guessed what alice suffered no one but god knew and so it fell out that when mrs wilson the elder came to her one day in violent distress occasioned by a very material diminution in the value of the property that her husband had left her a diminution which made her income barely enough to support herself much less alice the latter could hardly understand how anything which did not touch health or life could cause such grief and she received the intelligence with irritating composure but when that afternoon the little sick child was brought in and the grandmother who after all loved it well began a fresh moan over her losses to its unconscious ears saying how she had planned to consult this or that doctor and to give it this or that comfort or luxury in after years but that now all chance of this had passed away alices heart was touched and she drew near to mrs wilson with unwonted caresses and in a spirit not unlike to that of ruth entreated that come what would they might remain together after much discussion in succeeding days it was arranged that mrs wilson should take a house in manchester furnishing it partly with what furniture she had and providing the rest with alices remaining two hundred pounds mrs wilson was herself a manchester woman and naturally longed to return to her native town some connexions of her own too at that time required lodgings for which they were willing to pay pretty handsomely alice undertook the active superintendence and superior work of the household norah willing faithful norah offered to cook scour do anything in short so that she might but remain with them the plan succeeded for some years their first lodgers remained with them and all went smoothly with that one sad exception of the little girls increasing deformity how that mother loved that child it is not for words to tell then came a break of misfortune their lodgers left and no one succeeded to them after some months it became necessary to remove to a smaller house and alices tender conscience was torn by the idea that she ought not to be a burden to her motherinlaw but to go out and seek her own maintenance and leave her child the thought came like the sweeping boom of a funeralbell over her heart by and by mr openshaw came to lodge with them he had started in life as the errandboy and sweeperout of a warehouse had struggled up through all the grades of employment in it fighting his way through the hard striving manchester life with strong pushing energy of character every spare moment of time had been sternly given up to selfteaching he was a capital accountant a good french and german scholar a keen farseeing tradesman understanding markets and the bearing of events both near and distant on trade and yet with such vivid attention to present details that i do not think he ever saw a group of flowers in the fields without thinking whether their colour would or would not form harmonious contrasts in the coming spring muslins and prints he went to debating societies and threw himself with all his heart and soul into politics esteeming it must be owned every man a fool or a knave who differed from him and overthrowing his opponents rather by the loud strength of his language than the calm strength of his logic there was something of the yankee in all this indeed his theory ran parallel to the famous yankee motto england flogs creation and manchester flogs england such a man as may be fancied had had no time for falling in love or any such nonsense at the age when most young men go through their courting and matrimony he had not the means of keeping a wife and was far too practical to think of having one and now that he was in easy circumstances a rising man he considered women almost as encumbrances to the world with whom a man had better have as little to do as possible his first impression of alice was indistinct and he did not care enough about her to make it distinct a pretty yeanay kind of woman would have been his description of her if he had been pushed into a corner he was rather afraid in the beginning that her quiet ways arose from a listlessness and laziness of character which would have been exceedingly discordant to his active energetic nature but when he found out the punctuality with which his wishes were attended to and her work was done when he was called in the morning at the very stroke of the clock his shavingwater scalding hot his fire bright his coffee made exactly as his peculiar fancy dictated for he was a man who had his theory about everything based upon what he knew of science and often perfectly original then he began to think not that alice had any particular merit but that he had got into remarkably good lodgings his restlessness wore away and he began to consider himself as almost settled for life in them mr openshaw had been too busy all his days to be introspective he did not know that he had any tenderness in his nature and if he had become conscious of its abstract existence he would have considered it as a manifestation of disease in some part of him but he was decoyed into pity unawares and pity led on to tenderness that little helpless child always carried about by one of the three busy women of the house or else patiently threading coloured beads in the chair from which by no effort of its own could it ever move the great grave blue eyes full of serious not uncheerful expression giving to the small delicate face a look beyond its years the soft plaintive voice dropping out but few words so unlike the continual prattle of a child caught mr openshaws attention in spite of himself one day he half scorned himself for doing so he cut short his dinnerhour to go in search of some toy which should take the place of those eternal beads i forget what he bought but when he gave the present which he took care to do in a short abrupt manner and when no one was by to see him he was almost thrilled by the flash of delight that came over that childs face and he could not help all through that afternoon going over and over again the picture left on his memory by the bright effect of unexpected joy on the little girls face when he returned home he found his slippers placed by his sittingroom fire and even more careful attention paid to his fancies than was habitual in those model lodgings when alice had taken the last of his teathings away she had been silent as usual till then she stood for an instant with the door in her hand mr openshaw looked as if he were deep in his book though in fact he did not see a line but was heartily wishing the woman would go and not make any palaver of gratitude but she only said i am very much obliged to you sir thank you very much and was gone even before he could send her away with a there my good woman thats enough for some time longer he took no apparent notice of the child he even hardened his heart into disregarding her sudden flush of colour and little timid smile of recognition when he saw her by chance but after all this could not last for ever and having a second time given way to tenderness there was no relapse the insidious enemy having thus entered his heart in the guise of compassion to the child soon assumed the more dangerous form of interest in the mother he was aware of this change of feeling despised himself for it struggled with it nay internally yielded to it and cherished it long before he suffered the slightest expression of it by word action or look to escape him he watched alices docile obedient ways to her stepmother the love which she had inspired in the rough norah roughened by the wear and tear of sorrow and years but above all he saw the wild deep passionate affection existing between her and her child they spoke little to anyone else or when anyone else was by but when alone together they talked and murmured and cooed and chattered so continually that mr openshaw first wondered what they could find to say to each other and next became irritated because they were always so grave and silent with him all this time he was perpetually devising small new pleasures for the child his thoughts ran in a pertinacious way upon the desolate life before her and often he came back from his days work loaded with the very thing alice had been longing for but had not been able to procure one time it was a little chair for drawing the little sufferer along the streets and many an evening that following summer mr openshaw drew her along himself regardless of the remarks of his acquaintances one day in autumn he put down his newspaper as alice came in with the breakfast and said in as indifferent a voice as he could assume mrs frank is there any reason why we two should not put up our horses together alice stood still in perplexed wonder what did he mean he had resumed the reading of his newspaper as if he did not expect any answer so she found silence her safest course and went on quietly arranging his breakfast without another word passing between them just as he was leaving the house to go to the warehouse as usual he turned back and put his head into the bright neat tidy kitchen where all the women breakfasted in the morning youll think of what i said mrs frank this was her name with the lodgers and let me have your opinion upon it tonight alice was thankful that her mother and norah were too busy talking together to attend much to this speech she determined not to think about it at all through the day and of course the effort not to think made her think all the more at night she sent up norah with his tea but mr openshaw almost knocked norah down as she was going out at the door by pushing past her and calling out mrs frank in an impatient voice at the top of the stairs alice went up rather than seem to have affixed too much meaning to his words well mrs frank he said what answer dont make it too long for i have lots of office work to get through tonight i hardly know what you meant sir said truthful alice well i should have thought you might have guessed youre not new at this sort of work and i am however ill make it plain this time will you have me to be thy wedded husband and serve me and love me and honour me and all that sort of thing because if you will i will do as much by you and be a father to your child and thats more than is put in the prayerbook now im a man of my word and what i say i feel and what i promise ill do now for your answer alice was silent he began to make the tea as if her reply was a matter of perfect indifference to him but as soon as that was done he became impatient well said he how long sir may i have to think over it three minutes looking at his watch youve had two already that makes five be a sensible woman say yes and sit down to tea with me and well talk it over together for after tea i shall be busy say no he hesitated a moment to try and keep his voice in the same tone and i shant say another word about it but pay up a years rent for my rooms tomorrow and be off times up yes or no if you please sir you have been so good to little ailsie there sit down comfortably by me on the sofa and lets have our tea together i am glad to find you are as good and sensible as i took you for and this was alice wilsons second wooing mr openshaws will was too strong and his circumstances too good for him not to carry all before him he settled mrs wilson in a comfortable house of her own and made her quite independent of lodgers the little that alice said with regard to future plans was in norahs behalf no said mr openshaw norah shall take care of the old lady as long as she lives and after that she shall either come and live with us or if she likes it better she shall have a provision for life for your sake missus no one who has been good to you or the child shall go unrewarded but even the little one will be better for some fresh stuff about her get her a bright sensible girl as a nurse one who wont go rubbing her with calfsfoot jelly as norah does wasting good stuff outside that ought to go in but will follow doctors directions which as you must see pretty clearly by this time norah wont because they give the poor little wench pain now im not above being nesh for other folks myself i can stand a good blow and never change colour but set me in the operating room in the infirmary and i turn as sick as a girl yet if need were i would hold the little wench on my knees while she screeched with pain if it were to do her poor back good nay nay wench keep your white looks for the time when it comes i dont say it ever will but this i know norah will spare the child and cheat the doctor if she can now i say give the bairn a year or twos chance and then when the pack of doctors have done their best and maybe the old lady has gone well have norah back or do better for her the pack of doctors could do no good to little ailsie she was beyond their power but her father for so he insisted on being called and also on alices no longer retaining the appellation of mamma but becoming henceforward mother by his healthy cheerfulness of manner his clear decision of purpose his odd turns and quirks of humour added to his real strong love for the helpless little girl infused a new element of brightness and confidence into her life and though her back remained the same her general health was strengthened and alice never going beyond a smile herself had the pleasure of seeing her child taught to laugh as for alices own life it was happier than it had ever been before mr openshaw required no demonstration no expressions of affection from her indeed these would rather have disgusted him alice could love deeply but could not talk about it the perpetual requirement of loving words looks and caresses and misconstruing their absence into absence of love had been the great trial of her former married life now all went on clear and straight under the guidance of her husbands strong sense warm heart and powerful will year by year their worldly prosperity increased at mrs wilsons death norah came back to them as nurse to the newlyborn little edwin into which post she was not installed without a pretty strong oration on the part of the proud and happy father who declared that if he found out that norah ever tried to screen the boy by a falsehood or to make him nesh either in body or mind she should go that very day norah and mr openshaw were not on the most thoroughly cordial terms neither of them fully recognizing or appreciating the others best qualities this was the previous history of the lancashire family who had now removed to london they had been there about a year when mr openshaw suddenly informed his wife that he had determined to heal longstanding feuds and had asked his uncle and aunt chadwick to come and pay them a visit and see london mrs openshaw had never seen this uncle and aunt of her husbands years before she had married him there had been a quarrel all she knew was that mr chadwick was a small manufacturer in a country town in south lancashire she was extremely pleased that the breach was to be healed and began making preparations to render their visit pleasant they arrived at last going to see london was such an event to them that mrs chadwick had made all new linen fresh for the occasion from nightcaps downwards and as for gowns ribbons and collars she might have been going into the wilds of canada where never a shop is so large was her stock a fortnight before the day of her departure for london she had formally called to take leave of all her acquaintance saying she should need every bit of the intermediate time for packing up it was like a second wedding in her imagination and to complete the resemblance which an entirely new wardrobe made between the two events her husband brought her back from manchester on the last marketday before they set off a gorgeous pearl and amethyst brooch saying lunnon should see that lancashire folks knew a handsome thing when they saw it for some time after mr and mrs chadwick arrived at the openshaws there was no opportunity for wearing this brooch but at length they obtained an order to see buckingham palace and the spirit of loyalty demanded that mrs chadwick should wear her best clothes in visiting the abode of her sovereign on her return she hastily changed her dress for mr openshaw had planned that they should go to richmond drink tea and return by moonlight accordingly about five oclock mr and mrs openshaw and mr and mrs chadwick set off the housemaid and cook sat below norah hardly knew where she was always engrossed in the nursery in tending her two children and in sitting by the restless excitable ailsie till she fell asleep by and by the housemaid bessy tapped gently at the door norah went to her and they spoke in whispers nurse theres someone downstairs wants you wants me who is it a gentleman a gentleman nonsense well a man then and he asks for you and he rang at the frontdoor bell and has walked into the diningroom you should never have let him exclaimed norah master and missus out i did not want him to come in but when he heard you lived here he walked past me and sat down on the first chair and said tell her to come and speak to me there is no gas lighted in the room and supper is all set out hell be off with the spoons exclaimed norah putting the housemaids fear into words and preparing to leave the room first however giving a look to ailsie sleeping soundly and calmly downstairs she went uneasy fears stirring in her bosom before she entered the diningroom she provided herself with a candle and with it in her hand she went in looking around her in the darkness for her visitor he was standing up holding by the table norah and he looked at each other gradual recognition coming into their eyes norah at length he asked who are you asked norah with the sharp tones of alarm and incredulity i dont know you trying by futile words of disbelief to do away with the terrible fact before her am i so changed he said pathetically i dare say i am but norah tell me he breathed hard where is my wife is she is she alive he came nearer to norah and would have taken her hand but she backed away from him looking at him all the time with staring eyes as if he were some horrible object yet he was a handsome bronzed goodlooking fellow with beard and moustache giving him a foreignlooking aspect but his eyes there was no mistaking those eager beautiful eyes the very same that norah had watched not half an hour ago till sleep stole softly over them tell me norah i can bear it i have feared it so often is she dead norah still kept silence she is dead he hung on norahs words and looks as if for confirmation or contradiction what shall i do groaned norah oh sir why did you come how did you find me out where have you been we thought you dead we did indeed she poured out words and questions to gain time as if time would help her norah answer me this question straight by yes or no is my wife dead no she is not said norah slowly and heavily oh what a relief did she receive my letters but perhaps you dont know why did you leave her where is she oh norah tell me all quickly mr frank said norah at last almost driven to bay by her terror lest her mistress should return at any moment and find him there unable to consider what was best to be done or said rushing at something decisive because she could not endure her present state mr frank we never heard a line from you and the shipowners said you had gone down you and everyone else we thought you were dead if ever man was and poor miss alice and her little sick helpless child oh sir you must guess it cried the poor creature at last bursting out into a passionate fit of crying for indeed i cannot tell it but it was no ones fault god help us all this night norah had sat down she trembled too much to stand he took her hands in his he squeezed them hard as if by physical pressure the truth could be wrung out norah this time his tone was calm stagnant as despair she has married again norah shook her head sadly the grasp slowly relaxed the man had fainted there was brandy in the room norah forced some drops into mr franks mouth chafed his hands and when mere animal life returned before the mind poured in its flood of memories and thoughts she lifted him up and rested his head against her knees then she put a few crumbs of bread taken from the suppertable soaked in brandy into his mouth suddenly he sprang to his feet where is she tell me this instant he looked so wild so mad so desperate that norah felt herself to be in bodily danger but her time of dread had gone by she had been afraid to tell him the truth and then she had been a coward now her wits were sharpened by the sense of his desperate state he must leave the house she would pity him afterwards but now she must rather command and upbraid for he must leave the house before her mistress came home that one necessity stood clear before her she is not here that is enough for you to know nor can i say exactly where she is which was true to the letter if not to the spirit go away and tell me where to find you tomorrow and i will tell you all my master and mistress may come back at any minute and then what would become of me with a strange man in the house such an argument was too petty to touch his excited mind i dont care for your master and mistress if your master is a man he must feel for me poor shipwrecked sailor that i am kept for years a prisoner amongst savages always always always thinking of my wife and my home dreaming of her by night talking to her though she could not hear by day i loved her more than all heaven and earth put together tell me where she is this instant you wretched woman who salved over her wickedness to her as you do to me the clock struck ten desperate positions require desperate measures if you will leave the house now i will come to you tomorrow and tell you all what is more you shall see your child now she lies sleeping upstairs oh sir you have a child you do not know that as yet a little weakly girl with just a heart and soul beyond her years we have reared her up with such care we watched her for we thought for many a year she might die any day and we tended her and no hard thing has come near her and no rough word has ever been said to her and now you come and will take her life into your hand and will crush it strangers to her have been kind to her but her own father mr frank i am her nurse and i love her and i tend her and i would do anything for her that i could her mothers heart beats as hers beats and if she suffers a pain her mother trembles all over if she is happy it is her mother that smiles and is glad if she is growing stronger her mother is healthy if she dwindles her mother languishes if she dies well i dont know it is not everyone can lie down and die when they wish it come upstairs mr frank and see your child seeing her will do good to your poor heart then go away in gods name just this one night tomorrow if need be you can do anything kill us all if you will or show yourself a great grand man whom god will bless for ever and ever come mr frank the look of a sleeping child is sure to give peace she led him upstairs at first almost helping his steps till they came near the nursery door she had wellnigh forgotten the existence of little edwin it struck upon her with affright as the shaded light fell over the other cot but she skilfully threw that corner of the room into darkness and let the light fall on the sleeping ailsie the child had thrown down the coverings and her deformity as she lay with her back to them was plainly visible through her slight nightgown her little face deprived of the lustre of her eyes looked wan and pinched and had a pathetic expression in it even as she slept the poor father looked and looked with hungry wistful eyes into which the big tears came swelling up slowly and dropped heavily down as he stood trembling and shaking all over norah was angry with herself for growing impatient of the length of time that long lingering gaze lasted she thought that she waited for full half an hour before frank stirred and then instead of going away he sank down on his knees by the bedside and buried his face in the clothes little ailsie stirred uneasily norah pulled him up in terror she could afford no more time even for prayer in her extremity of fear for surely the next moment would bring her mistress home she took him forcibly by the arm but as he was going his eye lighted on the other bed he stopped intelligence came back into his face his hands clenched his child he asked her child replied norah god watches over him she said instinctively for franks looks excited her fears and she needed to remind herself of the protector of the helpless god has not watched over me he said in despair his thoughts apparently recoiling on his own desolate deserted state but norah had no time for pity tomorrow she would be as compassionate as her heart prompted at length she guided him downstairs and shut the outer door and bolted it as if by bolts to keep out facts then she went back into the diningroom and effaced all traces of his presence as far as she could she went upstairs to the nursery and sat there her head on her hand thinking what was to come of all this misery it seemed to her very long before her master and mistress returned yet it was hardly eleven oclock she heard the loud hearty lancashire voices on the stairs and for the first time she understood the contrast of the desolation of the poor man who had so lately gone forth in lonely despair it almost put her out of patience to see mrs openshaw come in calmly smiling handsomely dressed happy easy to inquire after her children did ailsie go to sleep comfortably she whispered to norah yes her mother bent over her looking at her slumbers with the soft eyes of love how little she dreamed who had looked on her last then she went to edwin with perhaps less wistful anxiety in her countenance but more of pride she took off her things to go down to supper norah saw her no more that night beside having a door into the passage the sleepingnursery opened out of mr and mrs openshaws room in order that they might have the children more immediately under their own eyes early the next summers morning mrs openshaw was awakened by ailsies startled call of mother mother she sprang up put on her dressinggown and went to her child ailsie was only half awake and in a not unusual state of terror who was he mother tell me who my darling no one is here you have been dreaming love waken up quite see it is broad daylight yes said ailsie looking round her then clinging to her mother but a man was here in the night mother nonsense little goose no man has ever come near you yes he did he stood there just by norah a man with hair and a beard and he knelt down and said his prayers norah knows he was here mother half angrily as mrs openshaw shook her head in smiling incredulity well we will ask norah when she comes said mrs openshaw soothingly but we wont talk any more about him now it is not five oclock it is too early for you to get up shall i fetch you a book and read to you dont leave me mother said the child clinging to her so mrs openshaw sat on the bedside talking to ailsie and telling her of what they had done at richmond the evening before until the little girls eyes slowly closed and she once more fell asleep what was the matter asked mr openshaw as his wife returned to bed ailsie wakened up in a fright with some story of a man having been in the room to say his prayers a dream i suppose and no more was said at the time mrs openshaw had almost forgotten the whole affair when she got up about seven oclock but by and by she heard a sharp altercation going on in the nursery norah speaking angrily to ailsie a most unusual thing both mr and mrs openshaw listened in astonishment hold your tongue ailsie let me hear none of your dreams never let me hear you tell that story again ailsie began to cry mr openshaw opened the door of communication before his wife could say a word norah come here the nurse stood at the door defiant she perceived she had been heard but she was desperate dont let me hear you speak in that manner to ailsie again he said sternly and shut the door norah was infinitely relieved for she had dreaded some questioning and a little blame for sharp speaking was what she could well bear if crossexamination was let alone downstairs they went mr openshaw carrying ailsie the sturdy edwin coming step by step right foot foremost always holding his mothers hand each child was placed in a chair by the breakfasttable and then mr and mrs openshaw stood together at the window awaiting their visitors appearance and making plans for the day there was a pause suddenly mr openshaw turned to ailsie and said what a little goosy somebody is with her dreams wakening up poor tired mother in the middle of the night with a story of a man being in the room father im sure i saw him said ailsie halfcrying i dont want to make norah angry but i was not asleep for all she says i was i had been asleep and i wakened up quite wide awake though i was so frightened i kept my eyes nearly shut and i saw the man quite plain a great brown man with a beard he said his prayers and then looked at edwin and then norah took him by the arm and led him away after they had whispered a bit together now my little woman must be reasonable said mr openshaw who was always patient with ailsie there was no man in the house last night at all no man comes into the house as you know if you think much less goes up into the nursery but sometimes we dream something has happened and the dream is so like reality that you are not the first person little woman who has stood out that the thing has really happened but indeed it was not a dream said ailsie beginning to cry just then mr and mrs chadwick came down looking grave and discomposed all during breakfasttime they were silent and uncomfortable as soon as the breakfast things were taken away and the children had been carried upstairs mr chadwick began in an evidently preconcerted manner to inquire if his nephew was certain that all his servants were honest for that mrs chadwick had that morning missed a very valuable brooch which she had worn the day before she remembered taking it off when she came home from buckingham palace mr openshaws face contracted into hard lines grew like what it was before he had known his wife and her child he rang the bell even before his uncle had done speaking it was answered by the housemaid mary was anyone here last night while we were away a man sir came to speak to norah to speak to norah who was he how long did he stay im sure i cant tell sir he came perhaps about nine i went up to tell norah in the nursery and she came down to speak to him she let him out sir she will know who he was and how long he stayed she waited a moment to be asked any more questions but she was not so she went away a minute afterwards mr openshaw made as though he were going out of the room but his wife laid her hand on his arm do not speak to her before the children she said in her low quiet voice i will go up and question her no i must speak to her you must know said he turning to his uncle and aunt my missus has an old servant as faithful as ever woman was i do believe as far as love goes but at the same time who does not speak truth as even the missus must allow now my notion is that this norah of ours has been come over by some goodfornothing chap for shes at the time o life when they say women pray for husbands any good lord any and has let him into our house and the chap has made off with your brooch and mappen many another thing beside its only saying that norah is softhearted and doesnt stick at a white lie thats all missus it was curious to notice how his tone his eyes his whole face was changed as he spoke to his wife but he was the resolute man through all she knew better than to oppose him so she went upstairs and told norah that her master wanted to speak to her and that she would take care of the children in the meanwhile norah rose to go without a word her thoughts were these if they tear me to pieces they shall never know through me he may come and then just lord have mercy upon us all for some of us are dead folk to a certainty but he shall do it not me you may fancy now her look of determination as she faced her master alone in the diningroom mr and mrs chadwick having left the affair in their nephews hands seeing that he took it up with such vehemence norah who was that man that came to my house last night man sir as if infinitely surprised but it was only to gain time yes the man that mary let in that she went upstairs to the nursery to tell you about that you came down to speak to the same chap i make no doubt that you took into the nursery to have your talk out with the one ailsie saw and afterwards dreamed about thinking poor wench she saw him say his prayers when nothing ill be bound was further from his thoughts the one that took mrs chadwicks brooch value ten pounds now norah dont go off im as sure as my names thomas openshaw that you knew nothing of this robbery but i do think youve been imposed on and thats the truth some goodfornothing chap has been making up to you and youve been just like all other women and have turned a soft place in your heart to him and he came last night alovyering and you had him up in the nursery and he made use of his opportunities and made off with a few things on his way down come now norah its no blame to you only you must not be such a fool again tell us he continued what name he gave you norah ill be bound it was not the right one but it will be a clue for the police norah drew herself up you may ask that question and taunt me with my being single and with my credulity as you will master openshaw youll get no answer from me as for the brooch and the story of theft and burglary if any friend ever came to see me which i defy you to prove and deny hed be just as much above doing such a thing as you yourself mr openshaw and more so too for im not at all sure as everything you have is rightly come by or would be yours long if every man had his own she meant of course his wife but he understood her to refer to his property in goods and chattels now my good woman said he ill just tell you truly i never trusted you out and out but my wife liked you and i thought you had many a good point about you if you once begin to sauce me ill have the police to you and get out the truth in a court of justice if youll not tell it me quietly and civilly here now the best thing you can do is quietly to tell me who the fellow is look here a man comes to my house asks for you you take him upstairs a valuable brooch is missing next day we know that you and mary and cook are honest but you refuse to tell us who the man is indeed youve told me one lie already about him saying no one was here last night now i just put it to you what do you think a policeman would say to this or a magistrate a magistrate would soon make you tell the truth my good woman theres never the creature born that should get it out of me said norah not unless i choose to tell ive a great mind to see said mr openshaw growing angry at the defiance then checking himself he thought before he spoke again norah for your missus sake i dont want to go to extremities be a sensible woman if you can its no great disgrace after all to have been taken in i ask you once more as a friend who was this man that you let into my house last night no answer he repeated the question in an impatient tone still no answer norahs lips were set in determination not to speak then there is but one thing to be done i shall send for a policeman you will not said norah starting forward you shall not sir no policeman shall touch me i know nothing of the brooch but i know this ever since i was fourandtwenty i have thought more of your wife than of myself ever since i saw her a poor motherless girl put upon in her uncles house i have thought more of serving her than of serving myself i have cared for her and her child as nobody ever cared for me i dont cast blame on you sir but i say its ill giving up ones life to anyone for at the end they will turn round upon you and forsake you why does not my missus come herself to suspect me maybe she is gone for the police but i dont stay here either for police or magistrate or master youre an unlucky lot i believe theres a curse on you ill leave you this very day yes ill leave that poor ailsie too i will no good ever will come to you mr openshaw was utterly astonished at this speech most of which was completely unintelligible to him as may easily be supposed before he could make up his mind what to say or what to do norah had left the room i do not think he had ever really intended to send for the police to this old servant of his wifes for he had never for a moment doubted her perfect honesty but he had intended to compel her to tell him who the man was and in this he was baffled he was consequently much irritated he returned to his uncle and aunt in a state of great annoyance and perplexity and told them he could get nothing out of the woman that some man had been in the house the night before but that she refused to tell who he was at this moment his wife came in greatly agitated and asked what had happened to norah for that she had put on her things in passionate haste and left the house this looks suspicious said mr chadwick it is not the way in which an honest person would have acted mr openshaw kept silence he was sorely perplexed but mrs openshaw turned round on mr chadwick with a sudden fierceness no one ever saw in her before you dont know norah uncle she is gone because she is deeply hurt at being suspected oh i wish i had seen her that i had spoken to her myself she would have told me anything alice wrung her hands i must confess continued mr chadwick to his nephew in a lower voice i cant make you out you used to be a word and a blow and oftenest the blow first and now when there is every cause for suspicion you just do nought your missus is a very good woman i grant but she may have been put upon as well as other folk i suppose if you dont send for the police i shall very well replied mr openshaw surlily i cant clear norah she wont clear herself as i believe she might if she would only i wash my hands of it for i am sure the woman herself is honest and shes lived a long time with my wife and i dont like her to come to shame but she will then be forced to clear herself that at any rate will be a good thing very well very well i am heartsick of the whole business come alice come up to the babies theyll be in a sore way i tell you uncle he said turning round once more to mr chadwick suddenly and sharply after his eye had fallen on alices wan tearful anxious face ill have no sending for the police after all ill buy my aunt twice as handsome a brooch this very day but ill not have norah suspected and my missus plagued theres for you he and his wife left the room mr chadwick quietly waited till he was out of hearing and then said to his wife for all toms heroics im just quietly going for a detective wench thou needst know nought about it he went to the policestation and made a statement of the case he was gratified by the impression which the evidence against norah seemed to make the men all agreed in his opinion and steps were to be immediately taken to find out where she was most probably as they suggested she had gone at once to the man who to all appearance was her lover when mr chadwick asked how they would find her out they smiled shook their heads and spoke of mysterious but infallible ways and means he returned to his nephews house with a very comfortable opinion of his own sagacity he was met by his wife with a penitent face oh master ive found my brooch it was just sticking by its pin in the flounce of my brown silk that i wore yesterday i took it off in a hurry and it must have caught in it and i hung up my gown in the closet just now when i was going to fold it up there was the brooch i am very vexed but i never dreamt but what it was lost her husband muttering something very like confound thee and thy brooch too i wish id never given it thee snatched up his hat and rushed back to the station hoping to be in time to stop the police from searching for norah but a detective was already gone off on the errand where was norah half mad with the strain of the fearful secret she had hardly slept through the night for thinking what must be done upon this terrible state of mind had come ailsies questions showing that she had seen the man as the unconscious child called her father lastly came the suspicion of her honesty she was little less than crazy as she ran upstairs and dashed on her bonnet and shawl leaving all else even her purse behind her in that house she would not stay that was all she knew or was clear about she would not even see the children again for fear it should weaken her she dreaded above everything mr franks return to claim his wife she could not tell what remedy there was for a sorrow so tremendous for her to stay to witness the desire of escaping from the coming event was a stronger motive for her departure than her soreness about the suspicions directed against her although this last had been the final goad to the course she took she walked a way almost at headlong speed sobbing as she went as she had not dared to do during the past night for fear of exciting wonder in those who might hear her then she stopped an idea came into her mind that she would leave london altogether and betake herself to her native town of liverpool she felt in her pocket for her purse as she drew near the euston square station with this intention she had left it at home her poor head aching her eyes swollen with crying she had to stand still and think as well as she could where next she should bend her steps suddenly the thought flashed into her mind that she would go and find out poor mr frank she had been hardly kind to him the night before though her heart had bled for him ever since she remembered his telling her when she inquired for his address almost as she had pushed him out of the door of some hotel in a street not far distant from euston square thither she went with what intention she scarcely knew but to assuage her conscience by telling him how much she pitied him in her present state she felt herself unfit to counsel or restrain or assist or do aught else but sympathize and weep the people of the inn said such a person had been there had arrived only the day before had gone out soon after arrival leaving his luggage in their care but had never come back norah asked for leave to sit down and await the gentlemans return the landlady pretty secure in the deposit of luggage against any probable injury showed her into a room and quietly locked the door on the outside norah was utterly worn out and fell asleep a shivering starting uneasy slumber which lasted for hours the detective meanwhile had come up with her some time before she entered the hotel into which he followed her asking the landlady to detain her for an hour or so without giving any reason beyond showing his authority which made the landlady applaud herself a good deal for having locked her in he went back to the policestation to report his proceedings he could have taken her directly but his object was if possible to trace out the man who was supposed to have committed the robbery then he heard of the discovery of the brooch and consequently did not care to return norah slept till even the summer evening began to close in then started up someone was at the door it would be mr frank and she dizzily pushed back her ruffled grey hair which had fallen over her eyes and stood looking to see him instead there came in mr openshaw and a policeman this is norah kennedy said mr openshaw oh sir said norah i did not touch the brooch indeed i did not oh sir i cannot live to be thought so badly of and very sick and faint she suddenly sank down on the ground to her surprise mr openshaw raised her up very tenderly even the policeman helped to lay her on the sofa and at mr openshaws desire he went for some wine and sandwiches for the poor gaunt woman lay there almost as if dead with weariness and exhaustion norah said mr openshaw in his kindest voice the brooch is found it was hanging to mrs chadwicks gown i beg your pardon most truly i beg your pardon for having troubled you about it my wife is almost brokenhearted eat norah or stay first drink this glass of wine said he lifting her head and pouring a little down her throat as she drank she remembered where she was and who she was waiting for she suddenly pushed mr openshaw away saying oh sir you must go you must not stop a minute if he comes back he will kill you alas norah i do not know who he is but someone is gone away who will never come back someone who knew you and whom i am afraid you cared for i dont understand you sir said norah her masters kind and sorrowful manner bewildering her yet more than his words the policeman had left the room at mr openshaws desire and they two were alone you know what i mean when i say someone is gone who will never come back i mean that he is dead who said norah trembling all over a poor man has been found in the thames this morning drowned did he drown himself asked norah solemnly god only knows replied mr openshaw in the same tone your name and address at our house were found in his pocket that and his purse were the only things that were found upon him i am sorry to say it my poor norah but you are required to go and identify him to what asked norah to say who it is it is always done in order that some reason may be discovered for the suicide if suicide it was i make no doubt he was the man who came to see you at our house last night it is very sad i know he made pauses between each little clause in order to try and bring back her senses which he feared were wandering so wild and sad was her look master openshaw said she at last ive a dreadful secret to tell you only you must never breathe it to anyone and you and i must hide it away for ever i thought to have done it all by myself but i see i cannot yon poor man yes the dead drowned creature is i fear mr frank my mistresss first husband mr openshaw sat down as if shot he did not speak but after a while he signed to norah to go on he came to me the other night when god be thanked you were all away at richmond he asked me if his wife was dead or alive i was a brute and thought more of your all coming home than of his sore trial i spoke out sharp and said she was married again and very content and happy i all but turned him away and now he lies dead and cold god forgive me said mr openshaw god forgive us all said norah yon poor man needs forgiveness perhaps less than any one among us he had been among the savages shipwrecked i know not what and he had written letters which had never reached my poor missus he saw his child he saw her yes i took him up to give his thoughts another start for i believed he was going mad on my hands i came to seek him here as i more than half promised my mind misgave me when i heard he never came in oh sir it must be him mr openshaw rang the bell norah was almost too much stunned to wonder at what he did he asked for writing materials wrote a letter and then said to norah i am writing to alice to say i shall be unavoidably absent for a few days that i have found you that you are well and send her your love and will come home tomorrow you must go with me to the police court you must identify the body i will pay high to keep names and details out of the papers but where are you going sir he did not answer her directly then he said norah i must go with you and look on the face of the man whom i have so injured unwittingly it is true but it seems to me as if i had killed him i will lay his head in the grave as if he were my only brother and how he must have hated me i cannot go home to my wife till all that i can do for him is done then i go with a dreadful secret on my mind i shall never speak of it again after these days are over i know you will not either he shook hands with her and they never named the subject again the one to the other norah went home to alice the next day not a word was said on the cause of her abrupt departure a day or two before alice had been charged by her husband in his letter not to allude to the supposed theft of the brooch so she implicitly obedient to those whom she loved both by nature and habit was entirely silent on the subject only treated norah with the most tender respect as if to make up for unjust suspicion nor did alice inquire into the reason why mr openshaw had been absent during his uncle and aunts visit after he had once said that it was unavoidable he came back grave and quiet and from that time forth was curiously changed more thoughtful and perhaps less active quite as decided in conduct but with new and different rules for the guidance of that conduct towards alice he could hardly be more kind than he had always been but he now seemed to look upon her as someone sacred and to be treated with reverence as well as tenderness he throve in business and made a large fortune one half of which was settled upon her long years after these events a few months after her mother died ailsie and her father as she always called mr openshaw drove to a cemetery a little way out of town and she was carried to a certain mound by her maid who was then sent back to the carriage there was a headstone with fw and a date upon it that was all sitting by the grave mr openshaw told her the story and for the sad fate of that poor father whom she had never seen he shed the only tears she ever saw fall from his eyes thomas hardy a mere interlude the bolton weekly journal and october i the traveller in schoolbooks who vouched in dryest tones for the fidelity to fact of the following narrative used to add a ring of truth to it by opening with a nicety of criticism on the heroines personality people were wrong he declared when they surmised that baptista trewthen was a young woman with scarcely emotions or character there was nothing in her to love and nothing to hate so ran the general opinion that she showed few positive qualities was true the colours and tones which changing events paint on the faces of active womankind were looked for in vain upon hers but still waters run deep and no crisis had come in the years of her early maidenhood to demonstrate what lay hidden within her like metal in a mine she was the daughter of a small farmer in st marias one of the isles of lyonesse beyond offwessex who had spent a large sum as there understood on her education by sending her to the mainland for two years at nineteen she was entered at the training college for teachers and at twentyone nominated to a school in the country near toruponsea whither she proceeded after the christmas examination and holidays the months passed by from winter to spring and summer and baptista applied herself to her new duties as best she could till an uneventful year had elapsed then an air of abstraction pervaded her bearing as she walked to and fro twice a day and she showed the traits of a person who had something on her mind a widow by name mrs wace in whose house baptista trewthen had been provided with a sittingroom and bedroom till the schoolhouse should be built noticed this change in her youthful tenants manner and at last ventured to press her with a few questions it has nothing to do with the place nor with you said miss trewthen then it is the salary no nor the salary then it is something you have heard from home my dear baptista was silent for a few moments it is mr heddegan she murmured him they used to call david heddegan before he got his money and who is the mr heddegan they used to call david an old bachelor at giants town st marias with no relations whatever who lives about a stones throw from fathers when i was a child he used to take me on his knee and say hed marry me some day now i am a woman the jest has turned earnest and he is anxious to do it and father and mother say i cant do better than have him hes well off yes hes the richest man we know as a friend and neighbour how much older did you say he was than yourself i didnt say twenty years at least and an unpleasant man in the bargain perhaps no hes not unpleasant well child all i can say is that id resist any such engagement if its not palatable to ee you are comfortable here in my little house i hope all the parish like ee and ive never been so cheerful since my poor husband left me to wear his wings as ive been with ee as my lodger the schoolmistress assured her landlady that she could return the sentiment but here comes my perplexity she said i dont like keeping school ah you are surprised you didnt suspect it thats because ive concealed my feeling well i simply hate school i dont care for children they are unpleasant troublesome little things whom nothing would delight so much as to hear that you had fallen down dead yet i would even put up with them if it was not for the inspector for three months before his visit i didnt sleep soundly and the committee of council are always changing the code so that you dont know what to teach and what to leave untaught i think father and mother are right they say i shall never excel as a schoolmistress if i dislike the work so and that therefore i ought to get settled by marrying mr heddegan between us two i like him better than school but i dont like him quite so much as to wish to marry him these conversations once begun were continued from day to day till at length the young girls elderly friend and landlady threw in her opinion on the side of miss trewthens parents all things considered she declared the uncertainty of the school the labour baptistas natural dislike for teaching it would be as well to take what fate offered and make the best of matters by wedding her fathers old neighbour and prosperous friend the easter holidays came round and baptista went to spend them as usual in her native isle going by train into offwessex and crossing by packet from penzephyr when she returned in the middle of april her face wore a more settled aspect well said the expectant mrs wace i have agreed to have him as my husband said baptista in an offhand way heaven knows if it will be for the best or not but i have agreed to do it and so the matter is settled mrs wace commended her but baptista did not care to dwell on the subject so that allusion to it was very infrequent between them nevertheless among other things she repeated to the widow from time to time in monosyllabic remarks that the wedding was really impending that it was arranged for the summer and that she had given notice of leaving the school at the august holidays later on she announced more specifically that her marriage was to take place immediately after her return home at the beginning of the month aforesaid she now corresponded regularly with mr heddegan her letters from him were seen at least on the outside and in part within by mrs wace had she read more of their interiors than the occasional sentences shown her by baptista she would have perceived that the scratchy rusty handwriting of miss trewthens betrothed conveyed little more matter than details of their future housekeeping and his preparations for the same with innumerable my dears sprinkled in disconnectedly to show the depth of his affection without the inconveniences of syntax ii it was the end of july dry too dry even for the season the delicate green herbs and vegetables that grew in this favoured end of the kingdom tasting rather of the wateringpot than of the pure fresh moisture from the skies baptistas boxes were packed and one saturday morning she departed by a waggonette to the station and thence by train to penzephyr from which port she was as usual to cross the water immediately to her home and become mr heddegans wife on the wednesday of the week following she might have returned a week sooner but though the wedding day had loomed so near and the banns were out she delayed her departure till this last moment saying it was not necessary for her to be at home long beforehand as mr heddegan was older than herself she said she was to be married in her ordinary summer bonnet and grey silk frock and there were no preparations to make that had not been amply made by her parents and intended husband in due time after a hot and tedious journey she reached penzephyr she here obtained some refreshment and then went towards the pier where she learnt to her surprise that the little steamboat plying between the town and the islands had left at eleven oclock the usual hour of departure in the afternoon having been forestalled in consequence of the fogs which had for a few days prevailed towards evening making twilight navigation dangerous this being saturday there was now no other boat till tuesday and it became obvious that here she would have to remain for the three days unless her friends should think fit to rig out one of the island sailingboats and come to fetch her a not very likely contingency the sea distance being nearly forty miles baptista however had been detained in penzephyr on more than one occasion before either on account of bad weather or some such reason as the present and she was therefore not in any personal alarm but as she was to be married on the following wednesday the delay was certainly inconvenient to a more than ordinary degree since it would leave less than a days interval between her arrival and the wedding ceremony apart from this awkwardness she did not much mind the accident it was indeed curious to see how little she minded perhaps it would not be too much to say that although she was going to do the critical deed of her life quite willingly she experienced an indefinable relief at the postponement of her meeting with heddegan but her manner after making discovery of the hindrance was quiet and subdued even to passivity itself as was instanced by her having at the moment of receiving information that the steamer had sailed replied oh so coolly to the porter with her luggage that he was almost disappointed at her lack of disappointment the question now was should she return again to mrs wace in the village of lower wessex or wait in the town at which she had arrived she would have preferred to go back but the distance was too great moreover having left the place for good and somewhat dramatically to become a bride a return even for so short a space would have been a trifle humiliating leaving then her boxes at the station her next anxiety was to secure a respectable or rather genteel lodging in the popular seaside resort confronting her to this end she looked about the town in which though she had passed through it halfadozen times she was practically a stranger baptista found a room to suit her over a fruiterers shop where she made herself at home and set herself in order after her journey an early cup of tea having revived her spirits she walked out to reconnoitre being a schoolmistress she avoided looking at the schools and having a sort of trade connection with books she avoided looking at the booksellers but wearying of the other shops she inspected the churches not that for her own part she cared much about ecclesiastical edifices but tourists looked at them and so would she a proceeding for which no one would have credited her with any great originality such for instance as that she subsequently showed herself to possess the churches soon oppressed her she tried the museum but came out because it seemed lonely and tedious yet the town and the walks in this land of strawberries these headquarters of early english flowers and fruit were then as always attractive from the more picturesque streets she went to the town gardens and the pier and the harbour and looked at the men at work there loading and unloading as in the time of the phoenicians not baptista yes baptista it is the words were uttered behind her turning round she gave a start and became confused even agitated for a moment then she said in her usual undemonstrative manner o is it really you charles without speaking again at once and with a halfsmile the newcomer glanced her over there was much criticism and some resentment even temper in his eye i am going home continued she but i have missed the boat he scarcely seemed to take in the meaning of this explanation in the intensity of his critical survey teaching still what a fine schoolmistress you make baptista i warrant he said with a slight flavour of sarcasm which was not lost upon her i know i am nothing to brag of she replied thats why i have given up o given up you astonish me i hate the profession perhaps thats because i am in it o no it isnt but i am going to enter on another life altogether i am going to be married next week to mr david heddegan the young man fortified as he was by a natural cynical pride and passionateness winced at this unexpected reply notwithstanding who is mr david heddegan he asked as indifferently as lay in his power she informed him the bearer of the name was a general merchant of giants town st marias island her fathers nearest neighbour and oldest friend then we shant see anything more of you on the mainland inquired the schoolmaster o i dont know about that said miss trewthen here endeth the career of the belle of the boardingschool your father was foolish enough to send you to a general merchants wife in the lyonesse isles will you sell pounds of soap and pennyworths of tin tacks or whole bars of saponaceous matter and great tenpenny nails hes not in such a small way as that she almost pleaded he owns ships though they are rather little ones o well it is much the same come let us walk on it is tedious to stand still i thought you would be a failure in education he continued when she obeyed him and strolled ahead you never showed power that way you remind me much of some of those women who think they are sure to be great actresses if they go on the stage because they have a pretty face and forget that what we require is acting but you found your mistake didnt you dont taunt me charles it was noticeable that the young schoolmasters tone caused her no anger or retaliatory passion far otherwise there was a tear in her eye how is it you are at penzephyr she inquired i dont taunt you i speak the truth purely in a friendly way as i should to anyone i wished well though for that matter i might have some excuse even for taunting you such a terrible hurry as youve been in i hate a woman who is in such a hurry how do you mean that why to be somebodys wife or other anythings wife rather than nobodys you couldnt wait for me o no well thank god im cured of all that how merciless you are she said bitterly wait for you what does that mean charley you never showed anything to wait for anything special towards me o come baptista dear come what i mean is nothing definite she expostulated i suppose you liked me a little but it seemed to me to be only a pastime on your part and that you never meant to make an honourable engagement of it there thats just it you girls expect a man to mean business at the first look no man when he first becomes interested in a woman has any definite scheme of engagement to marry her in his mind unless he is meaning a vulgar mercenary marriage however i did at last mean an honourable engagement as you call it come to that but you never said so and an indefinite courtship soon injures a womans position and credit sooner than you think baptista i solemnly declare that in six months i should have asked you to marry me she walked along in silence looking on the ground and appearing very uncomfortable presently he said would you have waited for me if you had known to this she whispered in a sorrowful whisper yes they went still farther in silence passing along one of the beautiful walks on the outskirts of the town yet not observant of scene or situation her shoulder and his were close together and he clasped his fingers round the small of her arm quite lightly and without any attempt at impetus yet the act seemed to say now i hold you and my will must be yours recurring to a previous question of hers he said i have merely run down here for a day or two from school near trufal before going off to the north for the rest of my holiday i have seen my relations at redrutin quite lately so i am not going there this time how little i thought of meeting you how very different the circumstances would have been if instead of parting again as we must in halfanhour or so possibly for ever you had been now just going off with me as my wife on our honeymoon trip ha ha well so humorous is life she stopped suddenly i must go back now this is altogether too painful charley it is not at all a kind mood you are in today i dont want to pain you you know i do not he said more gently only it just exasperates me this you are going to do i wish you would not what marry him there now i have showed you my true sentiments i must do it now said she why he asked dropping the offhand masterful tone he had hitherto spoken in and becoming earnest still holding her arm however as if she were his chattel to be taken up or put down at will it is never too late to break off a marriage thats distasteful to you now ill say one thing and it is truth i wish you would marry me instead of him even now at the last moment though you have served me so badly o it is not possible to think of that she answered hastily shaking her head when i get home all will be prepared it is ready even now the things for the party the furniture mr heddegans new suit and everything i should require the courage of a tropical lion to go home there and say i wouldnt carry out my promise then go in heavens name but there would be no necessity for you to go home and face them in that way if we were to marry it would have to be at once instantly or not at all i should think your affection not worth the having unless you agreed to come back with me to trufal this evening where we could be married by licence on monday morning and then no mr david heddegan or anybody else could get you away from me i must go home by the tuesday boat she faltered what would they think if i did not come you could go home by that boat just the same all the difference would be that i should go with you you could leave me on the quay where id have a smoke while you went and saw your father and mother privately you could then tell them what you had done and that i was waiting not far off that i was a schoolmaster in a fairly good position and a young man you had known when you were at the training college then i would come boldly forward and they would see that it could not be altered and so you wouldnt suffer a lifelong misery by being the wife of a wretched old gaffer you dont like at all now honestly you do like me best dont you baptista yes then we will do as i say she did not pronounce a clear affirmative but that she consented to the novel proposition at some moment or other of that walk was apparent by what occurred a little later iii an enterprise of such pith required indeed less talking than consideration the first thing they did in carrying it out was to return to the railway station where baptista took from her luggage a small trunk of immediate necessaries which she would in any case have required after missing the boat that same afternoon they travelled up the line to trufal charles stow as his name was despite his disdainful indifference to things was very careful of appearances and made the journey independently of her though in the same train he told her where she could get board and lodgings in the city and with merely a distant nod to her of a provisional kind went off to his own quarters and to see about the licence on sunday she saw him in the morning across the nave of the procathedral in the afternoon they walked together in the fields where he told her that the licence would be ready next day and would be available the day after when the ceremony could be performed as early after eight oclock as they should choose his courtship thus renewed after an interval of two years was as impetuous violent even as it was short the next day came and passed and the final arrangements were made their agreement was to get the ceremony over as soon as they possibly could the next morning so as to go on to penzephyr at once and reach that place in time for the boats departure the same day it was in obedience to baptistas earnest request that stow consented thus to make the whole journey to lyonesse by land and water at one heat and not break it at penzephyr she seemed to be oppressed with a dread of lingering anywhere this great first act of disobedience to her parents once accomplished with the weight on her mind that her home had to be convulsed by the disclosure of it to face her difficulties over the water immediately she had created them was however a course more desired by baptista than by her lover though for once he gave way the next morning was bright and warm as those which had preceded it by six oclock it seemed nearly noon as is often the case in that part of england in the summer season by nine they were husband and wife they packed up and departed by the earliest train after the service and on the way discussed at length what she should say on meeting her parents charley dictating the turn of each phrase in her anxiety they had travelled so early that when they reached penzephyr they found there were nearly two hours on their hands before the steamers time of sailing baptista was extremely reluctant to be seen promenading the streets of the wateringplace with her husband till as above stated the household at giants town should know the unexpected course of events from her own lips and it was just possible if not likely that some lyonessian might be prowling about there or even have come across the sea to look for her to meet anyone to whom she was known and to have to reply to awkward questions about the strange young man at her side before her wellframed announcement had been delivered at proper time and place was a thing she could not contemplate with equanimity so instead of looking at the shops and harbour they went along the coast a little way the heat of the morning was by this time intense they clambered up on some cliffs and while sitting there looking around at st michaels mount and other objects charles said to her that he thought he would run down to the beach at their feet and take just one plunge into the sea baptista did not much like the idea of being left alone it was gloomy she said but he assured her he would not be gone more than a quarter of an hour at the outside and she passively assented down he went disappeared appeared again and looked back then he again proceeded and vanished till as a small waxen object she saw him emerge from the nook that had screened him cross the white fringe of foam and walk into the undulating mass of blue once in the water he seemed less inclined to hurry than before he remained a long time and unable either to appreciate his skill or criticize his want of it at that distance she withdrew her eyes from the spot and gazed at the still outline of st michaels now beautifully toned in grey her anxiety for the hour of departure and to cope at once with the approaching incidents that she would have to manipulate as best she could sent her into a reverie it was now tuesday she would reach home in the evening a very late time they would say but as the delay was a pure accident they would deem her marriage to mr heddegan tomorrow still practicable then charles would have to be produced from the background it was a terrible undertaking to think of and she almost regretted her temerity in wedding so hastily that morning the rage of her father would be so crushing the reproaches of her mother so bitter and perhaps charles would answer hotly and perhaps cause estrangement till death there had obviously been no alarm about her at st marias or somebody would have sailed across to inquire for her she had in a letter written at the beginning of the week spoken of the hour at which she intended to leave her country schoolhouse and from this her friends had probably perceived that by such timing she would run a risk of losing the saturday boat she had missed it and as a consequence sat here on the shore as mrs charles stow this brought her to the present and she turned from the outline of st michaels mount to look about for her husbands form he was as far as she could discover no longer in the sea then he was dressing by moving a few steps she could see where his clothes lay but charles was not beside them baptista looked back again at the water in bewilderment as if her senses were the victim of some sleight of hand not a speck or spot resembling a mans head or face showed anywhere by this time she was alarmed and her alarm intensified when she perceived a little beyond the scene of her husbands bathing a small area of water the quality of whose surface differed from that of the surrounding expanse as the coarse vegetation of some foul patch in a mead differs from the fine green of the remainder elsewhere it looked flexuous here it looked vermiculated and lumpy and her marine experiences suggested to her in a moment that two currents met and caused a turmoil at this place she descended as hastily as her trembling limbs would allow the way down was terribly long and before reaching the heap of clothes it occurred to her that after all it would be best to run first for help hastening along in a lateral direction she proceeded inland till she met a man and soon afterwards two others to them she exclaimed i think a gentleman who was bathing is in some danger i cannot see him as i could will you please run and help him at once if you will be so kind she did not think of turning to show them the exact spot indicating it vaguely by the direction of her hand and still going on her way with the idea of gaining more assistance when she deemed in her faintness that she had carried the alarm far enough she faced about and dragged herself back again before reaching the now dreaded spot she met one of the men we can see nothing at all miss he declared having gained the beach she found the tide in and no sign of charleys clothes the other men whom she had besought to come had disappeared it must have been in some other direction for she had not met them going away they finding nothing had probably thought her alarm a mere conjecture and given up the quest baptista sank down upon the stones near at hand where charley had undressed was now sea there could not be the least doubt that he was drowned and his body sucked under by the current while his clothes lying within highwater mark had probably been carried away by the rising tide she remained in a stupor for some minutes till a strange sensation succeeded the aforesaid perceptions mystifying her intelligence and leaving her physically almost inert with his personal disappearance the last three days of her life with him seemed to be swallowed up also his image in her minds eye waned curiously receded far away grew stranger and stranger less and less real their meeting and marriage had been so sudden unpremeditated adventurous that she could hardly believe that she had played her part in such a reckless drama of all the few hours of her life with charles the portion that most insisted in coming back to memory was their fortuitous encounter on the previous saturday and those bitter reprimands with which he had begun the attack as it might be called which had piqued her to an unexpected consummation a sort of cruelty an imperiousness even in his warmth had characterized charles stow as a lover he had ever been a bit of a tyrant and it might pretty truly have been said that he had stung her into marriage with him at last still more alien from her life did these reflections operate to make him and then they would be chased away by an interval of passionate weeping and mad regret finally there returned upon the confused mind of the young wife the recollection that she was on her way homeward and that the packet would sail in threequarters of an hour except the parasol in her hand all she possessed was at the station awaiting her onward journey she looked in that direction and entering one of those undemonstrative phases so common with her walked quietly on at first she made straight for the railway but suddenly turning she went to a shop and wrote an anonymous line announcing his death by drowning to the only person she had ever heard charles mention as a relative posting this stealthily and with a fearful look around her she seemed to acquire a terror of the late events pursuing her way to the station as if followed by a spectre when she got to the office she asked for the luggage that she had left there on the saturday as well as the trunk left on the morning just lapsed all were put in the boat and she herself followed quickly as these things had been done the whole proceeding nevertheless had been almost automatic on baptistas part ere she had come to any definite conclusion on her course just before the bell rang she heard a conversation on the pier which removed the last shade of doubt from her mind if any had existed that she was charles stows widow the sentences were but fragmentary but she could easily piece them out a man drowned swam out too far was a stranger to the place people in boat saw him go down couldnt get there in time the news was little more definite than this as yet though it may as well be stated once for all that the statement was true charley with the overconfidence of his nature had ventured out too far for his strength and succumbed in the absence of assistance his lifeless body being at the moment suspended in the transparent middepths of the bay his clothes however had merely been gently lifted by the rising tide and floated into a nook hard by where they lay out of sight of the passersby till a day or two after iv in ten minutes they were steaming out of the harbour for their voyage of four or five hours at whose ending she would have to tell her strange story as penzephyr and all its environing scenes disappeared behind mousehole and st clements isle baptistas ephemeral meteorlike husband impressed her yet more as a fantasy she was still in such a trancelike state that she had been an hour on the little packetboat before she became aware of the agitating fact that mr heddegan was on board with her involuntarily she slipped from her left hand the symbol of her wifehood heehee well the truth is i wouldnt interrupt ee i reckon she dont see me or wont see me i said and whats the hurry shell see enough o me soon i hope ye be well mee deer he was a hale wellconditioned man of about five and fifty of the complexion common to those whose lives are passed on the bluffs and beaches of an ocean isle he extended the four quarters of his face in a genial smile and his hand for a grasp of the same magnitude she gave her own in surprised docility and he continued i couldnt help coming across to meet ee what an unfortunate thing you missing the boat and not coming saturday they meant to have warned ee that the time was changed but forgot it at the last moment the truth is that i should have informed ee myself but i was that busy finishing up a job last week so as to have this week free that i trusted to your father for attending to these little things however so plain and quiet as it is all to be it really do not matter so much as it might otherwise have done and i hope ye havent been greatly put out now if youd sooner that i should not be seen talking to ee if ee feel shy at all before strangers just say ill leave ee to yourself till we get home thank you much i am indeed a little tired mr heddegan he nodded urbane acquiescence strolled away immediately and minutely inspected the surface of the funnel till some female passengers of giants town tittered at what they must have thought a rebuff for the approaching wedding was known to many on st marias island though to nobody elsewhere baptista coloured at their satire and called him back and forced herself to commune with him in at least a mechanically friendly manner the opening event had been thus different from her expectation and she had adumbrated no act to meet it taken aback she passively allowed circumstances to pilot her along and so the voyage was made it was near dusk when they touched the pier of giants town where several friends and neighbours stood awaiting them her father had a lantern in his hand her mother too was there reproachfully glad that the delay had at last ended so simply mrs trewthen and her daughter went together along the giants walk or promenade to the house rather in advance of her husband and mr heddegan who talked in loud tones which reached the women over their shoulders some would have called mrs trewthen a good mother but though well meaning she was maladroit and her intentions missed their mark this might have been partly attributable to the slight deafness from which she suffered now as usual the chief utterances came from her lips ah yes im so glad my child that youve got over safe it is all ready and everything so well arranged that nothing but misfortune could hinder you settling as with gods grace becomes ee close to your mothers door amost twill be a great blessing im sure and i was very glad to find from your letters that youd held your word sacred thats right make your word your bond always mrs wace seems to be a sensible woman i hope the lord will do for her as hes doing for you no long time hence and how did ee get over the terrible journey from toruponsea to penzephyr once youd done with the railway of course you seemed quite at home well baptista conduct yourself seemly and all will be well thus admonished baptista entered the house her father and mr heddegan immediately at her back her mother had been so didactic that she had felt herself absolutely unable to broach the subjects in the centre of her mind the familiar room with the dark ceiling the wellspread table the old chairs had never before spoken so eloquently of the times ere she knew or had heard of charley stow she went upstairs to take off her things her mother remaining below to complete the disposition of the supper and attend to the preparation of tomorrows meal altogether composing such an array of pies from pies of fish to pies of turnips as was never heard of outside the western duchy baptista once alone sat down and did nothing and was called before she had taken off her bonnet im coming she cried jumping up and speedily disapparelling herself brushed her hair with a few touches and went down two or three of mr heddegans and her fathers friends had dropped in and expressed their sympathy for the delay she had been subjected to the meal was a most merry one except to baptista she had desired privacy and there was none and to break the news was already a greater difficulty than it had been at first everything around her animate and inanimate great and small insisted that she had come home to be married and she could not get a chance to say nay one or two people sang songs as overtures to the melody of the morrow till at length bedtime came and they all withdrew her mother having retired a little earlier when baptista found herself again alone in her bedroom the case stood as before she had come home with much to say and she had said nothing it was now growing clear even to herself that charles being dead she had not determination sufficient within her to break tidings which had he been alive would have imperatively announced themselves and thus with the stroke of midnight came the turning of the scale her story should remain untold it was not that upon the whole she thought it best not to attempt to tell it but that she could not undertake so explosive a matter to stop the wedding now would cause a convulsion in giants town little short of volcanic weakened tired and terrified as she had been by the days adventures she could not make herself the author of such a catastrophe but how refuse heddegan without telling it really seemed to her as if her marriage with mr heddegan were about to take place as if nothing had intervened morning came the events of the previous days were cut off from her present existence by scene and sentiment more completely than ever charles stow had grown to be a special being of whom owing to his character she entertained rather fearful than loving memory baptista could hear when she awoke that her parents were already moving about downstairs but she did not rise till her mothers rather rough voice resounded up the staircase as it had done on the preceding evening baptista come time to be stirring the man will be here by heavens blessing in threequarters of an hour he has looked in already for a minute or two and says hes going to the church to see if things be well forward baptista arose looked out of the window and took the easy course when she emerged from the regions above she was arrayed in her new silk frock and best stockings wearing a linen jacket over the former for breakfasting and her common slippers over the latter not to spoil the new ones on the rough precincts of the dwelling it is unnecessary to dwell at any great length on this part of the mornings proceedings she revealed nothing and married heddegan as she had given her word to do on that appointed august day v mr heddegan forgave the coldness of his brides manner during and after the wedding ceremony full well aware that there had been considerable reluctance on her part to acquiesce in this neighbourly arrangement and as a philosopher of long standing holding that whatever baptistas attitude now the conditions would probably be much the same six months hence as those which ruled among other married couples an absolutely unexpected shock was given to baptistas listless mind about an hour after the wedding service they had nearly finished the midday dinner when the now husband said to her father we think of starting about two and the breeze being so fair we shall bring up inside penzephyr new pier about six at least what are we going to penzephyr said baptista i dont know anything of it didnt you tell her asked her father of heddegan it transpired that owing to the delay in her arrival this proposal too among other things had in the hurry not been mentioned to her except some time ago as a general suggestion that they would go somewhere heddegan had imagined that any trip would be pleasant and one to the mainland the pleasantest of all she looked so distressed at the announcement that her husband willingly offered to give it up though he had not had a holiday off the island for a whole year then she pondered on the inconvenience of staying at giants town where all the inhabitants were bonded by the circumstances of their situation into a sort of family party which permitted and encouraged on such occasions as these oral criticism that was apt to disturb the equanimity of newly married girls and would especially worry baptista in her strange situation hence unexpectedly she agreed not to disorganize her husbands plans for the wedding jaunt and it was settled that as originally intended they should proceed in a neighbours sailing boat to the metropolis of the district in this way they arrived at penzephyr without difficulty or mishap bidding adieu to jenkin and his man who had sailed them over they strolled arm in arm off the pier baptista silent cold and obedient heddegan had arranged to take her as far as plymouth before their return but to go no further than where they had landed that day their first business was to find an inn and in this they had unexpected difficulty since for some reason or other possibly the fine weather many of the nearest at hand were full of tourists and commercial travellers he led her on till he reached a tavern which though comparatively unpretending stood in as attractive a spot as any in the town and this somewhat to their surprise after their previous experience they found apparently empty the considerate old man thinking that baptista was educated to artistic notions though he himself was deficient in them had decided that it was most desirable to have on such an occasion as the present an apartment with a good view the expression being one he had often heard in use among tourists and he therefore asked for a favourite room on the first floor from which a bowwindow protruded for the express purpose of affording such an outlook the landlady after some hesitation said she was sorry that particular apartment was engaged the next one however or any other in the house was unoccupied the gentleman who has the best one will give it up tomorrow and then you can change into it she added as mr heddegan hesitated about taking the adjoining and less commanding one we shall be gone tomorrow and shant want it he said wishing not to lose customers the landlady earnestly continued that since he was bent on having the best room perhaps the other gentleman would not object to move at once into the one they despised since though nothing could be seen from the window the room was equally large well if he doesnt care for a view said mr heddegan with the air of a highly artistic man who did o no i am sure he doesnt she said i can promise that you shall have the room you want if you would not object to go for a walk for half an hour i could have it ready and your things in it and a nice tea laid in the bowwindow by the time you come back this proposal was deemed satisfactory by the fussy old tradesman and they went out baptista nervously conducted him in an opposite direction to her walk of the former day in other company showing on her wan face had he observed it how much she was beginning to regret her sacrificial step for mending matters that morning she took advantage of a moment when her husbands back was turned to inquire casually in a shop if anything had been heard of the gentleman who was sucked down in the eddy while bathing the shopman said yes his body has been washed ashore and had just handed baptista a newspaper on which she discerned the heading a schoolmaster drowned while bathing when her husband turned to join her she might have pursued the subject without raising suspicion but it was more than flesh and blood could do and completing a small purchase almost ran out of the shop what is your terrible hurry mee deer said heddegan hastening after i dont know i dont want to stay in shops she gasped and we wont he said they are suffocating this weather lets go back and have some tay they found the much desired apartment awaiting their entry it was a sort of combination bed and sittingroom and the table was prettily spread with high tea in the bowwindow a bunch of flowers in the midst and a bestparlour chair on each side here they shared the meal by the ruddy light of the vanishing sun but though the view had been engaged regardless of expense exclusively for baptistas pleasure she did not direct any keen attention out of the window her gaze as often fell on the floor and walls of the room as elsewhere and on the table as much as on either beholding nothing at all but there was a change opposite her seat was the door upon which her eyes presently became riveted like those of a little bird upon a snake for on a peg at the back of the door there hung a hat such a hat surely from its peculiar make the actual hat that had been worn by charles conviction grew to certainty when she saw a railway ticket sticking up from the band charles had put the ticket there she had noticed the act her teeth almost chattered she murmured something incoherent her husband jumped up and said you are not well what is it what shall i get ee smelling salts she said quickly and desperately at the chemists shop you were in just now he jumped up like the anxious old man that he was caught up his own hat from a back table and without observing the other hastened out and downstairs left alone she gazed and gazed at the back of the door then spasmodically rang the bell an honestlooking country maidservant appeared in response a hat murmured baptista pointing with her finger it does not belong to us o yes ill take it away said the young woman with some hurry it belongs to the other gentleman she spoke with a certain awkwardness and took the hat out of the room baptista had recovered her outward composure the other gentleman she said where is the other gentleman hes in the next room maam he removed out of this to oblige ee how can you say so i should hear him if he were there said baptista sufficiently recovered to argue down an apparent untruth hes there said the girl hardily then it is strange that he makes no noise said mrs heddegan convicting the girl of falsity by a look he makes no noise but it is not strange said the servant all at once a dread took possession of the brides heart like a cold hand laid thereon for it flashed upon her that there was a possibility of reconciling the girls statement with her own knowledge of facts why does he make no noise she weakly said the waitingmaid was silent and looked at her questioner if i tell you maam you wont tell missis she whispered baptista promised because hes alying dead said the girl hes the schoolmaster that was drowned yesterday o said the bride covering her eyes then he was in this room till just now yes said the maid thinking the young ladys agitation natural enough and i told missis that i thought she oughtnt to have done it because i dont hold it right to keep visitors so much in the dark where deaths concerned but she said the gentleman didnt die of anything infectious she was a poor honest innkeepers wife she says who had to get her living by making hay while the sun sheened and owing to the drowned gentleman being brought here she said it kept so many people away that we were empty though all the other houses were full so when your good man set his mind upon the room and she would have lost good paying folk if hed not had it it wasnt to be supposed she said that shed let anything stand in the way ye wont say that ive told ye please mm all the linen has been changed and as the inquest wont be till tomorrow after you are gone she thought you wouldnt know a word of it being strangers here the returning footsteps of her husband broke off further narration baptista waved her hand for she could not speak the waitingmaid quickly withdrew and mr heddegan entered with the smelling salts and other nostrums any better he questioned i dont like the hotel she exclaimed almost simultaneously i cant bear it it doesnt suit me is that all thats the matter he returned pettishly this being the first time of his showing such a mood upon my heart and life such trifling is trying to any mans temper baptista sending me about from here to yond and then when i come back saying ee dont like the place that i have sunk so much money and words to get for ee od dang it all tis enough to but i wont say any more at present mee deer though it is just too much to expect to turn out of the house now we shant get another quiet place at this time of the evening every other inn in the town is bustling with rackety folk of one sort and tother while here tis as quiet as the grave the country i would say so bide still dye hear and tomorrow we shall be out of the town altogether as early as you like the obstinacy of age had in short overmastered its complaisance and the young woman said no more the simple course of telling him that in the adjoining room lay a corpse which had lately occupied their own might it would have seemed have been an effectual one without further disclosure but to allude to that subject however it was disguised was more than heddegans young wife had strength for horror broke her down in the contingency one thing only presented itself to her paralysed regard that here she was doomed to abide in a hideous contiguity to the dead husband and the living and her conjecture did in fact bear itself out that night she lay between the two men she had married heddegan on the one hand and on the other through the partition against which the bed stood charles stow vi kindly time had withdrawn the foregoing event three days from the present of baptista heddegan it was ten oclock in the morning she had been ill not in an ordinary or definite sense but in a state of cold stupefaction from which it was difficult to arouse her so much as to say a few sentences when questioned she had replied that she was pretty well their trip as such had been something of a failure they had gone on as far as falmouth but here he had given way to her entreaties to return home this they could not very well do without repassing through penzephyr at which place they had now again arrived in the train she had seen a weekly local paper and read there a paragraph detailing the inquest on charles it was added that the funeral was to take place at his native town of redrutin on friday after reading this she had shown no reluctance to enter the fatal neighbourhood of the tragedy only stipulating that they should take their rest at a different lodging from the first and now comparatively braced up and calm indeed a cooler creature altogether than when last in the town she said to david that she wanted to walk out for a while as they had plenty of time on their hands to a shop as usual i suppose mee deer partly for shopping she said and it will be best for you dear to stay in after trotting about so much and have a good rest while i am gone he assented and baptista sallied forth as she had stated her first visit was made to a shop a drapers without the exercise of much choice she purchased a black bonnet and veil also a black stuff gown a black mantle she already wore these articles were made up into a parcel which in spite of the saleswomans offers her customer said she would take with her bearing it on her arm she turned to the railway and at the station got a ticket for redrutin thus it appeared that on her recovery from the paralysed mood of the former day while she had resolved not to blast utterly the happiness of her present husband by revealing the history of the departed one she had also determined to indulge a certain odd inconsequent feminine sentiment of decency to the small extent to which it could do no harm to any person at redrutin she emerged from the railway carnage in the black attire purchased at the shop having during the transit made the change in the empty compartment she had chosen the other clothes were now in the bandbox and parcel leaving these at the cloakroom she proceeded onward and after a wary survey reached the side of a hill whence a view of the burial ground could be obtained it was now a little before two oclock while baptista waited a funeral procession ascended the road baptista hastened across and by the time the procession entered the cemetery gates she had unobtrusively joined it in addition to the schoolmasters own relatives not a few the paragraph in the newspapers of his death by drowning had drawn together many neighbours acquaintances and onlookers among them she passed unnoticed and with a quiet step pursued the winding path to the chapel and afterwards thence to the grave when all was over and the relatives and idlers had withdrawn she stepped to the edge of the chasm from beneath her mantle she drew a little bunch of forgetmenots and dropped them in upon the coffin in a few minutes she also turned and went away from the cemetery by five oclock she was again in penzephyr you have been a mortal long time said her husband crossly i allowed you an hour at most mee deer it occupied me longer said she well i reckon it is wasting words to complain hang it ye look so tired and wisht that i cant find heart to say what i would i am weary and wisht david i am we can get home tomorrow for certain i hope we can and please god we will said mr heddegan heartily as if he too were weary of his brief honeymoon i must be into business again on monday morning at latest they left by the next morning steamer and in the afternoon took up their residence in their own house at giants town the hour that she reached the island it was as if a material weight had been removed from baptistas shoulders her husband attributed the change to the influence of the local breezes after the hothouse atmosphere of the mainland however that might be settled here a few doors from her mothers dwelling she recovered in no very long time much of her customary bearing which was never very demonstrative she accepted her position calmly and faintly smiled when her neighbours learned to call her mrs heddegan and said she seemed likely to become the leader of fashion in giants town her husband was a man who had made considerably more money by trade than her father had done and perhaps the greater profusion of surroundings at her command than she had heretofore been mistress of was not without an effect upon her one week two weeks three weeks passed and being preeminently a young woman who allowed things to drift she did nothing whatever either to disclose or conceal traces of her first marriage or to learn if there existed possibilities which there undoubtedly did by which that hasty contract might become revealed to those about her at any unexpected moment while yet within the first month of her marriage and on an evening just before sunset baptista was standing within her garden adjoining the house when she saw passing along the road a personage clad in a greasy black coat and battered tall hat which common enough in the slums of a city had an odd appearance in st marias the tramp as he seemed to be marked her at once bonnetless and unwrapped as she was her features were plainly recognizable and with an air of friendly surprise came and leant over the wall what dont you know me said he she had some dim recollection of his face but said that she was not acquainted with him why your witness to be sure maam dont you mind the man that was mending the churchwindow when you and your intended husband walked up to be made one and the clerk called me down from the ladder and i came and did my part by writing my name and occupation baptista glanced quickly around her husband was out of earshot that would have been of less importance but for the fact that the wedding witnessed by this personage had not been the wedding with mr heddegan but the one on the day previous ive had a misfortune since then thats pulled me under continued her friend but dont let me damp yer wedded joy by naming the particulars yes ive seen changes since though tis but a short time ago let me see only a month next week i think for twere the first or second day in august yes thats when it was said another man a sailor who had come up with a pipe in his mouth and felt it necessary to join in baptista having receded to escape further speech for that was the first time i set foot in giants town and her husband took her to him the same day a dialogue then proceeded between the two men outside the wall which baptista could not help hearing ay i signed the book that made her one flesh repeated the decayed glazier wheres her goodman about the premises somewhere but you dont seeem together much replied the sailor in an undertone you see hes older than she older i should never have thought it from my own observation said the glazier he was a remarkably handsome man handsome well there he is we can see for ourselves david heddegan had indeed just shown himself at the upper end of the garden and the glazier looking in bewilderment from the husband to the wife saw the latter turn pale now that decayed glazier was a farseeing and cunning man too farseeing and cunning to allow himself to thrive by simple and straightforward means and he held his peace till he could read more plainly the meaning of this riddle merely added carelessly well marriage do alter a man tis true i should never ha knowed him he then stared oddly at the disconcerted baptista and moving on to where he could again address her asked her to do him a good turn since he once had done the same for her understanding that he meant money she handed him some at which he thanked her and instantly went away vii she had escaped exposure on this occasion but the incident had been an awkward one and should have suggested to baptista that sooner or later the secret must leak out as it was she suspected that at any rate she had not heard the last of the glazier in a day or two when her husband had gone to the old town on the other side of the island there came a gentle tap at the door and the worthy witness of her first marriage made his appearance a second time it took me hours to get to the bottom of the mystery hours he said with a gaze of deep confederacy which offended her pride very deeply but thanks to a good intellect ive done it now maam im not a man to tell tales even when a tale would be so good as this but im going back to the mainland again and a little assistance would be as rain on thirsty ground i helped you two days ago began baptista yes but what was that my good lady not enough to pay my passage to penzephyr i came over on your account for i thought there was a mystery somewhere now i must go back on my own mind this twould be very awkward for you if your old man were to know hes a queer temper though he may be fond she knew as well as her visitor how awkward it would be and the hushmoney she paid was heavy that day she had however the satisfaction of watching the man to the steamer and seeing him diminish out of sight but baptista perceived that the system into which she had been led of purchasing silence thus was one fatal to her peace of mind particularly if it had to be continued hearing no more from the glazier she hoped the difficulty was past but another week only had gone by when as she was pacing the giants walk the name given to the promenade she met the same personage in the company of a fat woman carrying a bundle this is the lady my dear he said to his companion this maam is my wife weve come to settle in the town for a time if so be we can find room that you wont do said she nobody can live here who is not privileged i am privileged said the glazier by my trade baptista went on but in the afternoon she received a visit from the mans wife this honest woman began to depict in forcible colours the necessity for keeping up the concealment i will intercede with my husband maam she said hes a true man if rightly managed and ill beg him to consider your position tis a very nice house youve got here she added glancing round and well worth a little sacrifice to keep it the unlucky baptista staved off the danger on this third occasion as she had done on the previous two but she formed a resolve that if the attack were once more to be repeated she would face a revelation worse though that must now be than before she had attempted to purchase silence by bribes her tormentors never believing her capable of acting upon such an intention came again but she shut the door in their faces they retreated muttering something but she went to the back of the house where david heddegan was she looked at him unconscious of all the case was serious she knew that well and all the more serious in that she liked him better now than she had done at first yet as she herself began to see the secret was one that was sure to disclose itself her name and charless stood indelibly written in the registers and though a month only had passed as yet it was a wonder that his clandestine union with her had not already been discovered by his friends thus spurring herself to the inevitable she spoke to heddegan david come indoors i have something to tell you he hardly regarded her at first she had discerned that during the last week or two he had seemed preoccupied as if some private business harassed him she repeated her request he replied with a sigh yes certainly mee deer when they had reached the sittingroom and shut the door she repeated faintly david i have something to tell you a sort of tragedy i have concealed you will hate me for having so far deceived you but perhaps my telling you voluntarily will make you think a little better of me than you would do otherwise tragedy he said awakening to interest much you can know about tragedies mee deer that have been in the world so short a time she saw that he suspected nothing and it made her task the harder but on she went steadily it is about something that happened before we were married she said indeed not a very long time before a short time and it is about a lover she faltered i dont much mind that he said mildly in truth i was in hopes twas more in hopes well yes this screwed her up to the necessary effort i met my old sweetheart he scorned me chid me dared me and i went and married him we were coming straight here to tell you all what we had done but he was drowned and i thought i would say nothing about him and i married you david for the sake of peace and quietness ive tried to keep it from you but have found i cannot there thats the substance of it and you can never never forgive me i am sure she spoke desperately but the old man instead of turning black or blue or slaying her in his indignation jumped up from his chair and began to caper around the room in quite an ecstatic emotion o happy thing how well it falls out he exclaimed snapping his fingers over his head haha the knot is cut i see a way out of my trouble haha she looked at him without uttering a sound till as he still continued smiling joyfully she said o what do you mean is it done to torment me no no o mee deer your story helps me out of the most heartaching quandary a poor man ever found himself in you see it is this ive got a tragedy too and unless you had had one to tell i could never have seen my way to tell mine what is yours what is it she asked with altogether a new view of things well it is a bouncer mine is a bouncer said he looking on the ground and wiping his eyes not worse than mine well that depends upon how you look at it yours had to do with the past alone and i dont mind it you see weve been married a month and it dont jar upon me as it would if wed only been married a day or two now mine refers to past present and future so that past present and future she murmured it never occurred to me that you had a tragedy too but i have he said shaking his head in fact four then tell em cried the young woman i will i will but be considerate i beg ee mee deer well i wasnt a bachelor when i married ee any more than you were a spinster just as you was a widowwoman i was a widowman ah said she with some surprise but is that all then we are nicely balanced she added relieved no it is not all theres the point i am not only a widower o david i am a widower with four tragedies that is to say four strapping girls the eldest taller than you dont ee look so struck dumblike it fell out in this way i knew the poor woman their mother in penzephyr for some years and to cut a long story short i privately married her at last just before she died i kept the matter secret but it is getting known among the people here by degrees ive long felt for the children that it is my duty to have them here and do something for them i have not had courage to break it to ee but ive seen lately that it would soon come to your ears and that hev worried me are they educated said the exschoolmistress no i am sorry to say they have been much neglected in truth they can hardly read and so i thought that by marrying a young schoolmistress i should get some one in the house who could teach em and bring em into genteel condition all for nothing you see they are growed up too tall to be sent to school o mercy she almost moaned four great girls to teach the rudiments to and have always in the house with me spelling over their books and i hate teaching it kills me i am bitterly punished i am i am youll get used to em mee deer and the balance of secrets mine against yours will comfort your heart with a sense of justice i could send for em this week very well and i will in faith i could send this very day baptista you have relieved me of all my difficulty thus the interview ended so far as this matter was concerned baptista was too stupefied to say more and when she went away to her room she wept from very mortification at mr heddegans duplicity education the one thing she abhorred the shame of it to delude a young wife so the next meal came round as they sat baptista would not suffer her eyes to turn towards him he did not attempt to intrude upon her reserve but every now and then looked under the table and chuckled with satisfaction at the aspect of affairs how very well matched we be he said comfortably next day when the steamer came in baptista saw her husband rush down to meet it and soon after there appeared at her door four tall hipless shoulderless girls dwindling in height and size from the eldest to the youngest like a row of pan pipes at the head of them standing heddegan he smiled pleasantly through the grey fringe of his whiskers and beard and turning to the girls said now come forrard and shake hands properly with your stepmother thus she made their acquaintance and he went out leaving them together on examination the poor girls turned out to be not only plainlooking which she could have forgiven but to have such a lamentably meagre intellectual equipment as to be hopelessly inadequate as companions even the eldest almost her own age could only read with difficulty words of two syllables and taste in dress was beyond their comprehension in the long vista of future years she saw nothing but dreary drudgery at her detested old trade without prospect of reward she went about quite despairing during the next few days an unpromising unfortunate mood for a woman who had not been married six weeks from her parents she concealed everything they had been amongst the few acquaintances of heddegan who knew nothing of his secret and were indignant enough when they saw such a readymade household foisted upon their only child but she would not support them in their remonstrances no you dont yet know all she said thus baptista had sense enough to see the retributive fairness of this issue for some time whenever conversation arose between her and heddegan which was not often she always said i am miserable and you know it yet i dont wish things to be otherwise but one day when he asked how do you like em now her answer was unexpected much better than i did she said quietly i may like them very much some day this was the beginning of a serener season for the chastened spirit of baptista heddegan she had in truth discovered underneath the crust of uncouthness and meagre articulation which was due to their troglodytean existence that her unwelcomed daughters had natures that were unselfish almost to sublimity the harsh discipline accorded to their young lives before their mothers wrong had been righted had operated less to crush them than to lift them above all personal ambition they considered the world and its contents in a purely objective way and their own lot seemed only to affect them as that of certain human beings among the rest whose troubles they knew rather than suffered this was such an entirely new way of regarding life to a woman of baptistas nature that her attention from being first arrested by it became deeply interested by imperceptible pulses her heart expanded in sympathy with theirs the sentences of her tragicomedy her life confused till now became clearer daily that in humanity as exemplified by these girls there was nothing to dislike but infinitely much to pity she learnt with the lapse of each week in their company she grew to like the girls of unpromising exterior and from liking she got to love them till they formed an unexpected point of junction between her own and her husbands interests generating a sterling friendship at least between a pair in whose existence there had threatened to be neither friendship nor love george moore a faithful heart the speaker april part i it was a lovely morning and major shepherd walked rapidly his toes turned well out his shoulders set well back behind him floated the summer foliage of appleton park the family seat of the shepherds and at the end of the smooth white road lay the majors destination the small town of branbury the major was the medium height his features were regular and cleanly cut he would have been a handsome man if his eyes had not been two dark mudcoloured dots set close together wholly lacking in expression a long brown moustache swept picturesquely over bright smoothly shaven cheeks and the ends of this ornament were beginning to whiten the major was over forty he carried under his arm a brownpaper parcel the major was rarely seen without a brownpaper parcel and in it were things he could not possibly do without his diary and his letterbook the brownpaper parcel contained likewise a number of other papers it contained the majors notes for a book he was writing on the principal county families in buckinghamshire the major had been collecting information for this book for many years and with it he hoped to make two or three hundred pounds money which he stood sorely in need of and to advance his position in the county a position which in his opinion his father had done little to maintain and which to his very deep regret his sisters were now doing their best to compromise that very morning while packing up his brownpaper parcel some quarter of an hour ago he had had a somewhat angry interview on this subject with his sisters for he had thought it his duty to reprove them for keeping company with certain small london folk who had chosen to come to live in the neighbourhood ethel had said that they were not going to give up their friends because they were not good enough for him and maud had added significantly that they were quite sure that their friends were quite as good as the friend he was going to see in branbury the major turned on his heel and left the house as he walked towards branbury he asked himself if it were possible that they knew anything about charlotte street and as he approached the town he looked round nervously fearing lest some friend might pop down upon him and after some hesitation decided to take a long detour so as to avoid passing by the house of some people he knew as he made his way through a byestreet his step quickened and at the corner of charlotte street he looked round to make sure he was not followed he then drew his keys from his pocket and let himself into a small meanlooking house major shepherd might have spared himself the trouble of these precautions no one was minded to watch him for everyone knew perfectly well who lived in charlotte street it was common talk that the tall dark woman who lived in was mrs charles shepherd and that the little girl who ran by mrs shepherds side on the rare occasions when she was seen in the streets for it was said that the major did not wish her to walk much about the town lest she should attract the attention of the curious who might be tempted to make inquiries was the majors little daughter and it had been noticed that this little girl went forth now and then basket on her arm to do the marketing it was said that mrs shepherd had been a servant in some lodginghouse where the major had been staying other scandalmongers declared that they knew for certain that the major had made his wifes acquaintance in the street rumour had never wandered far from the truth the major had met his wife one night as he was coming home from his club they seemed to suit one another he saw her frequently for several months and then fearing to lose her in a sudden access of jealousy he had some time before been bitterly jilted he proposed to marry her the arrival of his parents who came up to town beseeching of him to do nothing rash only served to intensify his determination and losing his temper utterly he told his father and mother that he would never set his foot in appleton park in their lifetime if they ever again ventured to pry into his private affairs and refusing to give any information regarding his intentions he asked them to leave his lodgings what he did after they never knew years went by and they sighed and wondered but the matter was never alluded to in appleton park but the major had only ј a year and though he lived at appleton park never spending a penny more than was necessary he could not allow her more than ј a week he had so many expenses his club his clothes and all the incidental expenses he was put to in the grand houses where he went to stay by strict economy however mrs shepherd managed to make two ends meet except when she was too ill and had to call in a charwoman to help her with the heaviest part of the work she undertook the entire housework herself when times were hardest she had even taken in a lodger not thinking herself above cooking and taking up his dinner she had noticed that her economies endeared her to the major and it was pleasant to please him hers was a kindhearted simple nature that misfortune had brought down in the world but as is not uncommon with persons of weak character she possessed a clear sensible mind which allowed her to see things in their true lights and without difficulty she recognized the unalterable nature of her case it mattered little whether the major acknowledged her or not his family would never have anything to do with her the doors of society were for ever closed against her so within a year of her marriage with the major she was convinced that her marriage had better be kept a secret for by helping to keep it a secret she could make substantial amends to the man who had married her by proclaiming it to the world she would only alienate his affection she understood this very well and in all docility and obedience lent herself to the deception accepting without complaint a mean and clandestine existence but she would not allow her little girl to carry up a jug of hot water and it was only rarely when prostrate with pain that she allowed nellie to take the basket and run round to the butchers and buy a bit of steak for their dinner the heiress of appleton park must be brought up free from all degrading memory but for herself she had no care appleton park could never be anything to her even if she outlived the old people which was hardly probable what would she a poor invalid do there she did not wish to compromise her husbands future and still less the future of her darling daughter she could only hope that when dead her sins would be forgiven her and that this release might not be long delayed she often prayed the house was poor and she was miserable but any place was good enough to suffer in so she said when she rose and dragged herself downstairs to do a little cooking and the same thought came to her when she lay all alone in the little parlour furnished with what a few pounds could buy a paraffinlamp a round table a few chairs an old and illpadded mahogany armchair in which it was a torture to lie not an ornament on the chimneypiece not a flower not a book to while away the interminable hours from the barren little passage covered with a bit of oilcloth all and everything in was meagre and unimaginative the major had impressed his personality upon the house everything looked as if it had been scraped there was a time when mrs shepherd noticed the barrenness of her life but she had grown accustomed to it and she waited for the major in the terrible armchair glad when she heard his step almost happy when he sat by her and told her what was happening at home he took her hand and asked her how she was you are looking very tired alice yes im a little tired i have been working all the morning i made up my room and then i went out to the butchers and bought a piece of steak i have made you such a nice pudding for your lunch i hope you will like it theres not much fear about my liking any beefsteak pudding you make dear i never knew anyone who could make one like you but you should not tire yourself and just as you are beginning to get better mrs shepherd smiled and pressed her husbands hand the conversation fell at the end of a long silence mrs shepherd said what has happened to trouble you dear i know something has i can see it by your face then the major told how unpleasantly his sisters had answered him when he had ventured to suggest that they saw far too much of their new neighbours who were merely common sort of londoners and never would be received by the county im sure that someone must have told them of my visits here im sure they suspect something girls are very sharp nowadays i am sorry but it is no fault of mine i rarely leave the house and i never walk in the principal streets if i can possibly help it i know dear i know that no one can be more careful than you but as people are beginning to smell a rat notwithstanding all our precautions i suppose theres nothing for it but to go back to london oh you dont think it will be necessary to go back to london do you the place suits the child so well and it is so nice to see you almost every day and it is such a comfort when you are not here to know you are only a few miles away and from the top of the hill the trees of the park are visible and whenever i feel well enough i walk there and think of the time our nellie will be the mistress of all those broad acres it is the fault of the busybodies he said i cannot think what pleasure people find in meddling in other peoples affairs i never care what anyone else does i have quite enough to do thinking of my own mrs shepherd did not answer i see he said you dont like moving but if you remain here all the trouble we have taken not to get found out these last ten years will go for nothing there will be more worry and vexations and i really dont think i could bear much more i believe i should go off my head the little man spoke in a calm even voice and stroked his silky moustache gravely very well then my dear ill return to town as soon as you like as soon as it is convenient i daresay you are right im sure i am you have never found me giving you wrong advice yet have you dear then they went down to the kitchen to eat the steak pudding and when the major had finished his second helping he lit his pipe and the conversation turned on how they should get rid of their house and how much the furniture would fetch when he had decided to sell the furniture and had fixed the day of their departure mrs shepherd said theres one thing i have to ask you dear and i hope you wont refuse my request i should like to see appleton park before i leave i should like to go there with nellie and see the house and the lands that will one day belong to her i dont know how it is to be managed if you were to meet my mother and sisters they would be sure to suspect something at once no one will know who i am i should like to walk about the grounds for half an hour with the child if i dont see appleton now i never shall see it the major stroked his long silky moustache with his short crabbed little hand he remembered that he had heard the carriage ordered for two oclock they were all going to a tennisparty some miles distant under the circumstances she might walk about the grounds without being noticed he did not think any of the gardeners would question her and if they did he could trust her to give an evasive answer and then he would like her to see the place just to know what she thought of it wont you say yes she said at last her voice breaking the silence sharply i was just thinking dear they have all gone to a tennisparty today therell be no one at home well why not today well i was thinking ive been lucky enough to get hold of some very interesting information about the websters about their ancestor sir thomas who distinguished himself in the peninsular and i wanted to get it copied under the proper heading but i daresay we can do that another day the only thing is how are you to get there you are not equal to walking so far i was thinking dear that i might take a fly i know there is the expense but yes five or six shillings at least and where will you leave the fly at the lodge gate the flyman would be sure to get into conversation with the lodgekeeper or his wife hed tell them where he came from and supposing you were to get a twowheeled trap and drive me yourself that would be nicer still im so unlucky someone would be sure to see me the major puffed at his pipe in silence then he said if you were to put on a thick veil and we were to get out of the town by this end and make our way through the lanes it would be a long way round but one hardly meets anyone that way and the only danger would be going we should return in the dusk i dont care how late you make it my people wont be home till nine or ten oclock at night perhaps later still there will be dancing and they are sure to stay late finally the matter was decided and about four oclock the major went to the livery stable to order the trap mrs shepherd and nellie joined him soon after turning from the pony whose nose he was stroking he said i hope you have brought a thick shawl it will be cold coming back in the evening yes dear here it is and another for nellie what do you think of this veil it will do very well i do hope these stablemen wont talk lets go off at once the major lifted in the child tucked the rug about them and cried to the stableman to let go he drove very nervously afraid at every moment lest the pony should bolt and when the animals extreme docility assured him there was no such danger he looked round right and left expecting at every moment some friend to pounce down upon him but the ways were empty the breeze that came across the fields was fresh and sweet and they were all beginning to enjoy themselves when he suddenly espied a carriage following in his wake he whipped up the pony and contrived to distance his imaginary pursuer and having succeeded he praised his own driving and at the crossroads he said i dare not go any farther but you cant miss the lodge gate in that clump of trees the first white gate you come to dont ask any questions it is ten to one youll find the gate open walk straight through and dont forget to go through the beechwood at the back of the house the river runs right round the hill i want to know what you think of the view but pray dont ask to see the house theres nothing to see the housemaids would be sure to talk and describe you to my sisters so now goodbye hope youll enjoy yourself i shall have just time to get to hambrook and back i want to see my solicitor youll have seen everything in a couple of hours so in a couple of hours i shall be waiting for you here part ii it was as the major said the lodgekeepers asked no questions and they passed up the drive through the silence of an overgrowth of laurels and rhododendrons then the park opened before their eyes nellie rolled on the short crisp worn grass or chased the dragonflies the spreading trees enchanted her and looking at the house a grey stone building with steps pillars and pilasters hidden amid cedars and evergreen oaks she said i never saw anything so beautiful is that where the major goes when he leaves us look at the flowers mother and the roses may we not go in there i dont mean into the house i heard the major ask you not to go in for fear we should meet the housemaids but just past this railing into the garden here is the gate the child stood with her hand on the wicket waiting for reply the mother stood as in a dream looking at the house thinking vaguely of the pictures the corridors and staircases that lay behind the plateglass windows yes go in my child the gardens were in tumult of leaf and bloom and the little girl ran hither and thither gathering single flowers and then everything that came under her hands binding them together in bouquets one for mother one for the major and one for herself mrs shepherd only smiled a little bitterly when nellie came running to her with some new and more splendid rose she did not attempt to reprove the child why should she everything here would one day be hers why then should the present be denied them and so did her thoughts run as she walked across the sward following nellie into the beech wood that clothed the steep hillside the pathway led by the ruins of some danish military earthworks ancient hollows full of leaves and silence pigeons cooed in the vast green foliage and from time to time there came up from the river the chiming sound of oars rustic seats were at pleasant intervals and feeling a little tired mrs shepherd sat down she could see the rivers silver glinting through the branches and beyond the river the lowlying river lands dotted with cattle and horses grazing dim already with blue evening vapours in the warm solitude of the wood the irreparable misfortune of her own life pressed upon her and in this hour of lassitude her loneliness seemed more than she could bear the major was good and kind but he knew nothing of the weight of the burden he had laid upon her and that none should know was in this moment a greater weight than the burden itself nellie was exploring the ancient hollows where danes and saxons had once fought and had ceased to call forth her discoveries when mrs shepherds bitter meditation was broken by the sudden sound of a footstep the intruder was a young lady she was dressed in white her pale gold hair was in itself an aristocracy and her narrow slippered feet were dainty to look upon dont let me disturb you she said this is my favourite seat but i pray you not to move there is plenty of room so amiable was she in voice and manner that mrs shepherd could not but remain although she had already recognized the girl as one of the majors sisters fearing to betray herself greatly nervous mrs shepherd answered briefly miss shepherds allusions to the beauty of the view at the end of a long silence miss shepherd said i think you know my brother major shepherd mrs shepherd hesitated and then she said no i have never heard the name are you sure of course i may be mistaken but ethel made pause and looked mrs shepherd straight in the face smiling sadly mrs shepherd said likenesses are so deceptive perhaps but my memory is pretty good for faces it was two or three months ago we were going up to london and i saw my brother get into the train with a lady who looked like you she really was very like you mrs shepherd smiled and shook her head i do not know the lady my brother was with but ive often thought i should like to meet her perhaps your brother will introduce you no i dont think he will she has come to live at branbury and now people talk more then ever they say that he is secretly married and you believe it i dont see why it shouldnt be true my brother is a good fellow in many ways but like all other men he is selfish he is just the man who would keep his wife hidden away in a lonely little lodging rather than admit that he had made a mйsalliance what i dont understand is why she consents to be kept out of the way just fancy giving up this beautiful place these woods and fields these gardens that house for for i suppose this woman gives up these things because she loves your brother do you not understand selfsacrifice oh yes if i loved a man but i think a woman is silly to allow a man to cheat and fool her to the top of his bent what does it matter if she is happy ethel tossed her head then at the end of a long silence she said would you care to see the house no thank you miss i must be getting on goodbye you cannot get back that way you must return through the pleasuregrounds ill walk with you a headache kept me at home this afternoon the others have gone to a tennisparty it is a pity i was mistaken i should like to meet the person my brother goes every day to branbury to see i should like to talk with her my brother has im afraid persuaded her that we would not receive her but this is not true we should only be too glad to receive her i have heard father and mother say so not to charles they dare not speak to him on the subject but they have to me your brother must have some good reason for keeping his marriage secret this woman may have a past yes they say that but i should not care if i liked her if i knew her to be a good woman now to better keep the majors secret mrs shepherd had given up all friends all acquaintance she had not known a womanfriend for years and the affinities of sex drew her to accept the sympathy with which she was tempted the reaction of ten years of selfdenial surged up within her and she felt that she must speak that her secret was being dragged from her ethels eyes were fixed upon her in another moment she would have spoken but at that moment nellie appeared climbing up the steep bank is that your little girl oh what a pretty child then raising her eyes from the child and looking the mother straight in the face ethel said she is like she is strangely like charles tears glistened in mrs shepherds eyes and then no longer doubting that mrs shepherd would break down and in a flow of tears tell the whole story of her life ethel allowed a note of triumph to creep into her voice and before she could stop herself she said and that little girl is the heiress of appleton park mrs shepherds face changed expression you are mistaken miss shepherd she said but if i ever meet your brother i will tell him that you think my little girl like him mrs shepherd pursued her way slowly across the park her long weary figure showing upon the sunset her black dress trailing on the crisp grass often she was obliged to pause the emotion and exercise of the day had brought back pain and her whole body thrilled with it since the birth of her child she had lived in pain but as she leaned against the white gate and looked back on the beautiful park never to be seen by her again knowledge of her sacrifice quickened within her the house and the park and the manner and speech of the young girl combined to help her to a full appreciation of all she had surrendered she regretted nothing however mean and obscure her life had been it had contained at least one noble moment nellie pursued the dragonflies mrs shepherd followed slowly feeling like a victor in a great battle she had not broken her trust she had kept her promise intact she would return to london tomorrow or next day or at the end of the week whenever the major wished he was waiting for them at the corner of the lane and nellie was already telling him all she thought of the house the woods the flowers and the lady who had sat down by mother on the bench above the river the major looked at his wife in doubt and fear her smile however reassured him soon after nellie fell asleep and while she dreamed of butterflies and flowers mrs shepherd told him what had passed between her and his sister in the beechwood above the river you see what i told you was right your appearance has been described to them they suspect something and will never cease worrying until they have found out everything im not a bit surprised ethel always was the more cunning and the more spiteful of the two mrs shepherd did not tell him how nearly she had been betrayed into confession she felt that he would not understand her explanation of the mood in which his sister had caught her men understand women so little to tell him would be merely to destroy his confidence in her as they drove through the twilight with nellie fast asleep between he spoke of her departure which he had arranged for the end of the week and then putting his arm round her waist he said you have always been a good little woman to me walter besant the solid gold reef company limited in deacons orders and other stories new york harper and bros act i you dear old boy said the girl i am sure i wish it could be with all my heart if i have any heart i dont believe you have replied the boy gloomily well but reg consider youve got no money ive got five thousand pounds if a man cant make his way upon that he must be a poor stick you would go abroad with it and dig and take your wife with you to wash and cook we would do something with the money here you should stay in london rosie yes in a suburban villa at shepherds bush perhaps no reg when i marry if ever i do i am in no hurry i will step out of this room into one exactly like it the room was a splendid drawingroom in palace gardens splendidly furnished i shall have my footmen and my carriage and i shall rosie give me the right to earn all these things for you the young man cried impetuously you can only earn them for me by the time you have one foot in the grave hadnt i better in the meantime marry some old gentleman with his one foot in the grave so as to be ready for you against the time you come home in two or three years the other foot i dare say would slide into the grave as well you laugh at my trouble you feel nothing if the pater would part but he wont he says he wants all his money for himself and that ive got to marry well besides reg here her face clouded and she lowered her voice there are times when he looks anxious we didnt always live in palace gardens suppose we should lose it all as quickly as we got it oh she shivered and trembled no i will never never marry a poor man get rich my dear boy and you may aspire even to the valuable possession of this heartless hand she held it out he took it pressed it stooped and kissed her then he dropped her hand and walked quickly out of the room poor reggie she murmured i wish i wish but what is the use of wishing act ii two men one young the other about fifty sat in the veranda of a small bungalow it was after breakfast they lay back in long bamboo chairs each with a cigar it looked as if they were resting in reality they were talking business and that very seriously yes sir said the elder man with something of an american accent i have somehow taken a fancy to this place the situation is healthy well i dont know ive had more than one touch of fever here the climate is lovely except in the rains the soil is fertile ive dropped five thousand in it and they havent come up again yet they will i have been round the estate and i see money in it well sir heres my offer five thousand down hard cash as soon as the papers are signed reginald sat up he was on the point of accepting the proposal when a pony rode up to the house and the rider a native groom jumped off and gave him a note he opened it and read it was from his nearest neighbour two or three miles away dont sell that man your estate gold has been found the whole country is full of gold hold on hes an assayer if he offers to buy be quite sure that he has found gold on your land fg he put the note into his pocket gave a verbal message to the boy and turned to his guest without betraying the least astonisment or emotion i beg your pardon the note was from bellamy my next neighbour well you were saying only that i have taken a fancy perhaps a foolish fancy to this place of yours and ill give you if you like all that you have spent upon it well he replied reflectively but with a little twinkle in his eye that seems handsome but the place isnt really worth the half that i spent upon it anybody would tell you that come let us be honest whatever we are ill tell you a better way we will put the matter into the hands of bellamy he knows what a coffee plantation is worth he shall name a price and if we can agree upon that we will make a deal of it the other man changed colour he wanted to settle the thing at once as between gentlemen what need of third parties but reginald stood firm and he presently rode away quite sure that in a day or two this planter too would have heard the news a month later the young coffeeplanter stood on the deck of a steamer homeward bound in his pocketbook was a plan of his auriferous estate in a bag hanging round his neck was a small collection of yellow nuggets in his boxes was a chosen assortment of quartz act iii well sir said the financier youve

city now let us sit down and talk about what we shall do dont you ridiculous boy act v another house just like the first the bride stepped out of one palace into another with their five or six thousand a year the young couple could just manage to make both ends meet the husband was devoted the wife had everything that she could wish who could be happier than this pair in a nest so luxurious their life so padded their days so full of sunshine it was a year after marriage the wife contrary to her usual custom was the first at breakfast a few letters were waiting for her chiefly invitations she opened and read them among them lay one addressed to her husband not looking at the address she opened and read that as well dear reginald i venture to address you as an old friend of your own and schoolfellow of your mothers i am a widow with four children my husband was the vicar of your old parish you remember him and me i was left with a little income of about two hundred a year twelve months ago i was persuaded in order to double my income a thing which seemed certain from the prospectus to invest everything in a new and rich gold mine everything and the mine has never paid anything the company it is called the solid gold reef company is in liquidation because though there is really the gold there it costs too much to get it i have no relatives anywhere to help me unless i can get assistance my children and i must go at once tomorrow into the workhouse yes we are paupers i am ruined by the cruel lies of that prospectus and the wickedness which deluded me and i know not how many others out of my money i have been foolish and am punished but those people who will punish them help me if you can my dear reginald oh for gods sake help my children and me help your mothers friend your own old friend this said rosie meditatively is exactly the kind of thing to make reggie uncomfortable why it might make him unhappy all day better burn it she dropped the letter into the fire hes an impulsive emotional nature and he doesnt understand the city if people are so foolish what a lot of fibs the poor old pater does tell to be sure hes a regular novelist oh here you are you lazy boy kiss me rosie he looked as handsome as apollo and as cheerful i wish all the world were as happy as you and me heigho some poor devils im afraid tea or coffee reg henry james the tree of knowledge the soft side london methuen and co i it was one of the secret opinions such as we all have of peter brench that his main success in life would have consisted in his never having committed himself about the work as it was called of his friend morgan mallow this was a subject on which it was to the best of his belief impossible with veracity to quote him and it was nowhere on record that he had in the connexion on any occasion and in any embarrassment either lied or spoken the truth such a triumph had its honour even for a man of other triumphs a man who had reached fifty who had escaped marriage who had lived within his means who had been in love with mrs mallow for years without breathing it and who last but not least had judged himself once for all he had so judged himself in fact that he felt an extreme and general humility to be his proper portion yet there was nothing that made him think so well of his parts as the course he had steered so often through the shallows just mentioned it became thus a real wonder that the friends in whom he had most confidence were just those with whom he had most reserves he couldnt tell mrs mallow or at least he supposed excellent man he couldnt that she was the one beautiful reason he had never married any more than he could tell her husband that the sight of the multiplied marbles in that gentlemans studio was an affliction of which even time had never blunted the edge his victory however as i have intimated in regard to these productions was not simply in his not having let it out that he deplored them it was remarkably in his not having kept it in by anything else the whole situation among these good people was verily a marvel and there was probably not such another for a long way from the spot that engages us the point at which the soft declivity of hampstead began at that time to confess in broken accents to saint johns wood he despised mallows statues and adored mallows wife and yet was distinctly fond of mallow to whom in turn he was equally dear mrs mallow rejoiced in the statues though she preferred when pressed the busts and if she was visibly attached to peter brench it was because of his affection for morgan each loved the other moreover for the love borne in each case to lancelot whom the mallows respectively cherished as their only child and whom the friend of their fireside identified as the third but decidedly the handsomest of his godsons already in the old years it had come to that that no one for such a relation could possibly have occurred to any of them even to the baby itself but peter there was luckily a certain independence of the pecuniary sort all round the master could never otherwise have spent his solemn wanderjahre in florence and rome and continued by the thames as well as by the arno and the tiber to add unpurchased group to group and model for what was too apt to prove in the event mere love fancyheads of celebrities either too busy or too buried too much of the age or too little of it to sit neither could peter lounging in almost daily have found time to keep the whole complicated tradition so alive by his presence he was massive but mild the depositary of these mysteries large and loose and ruddy and curly with deep tones deep eyes deep pockets to say nothing of the habit of long pipes soft hats and brownish greyish weatherfaded clothes apparently always the same he had written it was known but had never spoken never spoken in particular of that and he had the air since as was believed he continued to write of keeping it up in order to have something more as if he hadnt at the worst enough to be silent about whatever his air at any rate peters occasional unmentioned prose and verse were quite truly the result of an impulse to maintain the purity of his taste by establishing still more firmly the right relation of fame to feebleness the little green door of his domain was in a gardenwall on which the discoloured stucco made patches and in the small detached villa behind it everything was old the furniture the servants the books the prints the immemorial habits and the new improvements the mallows at carrara lodge were within ten minutes and the studio there was on their little land to which they had added in their happy faith for building it this was the good fortune if it was not the ill of her having brought him in marriage a portion that put them in a manner at their ease and enabled them thus on their side to keep it up and they did keep it up they always had the infatuated sculptor and his wife for whom nature had refined on the impossible by relieving them of the sense of the difficult morgan had at all events everything of the sculptor but the spirit of phidias the brown velvet the becoming beretto the plastic presence the fine fingers the beautiful accent in italian and the old italian factotum he seemed to make up for everything when he addressed egidio with the tu and waved him to turn one of the rotary pedestals of which the place was full they were tremendous italians at carrara lodge and the secret of the part played by this fact in peters life was in a large degree that it gave him sturdy briton as he was just the amount of going abroad he could bear the mallows were all his italy but it was in a measure for italy he liked them his one worry was that lance to which they had shortened his godson was in spite of a public school perhaps a shade too italian morgan meanwhile looked like somebodys flattering idea of somebodys own person as expressed in the great room provided at the uffizi museum for the general illustration of that idea by eminent hands the masters sole regret that he hadnt been born rather to the brush than to the chisel sprang from his wish that he might have contributed to that collection it appeared with time at any rate to be to the brush that lance had been born for mrs mallow one day when the boy was turning twenty broke it to their friend who shared to the last delicate morsel their problems and pains that it seemed as if nothing would really do but that he should embrace the career it had been impossible longer to remain blind to the fact that he was gaining no glory at cambridge where brenchs own college had for a year tempered its tone to him as for brenchs own sake therefore why renew the vain form of preparing him for the impossible the impossible it had become clear was that he should be anything but an artist oh dear dear said poor peter dont you believe in it asked mrs mallow who still at more than forty had her violet velvet eyes her creamy satin skin and her silken chestnut hair believe in what why in lances passion i dont know what you mean by believing in it ive never been unaware certainly of his disposition from his earliest time to daub and draw but i confess ive hoped it would burn out but why should it she sweetly smiled with his wonderful heredity passion is passion though of course indeed you dear peter know nothing of that has the masters ever burned out peter looked off a little and in his familiar formless way kept up for a moment a sound between a smothered whistle and a subdued hum do you think hes going to be another master she seemed scarce prepared to go that length yet she had on the whole a marvellous trust i know what you mean by that will it be a career to incur the jealousies and provoke the machinations that have been at times almost too much for his father well say it may be since nothing but claptrap in these dreadful days can it would seem make its way and since with the curse of refinement and distinction one may easily find ones self begging ones bread put it at the worst say he has the misfortune to wing his flight further than the vulgar taste of his stupid countrymen can follow think all the same of the happiness the same the master has had hell know peter looked rueful ah but what will he know quiet joy cried mrs mallow quite impatient and turning away ii he had of course before long to meet the boy himself on it and to hear that practically everything was settled lance was not to go up again but to go instead to paris where since the die was cast he would find the best advantages peter had always felt he must be taken as he was but had never perhaps found him so much of that pattern as on this occasion you chuck cambridge then altogether doesnt that seem rather a pity lance would have been like his father to his friends sense had he had less humour and like his mother had he had more beauty yet it was a good middle way for peter that in the modern manner he was to the eye rather the young stockbroker than the young artist the youth reasoned that it was a question of time there was such a mill to go through such an awful lot to learn he had talked with fellows and had judged one has got today he said dont you see to know his interlocutor at this gave a groan oh hang it dont know lance wondered dont then whats the use the use of what why of anything dont you think ive talent peter smoked away for a little in silence then went on it isnt knowledge its ignorance that as weve been beautifully told is bliss dont you think ive talent lance repeated peter with his trick of queer kind demonstrations passed his arm round his godson and held him a moment how do i know oh said the boy if its your own ignorance youre defending again for a pause on the sofa his godfather smoked it isnt ive the misfortune to be omniscient oh well lance laughed again if you know too much thats what i do and its why im so wretched lances gaiety grew wretched come i say but i forgot his companion went on youre not to know about that it would indeed for you too make the too much only ill tell you what ill do and peter got up from the sofa if youll go up again ill pay your way at cambridge lance stared a little rueful in spite of being still more amused oh peter you disapprove so of paris well im afraid of it ah i see no you dont see yet but you will that is you would and you mustnt the young man thought more gravely but ones innocence already is considerably damaged ah that wont matter peter persisted well patch it up here here then you want me to stay at home peter almost confessed to it well were so right we four together just as we are were so safe come dont spoil it the boy who had turned to gravity turned from this on the real pressure of his friends tone to consternation then whats a fellow to be my particular care come old man and peter now fairly pleaded ill look out for you lance who had remained on the sofa with his legs out and his hands in his pockets watched him with eyes that showed suspicion then he got up you think theres something the matter with me that i cant make a success well what do you call a success lance thought again why the best sort i suppose is to please ones self isnt that the sort that in spite of cabals and things is in his own peculiar line the masters there were so much too many things in this question to be answered at once that they practically checked the discussion which became particularly difficult in the light of such renewed proof that though the young mans innocence might in the course of his studies as he contended somewhat have shrunken the finer essence of it still remained that was indeed exactly what peter had assumed and what above all he desired yet perversely enough it gave him a chill the boy believed in the cabals and things believed in the peculiar line believed to be brief in the master what happened a month or two later wasnt that he went up again at the expense of his godfather but that a fortnight after he had got settled in paris this personage sent him fifty pounds he had meanwhile at home this personage made up his mind to the worst and what that might be had never yet grown quite so vivid to him as when on his presenting himself one sunday night as he never failed to do for supper the mistress of carrara lodge met him with an appeal as to of all things in the world the wealth of the canadians she was earnest she was even excited are many of them really rich he had to confess he knew nothing about them but he often thought afterwards of that evening the room in which they sat was adorned with sundry specimens of the masters genius which had the merit of being as mrs mallow herself frequently suggested of an unusually convenient size they were indeed of dimensions not customary in the products of the chisel and they had the singularity that if the objects and features intended to be small looked too large the objects and features intended to be large looked too small the masters idea either in respect to this matter or to any other had in almost any case even after years remained undiscoverable to peter brench the creations that so failed to reveal it stood about on pedestals and brackets on tables and shelves a little staring white population heroic idyllic allegoric mythic symbolic in which scale had so strayed and lost itself that the public square and the chimneypiece seemed to have changed places the monumental being all diminutive and the diminutive all monumental branches at any rate markedly of a family in which stature was rather oddly irrespective of function age and sex they formed like the mallows themselves poor brenchs own family having at least to such a degree the note of familiarity the occasion was one of those he had long ago learnt to know and to name short flickers of the faint flame soft gusts of a kinder air twice a year regularly the master believed in his fortune in addition to believing all the year round in his genius this time it was to be made by a bereaved couple from toronto who had given him the handsomest order for a tomb to three lost children each of whom they desired to see in the composition emblematically and characteristically represented such was naturally the moral of mrs mallows question if their wealth was to be assumed it was clear from the nature of their admiration as well as from mysterious hints thrown out they were a little odd as to other possibilities of the same mortuary sort what their further patronage might be and not less evident that should the master become at all known in those climes nothing would be more inevitable than a run of canadian custom peter had been present before at runs of custom colonial and domestic present at each of those of which the aggregation had left so few gaps in the marble company round him but it was his habit never at these junctures to prick the bubble in advance the fond illusion while it lasted eased the wound of elections never won the long ache of medals and diplomas carried off on every chance by everyone but the master it moreover lighted the lamp that would glimmer through the next eclipse they lived however after all as it was always beautiful to see at a height scarce susceptible of ups and downs they strained a point at times charmingly strained it to admit that the public was here and there not too bad to buy but they would have been nowhere without their attitude that the master was always too good to sell they were at all events deliciously formed peter often said to himself for their fate the master had a vanity his wife had a loyalty of which success depriving these things of innocence would have diminished the merit and the grace anyone could be charming under a charm and as he looked about him at a world of prosperity more void of proportion even than the masters museum he wondered if he knew another pair that so completely escaped vulgarity what a pity lance isnt with us to rejoice mrs mallow on this occasion sighed at supper well drink to the health of the absent her husband replied filling his friends glass and his own and giving a drop to their companion but we must hope hes preparing himself for a happiness much less like this of ours this evening excusable as i grant it to be than like the comfort we have always whatever has happened or has not happened been able to trust ourselves to enjoy the comfort the master explained leaning back in the pleasant lamplight and firelight holding up his glass and looking round at his marble family quartered more or less a monstrous brood in every room the comfort of art in itself peter looked a little shyly at his wine well i dont care what you may call it when a fellow doesnt but lance must learn to sell you know i drink to his acquisition of the secret of a base popularity oh yes he must sell the boys mother who was still more however this seemed to give out the masters wife rather artlessly allowed ah the sculptor after a moment confidently pronounced lance will dont be afraid hell have learnt which is exactly what peter mrs mallow gaily returned why in the world were you so perverse peter wouldnt when he told him hear of peter when this lady looked at him with accusatory affection a grace on her part not infrequent could never find a word but the master who was always all amenity and tact helped him out now as he had often helped him before thats his old idea you know on which weve so often differed his theory that the artist should be all impulse and instinct i go in of course for a certain amount of school not too much but a due proportion theres where his protest came in he continued to explain to his wife as against what might dont you see be in question for lance ah well and mrs mallow turned the violet eyes across the table at the subject of this discourse hes sure to have meant of course nothing but good only that wouldnt have prevented him if lance had taken his advice from being in effect horribly cruel they had a sociable way of talking of him to his face as if he had been in the clay or at most in the plaster and the master was unfailingly generous he might have been waving egidio to make him revolve ah but poor peter wasnt so wrong as to what it may after all come to that he will learn oh but nothing artistically bad she urged still for poor peter arch and dewy why just the little french tricks said the master on which their friend had to pretend to admit when pressed by mrs mallow that these жsthetic vices had been the objects of his dread iii i know now lance said to him the next year why you were so much against it he had come back supposedly for a mere interval and was looking about him at carrara lodge where indeed he had already on two or three occasions since his expatriation briefly reappeared this had the air of a longer holiday something rather awful has happened to me it isnt so very good to know im bound to say high spirits dont show in your face peter was rather ruefully forced to confess still are you very sure you do know well i at least know about as much as i can bear these remarks were exchanged in peters den and the young man smoking cigarettes stood before the fire with his back against the mantel something of his bloom seemed really to have left him poor peter wondered youre clear then as to what in particular i wanted you not to go for in particular lance thought it seems to me that in particular there can have been only one thing they stood for a little sounding each other are you quite sure quite sure im a beastly duffer quite by this time oh and peter turned away as if almost with relief its that that isnt pleasant to find out oh i dont care for that said peter presently coming round again i mean i personally dont yet i hope you can understand a little that i myself should well what do you mean by it peter sceptically asked and on this lance had to explain how the upshot of his studies in paris had inexorably proved a mere deep doubt of his means these studies had so waked him up that a new light was in his eyes but what the new light did was really to show him too much do you know whats the matter with me im too horribly intelligent paris was really the last place for me ive learnt what i cant do poor peter stared it was a staggerer but even after they had had on the subject a longish talk in which the boy brought out to the full the hard truth of his lesson his friend betrayed less pleasure than usually breaks into a face to the happy tune of i told you so poor peter himself made now indeed so little a point of having told him so that lance broke ground in a different place a day or two after what was it then that before i went you were afraid i should find out this however peter refused to tell him on the ground that if he hadnt yet guessed perhaps he never would and that in any case nothing at all for either of them was to be gained by giving the thing a name lance eyed him on this an instant with the bold curiosity of youth with the air indeed of having in his mind two or three names of which one or other would be right peter nevertheless turning his back again offered no encouragement and when they parted afresh it was with some show of impatience on the side of the boy accordingly on their next encounter peter saw at a glance that he had now in the interval divined and that to sound his note he was only waiting till they should find themselves alone this he had soon arranged and he then broke straight out do you know your conundrum has been keeping me awake but in the watches of the night the answer came over me so that upon my honour i quite laughed out had you been supposing i had to go to paris to learn that even now to see him still so sublimely on his guard peters young friend had to laugh afresh you wont give a sign till youre sure beautiful old peter but lance at last produced it why hang it the truth about the master it made between them for some minutes a lively passage full of wonder for each at the wonder of the other then how long have you understood the true value of his work i understood it lance recalled as soon as i began to understand anything but i didnt begin fully to do that i admit till i got lаbas dear dear peter gasped with retrospective dread but for what have you taken me im a hopeless muff that i had to have rubbed in but im not such a muff as the master lance declared then why did you never tell me that i hadnt after all the boy took him up remained such an idiot just because i never dreamed you knew but i beg your pardon i only wanted to spare you and what i dont now understand is how the deuce then for so long youve managed to keep bottled peter produced his explanation but only after some delay and with a gravity not void of embarrassment it was for your mother oh said lance and thats the great thing now since the murder is out i want a promise from you i mean and peter almost feverishly followed it up a vow from you solemn and such as you owe me here on the spot that youll sacrifice anything rather than let her ever guess that ive guessed lance took it in i see he evidently after a moment had taken in much but what is it youve in mind that i may have a chance to sacrifice oh one has always something lance looked at him hard do you mean that youve had the look he received back however so put the question by that he found soon enough another are you really sure my mother doesnt know peter after renewed reflexion was really sure if she does shes too wonderful but arent we all too wonderful yes peter granted but in different ways the things so desperately important because your fathers little public consists only as you know then peter developed well of how many first of all the masters son risked of himself and last of all too i dont quite see of whom else peter had an approach to impatience of your mother i say always lance cast it all up you absolutely feel that absolutely well then with yourself that makes three oh me and peter with a wag of his kind old head modestly excused himself the numbers at any rate small enough for any individual dropping out to be too dreadfully missed therefore to put it in a nutshell take care my boy thats all that youre not ive got to keep on humbugging lance wailed its just to warn you of the danger of your failing of that that ive seized this opportunity and what do you regard in particular the young man asked as the danger why this certainty that the moment your mother who feels so strongly should suspect your secret well said peter desperately the fat would be on the fire lance for a moment seemed to stare at the blaze shed throw me over shed throw him over and come round to us peter before he answered turned away come round to you but he had said enough to indicate and as he evidently trusted to avert the horrid contingency iv within six months again none the less his fear was on more occasions than one all before him lance had returned to paris for another trial then had reappeared at home and had had with his father for the first time in his life one of the scenes that strike sparks he described it with much expression to peter touching whom since they had never done so before it was the sign of a new reserve on the part of the pair at carrara lodge that they at present failed on a matter of intimate interest to open themselves if not in joy then in sorrow to their good friend this produced perhaps practically between the parties a shade of alienation and a slight intermission of commerce marked mainly indeed by the fact that to talk at his ease with his old playmate lance had in general to come to see him the closest if not quite the gayest relation they had yet known together was thus ushered in the difficulty for poor lance was a tension at home begotten by the fact that his father wished him to be at least the sort of success he himself had been he hadnt chucked paris though nothing appeared more vivid to him than that paris had chucked him he would go back again because of the fascination in trying in seeing in sounding the depths in learning ones lesson briefly even if the lesson were simply that of ones impotence in the presence of ones larger vision but what did the master all aloft in his senseless fluency know of impotence and what vision to be called such had he in all his blind life ever had lance heated and indignant frankly appealed to his godparent on this score his father it appeared had come down on him for having after so long nothing to show and hoped that on his next return this deficiency would be repaired the thing the master complacently set forth was for any artist however inferior to himself at least to do something what can you do thats all i ask he had certainly done enough and there was no mistake about what he had to show lance had tears in his eyes when it came thus to letting his old friend know how great the strain might be on the sacrifice asked of him it wasnt so easy to continue humbugging as from son to parent after feeling ones self despised for not grovelling in mediocrity yet a noble duplicity was what as they intimately faced the situation peter went on requiring and it was still for a time what his young friend bitter and sore managed loyally to comfort him with fifty pounds more than once again it was true rewarded both in london and in paris the young friends loyalty none the less sensibly doubtless at the moment that the money was a direct advance on a decent sum for which peter had long since privately prearranged an ultimate function whether by these arts or others at all events lances just resentment was kept for a season but only for a season at bay the day arrived when he warned his companion that he could hold out or hold in no longer carrara lodge had had to listen to another lecture delivered from a great height an infliction really heavier at last than without striking back or in some way letting the master have the truth flesh and blood could bear and what i dont see is lance observed with a certain irritated eye for what was after all if it came to that owing to himself too what i dont see is upon my honour how you as things are going can keep the game up oh the game for me is only to hold my tongue said placid peter and i have my reason still my mother peter showed a queer face as he had often shown it before that is by turning it straight away what will you have i havent ceased to like her shes beautiful shes a dear of course lance allowed but what is she to you after all and what is it to you that as to anything whatever she should or she shouldnt peter who had turned red hung fire a little well its all simply what i make of it there was now however in his young friend a strange an adopted insistence what are you after all to her oh nothing but thats another matter she cares only for my father said lance the parisian naturally and thats just why why youve wished to spare her because she cares so tremendously much lance took a turn about the room but with his eyes still on his host how awfully always you must have liked her awfully always said peter brench the young man continued for a moment to muse then stopped again in front of him do you know how much she cares their eyes met on it but peter as if his own found something new in lances appeared to hesitate for the first time in an age to say he did know ive only just found out said lance she came to my room last night after being present in silence and only with her eyes on me at what i had had to take from him she came and she was with me an extraordinary hour he had paused again and they had again for a while sounded each other then something and it made him suddenly turn pale came to peter she does know she does know she let it all out to me so as to demand of me no more than that as she said of which she herself had been capable she has always always known said lance without pity peter was silent a long time during which his companion might have heard him gently breathe and on touching him might have felt within him the vibration of a long low sound suppressed by the time he spoke at last he had taken everything in then i do see how tremendously much isnt it wonderful lance asked wonderful peter mused so that if your original effort to keep me from paris was to keep me from knowledge lance exclaimed as if with a sufficient indication of this futility it might have been at the futility peter appeared for a little to gaze i think it must have been without my quite at the time knowing it to keep me he replied at last as he turned away
