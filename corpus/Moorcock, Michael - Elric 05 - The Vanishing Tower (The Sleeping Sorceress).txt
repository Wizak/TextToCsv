book one the torment of the last lord and then did elric leave jharkor in pursuit of a certain sorcerer who had so elric claimed caused him some inconvenience the chronicle of the black sword chapter one pale prince on a moonlit shore in the sky a cold moon cloaked in clouds sent down faint light that fell upon a sullen sea where a ship lay at anchor off an uninhabited coast from the ship a boat was being lowered it swayed in its harness two figures swathed in long capes watched the seamen lowering the boat while they themselves tried to calm horses which stamped their hooves on the unstable deck and snorted and rolled their eyes the shorter figure clung hard to his horses bridle and grumbled why should this be necessary why could not we have disembarked at trepesaz or at least some fish ing harbour boasting an inn however lowly because friend moonglum i wish our arrival in lormyr to be secret if theleb kaarna knew of my comingas he soon would if we went to trepesaz then he would fly again and the chase would begin afresh would you welcome that moonglum shrugged i still feel that your pursuit of this sorcerer is no more than a surrogate for real activity you seek him because you do not wish to seek your proper destiny elric turned his bonewhite face in the moonlight and regarded moonglum with crimson moody eyes and what of it you need not accompany me if you do not wish to again moonglum shrugged his shoulders aye i know perhaps i stay with you for the same reasons that you pursue the sorcerer of pan tang he grinned so thats enough of debate eh lord elric debate achieves nothing elric agreed he patted his horses nose as more seamen clad in colourful tarkeshite silks came forward to take the horses and hoist them down to the waiting boat struggling whinnying through the bags muffling their heads the horses were lowered their hooves thudding on the bottom of the boat as if they would stave it in then elric and moonglum their bundles on their backs swung down the ropes and jumped into the rock ing craft the sailors pushed off from the ship with their oars and then bodies bending began to row for the shore the late autumn air was cold moonglum shivered as he stared towards the bleak cliffs ahead winter is near and id rather be domiciled at some friendly tavern than roaming abroad when this business is done with the sorcerer what say we head for jadmar or one of the other big vilmirian cities and see what mood the warmer clime puts us in but elric did not reply his strange eyes stared into the darkness and they seemed to be peering into the depths of his own soul and not liking what they saw moonglum sighed and pursed his lips he huddled deeper in his cloak and rubbed his hands to warm them he was used to his friends sudden lapses of silence but familiarity did not make him enjoy them any better from somewhere on the shore a nightbird shrieked and a small animal squealed the sailors grunted as they pulled on their oars the moon came out from behind the clouds and it shone on elrics grim white face made his crimson eyes seem to glow like the coals of hell revealed the barren cliffs of the shore the sailors shipped their oars as the boats bottom ground on shingle the horses smelling land snorted and moved their hooves elric and moonglum rose to steady them two seamen leaped into the cold water and brought the boat up higher another patted the neck of elrics horse and did not look directly at the albino as he spoke the captain said you would pay me when we reached the lormyrian shore my lord elric grunted and reached under his cloak he drew out a jewel that shone brightly through the darkness of the night the sailor gasped and stretched out his hand to take it xiombargs blood i have never seen so fine a gem elric began to lead the horse into the shallows and moonglum hastily followed him cursing under his breath and shaking his head from side to side laughing among themselves the sailors shoved the boat back into deeper water as elric and moonglum mounted their horses and the boat pulled through the darkness towards the ship moonglum said that jewel was worth a hundred times the cost of our passage what of it elric fitted his feet in his stirrups and made his horse walk towards a part of the cliff which was less steep than the rest he stood up in his stirrups for a moment to adjust his cloak and settle himself more firmly in his saddle there is a path here by the look of it much overgrown i would point out moonglum said bitterly that if it were left to you lord elric we should have no means of livelihood at all if i had not taken the pre caution of retaining some of the profits made from the sale of that trireme we captured and auctioned in dhakos we should be paupers now aye returned elric carelessly and he spurred his horse up the path that led to the top of the cliff in frustration moonglum shook his head but he fol lowed the albino by dawn they were riding over the undulating land scape of small hills and valleys that made up the ter rain of lormyrs most northerly peninsula since theleb kaarna must needs live off rich pa trons elric explained as they rode he will almost certainly go to the capital iosaz where king montan rules he will seek service with some noble perhaps king montan himself and how soon shall we see the capital lord elric moonglum looked up at the clouds it is several days ride master moonglum moonglum sighed the sky bore signs of snow and the tent he carried rolled behind his saddle was of thin silk suitable for the hotter lands of the east and west he thanked his gods that he wore a thick quilted jerkin beneath his breastplate and that before he had left the ship he had pulled on a pair of woollen breeks to go beneath the gaudier breeks of red silk that were his outer wear his conical cap of fur iron and leather had earflaps which were now drawn tightly and se cured by a thong beneath his chin and his heavy deer skin cape was drawn closely around his shoulders elric for his part seemed not to notice the chill weather his own cape flapped behind him he wore breeks of deep blue silk a high collared shirt of black silk a steel breastplate lacquered a gleaming black like his helmet and embossed with patterns of delicate silverwork behind his saddle were deep panniers and across this was a bow and a quiver of arrows at his side swung the huge runesword stormbringer the source of his strength and his misery and on his right hip was a long dirk presented him by queen yishana of jharkor moonglum bore a similar bow and quiver on each hip was a sword one short and straight the other long and curved after the fashion of the men of elwher his homeland both blades were in scabbards of beautifully worked ilmioran leather embellished with stitching of scarlet and gold thread together the pair looked to those who had not heard of them like free travelling mercenaries who had been more successful than most in their chosen careers their horses bore them tirelessly through the country side these were tall shazarian steeds known all over the young kingdoms for their stamina and intelligence after several weeks cooped up in the hold of the tarke shite ship they were glad to be moving again now small villagessquat houses of stone and thatchcame in sight but elric and moonglum were careful to avoid them lormyr was one of the oldest of the young kingdoms and much of the worlds history had been made there even the melniboneans had heard the tales of lormyrs hero of ancient times aubec of malador of the province of klant who was said to have carved new lands from the stuff of chaos that had once existed at the worlds edge but lormyr had long since declined from her peak of power though still a major nation of the south west and had mellowed into a nation that was at once picturesque and cultured elric and moonglum passed pleasant farmsteads wellnurtured fields vineyards and orchards in which the goldenleaved trees were sur rounded by timeworn mossgrown walls a sweet land and a peaceful land in contrast to the rawer bustling northwestern nations of jharkor tarkesh and dhari jor which they had left behind moonglum gazed around him as they slowed their horses to a trot theleb kaarna could work much mis chief here elric i am reminded of the peaceful hills and plains of elwher my own land elric nodded lormyrs years of turbulence ended when she cast off melnibones shackles and was first to proclaim herself a free nation i have a liking for this restful landscape it soothes me now we have another reason for finding the sorcerer before he begins to stir his brew of corruption moonglum smiled quietly be careful my lord for you are once again succumbing to those soft emotions you so despise elric straightened his back come lets make haste for iosaz the sooner we reach a city with a decent tavern and a warm fire the better moonglum drew his cape tighter about his thin body then pray that the sorcerers soul is soon sent to limbo master moonglum for then ill be content to sit before the fire all winter long if it suits you and elric made his horse break into a sudden gallop as grey evening closed over the tranquil hills chapter two white face staring through snow lormyr was famous for her great rivers it was her rivers that had helped make her rich and had kept her strong after three days travelling when a light snow had begun to drift from the sky elric and moonglum rode out of the hills and saw before them the foaming waters of the schlan river tributary of the zaphratrepek which flowed from beyond iosaz down to the sea at trepesaz no ships sailed the schlan at this point for there were rapids and huge waterfalls every few miles but at the old town of stagasaz built where the schlan joined the zaphratrepek elric planned to send moonglum into town and buy a small boat in which they could sail up the zaphratrepek to iosaz where theleb kaarna was almost certain to be they followed the banks of the schlan now riding hard and hoping to reach the outskirts of the town be fore nightfall they rode past fishing villages and the houses of minor nobles they were occasionally hailed by friendly fishermen who trawled the quieter reaches of the river but they did not stop the fishermen were typical of the area with ruddy features and huge curl ing moustaches dressed in heavily embroidered linen smocks and leather boots that reached almost to their thighs men who in past times had been ever ready to lay down their nets pick up swords and halberds and mount horses to go to the defence of their homeland could we not borrow one of their boats moon glum suggested but elric shook his head the fisher men of the schlan are well known for their gossiping the news of our presence might well precede us and warn theleb kaarna you seem needlessly cautious i have lost him too often more rapids came in sight great black rocks glistened in the gloom and roaring water gushed over them sending spray high into the air there were no houses or villages here and the paths beside the banks were narrow and treacherous so that elric and moon glum were forced to slow their pace and make their way with caution moonglum shouted over the noise of the water well not reach stagasaz by nightfall now elric nodded well make camp below the rapids there the snow was still falling and the wind drove it against their faces so that it became even more difficult to pick their way along the narrow track that now wound high above the river but at last the tumult began to die and the track widened out and the waters calmed and with relief they looked about them over the plain to find a likely camping place it was moonglum who saw them first his finger was unsteady as he pointed into the sky towards the north elric what make you of those elric peered up into the lowering sky brushing snowflakes from his face his expression was at first puzzled his brow fur rowed and his eyes narrowed black shapes against the sky winged shapes it was impossible at this distance to judge then scale but they did not fly the way birds fly elric was re minded of another flying creaturea creature he had last seen when he and the sealords fled burning imrryr and the folk of melnibone had released their vengeance upon the reavers that vengeance had taken two forms the first form had been the golden battlebarges which had waited for the attack as they left the dream ing city the second form had been the great dragons of the bright empire and these creatures in the distance had something of the look of dragons had the melniboneans discovered a means of waking the dragons before the end of their normal sleeping time had they unleashed their dragons to seek out elric who had slain his own kin betrayed his own un human kind in order to have revenge on his cousin yyrkoon who had usurped elrics place on the ruby throne of imrryr now elrics expression hardened into a grim mask his crimson eyes shone like polished rubies his left hand fell upon the hilt of his great black battleblade the runesword stormbringer and he controlled a rising sense of horror for now in midair the shapes had changed no longer did they have the appearance of dragons but this time they seemed to be like multicoloured swans whose gleaming feathers caught and diffracted the few remaining rays of light moonglum gasped as they came nearer they are huge draw your swords friend moonglum draw them now and pray to whatever gods rule over elwher for these are creatures of sorcery and they are doubtless sent by theleb kaarna to destroy us my respect for that conjurer increases what are they elric creatures of chaos in melnibone they are called the oonai they can change shape at will a sorcerer of great mental discipline of superlative powers who knows the apposite spells can master them and deter mine their appearance some of my ancestors could do such things but i thought no mere conjurer of pan tang could master the chimerae do you know no spell to counter them none comes readily to mind only a lord of chaos such as my patron demon arioch could dismiss them moonglum shuddered then call your arioch i beg you elric darted a halfamused glance at moonglum these creatures must fill you with great fear indeed if you are prepared to entertain the presence of arioch master moonglum moonglum drew his long curved sword perhaps they have no business with us he suggested but it is as well to be prepared elric smiled aye then moonglum drew his straight sword curling his horses reins around his arm a shrill cackling sound from the skies the horses pawed at the ground the cackling grew louder the creatures opened their beaks and called to one another and it was very plain now that they were indeed something other than gigantic swans for they had curling tongues and there were slim sharp fangs bristling in those beaks they changed direction slightly winging straight for the two men elric flung back his head and drew out his great sword and raised it skyward it pulsed and moaned and a strange black radiance poured from it casting peculiar shadows over its owners blanched features the shazarian horse screamed and reared and words began to pour from elrics tormented face arioch arioch arioch lord of the seven darks duke of chaos aid me aid me now arioch moonglums own horse had backed away in panic and the little man was having great difficulty in con trolling it his own features were almost as pale as elrics arioch overhead the chimerae began to circle arioch blood and souls if you will aid me now then some yards away a dark mist seemed to well up from nowhere it was a boiling mist that had strange disgusting shapes in it arioch the mist grew still thicker arioch i beg youaid me now the horse pawed at the air snorting and screaming its eyes rolling its nostrils flaring yet elric his lips curled back over his teeth so that he looked like a rabid wolf continued to keep his seat as the dark mist quiv ered and a strange unearthly face appeared in the upper part of the shifting column it was a face of won derful beauty of absolute evil moonglum turned his head away unable to regard it a sweet sibilant voice issued from the beautiful mouth the mist swirled languidly becoming a mottled scarlet laced with emerald green greetings elric said the face greetings most beloved of my children aid me arioch ah said the face its tone full of rich regret ah that cannot be you must aid me the chimerae had hesitated in their descent sight ing the peculiar mist it is impossible sweetest of my slaves there are other matters afoot in the realm of chaos matters of enormous moment to which i have already referred i offer only my blessings ariochi beg thee remember your oath to chaos and remain loyal to us in spite of all farewell elric and the dark mist vanished and the chimerae came closer and elric drew a racking breath while the rune sword whined in his hand and quivered and its radiance dimmed a little moonglum spat on the ground a powerful patron elric but a damned inconstant one then he flung himself from his saddle as a creature which changed its shape a dozen times as it arrowed towards him reached out huge claws which clashed in the air where he had been the riderless horse reared again striking out at the beast of chaos a fanged snout snapped blood vomited from the place where the horses head had been and the carcass kicked once more be fore falling to the ground to pour more gore into the greedy earth bearing the remains of the head in what was first a scaled snout then a beak then a sharklike mouth the oonai thrashed back into the air moonglum picked himself up his eyes contem plated nothing but his own imminent destruction elric too leapt from his horse and slapped its flank so that convulsively it began to gallop away towards the river another chimera followed it this tune the flying thing seized the horses body in claws which suddenly sprouted from its feet the horse struggled to get free threatening to break its own back bone in its struggles but it could not the chimera flapped towards the clouds with its catch snow fell thicker now but elric and moonglum were oblivious of it as they stood together and awaited the next attack of the oonai moonglum said quietly is there no other spell you know friend elric the albino shook his head nothing specific to deal with these the oonai always served the folk of melni bone they never threatened us so we needed no spell against them i am trying to think the chimerae cackled and yelled in the air above the two mens heads then another broke away from the pack and dived to the earth they attack individually elric said in a somewhat detached tone as if studying insects in a bottle they never attack in a pack i know not why the oonai had settled on the ground and it had now assumed the shape of an elephant with the huge head of a crocodile not an aesthetic combination said elric the ground shook as it charged towards them they stood shoulder to shoulder as it approached it was almost upon them and at the last moment they divided elric throw ing himself to one side and moonglum to the other the chimera passed between them and elric struck at the things side with his runesword the sword sang out almost lasciviously as it bit deep into the flesh which instantly changed and became a dragon dripping flaming venom from its fangs but it was badly wounded blood ran from the deep wound and the chimera screamed and changed shape again and again as if seeking some form in which the wound could not exist black blood now burst from its side as if the strain of the many changes had ruptured its body all the more it fell to its knees and the lustre faded from its feath ers died from its scales disappeared from its skin it kicked out once and then was stilla heavy black piglike creature whose lumpen body was the ugliest elric and moonglum had ever seen moonglum grunted it is not hard to understand why such a creature should want to change its form he looked up another was descending this had the appearance of a whale with wings but with curved fangs like those of a stomach fish and a tail like an enormous corkscrew even as it landed it changed shape again now it had assumed human form it was a huge beautiful figure twice as tall as elric it was naked and perfectly proportioned but its stare was vacant and it had the drooling lips of an idiot child lithely it ran at them its huge hands reaching out to grasp them as a child might reach for a toy this time elric and moonglum struck together one at each hand moonglums sharp sword cut the knuckles deeply and elrics lopped off two fingers before the oonai altered its shape again and began first to be an octopus then a monstrous tiger then a combination of both until at last it was a rock in which a fissure grew to reveal white snapping teeth gasping the two men waited for it to resume the at tack at the base of the rock some blood was oozing this put a thought into elrics mind with a sudden yell he leapt forward raised his sword over his head and brought it down on top of the rock splitting it in twain something like a laugh issued from the black sword then as the sundered shape flickered and became an other of the piglike creatures this was completely cut in two its blood and its entrails spreading themselves upon the ground then through the snowy dusk another of the oonai came down its body a glowing orange its shape that of a winged snake with a thousand rippling coils elric struck at the coils but they moved too rapidly the other chimerae had been watching his tactics with their dead companions and they had now gauged the skill of their victims almost immediately elrics arms were pinned to his sides by the coils and he found himself being borne upward as a second chimera with the same shape rushed down on moonglum to seize him in an identical way elric prepared to die as the horses had died he prayed that he would die swiftly and not slowly at the hands of theleb kaarna who had always promised him a slow death the scaly wings flapped powerfully no snout came down to snap his head off he felt despair as he realised that he and moonglum were being carried swiftly northward over the great lormyrian steppe doubtless theleb kaarna awaited them at the end of their journey chapter three feathers filling a great sky night fell and the chimerae flew on tire lessly their shapes black against the falling snow the coils showed no signs of relaxing though elric strove to force them apart keeping tight hold of his runesword and racking his brains for some means of defeating the monsters if only there were a spell he tried to keep his thoughts from what theleb kaarna would do if indeed it was that wizard who had set the oonai upon them elrics skill in sorcery lay chiefly in his command over the various elementals of air fire earth water and ether and also over the entities who had affinities with the flora and fauna of the earth he had decided that his only hope lay in summon ing the aid of fileet lady of the birds who dwelt in a realm lying beyond the planes of earth but the invoca tion eluded him even if he could remember it the mind had to be adjusted in a certain way the correct rhythms of the incantation remembered the exact words and inflec tions recalled before he could begin to summon fileets aid for she more than another elemental was as difficult to invoke as the fickle arioch through the drifting snow he heard moonglum call out something indistinct what was that moonglum he called back i onlysought to learnif you stilllived friend elric ayebarely his face was chill and ice had formed on his helmet and breastplate his whole body ached both from the crushing coils of the chimera and from the biting cold of the upper air on and on through the northern night they flew while elric forced himself to relax to descend into a trance and to dredge from his mind the ancient knowledge of his forefathers at dawn the clouds had cleared and the suns red rays spread over the snow like blood over damask everywhere stretched the steppea vast field of snow from horizon to horizon while above it the sky was nothing but a blue sheet of ice in which sat the red pool of the sun and tireless as ever the chimerae flew on elric brought himself slowly from his trance and prayed to his untrustworthy gods that he remembered the spell aright his lips were all but frozen together he licked them and it was as if he licked snow he opened them and bitter air coursed into his mouth he coughed then turning his head upwards his crimson eyes glazing he forced his lips to frame strange syllables to utter the old vowelheavy words of the high speech of old melnibone a speech hardly suited to a human tongue at all fileet he murmured then he began to chant the incantation and as he chanted the sword grew warmer in his hand and supplied him with more energy so that the eldritch chant echoed through the icy sky feathers fine our fates entwined bird and man and thine and mine formed a pact that gods divine hallowed on an ancient shrine when kind swore service unto kind fileet fair feathered queen of flight remember now that fateful night and help your brother in his plight there was more to the summoning than the words of the invocation there were the abstract thoughts in the head the visual images which had to be retained in the mind the whole time the emotions felt the memories made sharp and true without everything being exactly right the invocation would prove useless centuries before the sorcerer kings of melnibone had struck this bargain with fileet lady of the birds that any bird that settled in imrryrs walls should be protected that no bird would be shot by any of the melnibonean blood this bargain had been kept and dreaming imrryr had become a haven for all species of bird and at one time they had cloaked her towers in plumage now elric chanted his verses recalling that bargain and begging fileet to remember her part of it brothers and sisters of the sky hear my voice whereer ye fly and bring me aid from kingdoms high not for the first time had he called upon the elemen tals and those akin to them but lately he had sum moned haaashaastaak lord of the lizards in his fight against theleb kaarna and still earlier he had made use of the services of the wind elementalsthe sylphs the sharnahs and the hhaarshannsand the earth elementals yet fileet was fickle and now that imrryr was no more than quaking ruins she could even choose to forget that ancient pact fileet he was weak from the invoking he would not have the strength to battle theleb kaarna even if he found the opportunity fileet and then the air was stirring and a huge shadow fell across the chimerae bearing elric and moonglum north ward elrics voice faltered as he looked up but he smiled and said i thank you fileet for the sky was black with birds there were eagles and robins and rooks and starlings and wren and kites and crows and hawks and peacocks and flamingoes and pigeons and parrots and doves and magpies and ravens and owls their plumage flashed like steel and the air was full of their cries the oonai raised its snakes head and hissed its long tongue curling out between its front fangs its coiled tail lashing one of the chimerae not carrying elric or moonglum changed its shape into that of a gigantic condor and flapped up towards the vast array of birds but they were not deceived the chimera disappeared submerged by birds there was a frightful screaming and then something black and piglike spiralled to earth blood and entrails stream ing in its wake another chimerathe last not bearing a burden assumed its dragon shape almost completely identical to those which elric had once mastered as ruler of melnibone but larger and with not quite the same grace as flamefang and the others there was a sickening smell of burning flesh and feathers as the flaming venom fell upon elrics allies but now more and more birds were filling the air shrieking and whistling and cawing and hooting a mil lion wings fluttering and once again the oonai was hidden from sight once again a muffled scream sounded once again a mangled piglike corpse plum metted groundwards the birds divided into two masses turning their at tention to the chimerae bearing elric and moonglum they sped down like two gigantic arrowheads led each group by ten huge golden eagles which dived at the flashing eyes of the oonai as the birds attacked the chimerae were forced to change shape instantly elric felt himself fall free his body was numb and he fell like a stone remembering only to keep his grip on stormbringer and as he fell he cursed at the irony he had been saved from the beasts of chaos only to hurtle to his death on the snowcovered ground below but then his cloak was caught from above and he hung swaying in the air looking up he saw that several eagles had grasped his clothing in their claws and beaks and were slowing his descent so that he struck the snow with little more than a painful bump the eagles flew back to the fray a few yards away moonglum came down deposited by another flight of eagles which immediately returned to where their comrades were fighting the remaining oonai moonglum picked up the sword which had fallen from his hand he rubbed his right calf ill do my best never to eat fowl again he said feelingly so you remembered a spell eh aye two more piglike corpses thudded down not far away for a few moments the birds performed a strange wheeling dance in the sky partly a salute to the two men partly a dance of triumph and then they divided into their groups of species and flew rapidly away soon there were no birds at all in the iceblue sky elric picked up his bruised body and stiffly he sheathed his sword stormbringer he drew a deep breath and peered upwards fileet i thank thee again moonglum still seemed dazed how did you sum mon them elric elric removed his helmet and wiped sweat from within the rim in this clime that sweat would soon turn to ice an ancient bargain my ancestors made i was hardpressed to remember the lines of the spell im mightily pleased that you did remember absently elric nodded he replaced his helmet on his head staring about him as he did so everywhere stretched the vast snowcovered lor myrian steppe moonglum understood elrics thoughts he rubbed his chin aye we are fairly lost lord elric have you any idea where we may be i do not know friend moonglum we have no means of guessing how far those beasts carried us but im fairly sure it was well to the north of iosaz we are further away from the capital than we were but then so must theleb kaarna be if we were indeed being borne to where he dwells it would be logical i agree so we continue north i think not why so for two reasons it could be that theleb kaarnas idea was to take us to a place so far away from any where that we could not interfere with his plans that might be considered a wiser action than confronting us and thus risking our turning the tables on him aye ill grant you that and whats the other rea son we would do better to try to make for iosaz where we can replenish both our gear and our provisions and enquire of theleb kaarnas whereabouts if he is not there also we would be foolish to strike further north without good horses and in iosaz we shall find horses and perhaps a sleigh to carry us the faster across this snow and ill grant you the sense of that too but i do not think much of our chances in this snow whichever way we go we must begin walking and hope that we can find a river that has not yet frozen overand that the river will have boats upon it which will bear us to iosaz a faint hope elric aye a faint hope elric was already weakened from the energy spent in the invocation to fileet he knew that he must almost certainly die he was not sure that he cared overmuch it would be a cleaner death than some he had been offered of latea less painful death than any he might expect at the hands of the sorcerer of pan tang they began to trudge through the snow slowly they headed south two small figures in a frozen landscape two tiny specks of warm flesh in a great waste of ice chapter four old castle standing a lone a day passed a night passed then the evening of the second day passed and the two men staggered on for all that they had long since lost their sense of direction night fell and they crawled they could not speak their bones were stiff their flesh and their muscles numb cold and exhaustion drove the very sentience from them so that when they fell in the snow and lay motion less they were scarcely aware that they had ceased to move they understood no difference now between life and death between existence and the cessation of ex istence and when the sun rose and warmed their flesh a little they stirred and raised their heads perhaps in an effort to catch one last glimpse of the world they were leaving and they saw the castle it stood there in the middle of the steppe and it was ancient snow covered the moss and the lichen which grew on its worn old stones it seemed to have been there for eternity yet neither elric nor moonglum had ever heard of such a castle standing alone in the steppe it was hard to imagine how a castle so old could exist in the land once known as worlds edge moonglum was the first to rise he stumbled through the deep snow to where elric lay with chapped hands he tried to lift his friend the tide of elrics thin blood had almost ceased to move in his body he moaned as moonglum helped him to his feet he tried to speak but his lips were frozen shut clutching each other sometimes walking sometimes crawling they progressed towards the castle its entrance stood open they fell through it and the warmth issuing from the ulterior revived them suffi ciently to allow them to rise and stagger down a narrow passage into a great hall it was an empty hall it was completely bare of furnishings save for a huge log fire that blazed in a hearth of granite and quartz built at the far end of the hall they crossed flagstones of lapis lazuli to reach it so the castle is inhabited moonglums voice was harsh and thick in his mouth he stared around him at the basalt walls he raised his voice as best he could and called greetings to whoever is the master of this hall we are moonglum of elwher and elric of melnibone and we crave your hospitality for we are lost in your land and then elrics knees buckled and he fell to the floor moonglum stumbled towards him as the echoes of his voice died in the hall all was silent save for the crackling of the logs in the hearth moonglum dragged elric to the fire and lay him down near it warm your bones here friend elric ill seek the folk who live here then he crossed the hall and ascended the stone stair leading to the next floor of the castle this floor was as bereft of furniture or decoration as the other there were many rooms but all of them were empty moonglum began to feel uneasy scenting something of the supernatural here could this be theleb kaarnas castle for someone dwelt here in truth someone had laid the fire and had opened the gates so that they might enter and they had not left the castle in the ordinary way or he should have noticed the tracks in the snow outside moonglum paused then turned and slowly began to descend the stairs reaching the hall he saw that elric had revived enough to prop himself up against the chimneypiece andwhatfound you said elric thickly moonglum shrugged nought no servants no mas ter if they have gone ahunting then they hunt on flying beasts for there are no signs of hoofprints in the snow outside i am a little nervous i must admit he smiled slightly ayeand a little hungry too ill seek the pantry if danger comes wed do as well to face it on full stomachs there was a door set back and to one side of the hearth he tried the latch and it opened into a short passage at the end of which was another door he went down the passage hand on sword and opened the door at the end a parlour as deserted as the rest of the castle and beyond the parlour he saw the castles kitchens he went through the kitchens noting that there were cooking things here all polished and clean but none in use and came finally to the pantry here he found the best part of a large deer hanging and on the shelf above it were ranked many skins and jars of wine below this shelf were bread and some pasties and below that spices moonglums first action was to reach up on tiptoe and take down a jar of wine removing the cork and sniffing the contents he had smelled nothing more delicate or delicious in his life he tasted the wine and he forgot his pain and his weariness but he did not forget that elric still waited in the hall with his short sword he cut off a haunch of vension and tucked it under his arm he selected some spices and put them into his beltpouch under his other arm he put the bread and in both hands he carried a jar of wine he returned to the hall put down his spoils and helped elric drink from the jar the strange wine worked almost instantly and elric offered moonglum a smile that had gratitude in it you area good friendi wonder why moonglum turned away with an embarrassed grunt he began to prepare the meat which he intended to roast over the fire he had never understood his friendship with the al bino it had always been a peculiar mixture of reserve and affection a fine balance which both men were care ful to maintain even in situations of this kind elric since his passion for cymoril had resulted in her death and the destruction of the city he loved had at all tunes feared bestowing any tender emotion on those he fell in with he had run away from shaarilla of the dancing mist who had loved him dearly he had fled from queen yishana of jharkor who had offered him her kingdom to rale in spite of her subjects hatred of him he dis dained most company save moonglums and moon glum too became quickly bored by anyone other than the crimsoneyed prince of imrryr moonglum would die for elric and he knew that elric would risk any danger to save his friend but was not this an unhealthy relationship would it not be better if they went their different ways he could not bear the thought it was as if they were part of the same entitydifferent aspects of the character of the same man he could not understand why he should feel this and he guessed that if elric had ever considered the question the melnibonean would be equally hard put to find an answer he contemplated all this as he roasted the meat be fore the fire using his long sword as a spit meanwhile elric took another draft of wine and be gan almost visibly to thaw out his skin was still badly blistered by chilblains but both men had es caped serious frostbite they ate the venison in silence glancing around the hall puzzling over the nonappearance of the owner yet too tired to care greatly where he was then they slept having put fresh logs on the fire and in the morning they were almost completely recovered from their ordeal in the snow they breakfasted on cold venison and pasties and wine moonglum found a pot and heated water in it so that they might shave and wash and elric found some salve in his pouch which they could put on their blisters i looked in the stables moonglum said as he shaved with the razor he had taken from his own pouch but i found no horses there are signs however that some beasts have been kept there recently there is only one other way to travel elric said there might be skis somewhere in the castle it is the sort of thing you might expect to find for there is snow in these parts for at least half the year skis would speed our progress back towards iosaz as would a map and a lodestone if we could find one moonglum agreed ill search the upper levels he finished his shaving wiped his razor and replaced it in his pouch elric got up ill go with you through the empty rooms they wandered but they found nothing no gear of any kind elric frowned and yet there is a strong sense that the castle is inhabitedand evi dence too of course they searched two more floors and there was not even dust in the rooms well perhaps we walk after all moonglum said in resignation unless there was wood with which we could manufacture skis of some kind i might have seen some in the stables they had reached a narrow stair which wound up the highest tower of the castle well try this and then count our quest unsuccess ful elric said and so they climbed the stair and came to a door at the top which was halfopen elric pushed it back and then he hesitated what is it moonglum who was below him asked this room is furnished elric said quietly moonglum ascended two more steps and peered round elrics shoulder he gasped and occupied it was a beautiful room through crystal windows came pale light which sparkled and fell on hangings of manycoloured silk on embroidered carpets and tapes tries of hues so fresh they might have been made only a moment before in the centre of this room was a bed draped in er mine with a canopy of white silk and on the bed lay a young woman her hair was black and it shone her gown was of the deepest scarlet her limbs were like rosetinted ivory and her face was very fair the lips slightly parted as she breathed she was asleep elric took two steps towards the woman on the bed and then he stopped suddenly he was shuddering he turned away moonglum was alarmed he saw bright tears in el rics crimson eyes what is it friend elric elric moved his white lips but was incapable of speech something like a groan came from his throat elric moonglum placed a hand on his friends arm elric shook it off slowly the albino turned again towards the bed as if forcing himself to behold an impossibly horrifying sight he breathed deeply straightening his back and resting his left hand on the pommel of his sorcerous blade moonglum he was forcing himself to speak moonglum glanced at the woman on the bed glanced at elric did he recognise her moonglumthis is a sorcerous sleep how know you that itit is a similar slumber to that in which my cousin yyrkoon put my cymoril gods think you that i think nothing but it is not it is not cymoril i know ishe is like herso like her but unlike her too it is only that i could not have expected elric bowed his head he spoke in a low voice come lets be gone from here but she must be the owner of this castle if we awakened her we could she cannot be awakened by such as we i told you moonglum elric drew another deep breath it is an enchanted sleep she is in i could not wake cy moril from it with all my powers of sorcery unless one has certain magical aids some knowledge of the exact spell used there is nothing that can be done quickly moonglum let us depart there was an edge to elrics voice which made moon glum shiver but then i will go elric almost ran from the room moonglum heard his footsteps echoing rapidly down the long staircase he went up to the sleeping woman and stared down at her beauty he touched the skin it was unnaturally cold he shrugged and made to leave the chamber pausing for a moment only to notice that a number of ancient battle shields and weapons hung on one wall of the room be hind the bed strange trophies with which a beautiful woman should wish to decorate her bedroom he thought he saw the carved wooden table below the trophies something lay upon it he stepped back into the room a peculiar sensation filled him as he saw that it was a map the castle was marked and so was the zaphratrepek river holding the map down to the table was a lodestone set in silver on a long silver chain he grabbed the map in one hand and the lodestone in the other and ran from the room elric elric he raced down the stairs and reached the hall elric had gone the door of the hall was open he followed the albino out of the mysterious castle and into the snow elric elric turned his face set and his eyes tormented moonglum showed him the map and the lodestone we are saved after all elric elric looked down at the snow aye so we are chapter five doomed lord dreaming and two days later they reached the upper reaches of the zaphratrepek and the trading town of alorasaz with its towers of finely carved wood and its beautifully made timber houses to alorasaz came the fur trappers and the miners the merchants from iosaz downriver or from afar as trepesaz on the coast a cheerful bustling town with its streets lit and heated by great red braziers at every corner these were tended by citizens specially com missiond to keep them burning hot and bright wrapped in thick woollen clothing they hailed elric and moon glum as they entered the city for all they had been sustained by the wine and meat moonglum had thought to bring they were weary from their walk across the steppe they made their way through the rumbustious crowd laughing redcheeked women and burly furswathed men whose breath steamed in the air mingling with the smoke from the braziers as they took huge swallows from gourds of beer or skins of wine conducting their business with the slightly less bucolic merchants of the more sophisticated townships elric was looking for news and he knew that if he found it anywhere it would be in the taverns he waited while moonglum followed his nose to the best of alorasazs inns and came back with the news of where it could be found they walked a short distance and entered a rowdy tavern crammed with big wooden tables and benches on which were jammed more traders and more merchants all arguing cheerfully holding up furs to display their quality or to mock their worthlessness depending on which point of view was taken moonglum left elric standing in the doorway and went to speak with the landlord a hugely fat man with a glistening scarlet face elric saw the landlord bend and listen to moonglum the man nodded and raised an arm to bellow at elric to follow him and moonglum elric inched his way through the press and was knocked half off his feet by a gesticulating trader who apologised cheerfully and profusely and offered to buy him a drink it is nothing elric said faintly the man got up come on sir it was my fault his voice tailed off as he saw the albinos face he mumbled something and sat down again making a wry remark to one of his companions elric followed moonglum and the landlord up a flight of swaying wooden stairs along a landing and into a private room which the landlord told them was all that was available such rooms as these are expensive during the winter market the landlord said apologetically and moonglum winced as silently elric handed the man another precious ruby worth a small fortune the landlord looked at it carefully and then laughed this inn will have fallen down before your credits up master i thank thee trading must be good this sea son ill have drink and viands sent up at once the finest you have landlord said moonglum try ing to make the best of things ayei wish i had better elric sat down on one of the beds and removed his cloak and his swordbelt the chill had not left his bones i wish you would give me charge of our wealth moonglum said as he removed his boots by the fire we might have need of it before this quest is ended but elric seemed not to hear him after they had eaten and discovered from the land lord that a ship was leaving the day after tomorrow for iosaz elric and moonglum went to their separate beds to sleep elrics dreams were troubled that night more than usual did phantoms come to walk the dark corridors of his mind he saw cymoril screaming as the black sword drank her soul he saw imrryr burning her fine towers crum bling he saw his cackling cousin yyrkoon sprawling on the ruby throne he saw other things which could not possibly be part of his past never quite suited to be ruler of the cruel folk of melnibone elric had wandered the lands of men only to discover that he had no place there either and in the meantime yyrkoon had usurped the kingship had tried to force cymoril to be his and when she refused put her into a deep and sorcerous slumber from which only he could wake her now elric dreamed that he had found a nanorion the mystic gem which could awaken even the dead he dreamed that cymoril was still alive but sleeping and that he placed the nanorion on her forehead and that she woke up and kissed him and left imrryr with him sailing through the skies on flamefang the great melni bonean battle dragon away to a peaceful castle in the snow he awoke with a start it was the dead of night even the noise from the tavern below had subsided he opened his eyes and saw moonglum fast asleep in the next bed he tried to return to sleep but it was impossible he was sure that he could sense another presence in the room he reached out and gripped the hilt of storm bringer prepared to defend himself should any attackers strike at him perhaps it was thieves who had heard of his generosity towards the innkeeper he heard something move in the room and again he opened his eyes she was standing there her black hair curling over her shoulders her scarlet gown clinging to her body her lips curved in a smile of irony and her eyes re garded him steadily she was the woman he had seen in the castle the sleeping woman was this part of the dream forgive me for thus intruding upon your slumber and your privacy my lord but my business is urgent and i have little time to spare elric saw that moonglum still slept as if in a drugged slumber he sat upright in his bed stormbringer moaned softly and then was silent you seem to know me my lady but i do not i am called myshella empress of the dawn she smiled again some have named me that and others have called me the dark lady of kaneloon whom aubec loved then you must have preserved your youth carefully lady myshella no doing of mine it is possible that i am immortal i do not know i know only one thing and that is that time is a deception why do you come i cannot stay for long i come to seek your aid in what way we have an enemy in common i believe theleb kaarna the same did he place that enchantment upon you that made you sleep aye and he sent his oonai against me that is how she raised her hand i sent the chimerae to find you and bring you to me they meant you no harm but it was the only thing i could do for theleb kaarnas spell was already begin ning to work i battle his sorcery but it is strong and i am unable to revive myself for more than very short periods this is one such period theleb kaarna has joined forces with prince umbda lord of the kelmain hosts their plan is to conquer lormyr and ultimately the entire southern world who is this umbda i have heard neither of him nor of the kelmain hosts some noble of iosaz perhaps who prince umbda serves chaos he comes from the lands beyond worlds edge and his kelmain are not men at all though they have the appearance of men so theleb kaarna was in the far south after all that is why i came to you tonight you wish me to help you we both need theleb kaarna destroyed his sor cery is what enabled prince umbda to cross worlds edge now that sorcery is strengthened by what umbda bringsthe friendship of chaos i protect lormyr and i serve law i know that you serve chaos yet i hope your hatred of theleb kaarna overcomes that loyalty for the moment chaos has not served me of late lady so ill for get that loyalty i would have my vengeance on theleb kaarna and if we can help each other in the matter so much the better good she gasped then and her eyes glazed when next she spoke it was with some difficulty the enchantment is exerting its hold again i have a steed for you near the towns north gate it will bear you to an island in the boiling sea on that island is a palace called ashaneloon it is there that i have dwelt of late until i sensed lormyrs danger she pressed her hand to her brow and swayed but theleb kaarna expected me to try to re turn there and he placed a guardian at the palaces gate that guardian must be destroyed when you have de stroyed it you must go to the elric rose to help her but she waved him away to the eastern tower in the towers lower room is a chest in the chest is a large pouch of clothofgold you must take that andand bring it back to kaneloon for umbda and his kelmain now march against the castle theleb kaarna will destroy the castle with their helpand destroy me also with the pouch i may destroy them but pray that i am able to wake or the south is doomed and even you will not be able to go against the power that theleb kaarna will wield what of moonglum elric glanced at his sleeping friend can he accompany me best not besides he has a light enchantment upon him there is no time to wake him she gasped again and flung her arms across her forehead no time elric leaped from the bed and began to pull on his breeks he took his cloak from where it was draped across a stool and he buckled on his runesword he went forward to help her but she signalled him away no go please and she vanished still half asleep elric flung open the door and dashed down the stairs out into the night racing for the north gate of alorosaz passing through it and running on through the snow looking this way and that the cold flooded over him like a sudden wave he was soon knee deep in snow peering about him he carried on until he stopped in his tracks he gasped in astonishment when he saw the steed which myshella had provided for him whats this another chimera he approached it cautiously chapter six jewelled bird speaking it was a bird but it was not a bird of flesh and blood it was a bird of silver and of gold and of brass its wings clashed as he approached it and it moved its huge clawed feet impatiently turning cold emerald eyes to regard him on its back was a saddle of carved onyx chased in gold and copper and the saddle was empty awaiting him well i began all this unquestioningly elric said to himself i might as well complete it in the same manner and he went up to the bird and he climbed up its side and he lowered himself somewhat cautiously into the saddle the wings of gold and silver flapped with the sound of a hundred cymbals meeting and with three move ments had taken the bird of metal and its rider high up into the night sky above alorosaz it turned its bright head on its neck of brass and it opened its curved beak of gemstudded steel well master i am commanded to take thee to ash analoon elric waved a pale hand wherever you will i am at the mercy of you and your mistress and then he was jerked backward in the saddle as the birds wings beat the stronger and it gathered speed and he was rushing through the freezing night over snowy plains over mountains over rivers until the coast came in sight and he saw the sea in the west which was called the boiling sea down through the pitch blackness dropped the bird of gold and silver and now elric felt damp heat strike his face and hands heard a peculiar bubbling sound and he knew they were flying over that strange sea said to be fed by volcanoes lying deep below its surface a sea where no ships sailed steam surrounded them now its heat was almost un bearable but through it elric began to make out the silhouette of a landmass a small rocky island on which stood a single building and slender towers and turrets and domes the palace of ashaneloon said the bird of silver and gold i will alight among the battlements master but i fear that thing you must meet before our errand is accomplished so i will await you elsewhere then if you live i will return to take you back to kaneloon and if you die i will go back to tell my mistress of your failure over the battlements the bird now hovered its wings beating and elric reflected that there would be no ad vantage of surprise over whatever it was the bird feared so much he swung one leg from the saddle paused and then leapt down to the flat roof hastily the bird retreated into the black sky elric was alone all was silent save for the drumming of warm waves on a distant shore he located the eastern tower and began to make his way towards the door there was some chance per haps that he could complete his quest without the neces sity of facing the palaces guardian but then a monstrous bellow sounded behind him and he wheeled knowing that this must be the guardian a creature stood there its redrimmed eyes full of insen sate malice so you are theleb kaarnas slave said elric he reached for stormbringer and the sword seemed to spring into his hand at its own volition must i kill you or will you be gone now the creature bellowed again but it did not move the albino said i am elric of melnibone last of a line of great sorcerer kings this blade i wield will do more than kill you friend demon it will drink your soul and feed it to me perhaps you have heard of me by another name by the name of the soul thief the creature lashed its serrated tail and its bovine nostrils distended the horned head swayed on the short neck and the long teeth gleamed in the darkness it reached out scaly claws and began to lumber towards the prince of ruins elric took the sword in both hands and spread his feet wide apart on the flagstones and prepared to meet the monsters charge foul breath struck his face an other bellow and then it was upon him stormbringer howled and spilled black radiance over both the runes carved in the blade glowed with a greedy glow as the thing of hell slashed at elrics body with its claws ripping the shirt from him and baring his chest the sword came down the demon roared as the scales of its shoulder re ceived the blow but did not part it danced to one side and attacked again elric swayed back but now a thin wound was opened in his arm from elbow to wrist stormbringer struck for the second time and hit the demons snout so that it shrieked and lashed out once more again its claws found elrics body and blood smeared his chest from a shallow cut elric fell back losing his footing on the stones he almost went down but recovered his balance and de fended himself as best he could the claws slashed at him but stormbringer drove them to one side elric began to pant and the sweat poured down his face and he felt desperation well in him and then that desperation took a different quality and his eyes glowed and his lips snarled know you that i am elric he cried elric still the creature attacked i am elricmore demon than man begone you illshaped thing the creature bellowed and pounced and this time el ric did not fall back but his face writhing in terrible rage reversed his grip on the runesword and plunged it point first into the demons open jaws he plunged the black sword down the stinking throat down into the torso he wrenched the blade so that it split jaw neck chest and groin and the creatures life force began to course along the length of the runesword the claws lashed out at him but the creature was weakening then the life force pulsed up the blade and reached elric who gasped and screamed in dark ecstasy as the demons energy poured into him he withdrew the blade and hacked and hacked at the body and still the lifeforce flowed into him and gave greater power to his blows the demon groaned and dropped to the flag stones and it was done and a whitefaced demon stood over the dead thing of hell and its crimson eyes blazed and its pale mouth opened and it roared with wild laughter flinging its arms upward the runesword flaming with a black and horrid flame and it howled a wordless exultant song to the lords of chaos there was silence suddenly and then it bowed its head and it wept now elric opened the door to the eastern tower and stumbled through absolute blackness until he came to the lowest room the door to the room was locked and barred but stormbringer smashed through it and the last lord of melnibone entered a lighted room in which squatted a chest of iron his sword sundered the bands securing the chest and he flung open the lid and saw that there were many wonders in the chest as well as the pouch made from clothofgold but he picked out only the pouch and tucked it into his belt as he raced from the room back to the battlements where the bird of silver and gold stood pecking with its steel beak at the remnants of theleb kaarnas servant it looked up as elric returned in its eyes was an ex pression almost of humour well master we must make haste to kaneloon aye nausea had begun to fill elric his eyes were gloomy as he contemplated the corpse and that which he had stolen from it such life force whatever else it was must surely be tainted did not he drink something of the demons evil when his sword drank its soul he was about to climb back into the onyx saddle when he saw something gleaming amongst the black and yellow entrails he had spilled it was the demons heartan irregularly shaped stone of deep blue and purple and green it still pulsed though its owner was dead elric stooped and picked it up it was wet and so hot that it almost burned his hand but he tucked it into his pouch then mounted the bird of silver and gold his bonewhite face flickered with a dozen strange emotions as he let the bird bear him back over the boil ing sea his milkwhite hair flew wildly behind him and he was oblivious of the wounds on his arm and chest he was thinking of other things some of his thoughts lay in the past and others were in the future and he laughed bitterly twice and his eyes shed tears and he spoke once ah what agony is this life chapter seven black wizard laughing to kaneloon they came in the early dawn and in the distance elric saw a massive army darkening the snow and he knew it must be the kelmain host led by theleb kaarna and prince umbda marching against the lonely castle the bird of gold and silver flapped down in the snow outside the castles entrance and elric dismounted then the bird had risen into the air again and was gone the great gate of castle kaneloon was closed this time and he gathered his tattered cloak about his naked torso and he hammered on the gate with his fists and he forced a cry from his dry lips myshella myshella there was no answer myshella i have returned with that which you need he feared she must have fallen into her enchanted slumber again he looked towards the south and the dark tide had rolled a little closer to the castle myshella then he heard a bar being drawn and the gates groaned open and there stood moonglum his face strained and his eyes full of something of which he could not speak moonglum how came you here i know not how elric moonglum stepped aside so that elric could enter he replaced the bar i lay in my bed last night when a woman came to methe same woman we saw sleeping here she said i must go with her and somehow go i did but i know not how elric i know not how and where is that woman where we first saw her she sleeps and i cannot wake her elric drew a deep breath and told briefly what he knew of myshella and the host that came against her castle kaneloon do you know the contents of that pouch moon glum asked elric shook his head and opened the pouch to peer inside it seems to be nothing but a pinkish dust yet it must be some powerful sorcery if myshella believes it can defeat the entire kelmain host moonglum frowned but surely myshella must work the charm herself if only she knows what it is aye and theleb kaarna has enchanted her aye and now it is too late for umbdawhoever he may benears the castle aye elrics hand trembled as he drew from his belt the thing he had taken from the demon just before he left the palace of ashaneloon unless this is the stone i think it is what is that i know a legend some demons possess these stones as hearts he held it to the light so that the blues and purples and greens writhed i have never seen one but i believe it to be the thing i once sought for cymoril when i tried to lift my cousins charm from her what i sought but never found was a nanorion a stone of magical powers said to be able to waken the deador those in deathlike sleep and that is a nanorion it will awaken myshella if anything can then this will for i took it from theleb kaarnas own demon and that must improve the efficaciousness of the magic come elric strode through the hall and up the stairs until he came to myshellas room where she lay as he had seen her before on the bed hung with draperies her wall hung with shields and weapons now i understand why these arms decorate her chamber moonglum said according to legend these are the shields and weapons of all those who loved myshella and championed her cause elric nodded and said as if to himself aye she was ever an enemy of melnibone was the empress of the dawn he held the pulsing stone delicately and reached out to place it on her forehead it makes no difference moonglum said after a moment she does not stir there is a rune but i remember it not elric pressed his fingers to his temples i remember it not moonglum went to the window we can ask theleb kaarna perhaps he said ironically he will be here soon enough then moonglum saw that there were tears again in elrics eyes and that he had turned away hoping moonglum would not see moonglum cleared his throat i have some business below call me if you should require my help he left the room and closed the door and elric was alone with the woman who seemed increasingly a dreadful phantom from his most frightful dreams he controlled his feverish mind and tried to disci pline it to remember the crucial runes in the high speech of old melnibone gods he hissed help me but he knew that in this matter in particular the lords of chaos would not assist himwould hinder him if they could for myshella was one of the chief instruments of law upon the earth had been respon sible for driving chaos from the world he fell to his knees beside her bed bis hands clenched his face twisting with the effort and then it came back to him his head still bent he stretched out his right hand and touched the puls ing stone stretched out his left hand and rested it upon myshellas navel and he began a chant in an ancient tongue that had been spoken before true men had ever walked the earth elric moonglum burst into the room and elric was wrenched from his trance elric we are invaded their advance riders what they have broken into the castlea dozen of them i fought them off and barred the way up to this tower but they are hacking at the door now i think they have been sent to destroy myshella if they could they were surprised to discover me here elric rose and looked carefully down at myshella the rune was finished and had been repeated almost through again when moonglum had come in she did not stir yet theleb kaarna worked his sorcery from a dis tance moonglum said ensuring that myshella would not resist him but he did not reckon with us he and elric hurried from the room down the steps to where a door was bulging and splintering beneath the weapons of those beyond stand back moonglum elric drew the crooning runesword lifted it high and brought it against the door the door split and two oddly shaped skulls were split with it the remainder of the attackers fell back with cries of astonishment and horror as the whitefaced reaver fell upon them his huge sword drinking their souls and singing its strange undulating song down the stairs elric pursued them into the hall where they bunched together and prepared to defend themselves from this demon with his hellforged blade and elric laughed and they shuddered and their weapons trembled in their hands so you are the mighty kelmain elric sneered no wonder you needed sorcery to aid you if you are so cowardly have you not heard beyond worlds edge of elric kinslayer but the kelmain plainly did not understand his speech which was strange enough in itself for he had spoken in the common tongue known to all men these people had golden skins and eyesockets that were almost square their faces in all seemed crudely carved from rock all sharp angles and planes and their armour was not rounded but angular elric bared his teeth in a smile and the kelmain drew closer together then he screamed with dreadful laughter and moon glum stepped back and did not look at what took place the runesword swung heads and limbs were chopped away blood gouted souls were taken the kelmains dead faces bore expressions showing that before the life was drawn from them they had known the truth of their appalling fate and stormbringer drank again for stormbringer was a thirsty hellsword and elric felt his deficient veins swell with even more energy than that which he had taken earlier from theleb kaarnas demon the hall shook with elrics insane mirth and he strode over the piled corpses and he went through the open gateway to where the great host waited and he shouted a name theleb kaarna theleb kaarna moonglum ran after him calling for him to stop but elric did not heed him elric strode on through the snow his sword dripping a red trail behind him under a cold sun the kelmain were riding for the castle called kaneloon and elric went to meet them at their head on slender horses rode the darkfaced sorcerer of pan tang dressed in flowing robes and beside him was the prince of the kelmain host prince umbda in proud armour bizarre plumes nodding on his helm a triumphant smile on his strange angular features behind the host dragged oddlyfashioned wargear which for all its oddness looked powerfulmightier than anything lormyr could rally when the huge army fell upon her as the lone figure appeared and began to walk away from the walls of castle kaneloon theleb kaarna raised his hand and stopped the hosts advance reining in his own horse and laughing why it is the jackal of melnibone by all the gods of chaos he acknowledges his master at last and comes to deliver himself up to me elric came closer and theleb kaarna laughed on here elrickneel before me elric did not pause seemed not to hear the pan tangians words prince umbdas eyes were troubled and he said something in a strange tongue theleb kaarna sniffed and replied in the same language and still the albino marched through the snow towards the huge host by chardros elric stop cried theleb kaarna his horse shifting nervously beneath him if you have come to bargain you are a fool kaneloon and her mistress must fall before lormyr is oursand lormyr shall be ours theres no doubting that then eric did stop and he brought up his eyes to burn into those of the sorcerer and there was a still cold smile upon his pale lips theleb kaarna tried to meet elrics gaze but could not his voice trembled when he next spoke you cannot defeat the whole kelmain host i have no wish to conjurer your life is all i de sire the sorcerers face twitched well you shall not have it hai men of the kelmain take him he wheeled his horse and rode into the protective ranks of his warriors calling out his orders in their own tongue from the castle another figure burst rushing to join elric it was moonglum of elwher a sword in either hand elric halfturned elric well die together stay back moonglum moonglum hesitated stay back if you love me moonglum reluctantly retreated to the castle the kelmain horsemen swept in broadbladed straight swords raised instantly surrounding the albino they threatened him hoping that he would lay down his sword and let himself be captured but elric smiled stormbringer began to sing elric grasped the sword in both hands bent his elbows then suddenly held the blade straight out before him he began to whirl like a tarkeshite dancer round and round and it was as if the sword dragged him faster and faster while it gouged and gashed and decapitated the kelmain horsemen for a moment they fell back leaving their dead com rades heaped about the albino but prince umbda after a hurried conference with theleb kaarna urged them upon elric again and elric swung his blade once more but not so many of the kelmain perished this tune armoured body fell against armoured body blood mingled with brothers blood horses dragged corpses away with them across the snow and elric did not fall yet something was happening to him then it dawned upon his berserker brain that for some reason his blade was sated the energy still pulsed in its metal but it transferred nothing more to its mas ter and his own stolen energy was beginning to wane damn you stormbringer give me your power swords rained down upon him as he fought and slew and parried and thrust more power he was still stronger than normal and much stronger than any ordinary mortal but some of the wild anger was leaving him and he felt almost puzzled as more kelmain came at him he was beginning to waken from the blooddream he shook his head and drew deep breaths his back was aching give me their strength black sword he struck at legs and arms and chests and faces and he was covered from head to foot in the blood of bis attackers but the dead now hampered him worse than the liv ing for their corpses were everywhere and he almost lost his footing more than once what ails you runesword do you refuse to help me will you not fight these things because like you they are of chaos no it could not be that all that had happened was that the sword desired no more vitality and therefore gave elric none he fought on for another hour before his grip on the sword weakened and a rider halfmad with terror struck a blow at his head failed to split it but stunned him so that he fell upon the bodies of the slain tried to rise then was struck again and lost consciousness chapter eight a great host screaming it was more than i hoped murmured theleb kaarna in satisfaction but we have taken him alive elric opened his eyes and looked with hatred on the sorcerer who was stroking his black forked beard as if to comfort himself elric could barely remember the events which had brought him here and placed him in the sorcerers power he remembered much blood much laughter much dying but it was all fading like the memory of a dream well renegade your foolishness was unbelievable i thought you must have an army behind you but doubtless it was your fear which unbalanced your poor brain still ill not speculate upon the cause of my own good fortune theres many a bargain i can strike with the denizens of other planes were i to offer them your soul and your body i will keep for myselfto show queen yishana what i did to her lover before he died elric laughed shortly and looked about him ignoring theleb kaarna the kelmain were awaiting orders they had still not marched on kaneloon the sun was low in the sky he saw the pile of corpses behind him he saw the hatred and fear on the faces of the goldenskinned host and he smiled again i do not love yishana he said distantly as if scarcely aware of theleb kaarnas presence it is your jealous heart that makes you think so i left yishanas side to find you it is never love that moves elric of melnibone sorcerer but always hatred i do not believe you theleb kaarna tittered when the whole south falls to me and my comrades then will i court yishana and offer to make her queen of all the west as well as all the south our forces united we shall dominate the earth you pan tangians were ever an insecure breed for ever planning conquest for its own sake forever seeking to destroy the equilibrium of the young kingdoms one day sneered theleb kaarna pan tang will have an empire that will make the bright empire seem a mere flickering ember in the fire of history but it is not for the glory of pan tang that i do this it is for yishana by the gods sorcerer then i am glad im motivated by hatred and not by love for i do not half the damage it seems done by those in love i will lay the south at yishanas feet and she may use it as she pleases i am bored by this what do you intend to do with me first i will hurt your body i will hurt it delicately to begin with building up the pain until i have you in the proper frame of mind then i will consort with the lords of the higher planes to find which will give me most for your soul and what of kaneloon the kelmain will deal with kaneloon one knife is all thats needed now to slit myshellas throat as she sleeps she is protected theleb kaarnas brow darkened then it cleared and he laughed again aye but the gate will fall soon enough and your little redhaired friend will perish as myshella perishes he ran his fingers through his oiled ringlets i am allowing at prince umbdas request the kel main to rest a while before storming the castle but kaneloon will be burning by nightfall elric looked towards the castle across the trampled snow plainly his nines had failed to counter theleb kaarnas spell i would he began to speak when he paused he had seen a flash of gold and silver among the battlements and a thought without shape had entered his head and made him hesitate what theleb kaarna asked him harshly nothing i merely wondered where my sword was the sorcerer shrugged nowhere you can reach it reaver we left it where you dropped it the stinking hellblade is no use to us and none to you now elric wondered what would happen if he made a direct appeal to the sword he could not get to it him self for theleb kaarna had bound him tightly with ropes of silk but he might call for it he lifted himself to his feet would you seek to run away white wolf the leb kaarna watched him nervously elric smiled again i wished for a better view of the coming conquest of kaneloon just that the sorcerer drew a curved knife elric swayed his eyes halfclosed and he began to murmur a name beneath his breath theleb kaarna leapt forward and his arm encircled elrics head while the knife pricked into the albinos throat be silent jackal but elric knew that he had no other means of helping himself and for all it was a desperate scheme he mur mured the words once more praying that theleb kaarnas lust for a slow revenge would make the sorcerer hesitate before killing him theleb kaarna cursed trying to prise elrics mouth open the first thing ill do is cut out that damned tongue of yours elric bit the hand and tasted the sorcerers blood he spat it out theleb kaarna screamed by chardros if i did not wish to see you die over the months i would and then a sound came from the kelmain it was a moan of surprise and it issued from every throat theleb kaarna turned and the breath hissed from between his clenched teeth through the murky dusk a black shape moved it was the sword stormbringer elric had called it now he cried aloud stormbringer stormbringer to me theleb kaarna flung elric in the path of the sword and rushed into the security of the gathered ranks of kelmain warriors stormbringer the black sword hovered in the air near elric another shout went up from the kelmain a shape had left the battlements of castle kaneloon theleb kaarna shouted in hysteria prince umbda prepare your men for the attack i sense danger to us umbda could not understand the sorcerers words and theleb kaarna was forced to translate them do not let the sword reach him cried the sorcerer once more he shouted in the language of the kelmain and several warriors ran forward to grasp the rune sword before it could reach its albino master but the sword struck rapidly and the kelmain died and none dared approach it after that slowly stormbringer moved towards elric ah elric cried theleb kaarna if you escape me this day i swear that i shall find you and if you escape me elric shouted back i will find you theleb kaarna be sure of that the shape that had left castle kaneloon had feathers of silver and gold it flew high above the host and hovered for a moment before moving to the outer edges of the gathering elric could not see it clearly but he knew what it was that was why he had sum moned the sword for he had an idea that moonglum rode the giant bird of metal and that the elwherian would try to rescue him do not let it land it comes to save the albino screamed theleb kaarna but the kelmain host did not understand him un der prince umbdas commands they were preparing themselves for the attack upon the castle theleb kaarna repeated his orders in their own tongue but it was plain they were beginning not to trust him and could not see the need to bother them selves with one man and a strange bird of metal it could not stop their engines of war neither could the man stormbringer whispered elric as the sword sliced through his bonds and gently settled in his hand elric was free but the kelmain though not placing the same importance upon him as did theleb kaarna showed that they were not prepared to let him escape now that the blade was in his grasp and not moving of its own volition prince umbda shouted something a huge mass of warriors rushed at elric at once and he made no effort to take the attack to them this time for he was interested in fighting a defensive strategy until moonglum could descend on the bird and help him but the bird was even further away it appeared to be circling the outer perimeters of the host and showed no interest in his plight at all had he been deceived he parried a dozen thrusts letting the kelmain war riors crowd in upon each other and thus hamper them selves the bird of gold and silver was almost out of sight now and theleb kaarnawhere was he elric tried to find him but the sorcerer was doubt less somewhere in the centre of the kelmain ranks by now elric killed a goldenskinned warrior slitting his throat with the point of the runesword more strength began to flow into him again he killed another kel main with an overarm movement which split the mans shoulder but nothing could be gained from this fight if moonglum was not coming on the bird of silver and gold the bird seemed to change course and come back towards kaneloon was it merely waiting for instruc tions from its sleeping mistress or was it refusing to obey moonglums commands elric backed through the muddy bloody snow so that the pile of corpses now lay behind him he fought on but with very little hope the bird went past far to his right elric thought ironically that he had completely mis taken the significance of the birds leaving the castle battlements and by mistiming his decision had merely brought his death closerperhaps myshellas and moonglums deaths closer too kaneloon was doomed myshella was doomed lormyr and perhaps the whole of the young king doms were doomed and he was doomed it was then that a shadow passed across the battling men and the kelmain screamed and fell back as a great din rent the air elric looked up in relief hearing the sound of the metal birds clashing wings he looked for moonglum in the saddle and saw instead the tense face of myshella herself her hair blowing around her face as it was disturbed by the beating wings quickly lord elric before they close in again elric sheathed the runesword and leapt towards the saddle swinging himself behind the sorceress of kane loon then they rose into the air again while arrows hurtled around their heads and bounced off the birds metal feathers one more circuit of the host and then we return to the castle she said your rune and the nanorion worked to defeat theleb kaarnas enchantment but they took longer than either of us would have liked see already prince umbda is ordering his men to mount and ride to castle kaneloon and kaneloon has only moonglum to defend her now why this circuit of umbdas army you will see at least i hope you will see my lord she began to sing a song it was a strange disturbing chant in a language not dissimilar to the melnibonean high speech yet different enough for elric to under stand only a few words for it was oddly accented around the camp they flew elric saw the kelmain form their ranks into battle order doubtless umbda and theleb kaarna had by now decided on the best mode of attack then back to the castle beat the great bird settling on the battlements and allowing elric and myshella to dismount moonglum his features taut came running to meet them they went to look at the kelmain and they saw that the kelmain were on the move what did you do to began elric but myshella raised her hand perhaps i did nothing perhaps the sorcery will not work what was it you i scattered the contents of the purse you brought i scattered it around their whole army watch and if the spell has not worked moonglum murmured he paused straining his eyes through the gloom what is that myshellas satisfied tone was almost ghoulish as she said it is the noose of flesh something was growing out of the snow something pink that quivered something huge a great mass that arose on all sides of the kelmain and made their horses rear up and snort and it made the kelmain shriek the stuff was like flesh and it had grown so high that the whole kelmain host was obscured from sight there were noises as they tried to train their battle engines upon the stuff and blast their way through there were shouts but not a single horseman broke out of the noose of flesh then the substance began to fold in over the kel main and elric heard a sound such as none he had heard before it was a voice a voice of a hundred thousand men all facing an identical terror all dying an identical death it was a moan of desperation of hopelessness of fear but it was a moan so loud that it shook the walls of castle kaneloon it is no death for a warrior murmured moonglum turning away but it was the only weapon we had said myshella i have possessed it for a good many years but never before did i feel the need to use it of them all only theleb kaarna deserved that death said elric night fell and the noose of flesh tightened around the kelmain host crushing all but a few horses which had run free as the sorcery began to work it crushed prince umbda who spoke no language known in the young kingdoms who spoke no lan guage known to the ancients who had come to conquer from beyond the worlds edge it crushed theleb kaarna who had sought for the sake of his love for a wanton queen to conquer the world with the aid of chaos it crushed all the warriors of that nearhuman race the kelmain and it crushed all who could have told the watchers what the kelmain had been or from where they had originated then it absorbed them then it flickered and dis solved and was dust again no piece of fleshmans nor beastsremained but over the snow was scattered clothing arms ar mour siege engines riding accoutrements coins belt buckles for as far as the eye could see myshella nodded to herself that was the noose of flesh she said i thank you for bringing it to me elric i thank you also for finding the stone which revived me i thank you for saving lormyr aye said elric thank me there was a weari ness on him now he turned away shivering snow had begun to fall again thank me for nothing lady myshella what i did was to satisfy my own dark urges to sate my thirst for vengeance i have destroyed theleb kaarna the rest was incidental i care nought for lormyr the young kingdoms or any of your causes moonglum saw that myshella had a sceptical look in her eyes and she smiled slightly elric entered the castle and began to descend the steps to the hall wait myshella said this castle is magical it reflects the desires of any who enter itshould i wish it elric rubbed at his eyes then plainly we have no desires mine are satisfied now that theleb kaarna is destroyed i would leave this place now my lady you have none said she he looked at her directly he frowned regret breeds weakness regret achieves nothing regret is like a disease which attacks the internal organs and at last destroys and you have no desires he hesitated i understand you your own appear ance ill admit he shrugged but are you she spread her hands do not ask too many ques tions of me she made another gesture now see this castle becomes what you most desire and in it the things you most desire and elric looked about him his eyes widening and he began to scream he fell to his knees in terror he turned pleadingly to her no myshella no i do not desire this hastily she made yet another sign moonglum helped his friend to his feet what was it what did you see elric straightened his back and rested his hand on his sword and said grimly and quietly to myshella lady i would kill you for that if i did not under stand you sought only to please me he studied the ground for a moment before contin uing know this elric cannot have what he desires most what he desires does not exist what he desires is dead all elric has is sorrow guilt malice hatred this is all he deserves and all he will ever desire she put her hands to her own face and walked back to the room where he had first seen her elric followed moonglum started after them but then he stopped and remained where he stood he watched them enter the room and saw the door close he walked back on to the battlements and stared into the darkness he saw wings of silver and gold flashing in the moonlight and they became smaller and smaller until they had vanished he sighed it was cold he went back into the castle and settled himself with his back against a pillar preparing to sleep but a little while later he heard laughter come from the room in the highest tower and the laughter sent him running through the pas sages through the great hall where the fire had died out of the door into the night to seek the stables where he could feel more secure but he could not sleep that night for the distant laughter still pursued him and the laughter continued until morning book two to snare the pale prince but it was in nadsokor city of beggars that elric found an old friend and learned something con cerning an old enemy the chronicle of the black sword chapter one the beggar court nadsokor city of beggars was infamous throughout the young kingdoms lying near the shores of that ferocious river the varkalk and not too far from the kingdom of org in which blossomed the frightful forest of troos and exuding a stink which seemed thick enough ten miles distant nadsokor was plagued by few visitors from this unlovely place sallied out her citizens to beg their way about the world and steal what they could and bring it back to nadsokor where half of their profits were handed over to their king in return for his protection their king had ruled for many years he was called urish the sevenfingered for he had but four fingers on his right hand and three upon his left veins had burst all over his once handsome face and filthy in fested hair framed that seedy countenance upon which age and grime had traced a thousand lines from out of all this ruin peered two bright pale eyes as the symbol of his power urish had a great cleaver called hackmeat which was forever at his side his throne was of crudely carved black oak studded with bits of raw gold bones and semiprecious gems be neath this throne was urishs hoarda chest of trea sure which he let none but himself look upon for the best part of every day urish would lounge on his throne presiding over a gloomy festering hall throned with his court a rabble of rascals too foul in appearance and disposition to be tolerated anywhere but here for heat and light there burned permanently braziers of garbage which gave out oily smoke and a stink which dominated all the other stinks in the hall and now there was a visitor at urishs court he stood before the dais on which the throne was mounted and from time to time he raised a heavily scented kerchief to his red full lips his face which was normally dark in complexion was somewhat grey and his eyes had something of a haunted tortured look in them as they glanced from begrimed beggar to pile of rubbish to guttering brazier dressed in the loose brocade robes of the folk of pan tang the visitor had black eyes a great hooked nose blueblack ringlets and a curling beard kerchief to mouth he bowed low when he reached urishs throne as always greed weakness and malice mingled to form king urishs expression as he regarded the stranger whom one of his courtiers had but lately an nounced urish had recognised the name and he believed he could guess the pan tangians business here i heard you were dead theleb kaarnakilled be yond lormyr near worlds edge urish grinned to display the black crags which were the rotting remains of his teeth theleb kaarna removed the kerchief from his lips and his voice was strangled at first gaining strength as he remembered the wrongs recently done him my magic is not so weak i cannot escape a spell such as was woven that day i conjured myself below the ground while myshellas noose of flesh engulfed the kelmain host urishs disgusting grin widened you crept into a hole is that it the sorcerers eyes burned fiercely ill not dispute the strength of my powers with he broke off and drew a deep breath which he at once regretted he stared warily around him at the beggar court all manged and maimed which had de posited itself about the filthy hall mocking him the beggars of nadsokor knew the power of poverty and diseaseknew how it terrified those who were not used to it and thus their very squalor was their safe guard against intruders a repulsive cough which might have been a laugh now seized king urish and was it your magic that brought you here as his whole body shook his blood shot eyes continued beadily to regard the sorcerer i have travelled across the seas and all across vilmir to be here theleb kaarna said because i had heard there was one you hated above all others and we hate all othersall who are not beggars urish reminded him the king chuckled and the chuckle became once more a throaty convulsive cough but you hate elric of melnibone most aye it would be fair to say that before he won fame as the kinslayer the traitor of imrryr he came to nadsokor to deceive us disguised as a leper who had begged his way from the eastlands beyond karlaak he tricked me disgracefully and stole something from my hoard and my hoard is sacredi will not let another even glimpse it i heard he stole a scroll from you theleb kaarna said a spell which had once belonged to his cousin yyrkoon yyrkoon wished to be rid of elric and let him believe that the spell would release the princess cymoril from her sorcerous slumber aye yyrkoon had given the scroll to one of our citizens when he went abegging to the gates of imrryr he then told elric what he had done elric disguised himself and came here with the aid of sorcery he gained access to my hoardmy sacred hoardand plucked the scroll from it theleb kaarna looked sideways at the beggar king some would say that it was not elrics faultthat yyrkoon was to blame he deceived you both the spell did not awaken cymoril did it no but we have a law in nadsokor urish raised the great cleaver hackmeat and displayed its ragged rusty blade for all its battered appearance it was a fearsome weapon that law says that any man who looks upon the sacred hoard of king urish must die and die most horriblyat the hands of the burning god and none of your wandering citizens have yet man aged to take this vengeance i must pass the sentence personally upon him be fore he dies he must come again to nadsokor for it is only here that he may be acquainted with his doom theleb kaarna said i have no love for elric urish once more voiced the sound that was half laugh half wheezing cough ayei have heard he has chased you all across the young kingdoms that you have brought more and more powerful sorceries against him yet every time he has defeated you theleb kaarna frowned have a care king urish i have had bad luck yet i am still one of pan tangs greatest sorcerers but you spend your powers freely and claim much from the lords of chaos one day they will be tired of helping you and find another to do their work king urish closed soiled lips over black teeth his pale eyes did not blink as he studied theleb kaarna there were stirrings in the hall the beggar court moved in closer the click of a crutch the scrape of a staff the shuffle of misshapen feet even the oily smoke from the braziers seemed to menace him as it drifted reluctantly into the darkness of the roof king urish put one hand upon hackmeat and the other upon his chin broken nails caressed stubble from somewhere behind theleb kaarna a beggar woman let forth an obscene noise and then giggled almost as if to comfort himself the sorcerer placed the scented kerchief firmly over his mouth and nostrils he began to draw himself up prepared to deal with an attack if it came but you still have your powers now i take it said urish suddenly breaking the tension or you would not be here my powers increase for the moment perhaps my powers i take it you come with a scheme which you hope will result in elrics destruction continued urish easily the beggars relaxed only theleb kaarna now showed any signs of discomfort urishs bright blood shot eyes were sardonic and you desire our help because you know we hate the whitefaced reaver of melnibone theleb kaarna nodded would you hear the details of my plan urish shrugged why not at least they may be entertaining unhappily theleb kaarna looked about him at the corrupt and tittering crew he wished he knew a spell which would disperse the stink he took a deep breath through his kerchief and then began to speak chapter two the stolen ring on the other side of the tavern the young dandy pretended to order another skin of wine while actually taking a sly look towards the corner where elric sat then the dandy leaned towards his compatriots merchants and young nobles of several nationsand continued his murmured discourse the subject of that discourse elric knew was elric normally he was disdainful of such behaviour but he was weary and he was impatient for moonglum to re turn he was almost tempted to order the young dandy to desist if only to pass the time elric was beginning to regret his decision to visit old hrolmar this rich city was a great meeting place for all the imaginative people of the young kingdoms to it came explorers adventurers mercenaries craftsmen mer chants painters and poets for under the rule of the famous duke avan astran this vilmirian city state was undergoing a transformation in its character duke avan was himself a man who had explored most of the world and had brought back great wealth and knowledge to old hrolmar its riches and its in tellectual life attracted more riches more intellectuals and so old hrolmar flourished but where riches are and where intellectuals are then gossip also flourishes for if there is any breed of man who gossips more than the merchant or the sailor then it is the poet and the painter and naturally enough there was much gossip concerning the doomdriven albino elric already a hero of several ballads by poets not overtalented elric had allowed himself to be brought to the city because moonglum had said it was the best place to find an income elrics carelessness with their wealth had made nearpaupers of them not for the first time and they were in need of provisions and fresh steeds elric had been for skirting old hrolmar and riding on towards tanelorn where they had decided to go but moonglum had argued reasonably that they would need better horses and more food and equipment for the long ride across the vilmirian and ilmioran plains to the edge of the sighing desert where mysterious tane lorn was situated so elric had at last agreed though after his encounter with myshella and his witnessing of the destruction of the noose of flesh he had become weary and craved for the peace which tanelorn offered what made things worse was that this tavern was rather too welllit and catering too much to the better end of the trade for elrics taste he would have preferred a lowlier sort of inn which would have been cheaper and where men were used to holding back their questions and their gossip but moonglum had thought it wise to spend the last of their wealth on a good inn in case they should need to entertain someone elric left the business of raising treasure to moon glum doubtless he intended to get it by thievery or trickery but elric did not care he sighed and suffered the sidelong looks of the other guests and tried not to overhear the young dandy he sipped his cup of wine and picked at the flesh of the cold fowl moonglum had ordered before he went off he drew his head into the high collar of his black cloak but succeeded only in emphasising the bonewhite pallor of his face and the milky whiteness of his long hair he looked around him at the silks and furs and tapestries swirling about the tavern as their owners moved from table to table and he longed with all his heart to be on his way to tanelorn where men spoke little because they had experienced so much killed mother and father tooand the mothers lover it is said and they say he lies with corpses for preference and because of that the lords of the higher worlds cursed him with the face of a corpse incest was it not i got it from one who sailed with him that and his mother had congress with arioch him self thus producing shortly before he betrayed his own people to smiorgan and the rest he looks a gloomy fellow right enough not one to enjoy a jest laughter elric made himself relax in his chair and swallow more wine but the gossip went on they say also that he is an imposter that the real elric died at imrryr a true prince of melnibone would dress in more lavish style and he would more laughter elric stood up pushing back his cloak so that the great black broadsword at his hip was fully displayed most people in old hrolmar had heard of the rune sword stormbringer and its terrible power elric crossed to the table where the young dandy sat i pray you gentlemen to improve your sport you can do much better nowfor here is one who would offer you proof of certain things of which you speak what of his penchant for vampirism of a particular sort i did not hear you touch upon that in your con versation the young dandy cleared his throat and made a nervous little flirt of his shoulder well elric feigned an innocent expression can not i be of assistance the gossips had become dumb pretending to be absorbed in their eating and drinking elric smiled a smile which set their hands to shaking i desire only to know what you wish to hear gentlemen then i will demonstrate that i am truly the one you have called elric kinslayer the merchants and the nobles gathered their rich robes about them and avoiding his eye got up the young dandy minced towards the exita parody of bravado but now elric stood laughing in the doorway his hand on the hilt of stormbringer will you not join me as my guests gentlemen think how you could tell your friends of the meeting gods how boorish lisped the young dandy and then shivered sir we meant no harm thickly said a fat shazarian herb trader we spoke of another a young noble with only the hint of a chin but with an emphatic moustache offered a feeble placatory grin we said how much we admired you stuttered a vilmirian knight whose eyes appeared but recently to have crossed and whose face was now almost as pale as elrics a merchant in the dark brocades of tarkesh licked his red lips and attempted to conduct himself with more dignity than his friends sir old hrolmar is a civilised city gentlemen do not brawl amongst themselves here but like peasant women prefer to gossip said elric yes said the youth with the abundance of mous tache ahno the dandy arranged his cloak about him and glow ered at the floor elric stepped aside uncertainly the tarkeshite mer chant moved forward and then ran for the darkness of the street his companions tumbling behind him elric heard their footsteps running on the cobbles and he began to laugh at the sound of his laugh the footfalls became a scamper and the party had soon reached the quayside where the water gleamed turned a corner and disappeared elric smiled and looked up beyond old hrolmars baroque skyline at the stars now there were more footsteps coming from the other end of the street he turned and saw the newcomers step into a pool of light thrown from the window of a nearby office it was moonglum the stocky eastlander was return ing in the company of two women who were scantily dressed and heavily painted and who were without doubt vilmirian whores from the other side of city moonglum had an arm about each waist and he was singing some obscure but evidently disgraceful ballad pausing frequently to have one of the laughing girls pour wine down his throat both the whores had large stone flasks in their free hands and they were matching moonglum drink for drink as moonglum stepped unsteadily nearer he recog nised elric and hailed him winking you see i have not forgotten you prince of melnibone one of these beauties is for you elric made an exaggerated bow you are very good to me but i thought you planned to find some gold for us was that not the reason for coming to old hrolmar aye moonglum kissed the cheeks of the girls they snorted with laughter indeed gold it isor something as good as gold i have rescued these young ladies from a cruel whoremaster on the other side of town i have promised to sell them to a kinder master and they are grateful to me you stole these slaves if you wish to say soi stole them aye then steal i did i stole in with my steel and i released them from a life of degradation a humanitarian deed their miserable life is no more they may look forward to their miserable lives will be no moreas indeed will be ours when the whoremaster discovers the crime and alerts the watch how found you these ladies they found me i had made my swords available to an old merchant a stranger to the city i was to escort him about the murkier regions of old hrolmar in return for a good purse of gold better i think than he expected to give me while he whored above as he could i had a drink or two below in the public rooms these two beauties look a liking to me and told me of their unhappiness it was enough i rescued them a cunning plan elric said sardonically twas theirs they have brains as well as ill help you carry them back to their master before the city guards descend upon us but elric but first elric seized his friend and threw him over his shoulder staggering with him to the quay at the end of the street taking a good hold on his collar and lowering him suddenly into the reeking water then he hauled him up and stood him down moonglum shivered and looked sadly at elric i am prone to colds as you know and prone to drunken plans too we are not liked here moonglum the watch needs only one excuse to set upon us at best we should have to flee the city before our business was done at worst we shall be disarmed imprisoned perhaps slain they began to walk back to where the two girls still stood one of the girls ran forward and knelt to take elrics hand and press her lips against his thigh mas ter i have a message elric bent to raise her to her feet she screamed her painted eyes widened he stared at her in astonishment and then following her gaze turned and saw the pack of bravos who had stolen round the corner and were now rushing at himself and moonglum behind the bravos elric thought he saw the young dandy he had earlier chased from the tavern the dandy wished for revenge poignards glit tered in the darkness and their owners wore the black hoods of professional assassins there were at least a dozen of them the young dandy must therefore be extremely rich for assassins were expensive in old hrolmar moonglum had already drawn both his swords and was engaging the leader elric pushed the frightened girl behind him and put his hand to stormbringers pommel almost at its own volition the huge runesword sprang from its scabbard and black light poured from its blade as it began to hum its own strange battlecry he heard one of the assassins gasp elric and guessed that the dandy had not made it plain whom they were to slay he blocked the thrust of the slim longsword turned it and chopped with a kind of deli cacy at the owners wrist wrist and sword flew into the shadows and the owner staggered back screaming more swords now and more cold eyes glittering from the black hoods stormbringer sang its peculiar song halflament halfvictory shout elrics own face was alive with battlelust and his crimson eyes blazed from his bonewhite face as he swung this way and that shouts curses the screams of women and the groans of men steel striking steel boots on cobbles the sounds of swords in flesh of blades scraping bone a confusion through which elric fought his broadsword clapped in both pale hands he had lost sight of moonglum and prayed that the eastlander still stood from time to time he glimpsed one of the girls and wondered why she had not run for safety now the corpses of several hooded assassins lay upon the cobbles and the remainder were beginning to falter as elric pressed them they knew the power of his sword and what it did to those it struck they had seen their comrades faces as their souls were drawn from them by the hellblade with every death elric seemed to grow stronger and the black radiance from the blade seemed to burn fiercer and now the albino was laugh ing his laughter rang over the rooftops of old hrolmar and those who were abed covered their ears believing themselves in the grip of nightmares come friends my blade still hungers an assassin made to stand his ground and elric swept the black sword up the man raised his blade to protect his head and elric brought the black sword down it sheared through the steel and cut down through the hood through the neck through the breast bone it clove the assassin completely in two and it stayed in the flesh feasting drawing out the last traces of the mans dark soul and then the rest were running elric drew a deep breath avoided looking at the man his sword had slain last sheathed the blade and turned to look for moonglum it was then that the blow came on the back of his neck he felt nausea rise in him and tried to shake it off he felt a prick in his wrist and through the haze he saw a figure he thought at first was moonglum but it was anotherperhaps a woman she was tugging at his left hand where did she want him to go his knees became weak and he fell to the cobbles he tried to call out but failed the woman was still tugging at his hand as if she sought to take him to safety but he could not follow her he fell on his shoulder then on his back glimpsed a swimming sky and then the dawn was rising over the crazy spires of old hrolmar and he realised that several hours had passed since he had fought the assassins moonglums face appeared it was full of concern moonglum thank elwhers gentle gods i thought you slain by that poisoned blade elrics head was clearing rapidly now he rose to a sitting position the attacker came from behind how moonglum looked embarrassed i fear those girls were not all they seemed elric remembered the woman tugging at his left hand and he stretched out his fingers moonglum the ring of kings is gone from my hand the actorios has been stolen the ring of kings had been worn by elrics fore fathers for centuries it had been the symbol of their power the source of much of their supernatural strength moonglums face clouded i thought i stole the girls but they were thieves they planned to rob us an old trick theres more to it moonglum they stole nothing else just the ring of kings theres still a little gold left in my purse he jingled his belt pouch climbing to his feet moonglum jerked his thumb at the streets far wall there lay one of the girls her finery all smeared with mud and blood she got in the way of one of the assassins as we fought shes been dying all nightmumbling your name i had not told it to her therefore i fear youre right they were sent to steal that ring from you i was duped by them elric walked rapidly to where the girl lay and he kneeled down beside her gently he touched her cheek she opened her lids and stared at him from glazed eyes her lips formed ms name why did you plan to rob me elric asked who is your master urish she said in a voice that was a breeze passing through the grass steal ring take it to nadsokor moonglum now stood on the other side of the dying girl he had found one of the wine flasks and he bent to give her a drink she tried to sip the wine but failed it ran down her little chin down her slim neck and on to her wounded breast you are one of the beggars of nadsokor moon glum said faintly she nodded urish has always been my enemy elric told him i once recovered some property from him and he has never forgiven me perhaps he sought the actorios ring in payment he looked down at the girl your companionhas she returned to nadsokor again the girl seemed to nod then all intelligence left the eyes the lids closed and she ceased to breathe elric got up he was frowning rubbing at the hand on which the ring of kings had been let him keep the ring then said moonglum hope fully he will be satisfied elric shook his head moonglum cleared his throat a caravan is leaving jadmar in a week it is commanded by rackhir of tanelorn and has been purchasing provisions for the city if we took a ship round the coast we could soon be in jadmar join rackhirs caravan and be on our way to tanelorn in good company as you know its rare for anyone of tanelorn to make such a journey we are lucky for no said elric in a low voice we must forget tanelorn for the moment moonglum the ring of kings is my link with my fathers moreit aids my conjurings and has saved our lives more than once we ride for nadsokor now i must try to reach the girl before she gets to the city of beggars failing that i must enter the city and recover my ring moonglum shuddered it would be more foolish than any plan of mine elric urish would destroy us none the less to nadsokor i must go moonglum bent and began systematically to strip the girls corpse of its jewellery well need every penny we can raise if were to buy decent horses for our journey he explained chapter three the cold ghouls framed against the scarlet sunset nadso kor looked from this distance more like a badly kept graveyard than a city towers tottered houses were halfcollapsed the walls were broken elric and moonglum came up the peak of the hill on their fast shazarian horses which had cost them all they had and saw it worsethey smelled it a thou sand stinks issued from the festering city and both men gagged turning their horses back down the hill to the valley well camp here for a short whileuntil nightfall elric said then well enter nadsokor elric i am not sure i could bear the stench what ever our disguise our disgust would reveal us for strangers elric smiled and reached into his pouch he took out two small tablets and handed one to moonglum the eastlander regarded the thing suspiciously whats this a potion i used it once before when i came to nadsokor it will kill your sense of smell completely unfortunately your sense of taste as well moonglum laughed i did not plan to eat a gourmet meal while in the city of beggars he swallowed the pill and elric did likewise almost instantly moonglum remarked that the stink of the city was subsiding later as they chewed the stale bread which was all that was left of their pro visions he said i can taste nothing the potion works elric nodded he was frowning looking up the hill in the direction of the city as the night fell moonglum took out his swords and began to hone them with the small stone he carried for the purpose as he honed he watched elrics face trying to see if he could guess elrics thoughts at last the albino spoke well need to leave the horses here of course for most beggars disdain their use they are proud in their perversity moonglum murmured aye well need those rags we brought our swords will be noticed not if we wear the loose robes over all it will mean well walk stifflegged but thats not so strange in a beggar reluctantly moonglum got the bundles of rags from the saddlepanniers so it was that a filthy pair one stooped and limping one short but with a twisted arm crept through the debris which was ankle deep around the whole city of nadsokor they made for one of the many gaps in the wall nadsokor had been abandoned some centuries be fore by a people fleeing from the ravages of a particu larly virulent pox which had struck down most of their number not long afterwards the first of the beggars had occupied it nothing had been done to preserve the citys defences and now the muck around the pe rimeters was as effective a protection as any wall no one saw the two figures as they climbed over the messy rubble and entered the dark festering streets of the city of beggars huge rats raised themselves on their hind legs and watched them as they made their way to what had once been nadsokors senate build ing and which was now urishs palace scrawny dogs with garbage dangling in their jaws warily slunk back into the shadows once a little column of blind men each man with his right hand on the shoulder of the man in front tapped their way through the night pass ing directly across the street elric and moonglum were in from some of the tumbledown buildings came cacklings and titterings as the maimed caroused with the crippled and the degenerate and corrupted coupled with their crones as the disguised pair neared what had been nadsokors forum there came a scream from one shattered doorway and a young girl barely over puberty dashed out pursued by a monstrously fat beg gar who propelled himself with astounding speed on his crutches the livid stumps of his legs which termi nated at the knee making the motions of running moonglum tensed but elric held him back as the fat cripple bore down his prey abandoned his crutches which rattled on the broken pavement and flung him self on the child moonglum tried to free himself from elrics grasp but the albino whispered let it happen those who are whole either in mind body or spirit cannot be tolerated in nadsokor there were tears in moonglums eyes as he looked at his friend your cynicism is as disgusting as any thing they do i do not doubt it but we are here for one purpose to recover the stolen ring of kings that and nought else is what we shall do what matters that when but elric was continuing on his way to the forum and after hesitating for a moment moonglum followed him now they stood on the far side of the square looking at urishs palace some of its columns had fallen but on this building alone had there been some attempt at restoration and decoration the archway of the main entrance was painted with crude representations of the arts of begging and extortion an example of the coinage of all the nations of the young kingdoms had been imbedded in the wooden door and above it had been nailed perhaps ironically a pair of wooden crutches crossed as swords might be crossed indicat ing that the weapons of the beggar were his power to horrify and disgust those luckier or better endowed than himself elric stared through the murk at the building and he had a calculating frown on his face there are no guards he said to moonglum why should there be what have they to guard there were guards last time i came to nadsokor urish protects his hoard most assiduously it is not outsiders he fears but his own despicable rabble perhaps he no longer fears them elric smiled a creature like king urish fears every thing we had best be wary when we enter the hall have your swords ready to draw at any hint that we have been lured into a trap surely urish would not suspect wed know where the girl came from aye it seemed good chance that one of them told us but none the less we must make allowances for urishs cunning he would not willingly bring you herenot with the black sword at your side perhaps they began to walk across the forum it was very still very dark from far away came the occasional shout a laugh or an obscene indefinable sound now they were at the door standing beneath the crossed crutches elric felt beneath his ragged robes for the hilt of his sword and with his left hand pushed at the door it squeaked open a fraction they looked about them to see if anyone had heard the sound but the square was as still as it had been more pressure another squeak and now they could squeeze their bodies through the aperture they stood in urishs hall braziers of garbage gave off faint light oily smoke curled towards the rafters they saw the dim outlines of the dais at the far end and on the dais stood urishs huge crude throne the hall seemed deserted but elrics hand did not leave the hilt of the black sword he stopped as he heard a sound but it was a great black rat scuttling across the floor silence again elric moved forward step by cautious step along the length of the slimy hall moonglum behind him elrics spirits began to rise as they neared the throne perhaps urish had after all grown complacent of his strength he would open the trunk beneath the throne remove his ring and then they would leave the city and be away before dawn riding across country to join the caravan of rackhir the red archer on its way to tanelorn he began to relax but his step was just as cautious moonglum had paused cocking his head to one side as if hearing something elric turned what is it you hear possibly nothing or maybe one of those great rats we saw earlier it is just that a silverblue radiance burst out from behind the grotesque throne and elric flung up his left hand to protect his eyes trying to disentangle his sword from his rags moonglum yelled and began to run for the door but even when elric put his back to the light he could not see stormbringer moaned in its scabbard as if in rage elric tugged at it but felt his limbs grow weaker and weaker from behind him came a laugh which he rec ognised a second laughalmost a throaty cough joined it his sight came back but now he was held by clammy hands and when he saw his captors he shuddered shadowy creatures of limbo held himghouls sum moned by sorcery their dead faces smiled but their dead eyes remained dead elric felt the heat and the strength leaving his body and it was as if the ghouls sucked it from him he could almost feel his vitality travelling from his own body to theirs again the laugh he looked up at the throne and saw emerging from behind it the tall saturnine figure of theleb kaarna whom he had left for dead near the castle of kaneloon a few months since theleb kaarna smiled in his curling beard as elric struggled in the grasp of the ghouls now from the other side of the throne came the filthy carcass of urish the sevenfingered the cleaver hackmeat cra dled in his left arm elric could barely hold his head up as the ghouls cold flesh absorbed his strength but he smiled at his own foolishness he had been right in suspecting a trap but wrong in entering it so poorly prepared and where was moonglum had he deserted him the little eastlander was nowhere to be seen urish swaggered round the throne and sprawled his begrimed person in it placing hackmeat so that it lay across the arms his pale beady eyes stared hard at elric theleb kaarna remained standing by the side of the throne but triumph flamed in his eyes like imrryrs own funeral fires welcome back to nadsokor wheezed urish scratching himself between the legs you have returned to make amends i take it elric shivered as the cold in his bones increased stormbringer stirred at his side but it could only help him if he drew it with his own hands he knew he was dying i have come to regain my property he said through chattering teeth my ring ah the ring of kings it was yours was it my girl mentioned something of that you sent her to steal it urish sniggered ill not deny it but i did not ex pect the white wolf of imrryr to step so easily into my trap he would have stepped out again if you had not that amateur magicmakers spells to help you theleb kaarna glowered but then his face relaxed are you not discomforted then by my ghouls elric was gasping as the last of the heat fled his bones he now could not stand but hung in the hands of the dead creatures theleb kaarna must have planned this for weeks for it took many spells and pacts with the guardians of limbo to bring such ghouls to earth and so i die elric murmured well i suppose i do not care urish raised his ruined features in what was a parody of pride you do not die yet elric of melni bone the sentence has yet to be passed the formalities must be suffered by my cleaver hackmeat i must sen tence you for your crimes against nadsokor and against the sacred hoard of king urish elric hardly heard him as his legs collapsed alto gether and the ghouls tightened their grip on him dimly he was aware of the beggar rabble shuffling into the hall doubtless they had all been waiting for this had moonglum died at their hands when he fled the hall put his head up theleb kaarna instructed his dead servants let him see urish king of all beggars make his just decree elric felt a cold hand beneath his chin and his head was raised so he could watch through misting eyes as urish stood up and grasped the cleaver hackmeat in his fourfingered hand stretching it towards the smoky ceiling elric of melnibone thou art convicted of many crimes against the ignoblest of the ignoblemyself king urish of nadsokor thou has offended king urishs friend that most pleasingly degenerate villain theleb kaarna at this theleb kaarna pursed his lips but did not interrupt and moreover did come a second time to the city of beggars to repeat your crimes by my great cleaver hackmeat the symbol of my dignity and power i condemnest thou to the punishment of the burning god from all sides of the hall came the foul applause of the beggar court elric remembered a legend of nadsokorthat when the original population were first struck by the disease they summoned aid from chaos begging chaos to cleanse the disease from the city with fire if necessary chaos had played a joke upon these folksent the burning god who had burned what was left of their possessions a further summons to law to help them had resulted in the burning gods being imprisoned by lord donblas in the city having had enough of the lords of the higher worlds the remnants of the citizens had abandoned their city but was the burning god still here in nadsokor faintly he still heard urishs voice take him to the labyrinth and give him to the burning god theleb kaarna spoke but elric did not hear what he said though he heard urishs reply his sword how will that avail him against a lord of chaos besides if the sword is released from the scabbard who knows what will happen theleb kaarna was evidently reluctant by his tone but at last agreed with urish now theleb kaarnas voice boomed commandingly things of limborelease him his vitality has been your reward nowbegone elric fell to the muck on the flagstones but was now too weak to move as beggars came forward and lifted him up his eyes closed and his senses deserted him as he felt himself borne from the hall and heard the united voices of the wizard of pan tang and the king of the beggars giving vent to their mocking triumph chapter four punishment of the burning god by narjhans droppings hes cold elric heard the rasping voice of one of the beggars who carried him he was still weak but some of the beggars body heat had transferred itself to him and the chill of his bones was now by no means as intense heres the portal elric forced his eyes open he was upside down but could see ahead of him through the gloom something shimmered there it looked like the iridescent skin of some unearthly animal stretched across the arch of the tunnel he was jerked backwards as the beggars swung his body and hurled it towards the shimmering skin he struck it it was viscous it clung to him and he felt it was absorbing him he tried to struggle but was still far too weak he was sure that he was being killed but after long minutes he was through it and had struck stone and lay gasping in the blackness of the tunnel this must be the labyrinth of which urish had spoken trembling he tried to rise using his scabbarded sword as a support it took him some time to get up but at last he could lean against the curving wall he was surprised the stones seemed to be hot per haps it was because he was so cold and in reality the stones were of normal heat even this speculation seemed to weary him what ever the nature of the heat it was welcome he pressed his back harder against the stones as their heat passed into his body he felt a sensation almost of ecstacy and he drew a deep breath strength was returning slowly gods he murmured even the snows of the lormyrian steppe could not compare with such a great cold he drew another deep breath and coughed then he realised that the drug he had swallowed was beginning to wear off he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and spat out saliva something of the stink of nadsokor had entered his nostrils he stumbled back towards the portal the peculiar stuff still shimmered there he pressed his hand against it and it gave reluctantly but then held firm he leant his whole weight on it but it would still not give any further it was like a particularly tough membrane but it was not flesh was this the stuff with which the lords of law had sealed off the tunnel entrapping their enemy the lord of chaos the only light in the tunnel came from the membrane itself by arioch ill turn the tables on the beggar king elric murmured he threw back his rags and put his hand on stormbringers pommel the blade purred as a cat might purr he drew the sword from its scabbard and it began to sing a low satisfied song now elric hissed as its power flowed up his arm and into his body stormbringer was giving him the strength he needed but he knew that stormbringer must be paid soon must taste blood and souls and thus replenish its energy he aimed a great blow at the shimmering wall ill hack down this portal and release the burning god upon nadsokor strike true stormbringer let flame come to devour the filth that is this city but stormbringer howled as it bit into the membrane and it was held fast no rent appeared in the stuff in stead elric had to tug with all his might to get the sword free he withdrew panting the portal was made to withstand the efforts of chaos elric murmured my swords useless against it and so unable to go back i must perforce go for ward stormbringer in hand he turned and began to make his way along the passage he took one turn and then another and then a third and the light had disap peared completely he reached for his pouch where his flint and tinder were kept but the beggars had cut that from his belt as they carried him he decided to retrace his steps but by now he was deeply within the laby rinth and he could not find the portal no portalbut no god it seems mayhap theres another exit from this place if its blocked by a door of wood then stormbringer will soon carve me a path to freedom and so he pressed further into the labyrinth taking a hundred twists and turns in the darkness before he paused again he had noticed that he was growing warmer now instead of feeling horribly cold he felt uncomfortably hot he was sweating he removed some of the upper layers of his rags and stood in his own shirt and breeks he had begun to thirst another turning and he saw light ahead well stormbringer perhaps we are free after all he began to run towards the source of the light but it was not daylight neither was it the light from the portal this was firelightof brands perhaps he could see the sides of the tunnel quite clearly in the firelight unlike the masonry in the rest of nadsokor this was free of filtha plain grey stone stained by the red light the source of the light was around the next bend but the heat had grown greater and his flesh stung as the sweat sprang from his pores aah a great voice suddenly filled the tunnel as elric rounded the bend and saw the fire leaping not thirty yards distant aah at last the voice came from the fire and elric knew he had found the burning god i have no quarrel with you my lord of chaos he called i too serve chaos but i must eat came the voice checkalakh must eat i am poor food for one such as you elric said reasonably putting both his hands around stormbring ers hilt and taking a step backward aye beggar that thou artbut thou art the only food they send im no beggar beggar or not checkalakh will devour thee the flames shook and a shape began to be made of them it was a human shape but comprised entirely of flame flickering hands of fire stretched out towards elric and elric turned and elric ran and checkalakh the burning god came fast as a flash fire behind him elric felt pain in his shoulder and he smelled burn ing cloth he increased his speed having no notion of where he ran and still the burning god pursued him stop mortal it is futile thou canst not escape checkalakh of chaos elric shouted back in desperate humour ill be no ones roast pork his step began to falter notnot even a gods like the roar of flames up a chimney checkalakh replied do not defy me mortal it is an honour to feed a god both the heat and the effort of running were exhaust ing elric a plan of sorts had formed in his brain when he had first encountered the burning god that was why he had started to run but now as checkalakh came on he was forced to turn thou art somewhat feeble for so mighty a lord of chaos he panted readying his sword my long sojourn here has weakened me check alakh replied else i would have caught thee ere now but catch thee i will and devour thee i must stormbringer whined its defiance at the enfeebled chaos god and blade struck out at flaming head and gashed the gods right cheek so that paler fire flickered there and something ran up the black blade and into elrics heart so that he trembled in a mixture of terror and joy as some of the burning gods lifeforce entered him eyes of flame stared at the black sword and then at elric brows of flame furrowed and checkalakh halted thou art no ordinary beggar tis true i am elric of melnibone and i bear the black sword lord arioch is my mastera more powerful entity than you lord checkalakh something akin to misery passed across the gods fiery countenance ayethere are many more power ful than me elric of melnibone elric wiped sweat from his face he drew in great gulps of burning air then whywhy not combine your strength with mine together we can tear down the portal and take vengeance on those who have con spired to bring us together checkalakh shook his head and little tongues of fire fell from it the portal will only open when i am dead so it was decreed when lord donblas of law impris oned me here even if we were successful in destroying the portalit would result in my death therefore most powerful of mortals i must fight thee and eat thee and again elric began to run desperately seeking the portal knowing that the only light he could hope to find in the labyrinth came from the burning god himself even if he were to defeat the god he would still be trapped in the complex maze and then he saw it he was back at the place where he had been thrown through the membrane it is only possible to enter my prison through the portal not leave it called checkalakh im aware of that elric took a firmer grip on stormbringer and turned to face the thing of flame even as his sword swung back and forth parrying every attempt of the burning gods to seize him elric felt sympathy for the creature he had come in answer to the summonings of mortals and he had been im prisoned for his pains but elrics clothes had begun to smoulder now and even though stormbringer supplied him with energy every time it struck checkalakh the heat itself was beginning to overwhelm him he sweated no more in stead his skin felt dry and about to split blisters were forming on his white hands soon he would be able to hold the blade no longer arioch he breathed though this creature be a fellow lord of chaos aid me to defeat him but arioch lent him no extra strength he had al ready learned from his patron demon that greater things were being planned on and above the earth and that arioch had little time for even the most favourite of his mortal charges yet from habit still elric murmured ariochs name as he swept the sword so that it struck first checkalakhs burning hands and then his burning shoulder and more of the gods energy entered him it seemed to elric that even stormbringer was be ginning to burn and the pain in his blistered hands grew so great that it was at last the only sensation of which he was aware he staggered back against the iridescent membrane and felt its fleshlike texture on his back the ends of his long hair were beginning to smoke and large areas of his clothes had completely charred was checkalakh failing though the flames burned less brightly and there was an expression of resignation beginning to form on the face of fire elric drew on his pain as his only source of strength and he made the pain take the sword and bring it back over his head and he made the pain bring stormbringer down in a massive blow aimed at the gods head and even as the blow descended the fire began to die then stormbringer had struck and elric yelled as an enormous wave of energy poured into his body and knocked him backwards so that the sword fell from his hand and he felt that his flesh could not contain what it now held he rolled moaning on the floor and he kicked at the air raising his twisted blistered hands to the roof as if in supplication to some being who had the power to stop what was happening to him there were no tears in his eyes for it seemed that even his blood had begun to boil out of him arioch save me he was shuddering screaming arioch stop this thing happening to me he was full of the energy of a god and the mortal frame was not meant to contain so much force aaaah take it from me he became aware of a calm beautiful face looking down upon him as he writhed he saw a tall man much taller than himselfand he knew that this was no mortal at all but a god it is over said a pure sweet voice and though the creature did not move soft hands seemed to caress him and the pain began to diminish and the voice continued to speak long centuries ago i lord donblas the justice maker came to nadsokor to free it from the grip of chaos but i came too late evil brought more evil as evil will and i could not interfere too much with the affairs of mortals for we of law have sworn to let mankind make its own destiny if that is possible yet the cosmic balance swings now like the pendulum of a clock with a broken spring and terrible forces are at work on the earth thou elric art a servant of chaos yet thou hast served law more than once it has been said that the destiny of mankind rests within thee and that may be true thus i aid theethough i do so against mine own oath and elric closed his eyes and felt at peace for the first time that he remembered the pain had gone but great energy still filled him when he opened his eyes again there was no beautiful face looking down on him and the scintillating mem brane which had covered the archway had disappeared nearby stormbringer lay and he sprang up and seized the sword returning it to his scabbard he noticed that the blisters had left his hands and that even his clothes were no longer charred had he dreamed it allor most of it he shook his head he was free he was strong he had his sword with him now he would return to the hall of king urish and take his vengeance both on nadsokors ruler and theleb kaarna he heard a footfall and withdrew into the shadows light filtered into the tunnel from gaps in the roof and it was plain that at this point it was close to the surface a figure appeared and he recognised it at once moonglum the little eastlander grinned in relief and sheathed his swords i came here to aid you if i could but i see you need no aid from me not here the burning god is no more ill tell you of that later what became of you when i realised we were in a trap i ran for the door deciding it would be best if one of us were free and i knew it was you they wanted but then i saw the door opening and realised they had been waiting there all along moonglum wrinkled his nose and dusted at the rags he still wore thus i came to find myself lying at the bottom of one of those heaps of garbage littered about urishs hall i dived into it and stayed there listening to what passed as soon as i could i found this tunnel planning to help you however i could and where are urish and theleb kaarna now it appears that they go to make good theleb kaarnas bargain with urish urish was not altogether happy with the plan to lure you here for he fears your power he has reason to now aye well it seems that urish had heard what we had heard that the caravan for tanelorn was on its way back to that city urish has knowledge of tanelorn though not much i gatherand fosters an unreason ing hatred for the place perhaps because it is the opposite of what nadsokor is they plan to attack rackhirs caravan ayeand theleb kaarna is to summon creatures from hell to ensure that their attack is successful rackhir has no sorcery to speak of i believe he served chaos once but no morethose who dwell in tanelorn can have no supernatural masters i gathered as much from the conversation when do they make this attack they have gone alreadyalmost as soon as they had dealt with you urish is impatient it is unlike the beggars to make a direct attack on a caravan they do not always have a powerful wizard for an ally true elric frowned my own powers of sorcery are limited without the ring of kings upon my hand its supernatural qualities identify me as a true member of the royal line of melnibonethe line which made so many bargains with the elementals first i must recover my ring and then we go at once to aid rackhir moonglum glanced at the floor they said some thing of protecting urishs hoard in his absence there may be a few armed men in the hall elric smiled now that we are prepared and now i have the strength of the burning god in me i think we shall be able to deal with a whole army moonglum moonglum brightened then ill lead the way back to the hall come this passage will take us to a door which is let into the side of the hall near the throne they began to run along the passage until they came at length to the door moonglum had mentioned elric did not pause but drew his sword and flung the door open it was only when he was in the hall that he stopped daylight now lit the gloomy place but it was again deserted no swordbearing beggars awaited them instead there sat in urishs throne a fat scaly thing of yellow and green and black brown bile dripped from its grinning snout and it raised one of its many paws in a mockery of a salute greetings it hissed and bewarefor i am the guardian of urishs treasure a thing of hell elric said a demon raised by theleb kaarna he has been brewing his spells for a long time methinks if he can command so many foul servants he frowned and weighed stormbringer in his hand but oddly the blade did not seem to hunger for battle i warn thee hissed the demon i cannot be slain by a swordnot even that sword it is my wardpact what is that whispered moonglum eying the demon warily he is of a race of demons used by all with sorcerous power he is a guardian he will not attack unless himself attacked he is virtually invulnerable to mortal weapons and in his case he has a ward against swords be they supernatural or no if we attempted to slay him with our swords we should be struck down by all the powers of hell we could not possibly survive but you have just destroyed a god a demon is nothing compared with that a weak god elric reminded him and this is a strong demonfor he is a representative of all demons who would mass with him to preserve his wardpact is there no chance of defeating him if we are to help rackhir there is no reason for trying we must get to our horses and try to warn the caravan later perhaps we can return and think of some sorcery which will aid us against the demon elric bowed sardonically to the demon and returned his salute farewell unlovely one may your master not return to release you and thus ensure you squat in this filth forever the demon slobbered in rage my master is theleb kaarnaone of the most powerful sorcerers amongst your kind elric shook his head not my kind i shall be slay ing him soon and you will be left there until i discover the means of destroying you somewhat pettishly the demon folded its multitude of arms and closed its eyes elric and moonglum strode through the muck strewn hall towards the door they were close to vomiting by the time they reached the steps leading into the forum the rest of elrics potions had been taken when his purse was taken and they had no protection now against the stink moonglum spat on the steps as they descended into the square and then he looked up and drew his two swords in a crossarm motion elric some dozen beggars were rushing at them bearing an array of clubs axes and knives elric laughed heres a titbit for you stormbringer he drew his sword and began to swing the howling blade around his head moving implacably towards the beggars almost immediately two of their number broke and ran but the rest came in a rush at the pair elric brought the sword lower and took a head from its shoulders and had bitten deep into the next mans shoulder before the firsts blood had begun to spout moonglum darted in with his two slim swords and engaged two of the beggars at the same time elric stabbed at another and the man screamed and danced clutching at the blade which remorselessly drew out his soul and his life stormbringer was singing a sardonic song now and three of the surviving beggars dropped their weapons and were off across the square as moonglum neatly took both his opponents simultaneously in their hearts and elric hacked down the rest of the rabble as they shouted and groaned for mercy elric sheathed stormbringer looked down at the crimson ruin he had caused wiped his lips as a man might who had just enjoyed a fine meal caused moon glum to shudder and clapped his friend on the shoul der comelets to rackhirs aid as moonglum followed the albino he reflected that elric had absorbed more than just the burning gods life force in the encounter in the labyrinth much of the callousness of the lords of chaos was in him today today elric seemed a true warrior of ancient melnibone chapter five things which are not women the beggars had been too absorbed in their triumph over the albino and their plans for their attack on the caravan of tanelorn to think to seek the mounts on which elric and moonglum had come to nadsokor they found the horses where they had left them the previous night the superb shazarian steeds were cropping the grass as if they had been waiting only a few minutes they climbed into their saddles and soon were riding as fast as the fleet horses could carry themnorth northeast to the point the caravan was logically due to reach shortly after noon they had found ita long sprawl of waggons and horses awnings of gay rich silks brightly decorated harness it stretched across the floor of a shallow valley and surrounding it on all sides was the squalid and motley beggar army of king urish of nadsokor elric and moonglum reined in their horses when they reached the brow of the hill and they watched theleb kaarna and king urish were not immedi ately visible and at last elric saw them on the opposite hill by the way in which the sorcerer was stretching out his arms to the deep blue sky elric guessed he was already summoning the aid he had promised urish below elric saw a flash of red and knew that it must be the scarlet garb of the red archer peering closer he saw one or two other shapes he recognisedbrut of lashmar with his blond hair and his huge burly body almost dwarfing his warhorse carkan once of pan tang himself but now dressed in the chequered cloak and fur cap of the barbarians of southern ilmiora rackhir himself had been a warrior priest from moonglums country beyond the weeping waste but all these men had foresworn their gods to go to live in peaceful tanelorn where it was said even the greatest lords of the higher worlds could not enter eternal tanelorn which had stood for uncountable cycles and would outlive the earth herself knowing nothing of theleb kaarnas plan rackhir was plainly not too worried by the appearance of the beggar rabble which was as poorly armed as those elric and moonglum had fought in nadsokor we must ride through their army to reach rackhir now moonglum said elric nodded but he made no move he was watching the distant hill where theleb kaarna continued his incantation hoping that he might guess what kind of aid the sorcerer was summoning a moment later elric yelled and spurred his horse down the hill at a gallop moonglum was almost as startled as the beggars as he followed his friend into the thick of the ragged horde slashing this way and that with the longest of his swords elrics stormbringer emitted black radiance as it carved a bloody path through the beggar army leaving in its wake a mess of dismembered bodies entrails and dead horrified eyes moonglums horse was splashed with blood to the shoulder and it snorted and balked at following the whiteskinned demon with the howling black blade but moonglum afraid that the beggar ranks would close forced it on until at last they were both riding towards the caravan and someone was yelling elrics name it was rackhir the red archer clothed in scarlet from head to foot with a red bone bow in his hand and a red quiver of crimsonfletched arrows on his back on his head was a scarlet skull cap decorated with a single scarlet feather his face was weather beaten and all but fleshless he had fought with elric before the fall of imrryr and together they had dis covered the black swords rackhir had gone on to seek tanelorn and find it at last elric had not seen rackhir since then now he noted an enviable look of peace in the archers eyes rackhir had once been a warrior priest in the eastlands serv ing chaos but now he served nothing but his tranquil tanelorn elric have you come to help us send urish and his beggars back to where they came from rackhir was laughing evidently pleased to see his old friend and moonglum when did you two meet i have not seen thee since i left the eastlands moonglum grinned much has come to pass since those days rackhir rackhir rubbed at his aquiline nose ayeso ive heard elric dismounted swiftly no time for reminiscence now rackhir youre in greater danger than you know what when did the beggar rabble of nadsokor offer anything to fear look how poorly armed they are they have a sorcerer with themtheleb kaarna of pan tang seethats him on yonder hill rackhir frowned sorcery these days ive little guard against that how good is the sorcerer do you know he is one of the most powerful in pan tang and the wizards of pan tang almost equal your folk elric in their skills i fear he more than equals me at present for my actorios ring has been stolen from me by urish rackhir looked strangely at elric noting something in the albinos face which he had evidently not seen there when they last parted well he said we shall have to defend ourselves as best we can if you cut loose your horses so that all your folk could be mounted we might be able to escape before theleb kaarna invokes whatever supernatural aid it is he seeks elric nodded as the giant brut of lashmar rode up grinning at him brut had been a hero in lash mar before he had disgraced himself rackhir shook his head tanelorn needs the pro visions we carry look said moonglum quietly on the hill where theleb kaarna had been standing there had now appeared a billowing cloud of redness like blood in clear water he is successful rackhir murmured brut let all be mounted weve no time to prepare further de fences but well have the advantage of being on horse back when they attack brut thundered off yelling at the men of tanelorn they began to unharness the wagon horses and ready their weapons the cloud of redness above was beginning to disperse and out of it shapes were emerging elric tried to dis tinguish the shapes but could not at that distance he climbed back into his saddle as the horsemen of tane lorn now formed themselves into groups which would when the attack came race through the unmounted beggars striking swiftly and passing on rackhir waved to elric and went to join one of these divisions elric and moonglum found themselves at the head of a dozen warriors armed with axes pikes and lances then urishs voice cawed out over the waiting silence attack my beggars they are doomed the beggar rabble began to move down the sides of the valley rackhir raised his sword as the signal to his men then the first groups of cavalry rode out from the caravan straight at the advancing beggars rackhir replaced his blade and took up his bow from where he sat on his horse he began to send arrow after arrow into the beggar ranks there was shouting everywhere now as the warriors of tanelorn met their foes driving wedges everywhere in their mass elric saw carkans chequered cape in the midst of a sea of rags filthy limbs clubs and knives he saw bruts great blond head towering over a cluster of human filth and moonglum said such creatures as these are unfit opponents for the warriors of tanelorn elric pointed grimly up the hill perhaps theyll prefer their new foes moonglum gasped they are women elric drew stormbringer from its scabbard they are not women they are elenoin they come from the eighth planeand neither are they human you will see you recognize them my ancestors fought them once a strange shrill ululation reached their ears now it came from the hillside where theleb kaarnas figure could again be seen it came from the shapes which moonglum was sure were women redhaired women whose tresses fell almost to their knees and covered their otherwise completely naked bodies they danced down the hill towards the besieged caravan and they whirled swords about their heads which must have been over five feet long theleb kaarna is clever elric muttered the warriors of tanelorn will hesitate before striking at women and while they hesitate the elenoin will rip and slash and slay them rackhir had already seen the elenoin and he too recognised them for what they were do not be de ceived men he called these creatures are demons he glanced across at elric and there was a look of resignation on his face he knew the power of the elenoin he spurred his horse towards the albino what can we do elric elric sighed what can mortals do against the elenoin have you no sorcery with the ring of kings i could summon the grahluk perhaps they are the ancient enemies of the elenoin theleb kaarna has already made a gateway from the eighth plane could you not try to call the grahluk rackhir begged while i tried my sword would not be aiding you i think stormbringer is more use today than spells rackhir shuddered and turned his horse away to order his men to reform their ranks he knew now that they were all to die and now the beggars fell back as horrified by the elenoin as were the men of tanelorn still singing their shrill chill song the elenoin low ered their swords and spread out along the hill each one smiling at them how can they then moonglum saw their eyes they were huge orange animal eyes oh by the gods and then he saw their teethlong pointed teeth which glinted like metal the horsemen of tanelorn fell back to the waggons in a long ragged line horror despair uncertainty was on every face save elricsand on his face was a look of grim anger his crimson eyes smouldered as he held stormbringer across his saddle pommel and regarded the demon women the elenoin the singing grew louder until it made their ears fill with sharp pain and made their stomachs turn the elenoin raised their slender arms and began to whirl their long swords about their heads again staring at them all the while through beastlike insensate eyes malicious unblinking eyes then carkan of pan tang his fur cap askew his chequered cloak billowing gave a strangled yell and urged his heavy horse at them his own sword waving back demons back spawn of hell aaaaaaaah gasped the elenoin in anticipation eeeeeeeh they sang and carkan was suddenly in the midst of a dozen slender slashing swords and he and his horse were cut all to tiny morsels of flesh which lay in a heap at the feet of the elenoin and their laughter filled the valley as some of them bent to pop the flesh into their fanged mouths a groan of horror and hatred went up from the ranks of tanelorn then and screaming men hysterical with fear and disgust began to fling themselves at the elenoin who laughed the more and whirled their sharp swords stormbringer murmured as it seemed to hear the sounds of battle but elric did not move as he stared at the scene he knew that the elenoin would kill all as they had killed carkan moonglum moaned elricthere must be some sorcery against them there is but i cannot summon the grahluk elrics chest was heaving and his brain was in turmoil i cannot moonglum for the sake of tanelorn you must try then elric was riding forward stormbringer howl ing riding at the elenoin and screaming ariochs name as his ancestors had screamed it since the founding of imrryr arioch arioch blood and souls for my lord arioch he parried the whirling blade of an elenoin and glared into the bestial eyes as stormbringer sent a shud der down his arm he struck and his own blow was parried by the demon that was not a woman red hair swung and curled around his throat he hacked at it and it loosened its grip he thrust at the naked body and the elenoin danced aside another whistling blow from the slim sword and he flung himself backwards to avoid it toppling from his saddle and springing in stantly to his feet to parry a second attack gripped stormbringer in both hands and stepped forward under the blade to plunge the black sword into the smooth belly the elenoin shouted with anger and green foul ness billowed from the wound the elenoin fell still glaring and snarling still living elric chopped at the neck and the head sprang off its hair thrashing at him he dashed forward picked up the head and began to run up the hill to where the beggars were gathered watching the destruction of tanelorns warriors as he approached the beggars broke and began to run but he caught one in the back with his blade the man fell tried to crawl on but his twisted knees would not sup port him and he collapsed into the stained grass elric picked the wretch up and flung him over his shoulder then he turned and began to run down the hill back to the camp the warriors of tanelorn were fighting well but half their number had already been slain by the elenoin almost unbelievably there were also sev eral elenoin corpses on the field elric saw moonglum defending himself with both swords he saw rackhir still mounted shouting orders to his men he saw brut of lashmar in the thick of the fight but he ran on until he stood behind one of the waggons and had dropped both his bloody bundles to the ground with his sword he split open the twitching body of the beggar and he gathered up the hair of the elenoin and soaked it in the mans blood again he stood upright looking towards the west with the bloody hair in one hand and stormbringer in the other he raised both sword and head and began to speak in the ancient high speech of melnibone held to the west and soaked in the blood of an enemy the hair of an elenoin must be used to summon the enemies of the elenointhe grahluk he remem bered the words he had read in his fathers ancient grimoire and now the invocation grahluk come and grahluk slay come kill thine ancient enemy make this thy victory day all the strength of the burning god was leaving him as he used the energy to perform the invocation and perhaps without the ring of kings he was wasting that strength for nothing grahluk speed without delay come kill thine ancient enemy make this thy vengeance day the spell was far less complex than many he had used in the past yet it took as much from him as any spell ever had grahluk i summon thee grahluk here you may take vengeance on your foes many cycles since the elenoin were said to have driven the grahluk from their lands in the eighth plane and the grahluk sought revenge now at every opportunity all around elric the air shivered and turned brown then green then black grahluk come destroy the elenoin elrics voice was weakening grahlukthe gateway is made and now the ground trembled and strange winds blew at the bloodsoaked hair of the elenoin and the air became thick and purple and elric fell to his knees still croaking the invocation grahluk a shuffling sound a grunting noise the stink of something unnameable the grahluk had come they were apelike creatures as bestial as the elenoin they carried nets and ropes and shields once it was said both grahluk and elenoin had had intelligencehad been part of the same species which had devolved and divided they moved out of the purple mist in their scores and they stood looking at elric who was still on his knees elric pointed at where the remaining warriors of tanelorn were still fighting the elenoin there the grahluk snorted with battlegreed and shambled towards the elenoin the elenoin saw them and their shrill wailing voices changed in quality as they retreated a short distance up the hill elric forced himself to his feet and gasped rack mr withdraw your warriors the grahluk will do their work now you helped us after all rackhir yelled turning his horse his clothes were all in tatters and there were a dozen wounds on his body they watched as the grahluks nets and nooses flashed towards the screaming elenoin whose sword blows were stopped by the grahluk shields they watched as the elenoin were crushed and throttled and parts of their entrails devoured by the grunting apelike demons and when the last of the elenoin was dead the grahluk picked up the fallen swords and reversed them and fell upon them rackhir said they are killing themselves why they live only to destroy the elenoin once that is done they have nothing left for which to exist elric swayed and rackhir and moonglum caught him see moonglum laughed the beggars are run ning theleb kaarna elric muttered we must get theleb kaarna doubtless he has gone back with urish to nadso kor moonglum said i musti must retrieve the ring of kings plainly you can work your sorcery without it rackhir said can i elric looked up and showed his face to rackhir who lowered his eyes and nodded we will help you get back your ring rackhir said quietly therell be no more trouble from the beggars well ride with you to nadsokor i had hoped you would elric climbed with diffi culty into the saddle of a surviving horse and jerked at its reins turning it towards the city of beggars per haps your arrows will slay what my sword can not i do not understand you rackhir said moonglum was mounting now well tell you on the way chapter six the jesting demon through the filth of nadsokor now rode the warriors of tanelorn elric moonglum and rackhir were at the head of the company but there was no ostentatious triumph in their demeanour the riders looked neither to left nor to right and the beggars offered no threat now not daring to attack but instead cowering into the shadows a potion of rackhirs had helped elric recover some of his strength and he no longer leaned over his horses neck but sat upright as they crossed the forum came to the palace of the beggar king elric did not pause he rode his horse up the steps and into the gloomy hall theleb kaarna elric shouted his voice boomed through the hall but theleb kaarna did not reply the braziers of garbage guttered in the wind from the opened door and threw a little more light on the dais at the end theleb kaarna but it was not theleb kaarna who knelt there it was a wretched ragged figure and it sprawled before the throne and it was sobbing imploring whining at something on the throne elric walked his horse a little further into the hall and now he could see what occupied the throne squatting in the great chair of black oak was the demon which had been there earlier its arms were folded and its eyes were shut and it seemed somewhat theatrically to be ignoring the pleadings of the creature kneeling at its feet the others also mounted entered the hall now and together they rode up to the dais and stopped the kneeling figure turned its head and it was urish it gasped when it saw elric and stretched out a maimed hand for its cleaver abandoned some dis tance away elric sighed do not fear me urish im weary of bloodletting i do not want your life the demon opened its eyes prince elric you have returned it said there seemed to be an indefinable difference in its tone aye where is your master i fear he has fled nadsokor forever and left you to sit here for eternity the demon inclined its head urish put a grimy hand on elrics leg elrichelp me i must have my hoard it is everything destroy the demon and i will give you back the ring of kings elric smiled you are generous king urish tears streamed down the filth on urishs ruined face please elric i beg thee it is my intention to destroy the demon urish looked nervously about him and aught else that decision lies with the men of tanelorn whom you sought to rob and whose friends you caused to be slain in a most foul manner it was theleb kaarna not i and where is theleb kaarna now when you unleashed those ape things on our ele noin he fled the field he went towards the varkalk rivertowards troos without looking behind him elric said rackhir will you try the arrows now there was the hum of a bowstring and an arrow struck the demon in the breast it quivered there and the demon looked at it with mild interest then breathed in deeply as he breathed the arrow was drawn further into him and was eventually absorbed altogether aaah urish scuttled for his cleaver it will not work a second arrow sped from rackhirs scarlet bow and it too was absorbed as was the third urish was gibbering now waving his cleaver elric warned him he has a wardpact against swords king urish the demon rattled its scales is that thing a sword i wonder urish hesitated spittle ran down his chin and his red eyes rolled demonbegone i must have my hoard it is mine the demon watched him sardonically with a yell of terror and anguish urish flung himself at the demon the cleaver hackmeat swinging wildly its blade came down on the hellthings head there was a sound like lightning striking metal and the cleaver shivered to pieces urish stood staring at the demon in quaking anticipation casually the demon reached out four of its hands and seized him its jaws opened wider than should have been possible the bulk of the demon expanded until it was suddenly twice its original size it brought the kicking beggar king to its maw and suddenly there were only two legs waving from the mouth and then the demon gave a mighty swallow and there was nothing at all left of urish of nadsokor elric shrugged your wardpact is effective the demon smiled aye sweet elric now the tone of voice was very familiar elric looked narrowly at the demon youre no ordi nary i hope not most beloved of mortals elrics horse reared and snorted as the demons shape began to alter there was a humming sound and black smoke coiled over the throne and then another figure was sitting there its legs crossed it had the shape of a man but it was more beautiful than any mortal it was a being of intense and majestic beauty unearthly beauty arioch elric bowed his head before the lord of chaos aye elric i took the demons place while you were gone but you have refused to aid me there are larger affairs afoot as ive told you soon chaos must engage with law and such as don bias will be dismissed to limbo for eternity you knew donblas spoke to me in the labyrinth of the burning god indeed i did that was why i afforded myself the time to visit your plane i cannot have you patronised by donblas the justice maker and his humourless kind i was offended now i have shown you that my power is greater than laws arioch stared beyond elric at rackhir brut moonglum and the rest who were pro tecting their eyes from his beauty perhaps you fools of tanelorn now realise that it is better to serve chaos rackhir said grimly i serve neither chaos nor law one day you will be taught that neutrality is more dangerous than sidetaking renegade the harmoni ous voice was now almost vicious you cannot harm me rackhir said and if elric returns with us to tanelorn then he too may rid him self of your evil yoke elric is of melnibone the folk of melnibone all serve chaosand are greatly rewarded how else would you have rid this throne of theleb kaarnas demon perhaps in tanelorn elric would have no need of his ring of kings rackhir replied levelly there was a sound like rushing water the boom of thunder and ariochs form began to grow larger but as it grew it also began to fade until there was nothing left in the hall but the stench of its garbage elric dismounted and ran to the throne reaching under it he drew out dead urishs chest and hacked it open with stormbringer the sword murmured as if resenting the menial work gems gold artifacts scat tered through the muck as elric sought his ring and then at last he held it up in triumph replacing it on his finger his step was lighter as he returned to his horse moonglum had in the meantime dismounted and was scooping the best of the jewels into his pouch he winked at rackhir who smiled and now elric said i go to troos to seek theleb kaarna there i have still to take my vengeance upon him let him rot in trooss sickly forest moonglum said rackhir placed a hand on elrics shoulder if theleb kaarna hates you so he will find you again why waste your own time in the pursuit elric smiled slightly at his old friend you were ever clever in your arguments rackhir and it is true that i am wearyboth gods and demons have fallen to my blade in the little while since i came to nad sokor come rest in tanelornpeaceful tanelorn where even the greatest lords of the higher worlds cannot come without permission elric looked down at the ring on his finger yet i have sworn theleb kaarna shall perish there will be time yet to fulfil your oath elric ran his hand through his milkwhite hair and it seemed to his friends that there were tears in his crimson eyes aye he said aye tune yet and they rode away from nadsokor leaving the beg gars to brood in the stink and the foulness and regret that they had aught to do with sorcery or with elric of melnibone they rode for eternal tanelorn tanelorn which had welcomed and held all troubled wanderers who came upon it all save one doomhaunted full of guilt of sorrow of despair elric of melnibone prayed that this time tanelorn might hold even him book three three heroes with a single aim elric of all the manifestations of the champion eternal was to find tanelorn without effort and of all those manifestations he was the only one to choose to leave that city of myriad incarnations the chronicle of the black sword chapter one tanelorn eternal tanelorn had taken many forms in her endless existence but all those forms save one had been beautiful she was beautiful now with the soft sunlight on her pastel towers and her curved turrets and domes and banners flew from her spires but they were not battle banners for the warriors who had found tane lorn and had stayed there were weary of war she had been here always none knew when tane lorn had been built but some knew that she had existed before tune and would exist after the end of time and that was why she was known as eternal tanelorn she had played a significant role in the struggles of many heroes and many gods and because she existed beyond tune she was hated by the lords of chaos who had more than once sought to destroy her to the north of her lay the rolling plains of ilmiora a land where justice was known to prevail and to the south of her lay desolation which was the sighing desert endless wasteland over which hissed a constant wind if ilmiora represented law then the sighing desert certainly mirrored something of the barrenness of ultimate chaos those who dwelled in her had loyalty neither to law nor to chaos and they had chosen to have no part in the cosmic struggle which was waged continuously by the lords of the higher worlds there were no leaders and there were no followers in tanelorn and her citizens lived in harmony with each other even though many had been warriors of great reputation before they chose to stay there but one of the most admired citizens of tanelorn one who was often con sulted by the others was rackhir of the ascetic fea tures who had once been a fierce warriorpriest in phum where he had gained the name of the red archer because his skill with a bow was great and he dressed all in scarlet his skill and his dress remained the same but his urge to fight had left him since he had come to live in tanelorn close to the low west wall of the city lay a house of two storeys surrounded by a lawn in which grew all manner of wild flowers the house was of pink and yellow marble and unlike most of the other dwellings in tanelorn it had a tall pointed roof this was rackhirs house and rackhir sat outside it now sprawled on a bench of plain wood while he watched his guest pace the lawn the guest was his old friend the tormented albino prince of melnibone elric wore a simple white shirt and britches of heavy black silk he had a band of the same black silk tied around his head to keep back the mane of milkwhite hair which grew to his shoulders his crimson eyes were downcast as he paced and he did not look at rackhir at all rackhir was unwilling to intrude upon his friends reverie and yet he hated to see elric as he was now he had hoped that tanelorn would comfort the albino drive away the ghosts and the doubts inhabiting his skull but it seemed that even tanelorn could not bring elric tranquillity at last rackhir broke his silence it has been a month since you came to tanelorn my friend yet still you pace still you brood elric looked up with a slight smile ayestill i brood forgive me rackhir i am a poor guest what occupies your thoughts no particular subject it seems that i cannot lose myself in all this peace only violent action helps me drive away my melancholy i was not meant for tane lorn rackhir but violent actionor the results of itproduces further melancholy does it not it is true it is the dilemma with which i live con stantly it is a dilemma i have been in since the burning of imrryrperhaps before it is a dilemma known to all men perhaps rackhir said at least to some degree ayeto wonder what purpose there is to ones existence and what point there is to purpose even if it should be discovered tanelorn makes such problems seem meaningless to me rackhir told him i had hoped that you too would be able to dismiss them from your thoughts will you stay on in tanelorn i have no other plans i still thirst for vengeance upon theleb kaarna but i now have no idea of his whereabouts and as you or moonglum told me theleb kaarna is sure to seek me out sooner or later i remember once when you first found tanelorn you suggested that i bring cymoril here and forget melnibone i wish i had listened to you then rackhir for now i think i would know peace and cymorils dead face would not be infesting my nights you mentioned this sorceress who you said re sembled cymoril myshella she who is called empress of the dawn i first saw her in a dream and when i left her side it was i who was in a dream we served each other to achieve a common purpose i shall not see her again but if she i shall not see her again rackhir as you say once more the two friends fell silent and there was only birdsong and the splash of fountains in the air as elric continued his pacing of the garden some while later elric suddenly turned on his heel and went into the house followed by rackhirs trou bled gaze when elric came out again he was wearing the great wide belt around his waistthe belt which sup ported the black scabbard containing his runesword stormbringer over his shoulders was flung a cloak of white silk and he wore high boots i go riding he said i will go by myself into the sighing desert and i will ride until i am exhausted perhaps exercise is all i need be careful of the desert my friend rackhir cau tioned him it is a sinister and treacherous wilder ness i will be careful take the big golden mare she is used to the desert and her stamina is legendary thank you i will see you in the morning if i do not return earlier take care elric i trust your remedy is successful and your melancholy disappears rackhirs expression had little of relief in it as he watched his friend stride towards the nearby stables his white cloak billowing behind him like a sea fog suddenly risen then he heard the sound of elrics horse as its hooves struck the cobbles of the street and rackhir got to his feet to watch as the albino urged the golden mare into a canter and headed for the northern wall beyond which the great yellow waste of the sighing desert could be seen moonglum came out of the house a large apple in his hand a scroll under his arm where goes elric rackhir he looks for peace in the desert moonglum frowned and bit thoughtfully into his apple he has sought peace in all other places and i fear hell not find it there either rackhir nodded his agreement but it is my pre monition hell discover something else for elric is not always motivated by his own wishes there are times when other forces work within him to make him take some fateful action you think this is such a time it could be chapter two return of a sorceress the sand rippled as the wind blew it so that the dunes seemed like waves in an almost petri fied sea stark fangs of rock jutted here and there the remains of mountain ranges which had been eroded by the wind and a mournful sighing could just be heard as if the sand remembered when it had been rock and the stones of cities and the bones of men and beasts and longed for its resurrection sighed at the memory of its death elric drew the cloaks cowl over ms head to protect it from the fierce sun which hung in the steelblue sky one day he thought i too shall know this peace of death and perhaps then i shall also regret it he let the golden mare slow to a trot and took a sip of water from one of his canteens now the desert surrounded him and it seemed in finite nothing grew no animals lived there there were no birds in the sky for some reason he shuddered and he had a pre sentiment of a moment in the future when he would be alone as he was now in a world even more barren than this desert without even a horse for company he shook off the thought but it had left him so stunned that for a little while he achieved his ambi tion and did not brood upon his fate and his situation the wind dropped slightly and the sighing became little more than a whisper dazed elric fingered the pommel of his blade stormbringer the black swordfor he associated his presentiment with the weapon but could not tell why and it seemed to him that he heard an ironic note in the murmuring of the wind or did the sound ema nate from his sword itself he cocked his head lis tening but the sound became even less audible as if aware that he listened the golden mare began to climb the gentle slope of a dune stumbling once as her foot sank into deeper sand elric concentrated on guiding her to firmer ground reaching the top of the dune he reined his horse in the desert dunes rolled on broken only by the occasional rock he had it in mind then to ride on and on until it would be impossible to return to tanelorn until both he and his mount collapsed from exhaustion and were eventually swallowed by the sands he pushed back his cowl and wiped sweat from his brow why not he thought life was not bearable he would try death and yet would death deny him was he doomed to live it sometimes seemed so then he considered the horse it would not be fair to sacrifice it to his desire slowly he dismounted the wind grew stronger and the sound of its sigh ing increased sand blew around elrics booted feet it was a hot wind and it tugged at his voluminous white cloak the horse snorted nervously elric looked towards the north east towards the edge of the world and he began to walk the horse whinnied enquiringly at him when he did not call it but he ignored the sound and had soon left his mount behind him he had not even bothered to bring water with him he flung back his cowl so that the sun beat directly upon his head his pace was even purposeful and he marched as if at the head of an army perhaps he did sense an army behind himthe army of the dead of all those friends and enemies whom he had slain in the course of his pointless search for a meaning to his existence and still one enemy remained alive an enemy even stronger even more malevolent than theleb kaarnathe enemy of his darker self of that side of his nature which was symbolised by the sentient blade still resting at his hip and when he died then that enemy would also die a force for evil would be re moved from the world for several hours elric of melnibone tramped on through the sighing desert and gradually as he had hoped his sense of identity began to leave him so that it was almost as if he became one with the wind and the sand and in so doing was united at last with the world which had rejected him and which he had re jected evening came but he hardly noticed the suns set ting night fell but he continued to march unaware of the cold already he was weakening he rejoiced in the weakness where previously he had fought to retain the strength he enjoyed only through the power of the black sword and sometime around midnight beneath a pale moon his legs buckled and he fell sprawling in the sand and lay there while the remains of his sensibili ties left him prince elric my lord the voice was rich vibrant almost amused it was a womans voice and elric recognised it he did not move elric of melnibone he felt a hand on his arm she was trying to pull him upright rather than be dragged he raised him self with some difficulty to a sitting position he tried to speak but at first no words would come from his mouth which was dry and full of sand she stood there as the dawn rose behind her and brightened her long black hair framing her beautiful features she was dressed in a flowing gown of blue green and gold and she was smiling as he cleared the sand from his mouth he shook ms head saying at last if i am dead then i am still plagued by phantoms and illusions i am no more illusion than anything else in this world you are not dead my lord you are in that case many leagues from castle kaneloon my lady you have come from the other side of the worldfrom edge to edge i have been seeking you elric then you have broken your word myshella for when we parted you said that you would not see me again that our fates had ceased to be twined i thought then that theleb kaarna was dead that our mutual enemy had perished in the noose of flesh the sorceress spread her arms wide and it was almost as if the gesture summoned the sun for it appeared over the horizon suddenly why did you walk thus in the desert my lord i sought death yet you know it is not your destiny to die in such a way i have been told as much but i do not know it lady myshella however he stumbled upright and stood swaying before her i am beginning to suspect that it is so she came forward bringing a goblet from beneath her robes it was full to the brim with a cool silvery liquid drink she said he did not lift his hands towards the cup i am not pleased to see you lady myshella why because you are afraid to love me if it flatters you to think thataye it does not flatter me i know you are reminded of cymoril and that i made the mistake of letting kaneloon become that which you most desirebe fore i understood that it is also what you most fear he lowered his head be silent i am sorry i apologised then we drove away the desire and terror together for a little while did we not he looked up and she was staring intently into his eyes did we not we did he took a deep breath and stretched out his hands for the goblet is this some potion to sap my will and make me work for your interests no potion could do that it will revive you that is all he sipped the liquid and immediately his mouth was clean and his head clear he drained the goblet and he felt a glow of strength in all his limbs and vitals do you still wish to die she asked as she re ceived back the cup replacing it beneath her robes if death will bring me peace it will notnot if you die now that i know how did you find me here oh by a variety of means some of them sorcer ous but my bird brought me to you she extended her right arm to point behind him he turned and there was the bird of gold and silver and brass which he himself had once ridden while in myshellas service its great metallic wings were folded but there was intelligence in its emerald eyes as it waited for its mistress have you come then to return me to tanelorn she shook her head not yet i have come to tell you where you may discover our enemy theleb kaarna he smiled he threatens you again not directly elric shook sand from his cloak i know you well myshella you would not interfere in my destiny un less it had again become in some way linked with your own you have said that i am afraid to love you that may be true for i think i am afraid to love any woman but you make use of lovethe men to whom you give your love are men who will serve your purpose i do not deny that i love only heroesand only heroes who work to ensure the presence of the power of law upon this plane of our earth i care not whether law or chaos gains predomi nance even my hatred of theleb kaarna has waned and that was a personal hatred nothing to do with any cause what ft you knew theleb kaarna once again threatens the folk of tanelorn impossible tanelorn is eternal tanelorn is eternalbut its citizens are not i know more than once has some catastrophe fallen upon those who dwell in tanelorn and the lords of chaos hate tanelorn though they cannot attack it directly they would aid any mortal who thought he could destroy those whom the chaos lords regard as traitors elric frowned he knew of the enmity of the lords of chaos to tanelorn he had heard that on more than one occasion they had made use of mortals to attack the city and you say theleb kaarna plans to destroy tanelorns citizens with chaos aid aye your thwarting of his schemes concerning nadsokor and rackhirs caravan made him extend his hatred to all dwelling in tanelorn in troos he discovered some ancient grimoiresthings which survived from the age of the doomed folk how can that be they existed a whole time cycle before melnibone truebut troos itself has lasted since the age of the doomed folk and these were people who had many great inventions a means of preserving their wisdom very well i will accept that theleb kaarna found their grimoires what did those grimoires tell him they showed him the means of causing a rupture in the division which separates one plane of earth from another this knowledge of the other planes is largely mysterious to useven your ancestors only guessed at the variety of existences obtaining in what the ancients termed the multiverseand i know only a little more than do you the lords of the higher worlds can at times move freely between these temporal and spatial layers but mortals can notat least not in this period of our being and what has theleb kaarna done surely great power would be needed to cause this rupture you describe he does not have that power true but he has powerful allies in the chaos lords the lords of entropy have leagued them selves with him as they would league themselves with anyone who was willing to be the means of destruc tion of those who dwell in tanelorn he found more than manuscripts in the forest of troos he dis covered those buried devices which were the inven tions of the doomed folk and which ultimately brought about their destruction these devices of course were meaningless to him until the lords of chaos showed him how they could be activated using the very forces of creation for their energy and he has activated them where he brought the device he wanted to these parts for he needed space to work where he thought he could not be observed by such as myself he is in the sighing desert aye if you had continued on your horse you would have found him by nowor he you i believe that is what drove you into the deserta compulsion to seek him out i had no compulsion save a need to die elric tried to control his anger she smiled again have it thus if you will you mean i am so manipulated by fate that i cannot choose to die if i wish ask yourself for that answer elrics face was clouded with puzzlement and de spair what is it then which guides me and to what end you must discover that for yourself you want me to go against chaos yet chaos aids me and i am sworn to arioch but you are mortaland arioch is slow to aid you these days perhaps because he guesses what lies in the future what do you know of the future littleand what i know i cannot speak of to you a mortal may choose whom he serves elric i have chosen i chose chaos yet much of your melancholy is because you are divided in your loyalties that too is true besides you would not fight for law if you fought against theleb kaarnayou would merely be fighting against one aided by chaosand those of chaos often fight among themselves do they not they do it is also well known that i hate theleb kaarna and would destroy him whether he served law or chaos therefore you will not unduly anger those to whom you are loyalthough they may be reluctant to help you tell me more of theleb kaarnas plans you must see for yourself there is your horse she pointed again and this time he saw the golden mare emerge from the other side of a dune head northeast as you were heading but move cautiously lest theleb kaarna becomes aware of your presence and traps you suppose i merely return to tanelornor choose to try to die again but you will not will you elric you have loyalties to your friends you wish in your heart to serve what i representand you hate theleb kaarna i do not think you would wish to die for the moment he scowled once more i am burdened with un wanted responsibilities hedged by considerations other than my own desires trapped by emotions which we of melnibone have been taught to despise ayei will go myshella i will do what you wish be careful elric theleb kaarna now has powers which are unfamiliar to you which you will find diffi cult to combat she gave him a lingering look and sud denly he had stepped forward and had seized her kissed her while tears flowed down his white face and mingled with hers later he watched as she climbed into the onyx sad dle of the bird of silver and gold and called out a com mand the metal wings beat with a great clashing the emerald eyes turned and the gemstudded beak opened farewell elric said the bird but myshella said nothing did not look back soon the metal bird was a speck of light in the blue sky and elric had turned his horse towards the north east chapter three the barrier broken elric reined in behind the cover of a crag he had found the camp of theleb kaarna a large tent of yellow silk had been erected beneath the pro tection of an overhang of rock which was part of a formation making a natural amphitheatre among the dunes of the desert a wagon and two horses were close to the tent but all this was dominated by the thing of metal which reared in the centre of the clear ing it was contained in an enormous bowl of clear crystal the bowl was almost globular with a narrow opening at the top the device itself was asymmetrical and strange composed of many curved and angular surfaces which seemed to contain myriad halfformed faces shapes of beasts and buildings illusive designs coming and going even as elric looked upon it an imagination even more grotesque than that of elrics ancestors had fashioned the thing amalgamating metals and other substances which logic denied could ever be fused into one thing a creation of chaos which offered a clue as to how the doomed folk had come to destroy themselves and it was alive deep within it something pulsed as delicate and tentative as the heartbeat of a dying wren elric had witnessed many obscenities in his life and was moved by few of them but this device though superficially more in nocuous than much he had seen brought bile into his mouth yet for all his disgust he remained where he was fascinated by the machine in the bowl until the flap of the yellow tent was drawn back and theleb kaarna emerged the sorcerer of pan tang was paler and thinner than when elric had last seen him shortly before the battle between the beggars of nadsokor and the war riors of tanelorn yet unhealthy energy flushed the cheeks and burned in the dark eyes gave a nervous swiftness to the movements theleb kaarna ap proached the bowl as he came closer elric could hear him muttering to himself now now now murmured the sorcerer soon soon will die elric and all who league with him ah the albino will rue the day when he earned my vengeance and turned me from a scholar into what i am today and when he is dead then queen yishana will realise her mistake and give herself to me how could she love that palefaced anachronism more than a man of my great talents how elric had almost forgotten theleb kaarnas obses sion with queen yishana of jharkor the woman who had wielded a greater power over the sorcerer than could any magic it had been theleb kaarnas jeal ousy of elric which had turned him from a relatively peaceful student of the dark arts into a vengeful practi tioner of the most frightful sorceries he watched as theleb kaarna began with his finger to trace complicated patterns upon the glass of the bowl and with every completed rune the pulse within the machine grew stronger oddly coloured light began to flow through certain sections bringing them to life a steady thump issued from the neck of the bowl a peculiar stink began to reach elrics nostrils the core of light became brighter and larger and the machine seemed to alter its shape sometimes becoming ap parently liquid and streaming around the inside of the bowl the golden mare snorted and began to shift uneasily elric automatically patted her neck and steadied her theleb kaarna was now merely a silhouette against the swiftly changing light within the bowl he continued to murmur to himself but his words were drowned by the heartbeats which now echoed among the surround ing rocks his right hand drew still more invisible diagrams upon the glass the sky seemed to be darkening though it was some hours to sunset elric looked up above his head the sky was still blue the golden sun still strong but the air around him had grown dark as if a solitary cloud had come to cover the scene he witnessed now theleb kaarna was stumbling back his face stained by the strange light from the bowl his eyes huge and mad come he screamed come the barrier is down elric saw a shadow then behind the bowl it was a shadow which dwarfed even the great machine some thing bellowed it was scaly it lumbered it raised a huge and sinuous head it reminded elric of a dragon from one of his own caves but it was bulkier and upon its enormous back were two rows of flapping ridges of bone it opened its mouth to reveal row upon row of teeth and the ground shook as it walked from the other side of the bowl and stood staring down at the tiny figure of the sorcerer its eyes stupid and angry an other came pounding from behind the bowl and an othergreat reptilian monsters from another age of earth and following them came those who controlled them the horse was snorting and prancing and des perately trying to escape but elric managed to calm her down again as he looked at the figures which now rested their hands on the obedient heads of the mon sters the figures were even more terrifying than the reptilesfor although they walked upon two legs and had hands of sorts they too were reptilian they bore a peculiar resemblance to the dragon creatures and their size also was many times greater than a mans in their hands they had ornate instruments which could only be weaponsinstruments attached to their arms by spirals of golden metal a hood of skin covered their black and green heads and red eyes glared from the shadows of their faces theleb kaarna laughed i have achieved it i have destroyed the barrier between the planes and thanks to the lords of chaos have found allies which elrics sorcery cannot destroy because they do not obey the sorcerous rules of this plane they are invincible in vulnerableand they obey only theleb kaarna a huge snorting and screaming came from beasts and warriors alike now we shall go against tanelorn theleb kaarna shouted and with this power i shall return to jharkor to make fickle yishana my own elric felt a certain sympathy for theleb kaarna at that moment without the aid of the lords of chaos his sorcery could not have achieved this he had given himself up to them had become one of their tools all because of his weakminded love for jharkors ageing queen elric knew he could not go against the monsters and their monstrous riders he must return to tanelorn to warn his friends to leave the city to hope that he might find a means of returning these frightful inter lopers back to their own plane but then the mare screamed suddenly and reared maddened by the sights the sounds and the smells she had been forced to wit ness and the scream sounded in a sudden silence the rearing horse revealed itself to theleb kaarna as he turned his mad eyes in elrics direction elric knew he could not outride the monsters he knew those weapons could easily destroy him from a distance he drew the black hellsword stormbringer from its scabbard and it shouted as it came free he drove his spurs into the horse and he rode directly down the rocks towards the bowl while theleb kaarna was still too startled to give orders to his new allies his one hope was that he could destroy the deviceor at least break some important part of itand in so doing return the monsters to their own plane his white face ghastly in the sorcerous darkness his sword raised high he galloped past theleb kaarna and struck a mighty blow at the glass protecting the machine the black sword collided with the glass and sank into it carried on by the momentum elric was flung from his saddle and he too passed through the glass without apparently breaking it he glimpsed the dread ful planes and curves of the doomed folks device his body struck them he felt as if the fabric of his being was disintegrating and then he lay sprawled upon sweet grass and there was nothing of the desert of theleb kaarna of the pulsing machine of the horrible beasts and their dreadful masters only waving foliage and warm sun shine he heard birdsong and he heard a voice the storm it has gone and you are you called elric of melnibone he picked himself up and turned a tall man stood before him the man was clad in a conical silver helm and was encased to the knee in a byrnie also of silver a scarlet longsleeved coat partly covered the byrnie the man bore a scabbarded longsword at his side his legs were encased in breeks of soft leather and there were boots of greentinted doeskin on his feet but elrics attention was caught primarily by the mans features which resembled those of a melni bonean much more than those of a true man and the fact that he wore upon his left hand a sixfingered gauntlet encrusted with dark jewels while over his right eye was a large patch which was also jewelled and matched the hand the eye not covered by the patch was large and slanting and had a yellow centre and purple surrounds i am elric of melnibone the albino agreed are you to thank for rescuing me from those creatures theleb kaarna summoned the tall man shook his head twas i that sum moned you but i know of no theleb kaarna i was told that i had only one opportunity to receive your aid and that i must take it in this particular place at this particular time i am called corum jhaelen irsei the prince in the scarlet robeand i ride upon a quest of grave import elric frowned the name had a halffamiliar ring but he could not place it he halfrecalled an old dream where is this forest he asked sheathing his sword it is nowhere on your plane or in your time prince elric i summoned you to aid me in my battle against the lords of chaos already i have been instrumental in destroying two of the sword rulersarioch and xiombargbut the third the most powerful re mains arioch of chaosand xiombarg you have de stroyed two of the most powerful members of the company of chaos yet but a month since i spoke with arioch he is my patron he there are many planes of existence prince co rum told him gently in some the lords of chaos are strong in some they are weak in some i have heard they do not exist at all you must accept that here arioch and xiombarg have been banished so that effectively they no longer exist in my world it is the third of the sword rulers who threatens us nowthe strongest king mabelode elric frowned in myplanemabelode is no stronger than arioch and xiombarg this makes a travesty of all my understanding i will explain as much as i can said prince corum for some reason fate has selected me to be the hero who must banish the domination of chaos from the fifteen planes of earth i am at present travelling on my way to seek a city which we call tanelorn where i hope to find aid but my guide is a prisoner in a castle close to here and before i can continue i must rescue him i was told how i might summon aid to help me effect this rescue and i used the spell to bring you to me i was to tell you that if you aided me then you would aid yourselfthat if i was successful then you would receive something which would make your task easier who told you this a wise man elric sat down on a fallen treetrunk his head in his hands i have been drawn away at an importunate time he said i pray that you speak the truth to me prince corum he looked up suddenly it is a marvel that you speak at allor at least that i understand you how can this be i was informed that we should be able to com municate easily because we are part of the same thing do not ask me to explain more prince elric for i know no more elric shrugged well this may be an illusion i may have killed myself or become digested by that machine of theleb kaarnas but plainly i have no choice but to agree to aid you in the hope that i am in turn aided prince corum left the clearing and returned with two horses one white and one black he offered the reins of the black horse to elric elric settled himself in the unfamiliar saddle you spoke of tanelorn it is for the sake of tanelorn that i find myself in this dreamworld of yours prince corums face was eager you know where tanelorn lies in my own world ayebut why should it lie in this one tanelorn lies in all planes though in different guises there is one tanelorn and it is eternal with many forms they were riding through the gentle forest along a narrow track elric accepted what corum said there was a dreamlike quality about his presence here and he decided that he must regard all events here as he would regard the events in a dream where go we now he asked casually to the castle corum shook his head first we must have the third herothe manynamed hero and will you summon him with sorcery too i was told not i was told that he would meet us drawn from whichever age he exists in by the neces sity to complete the three who are one and what mean these phrases what is the three who are one i know little more than you friend elric save that it will need all three of us to defeat him who holds my guide prisoner aye murmured elric feelingly and it will need more than that to save my tanelorn from theleb kaarnas reptiles even now they must march against the city chapter four the vanishing tower the road widened and left the forest to wander among the heather of high and hilly moorland country far away to the west they could see cliffs and beyond the cliffs was the deeper blue of the ocean a few birds circled in the wide sky it seemed a particularly peaceful world and elric could hardly believe that it was under attack from the forces of chaos as they rode corum explained that his gaunt let was not a gauntlet at all but the hand of an alien being grafted on to his arm just as his eye was an alien eye which could see into a terrifying nether world from which corum could bring aid if he chose to do so all you tell me makes the complicated sorceries and cosmologies of my world seem simple in com parison elric smiled as they crossed the peaceful landscape it only seems complicated because it is strange corum said your world would doubtless seem in comprehensible to me if i were suddenly flung into it besides he laughed this particular plane is not my world either though it resembles it more than do many we have one thing in common elric and that is that we are both doomed to play a role in the con stant struggle between the lords of the higher worldsand we shall never understand why that struggle takes place why it is eternal we fight we suffer agonies of mind and soul but we are never sure that our suffering is worthwhile you are right elric said feelingly we have much in common you and i corum corum was about to reply when he saw something on the road ahead it was a mounted warrior he sat perfectly still as if he awaited them perhaps this is the third of whom bolorhiag spoke cautiously they rode forward the man they approached stared at them from a brooding face he was as tall as them but bulkier his skin was jet black and he wore upon his head and shoulders the stuffed head and pelt of a snarling bear his plate armour was also black without insignia and at his side was a great blackhilted sword in a black scabbard he rode a massive roan stallion and there was a heavy round shield attached to the back of his saddle as elric and corum came closer the mans handsome negroid features assumed an aston ished expression and he gasped i know you i know you both elric too felt he recognised the man just as he had noticed something familiar in corums features how came you here to balwyn moor friend corum asked him the man looked about him as if in a daze balwyn moor this is balwyn moor i have been here but a few moments before that i wasi was ah the memory starts to fade again he pressed a large hand to his forehead a nameanother name no more elric corum but ii am now how do you know our names elric asked him a mood of dread had seized the albino he felt that he should not ask these questions that he should not know the answers becausedont you seei am elrici am corumoh this is the worst agony or at least i have been or am to be elric or corum your name sir corum said again a thousand names are mine a thousand heroes i have been ah i ami amjohn dakererekose urlikmany many many more the mem ories the dreams the existences he stared at them suddenly through his painfilled eyes do you not understand am i the only one to be doomed to understand i am he who has been called the cham pion eternali am the hero who has existed forever and yes i am elric of melniboneprince corum jhaelen irseii am you also we three are the same creature and a myriad other creatures besides we three are one thingdoomed to struggle forever and never understand why oh my head pounds who tortures me so who elrics throat was dry you say you are another incarnations of myself if you would phrase it so you are both other incarnations of myself so said corum that is what bolorhiag meant by the three who are one we are all aspects of the same man yet we have tripled our strength because we have been drawn from three different ages it is the only power which might successfully go against voilodion ghagnasdiak of the vanishing tower is that the castle wherein your guide is impris oned elric asked casting a glance of sympathy at the groaning black man aye the vanishing tower flickers from one plane to another from one age to another and exists in a single location only for a few moments at a tune but because we are three separate incarnations of a single hero it is possible that we form a sorcery of some kind which will enable us to follow the tower and attack it then if we free my guide we can con tinue on to tanelorn tanelorn the black man looked at corum with hope suddenly flooding into his eyes i too seek tanelorn only there may i discover some remedy to my dreadful fatewhich is to know all previous in carnations and be hurled at random from one exis tence to another tanelorni must find her i too must discover tanelorn elric told him for on my own plane her inhabitants are in great danger so we have a common purpose as well as a com mon identity corum said therefore we shall fight in concert i pray first we must free my guide then go on to tanelorn til aid you willingly said the black giant and what shall we call youyou who are our selves corum asked him call me erekosethough another name suggests itself to mefor it was as erekose that i came closest to knowing forgetfulness and the fulfilment of love then you are to be envied erekose elric said meaningly for at least you have come close to for getfulness you have no inkling of what it is i must forget the black giant told him he shook his reins now corumwhich way to the vanishing tower this road leads to it we ride down now to darkvale i believe elrics mind could hardly contain the significance of what he had heard it suggested that the universeor the multiverse as myshella had named itwas di vided into infinite layers of existence that time was virtually a meaningless concept save where it related to one mans life or one short period of history and there were planes of existence where the cosmic bal ance was not known at allor so corum had sug gestedand other planes where the lords of the higher worlds had far greater powers than they had on his own world he was tempted to consider the idea of forgetting theleb kaarna myshella tane lorn and the rest and devote himself to the explora tion of all these infinite worlds but then he knew that this could not be for if erekose spoke the truth then heor something which was essentially himself existed in all these planes already whatever force it was which he named fate had admitted him to this plane to fulfil one purpose an important pur pose affecting the destinies of a thousand planes it must surely be if it brought him together in three separate incarnations he glanced curiously at the black giant on his left at the maimed man with the jewelled hand and eye on his right were they really himself now he fancied he felt some of the desperation erekose must feelto remember all those other in carnations all those other mistakes all that other pointless conflictand never to know the purpose for it all if purpose indeed there were darkvale said corum pointing down the hill the road ran steeply until it passed between two looming cliffs disappearing in shadow there was something particularly gloomy about the place i am told there was a village here once corum said to them an uninviting spot eh brothers i have seen worse murmured erekose come lets get all this done with he spurred his roan ahead of the others and galloped at great speed down the steep path they followed his example and soon they had passed between the lowering cliffs and could barely see ahead of them as they continued to follow the road through the shadows and now elric saw ruins huddled close to the foot of the cliffs on either side oddly twisted rums which had not been the result of age or warfarethese ruins were warped fused as if chaos had touched them while passing through the vale corum had been studying the ruins carefully and at length he reined in there he said that pit here is where we must wait elric looked at the pit it was ragged and deep and the earth in it seemed freshly turned as if it had been but lately dug what must we wait for friend corum for the tower said prince corum i would guess that this is where it appears when it is in this plane and when will it appear at no particular time we must wait and then as soon as we see it we must rush it and attempt to enter before it vanishes again moving on to the next plane erekoses face was impassive he dismounted and sat on the hard ground with his back against a slab of rock which had once belonged to a house you seem more patient than i erekose said elric i have learned patience for i have lived since time began and will live on at the end of time elric got down from his own black horse and loos ened its girth strap while corum prowled about the edge of the pit who told you that the tower would appear here elric asked him a sorcerer who doubtless serves law as i do for i am a mortal doomed to battle chaos as am i said erekose the champion eternal as am i said elric of melnibone though i am sworn to serve it elric looked at his two companions and it was possible to believe that these were two incarnations of himself certainly their lives their struggles their personalities to some extent were very similar and why do you seek tanelorn erekose he asked i have been told that i may find peace there and wisdoma means of returning to the world of the eldren where dwells the woman i love for it has been said that since tanelorn exists in all planes at all times it is easier for a man who dwells there to pass between the planes discover the particular one he seeks what interest have you in tanelorn lord elric i know tanelorn and i know that you are right to seek it my mission seems to be the defence of that city upon my own planebut even now my friends may be destroyed by that which has been brought against them i pray corum is right and that in the vanishing tower i shall find a means to defeat theleb kaarnas beasts and their masters corum raised his jewelled hand to his jewelled eye i seek tanelorn for i have heard the city can aid me in my struggle against chaos but tanelorn will fight neither law nor chaos that is why she exists for eternity elric said aye like erekose i do not seek swords but wis dom night fell and darkvale grew gloomier while the others watched the pit elric tried to sleep but his fears for tanelorn were too great would myshella try to defend the city would moonglum and rackhir die and what could he possibly find in the vanish ing tower which would aid him he heard the mur muring of conversation as his other selves discussed how darkvale had come to exist i heard that chaos once attacked the town which at that time lay in a quiet valley corum told erekose the tower was then the property of a knight who gave shelter to one whom chaos hated they brought a huge force of creatures against darkvale raising and compressing the walls of the valley but the knight sought the aid of law who enabled him to shift his tower into another dimen sion then chaos decreed that the tower should shift forever never being on one plane longer than a few hours usually for never more than a few moments the knight and the fugitive went mad at last and killed each other then voilodion ghagnasdiak found the tower and became resident therein too late he realised his mistake as he was shifted from his own plane to an alien one since then he has been too fearful to leave the tower but desperate for company he has taken to the habit of capturing whomever he can and forcing them to be his companions in the vanishing tower until they bore him when they bore him he slays them and your guide may soon be slain what manner of creature is this voilodion ghagnasdiak he is a monstrous evil creature commanding great powers of destruction that is all i know which is why the gods have seen fit to call up three aspects of myself to attack the vanishing tower said erekose it must be important to them it is to me said corum for the guide is also my friend and the very existence of the fifteen planes is threatened if i cannot find tanelorn soon elric heard erekose laugh bitterly why cannot iweever be faced with a small problem a do mestic problem why are we forever involved with the destiny of the universe corum replied just as elric began to nod into a halfdoze perhaps domestic problems are worse who knows chapter five jharyaconel it is here hasten elric elric sprang up it was dawn he had already stood watch once during the night he drew his black sword from its scabbard noticing with some astonishment that erekose had already drawn his own blade and that it was almost identical to his own there was the vanishing tower corum was running towards it even now the tower was in fact a small castle of grey and solid stone but about its battlements played lights and its outline was not altogether clear at certain sections of its walls elric ran beside erekose he keeps the door open to lure his guests in panted the black giant it is our only advantage i think the tower flickered hasten corum cried again and the prince in the scarlet robe dashed into the darkness of the doorway hasten they ran into a small antechamber which was lit by a great oil lamp hanging from the ceiling by chains the door closed suddenly behind them elric glanced at erekoses tense black features at corums blemished face all had swords ready but now a profound silence filled the hall without speaking corum pointed through a windowslit the view be yond it had changed they seemed now to be looking out over blue sea jhary corum called jharyaconel a faint sound came back it might have been a reply or it might have been the squeak of a rat in the castle walls jhary corum cried again voilodion ghagnasdiak am i to be thwarted have you left this place i have not left it what do you want with me the voice came from the next room warily the three heroes who were one hero went forward something like lightning flickered in the room and in its ghastly glare elric saw voilodion ghagnasdiak he was a dwarf clad all in puffed multicoloured silks furs and satins a tiny sword in his hand his head was too large for his body but it was a handsome head with thick black eyebrows which met in the middle he smiled at them at last someone new to relieve my ennui but lay down your swords gentlemen i beg you for you are to be my guests i know what fate your guests may expect corum said know this voilodion ghagnasdiak we have come to release jharyaconel whom you hold prisoner give him up to us and we will not harm you the dwarfs handsome features grinned cheerfully at these words but i am very powerful you cannot defeat me watch he waved his sword and more lightning lashed about the room elric halfraised his sword to ward it off but it never quite touched him he stepped angrily towards the dwarf know this voilodion ghagnas diak i am elric of melnibone and i have much power i bear the black sword and it thirsts to drink your soul unless you release prince corums friend again the dwarf laughed swords what power have they our swords are not ordinary blades erekose said and we have been brought here by forces you could not comprehendwrenched from our own ages by the power of the gods themselvesspecifically to de mand that this jharyaconel be given up to us you are deceived said voilodion ghagnasdiak or you seek to deceive me this jhary is a witty fellow id agree but what interest could gods have in him elric raised stormbringer the black sword moaned in anticipation of a quenching then the dwarf produced a tiny yellow ball from nowhere and flung it at elric it bounced on his fore head and he was flung backward across the room stormbringer clattering from his hand dizzily elric tried to rise reached out to take his sword but he was too weak on impulse he began to cry for the aid of arioch but then he remembered that arioch had been banished from this world there were no supernatural allies to call upon herenone but the sword and he could not reach the sword erekose leapt backward and kicked the black sword in elrics direction as the albinos hand encircled the hilt he felt strength come back to him but it was no more than ordinary mortal strength he climbed to bis feet corum remained where he was the dwarf was still laughing another ball appeared in his hand again he flung it at elric but this time he brought up the black sword in time and deflected it it bounced across the room and exploded against the far wall something black writhed from the fire it is dangerous to destroy the globes said voilo dion ghagnasdiak equably for now what is in them will destroy you the black thing grew the flames died i am free said a voice aye voilodion ghagnasdiak was gleeful free to kill these fools who reject my hospitality free to be slain elric replied as he watched the thing take shape at first it seemed all made of flowing hair which gradually compressed until it formed the outline of a creature with the heavily muscled body of a gorilla though the hide was thick and warted like that of a rhinoceros from behind the shoulders curved great black wings and on the neck was the snarling head of a tiger it clutched a long scythelike weapon in its hairy hands the tiger head roared and the scythe swept out suddenly barely missing elric erekose and corum began to move forward to elrics aid elric heard corum cry my eyeit will not see into the netherworld i cannot summon help it seemed that corums sorcerous powers were also limited on this plane then voilodion ghagnasdiak threw a yellow ball at the black giant and the pale man with the jewelled hand both barely managed to de flect the missiles and in so doing caused them to burst immediately shapes emerged and became two more of the winged tigermen and elrics allies were forced to defend themselves as he dodged another swing of the scythe elric tried to think of some rune which would summon super natural aid to him but he could think of none which would work here he thrust at the tigerman but his blow was blocked by the scythe his opponent was enormously strong and swift the black wings began to beat and the snarling thing flapped upwards to the ceiling hovered for a moment and then rushed down on elric with its scythe whirling a chilling scream coming from its fanged mouth its yellow eyes glaring elric felt something close to panic stormbringer was not supplying him with the strength he expected its powers were diminished on this plane he barely man aged to dodge the scythe again and lash at the crea tures exposed thigh the blade bit but no blood came the tigerman did not seem to notice the wound again it began to flap towards the ceiling elric saw that his companions were experiencing a similar plight corums face was full of consternation as if he had expected an easy victory and now foresaw defeat meanwhile voilodion ghagnasdiak continued to scream his glee and flung more of the yellow balls about the room as each one burst there emerged another snarling winged tiger creature the room was full of them elric erekose and corum backed to the far wall as the monsters bore down on them their ears full of the fearful beating of the giant wings the harsh screams of hatred i fear i have summoned you two to your destruc tion corum panted i had no warning that our powers would be so limited here the tower must shift so fast that even the ordinary laws of sorcery do not apply within its walls they seem to work well enough for the dwarf elric said as he brought up his blade to block first one scythe and then another if i could slay but a sin gle his back was hard against the wall a scythe nicked his cheek and drew blood another tore his cloak another slashed his arm the tiger faces were grinning now as they closed in elric aimed a blow at the head of the nearest crea ture struck off its ear so that it howled stormbringer howled back and stabbed at the things throat but the sword hardly penetrated and served only to put the tigerman slightly off balance as the thing staggered elric wrenched the scythe from its hands and reversed the weapon drawing the blade across the chest the tigerman screamed as blood spurted from the wound i was right elric shouted at the others only their own weapons can harm them he moved for ward with the scythe in one hand and stormbringer in the other the tigermen backed off and then began to flap upwards to hover near the ceiling elric ran towards voilodion ghagnasdiak the dwarf gave a yell of terror and disappeared through a doorway too small easily to admit elric then with thundering wings the tiger creatures descended again this tune the other two strove to capture scythes from their enemies driving back those who attacked him the albino prince took corums main assailant from behind and the thing fell with its head sliced off corum sheathed his longsword and plucked up the scythe killing a third tigerman almost immediately and kicking the fallen scythe towards erekose black feath ers drifted in the stinking air the flagstones of the floor were slippery with blood the three heroes drove a path through their enemies into the smaller room they had lately left still the tiger creatures came on but now they had to pass through the door and this was more easily defended glancing back elric saw the window slit of the tower outside the scenery altered constantly as the vanishing tower continued its erratic progress through the planes of existence but the three were wearying and all had lost some blood from minor wounds scythes clashed on scythes as the fight continued wings beat loudly and the snarling faces spat at them and spoke words which could barely be understood without the strength supplied him by his hellforged sword elric was weakening rapidly twice he staggered and was borne up by the others was he to die in some alien world with his friends never knowing how he had perished but then he remembered that his friends were even now under attack from the reptilian beasts theleb kaarna had sent against tanelorn that they too would soon be dead this knowledge gave him a little more strength and enabled him to sweep his scythe deep into the belly of another tiger creature this gap in the ranks of the sorcerous things enabled him to see the small doorway on the far side of the other room voilodion ghagnasdiak was crouched there hurling still more of the yellow globes new winged tigermen grew up to replace those who had fallen but then elric heard voilodion ghagnasdiak give a yell and saw that something was covering his face it was a black and white animal with small black wings which beat in the air some offspring of the beasts who attacked him elric could not tell but voilodion ghag nasdiak was plainly terrified of it trying to drag it from his face another figure appeared behind the dwarf bright eyes peered from an intelligent face framed by long black hair he was dressed as ostentatiously as the dwarf but he was unarmed he was calling to elric and the albino strained to catch the words even as another tigercreature came at him corum saw the newcomer now jhary he shouted the one you came to save elric asked aye elric made to press forward into the room but jharyaconel waved him back no no stay there elric frowned was about to ask why when he was attacked from two sides by the tiger creatures and had to retreat slashing his scythe this way and that link arms jharyaconel cried corum in the centreand you two draw your swords elric was panting he slew another tigerman and felt a new pain shoot through his leg blood gushed from his calf voilodion ghagnasdiak was still struggling with the thing which clung to his face hurry cried jharyaconel it is your only chanceand mine elric looked at corum he is wise my friend corum said he knows many things which we do not here i will stand in the centre erekose linked his brawny arm with corums and elric did the same on the other side erekose drew his sword in his left hand and elric brought forth storm bringer in his right and something began to happen a sense of energy came back then a sense of great physical wellbeing elric looked at his companions and laughed it was al most as if by combining their powers they had made them four tunes strongeras if they had become one entity a peculiar feeling of euphoria filled elric and he knew that erekose had spoken the truththat they were three aspects of the same being let us finish them he shoutedand he saw that they shouted the same laughing the linked three strode into the chamber and now the two swords wounded whenever they struck slaying swiftly and bringing them more energy still the winged tigermen became frantic flapping about the room as the three who were one pursued them all three were drenched in their own blood and that of their enemies all three were laughing invulnerable acting completely in unison and as they moved the room itself began to shake they heard voilodion ghagnasdiak screaming the tower the tower this will destroy the tower elric looked up from the last corpse it was true that the tower was swaying wildly from side to side like a ship in a storm jharyaconel pushed past the dwarf and entered the room of death the sight seemed obnoxious to him but he controlled his feelings it is true the sorcery we have worked today must have its effect whiskers to me the thing on voilodion ghagnasdiaks face flew into the air and settled on jharys shoulder elric saw that it was a small black and white cat ordinary in every detail save for its neat pair of wings which it was now folding voilodion ghagnasdiak sat crumpled in the doorway and he was weeping through sightless eyes tears of blood flowed down his handsome face elric ran back into the other room breaking his link with corum he peered through the window slit but now there was nothing but a wild eruption of mauve and purple cloud he gasped we are in limbo silence fell still the tower swayed the lights were extinguished by a strange wind blowing through the rooms and the only illumination came from outside where the mist still swirled jharyaconel was frowning to himself as he joined elric at the window how did you know what to do elric asked him i knew because i know you elric of melnibone just as i know erekose therefor i travel in many ages and on many planes that is why i am sometimes called companion to champions i must find my sword and my sackalso my hat doubtless all are in voilodions vault with his other loot but the tower if it is destroyed shall we too be destroyed a possibility come friend elric help me seek my hat at such a time you look for ahat aye jharyaconel returned to the larger room stroking the black and white cat voilodion ghagnas diak was still there and he was still weeping prince corumlord erekosewill you come with me too corum and the black giant joined elric and they squeezed into the narrow passage inching their way along until it widened to reveal a flight of stairs leading downward the tower shuddered again jhary lit a brand and removed it from its place in the wall he began to descend the steps the three heroes behind him a slab of masonry fell from the roof and crashed just in front of elric i would prefer to seek a means of escape from the tower he said to jharyaconel if it falls now we shall be buried trust me prince elric was all that jhary would say and because jhary had already shown himself to possess great knowledge elric allowed the dandy to lead him further into the bowels of the tower at last they reached a circular chamber and in it was set a huge metal door voilodions vault jhary told them here you will find all the things you seek and i i hope will find my bat the hat was specially made and is the only one which properly matches my other clothes how do we open a door like that erekose asked it is made of steel surely he hefted the black blade he still bore in his left hand if you link arms again my friends jhary suggested with a kind of mocking deference i will show you how the door may be opened once again elric corum and erekose linked their arms together once again the supernatural strength seemed to flow through them and they laughed at each other knowing that they were all part of the same creature jharys voice seemed to come faintly to elrics ears and now prince corum if you would strike with your foot once upon the door they moved until they were close to the door that part of them which was corum struck out with his foot at the slab of steeland the door fell inward as if made of the lightest wood this tune elric was much more reluctant to break the link which held them but he did so at last as jhary stepped into the vault chuckling to himself the tower lurched all three were flung after jhary into voilodions vault elric fell heavily against a great golden chair of a kind he had once seen used as an elephant saddle he looked around the vault it was full of valuables of clothes shoes weapons he felt nau seated as he realised that these had been the posses sions of all those voilodion had chosen to call his guests jhary pulled a bundle from under a pile of furs look prince elric these are what you will need where tanelorn is concerned it seemed to be a bunch of long sticks rolled in thin sheets of metal elric accepted the heavy bundle what is it they are the banners of bronze and the arrows of quartz useful weapons against the reptilian men of pio and their mounts you know of those reptiles you know of theleb kaarna too the sorcerer of pan tang aye elric stared almost suspiciously at jharyaconel how can you know all this i have told you i have lived many lives as a friend of heroes unwrap this bundle when you return to tanelorn use the arrows of quartz like spears to use the banners of bronze merely unfurl them aha jhary reached behind a sack of jewels and came up with a somewhat dusty hat he smacked off the dust and placed it on his head ah he bent again and displayed a goblet he offered this to prince corum take it it will prove useful i think from another corner jhary took a small sack and put it on his shoulder almost as an afterthought he hunted about in a chest of jewels and found a gleaming ring of unnamable stones and peculiar metal this is your reward erekose in helping to free me from my captor erekose smiled i have the feeling you needed no help young man you are mistaken friend erekose i doubt if i have ever been in greater peril he looked vaguely about the vault staggering as the floor tilted alarmingly elric said we should take steps to leave exactly jharyaconel crossed swiftly to the fat side of the vault the last thing in his pride voilodion showed me his possessions but he did not know the value of all of them what do you mean asked the prince in the scar let robe he killed the traveller who brought this with him the traveller was right in assuming he had the means to stop the tower from vanishing but he did not have time to use it before voilodion had slain him jhary picked up a small staff coloured a dull ochre here it is the runestaff hawkmoon had this with him when i travelled with him to the dark empire noticing their puzzlement jharyaconel compan ion to champions apologised i am sorry i some times forget that not all of us have memories of other careers what is the runestaff corum asked i remember one descriptionbut i am poor at naming and explaining things that has not escaped my notice elric said al most smiling it is an object which can only exist under a certain set of spatial and temporal laws in order to continue to exist it must exert a field in which it can contain itself that field must accord with those lawsthe same laws under which we best survive more masonry fell the tower is breaking up erekose growled jhary stroked the dull ochre staff please gather near me my friends the three heroes stood around him and then the roof of the tower fell in but it did not fall on them for they stood suddenly on firm ground breathing fresh air but there was blackness all around them do not step outside this small area jhary warned or you will be doomed let the runestaff seek what we seek they saw the ground change colour breathed warmer then colder air it was as if they moved from plane to plane of the universe never seeing more than the few feet of ground upon which they stood and then there was harsh desert sand beneath their feet and jhary shouted now the four of them rushed out of the area and into the blackness to find themselves suddenly in sunlight beneath a sky like beaten metal a desert erekose murmured a vast desert jhary smiled do you not recognise it friend elric is it the sighing desert listen and sure enough elric heard the familiar sound of the wind as it made its mournful passage across the sands a little way away he saw the runestaff where they had left it then it was gone are you all to come with me to the defence of tanelorn he asked jhary jhary shook his head no we go the other way we go to seek the device theleb kaarna activated with the help of the lords of chaos where lies it elric tried to get his bearings he lifted a hesitant finger that way i think then let us go to it now but i must try to help tanelorn you must destroy the device after we have used it friend elric lest theleb kaarna or his like try to acti vate it again but tanelorn i do not believe that theleb kaarna and his beasts have yet reached the city not reached it so much time has passed less than a day elric rubbed at his face he said reluctantly very well i will take you to the machine but if tanelorn lies so near corum said to jhary why seek it elsewhere because this is not the tanelorn we wish to find jhary told him it will suit me erekose said i will remain with elric then perhaps a look almost of terror spread over jharys features then he said sadly my friendalready much of time and space is threatened with destruction eternal barriers could soon fallthe fabric of the multiverse could decay you do not understand such a thing as has happened in the vanishing tower can only happen once or twice in an eternity and even then it is danger ous to all concerned you must do as i say i promise that you will have just as good a chance of finding tanelorn where i take you your opportunity lies in elrics future erekose bowed his head very well come elric said impatiently beginning to strike off to the northeast for all your talk of tune there is precious little left for me chapter six pale lord shouting in sunlight the machine in the bowl was where elric had last seen it just before he had attacked it and found himself plunged into corums world jhary seemed completely familiar with it and soon had its heart beating strongly he shepherded the other two up to it and made them stand with their backs against the crystal then he handed something to elric it was a small vial when we have departed he said hurl this through the top of the bowl then take your horse which i see is yonder and ride as fast as you can for tanelorn follow these instructions perfectly and you will serve us all elric accepted the vial very well and jhary said finally as he took his place with the others please give my compliments to my brother moonglum you know him what farewell elric we shall doubtless meet many times in the future though we may not recognise each other then the beating of the thing in the bowl grew louder and the ground shook and the strange darkness surrounded itthen the three figures had gone swiftly elric hurled the vial upwards so that it fell through the opening of the bowl then he ran to where his golden mare was tethered leapt into the saddle with the bun dle jhary had given him under his arm and galloped as fast as he could go towards tanelorn behind him the beating suddenly ceased the dark ness disappeared a tense silence fell then elric heard something like a giants gasp and blinding blue light filled the desert he looked back not only the bowl and the device had goneso also had the rocks which had once surrounded it he came up behind them at last just before they reached the walls of tanelorn elric saw warriors on those walls the massive reptilian monsters bore their equally re pulsive masters upon their backs their feet leaving deep marks in the sand as they moved and theleb kaarna rode at their head on a chestnut stallionand there was something draped across his saddle then a shadow passed over elrics head and he looked up it was the metal bird which had borne myshella away but it was riderless it wheeled over the heads of the lumbering reptiles whose masters raised their strange weapons and sent hissing streams of fire in its direction driving it higher into the sky why was the bird here and not myshella a peculiar cry came again and again from its metal throat and elric realised what that cry resembledthe pathetic sound of a mother bird whose young is in danger he stared hard at the bundle over theleb kaarnas saddle and suddenly he knew what it must be myshella herself doubtless she had given elric up for dead and had tried to go against theleb kaarna only to be beaten anger boiled in the albino all his intense hatred for the sorcerer revived and his hand went to his sword but then he looked again at the vulnerable walls of tanelorn at his brave companions on the battlements and he knew that his first duty was to help them but how was he to reach the walls without theleb kaarna seeing him and destroying him before he could bring the banners of bronze to his friends he prepared to spur his horse forward and hope that he would be lucky then a shadow passed over his head again and he saw that it was the metal bird flying low something chapter six pale lord shouting in sunlight the machine in the bowl was where elric had last seen it

prince elric we must save her he shook his head as the bird settled in the sand first i must save tanelorn i will help you said the bird of gold and silver and brass climb up into my saddle elric cast a glance towards the distant monsters their attention was now wholly upon the city they in tended to destroy he jumped from his horse and crossed the sand to clamber into the onyx saddle of the bird the wings began to clash and with a rush they swept into the sky turning towards tanelorn more streaks of fire hissed around them as they neared the city but the bird flew rapidly from side to side and avoided them down they drifted now to the gentle city to land on the wall itself elric moonglum came running along the defences we were told you were dead by whom by myshella and by theleb kaarna when he de manded our surrender i suppose they could only believe that elric said separating the staffs around which were furled the thin sheets of bronze here you must take these i am told that they will be useful against the reptiles of pio un furl them along the walls greetings rackhir he handed the astounded red archer one of the banners you do not stay to fight with us rackhir asked elric looked down at the twelve slender arrows in his hand each one was perfectly carved from multi coloured quartz so that even the fletchings seemed like real feathers no he said i hope to rescue myshella from theleb kaarnaand i can use these arrows better from the air also myshella thinking you dead seemed to go mad rackhir told him she conjured up various sorceries against theleb kaarnabut he retaliated at last she flung herself from the saddle of that bird you ride flung herself upon him armed only with a knife but he overpowered her and has threatened to slay her if we do not allow ourselves to be killed without retaliating i know that he will kill myshella anyway i have been in something of a quandary of conscience i will resolve that quandary i hope elric stroked the metallic neck of the bird come my friend into the air again remember rackhirunfurl the banners along the walls as soon as i have gamed a good height the red archer nodded his face puzzled and once again elric was rising into the air the arrows of quartz clutched in his left hand he heard theleb kaarnas laughter from below he saw the monstrous beasts moving inexorably to wards the walls the gates opened suddenly and a group of horsemen rode out plainly they had hoped to sacrifice themselves in order to save tanelorn and rackhir had not had time to warn them of elrics mes sage the riders galloped wildly towards the reptilian monsters of pio their swords and lances waving their yells rising to where elric drifted high above the mon sters roared and opened their huge jaws their masters pointed their ornate weapons at the horsemen of tane lorn flames burst from the muzzles the riders shrieked as they were devoured by the dazzling heat in horror elric directed the metal bird downwards and at last theleb kaarna saw him and reined in his horse his eyes wide with fear and rage you are dead you are dead the great wings beat at the air as the bird hovered over theleb kaarnas head i am alive theleb kaarnaand i come to destroy you at long last give myshella up to me a cunning expression came over the sorcerers face no destroy me and she is also destroyed beings of pioturn your full strength against tane lorn raze it utterly and show this fool what we can do each of the reptilian riders directed their oddly shaped weapons at tanelorn where rackhir moon glum and the rest waited on the battlements no shouted elric you cannot there was something flashing on the battlements they were unfurling at last the banners of bronze and as each banner was unfurled a pure golden light blazed out from it until there was a vast wall of light stretching the whole length of the defences making it impossible to see the banners themselves or the men who held them the beings of pio aimed their weap ons and released streams of fire at the barrier of light which immediately repelled them theleb kaarnas face was suffused with anger what is this our earthly sorcery cannot stand against the power of pio elric smiled savagely this is not our sorceryit is another sorcery which can resist that of pio now theleb kaarna give up myshella no you are not protected as tanelorn is pro tected beings of piodestroy him and as the weapons began to be directed at him elric flung the first of the arrows of quartz it flew truedirectly into the face of the leading reptilian rider a high whining escaped the riders throat as it raised its webbed hands towards the arrow embedded in its eye the beast the rider sat upon reared for it was plain that it was only barely controlled it turned away from the blinding light from tanelorn and it galloped at earthshaking speed away into the desert the dead rider falling from its back a streak of fire barely missed elric and he was forced to take the bird up higher flinging down another arrow and see ing it strike a riders heart again the mount went out of control and followed its companion into the desert but there were ten more of the riders and each now turned his weapon against elric though finding it hard to aim as all the mounts grew restive and sought to accompany the two who had fled elric left it to the metal bird to duck and to dive through the crisscross of beams and he hurled down another arrow and another his clothes and his hair were singed and he remembered another tune when he had ridden the bird across the boiling sea part of the birds right wingtip had been melted and its flight was a little more erratic but still it climbed and dived and still elric threw the arrows of quartz into the ranks of the beings of pio then suddenly there were only two left and they were turning to flee for nearby a cloud of unpleasant blue smoke had begun to erupt where theleb kaarna had been elric flung the last arrows after the reptiles of pio and took each rider in the back now there were only corpses upon the sand the blue smoke cleared and theleb kaarnas horse stood there and there was another corpse re vealed it was that of myshella empress of the dawn and her throat had been cut theleb kaarna had vanished doubtless with the aid of sorcery sickened elric descended on the bird of metal on the walls of tanelorn the light faded he dismounted and he saw that the bird was weeping dark tears from its emerald eyes he knelt beside myshella an ordinary mortal could not have done it but now she opened her lips and she spoke though blood bubbled from her mouth and her words were hard to make out elric can you live elric asked her have you some power to i cannot live i am slain even now i am dead but it will be some comfort to you to know that theleb kaarna has earned the disdain of the great chaos lords they will never aid him again as they aided him this tune for in their eyes he has proved himself incompetent where has he gone i will pursue him i will slay him the next time that i swear i think that you will but i do not know where he went elrici am dead and my work is threatened i have fought against chaos for centuries and now i think chaos will increase its power soon the great battle between the lords of law and the lords of entropy will take place the threads of destiny be come much tangledthe very structure of the uni verse seems about to transform itself you have some part in this some part farewell elric oh myshella is she dead now it was the sombre voice of the bird of metal aye the word was forced from elrics tight throat then i must take her back to kaneloon gently elric picked up myshellas bloody corpse supporting the halfsevered head on his arm he placed the body in the onyx saddle the bird said we shall not see each other again prince elric for my death shall follow closely upon lady myshellas elric bowed his head the shining wings spread and with the sound of cymbals clashing beat at the air elric watched the beautiful creature circle in the sky and then turn and fly steadily towards the south and worlds edge he buried his face in his hands but he was beyond weeping now was it the fate of all the women he loved to die would myshella have lived if she had let him die when he had wanted to there was no rage left in him only a sense of impotent despair he felt a hand on his shoulder and he turned moonglum stood there with rackhir beside him they had ridden out from tanelorn to find him the banners have vanished rackhir told him and the arrows too only the corpses of those crea tures remain and we shall bury them will you come back with us now to tanelorn tanelorn cannot give me peace rackhir i believe that to be true but i have a potion in my house which will deaden some of your memories help you forget some of what has happened lately i would be grateful for such a potion though i doubt it will work i promise another would achieve complete forgetfulness from drinking this potion but you may hope to forget a little elric thought of corum and erekose and jharya conel and the implications of his experiencesthat even if he were to die he would be reincarnated in some other form to fight again and to suffer again an eternity of warfare and of pain if he could forget that knowledge it would be enough he had the impulse to ride far away from tanelorn and concern himself as much as he could in the pettier affairs of men i am so weary of gods and their struggles he murmured as he mounted his golden mare moonglum stared out into the desert but when will the gods themselves weary of it i wonder he said if they did it would be a happy day for man perhaps all our struggling our suffering our conflicts are merely to relieve the boredom of the lords of the higher worlds perhaps that is why when they created us they made us imperfect they began to ride towards tanelorn while the wind blew sadly across the desert the sand was already beginning to cover up the corpses of those who had sought to wage war against eternity and had inevitably found that other eternity which was death for a while elric walked his horse beside the others his lips formed a name but did not speak it and then suddenly he was galloping towards tanelorn dragging the screaming runesword from its scabbard and brandishing it at the impassive sky making the horse rear up and lash its hooves in the air shouting over and over again in a voice full of roaring misery and bitter rage ah damn you damn you damn you but those who heard himand some might have been the gods he addressedknew that it was elric of melnibone himself who was truly damned
