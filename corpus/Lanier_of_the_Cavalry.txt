mean colonel button accused mr lanier of those letters lanier of the cavalry i the sun was sinking low beyond the ford of the foaming platte the distant bluffs commanding the broad valley of the sweetwater stood sharp and clear against the westward skies the smoke from the campfires along the stream rose in misty columns straight aloft for not so much as a breath of breeze had wafted down from the far snow fields of cloud peak or the sunsheltered rifts of the big horn the flag at the old fort on the neighboring height clung to the staff with scarcely a flutter awaiting the evening salute of the trumpets and the roar of the sunset gun the long june day had seemed unusually unconscionably long to the young girl flitting restlessly about the vinecovered porch of the roadside cottage she laid the big binocular aside for perhaps the twentieth time within the hour with a sigh of impatience a piteous quiver about the pretty rosebud mouth a wistful longing look in the dark and dreamy eyes ever since stable call and her fathers departure to his neverneglected duty she had hovered about that shaded nook again and again searching the northward slopes and ridges the scouts had been in three hours ago reporting the squadron only a mile or so behind it should have dismounted unsaddled fed watered and groomed by this time and rawdon should have been here at her side rawdon whom she had not seen for three mortal days rawdon whom for three mortal weeks before the march she had not missed seeing sometimes several times a day even when he was on guard rawdon whom she had never set eyes on before the first of april and whom now she looked upon as the foremost soldier of the regiment when in point of fact he was but a private trooper serving the first part of his first enlistment in the eyes of his elders a mere recruit and in those of sergeant fitzroy an unspeakable thing another long peep through the signal glasses another sigh and then she came this girl of seventeen in her dainty white frock and plumped herself dejectedly down on the top step with two very shapely slender slippered feet displayed on the second below two dimpled elbows planted on her knees two flushed soft rounded cheeks buried in two long and slender hands away over at the stables she could hear the tap tap of currycomb on brushback as the first squadron groomed its fidgety mounts away up the valley the voices of the children in the arapahoe village rose gleefully on the air away up among the barracks and quarters at the fort the band of the infantry was playing sweet melody peace content and harmony were roundabout her but the dark eyes welling with unshed tears told of a troubled heart and then of a sudden the tears were dashed away and the girl sprang to her feet a blithe voice hailed her from within deys comin miss dora two on em at least like enough to be twin brudders the girl ran to the northward corner again and gazed out across the rushing swollen river not so much as a sign of a dustcloud to tell of marching cavalry and she turned again with rebuke ready on her tongue but again the voice from within comin t other way chile must ha took the lower fohd and rode roun back o de stables and with the words a laughing mammy came bustling to the front door a cool white pitcher in one hand a tray with glasses in the other ah know well nuff what brings de lieutenant round dis way as for dat trash wid him and here came a chuckle of delight at her own wit he just caint help hisself but dora was not listening light as a bird she had flown to the other end of the little porch and was gazing out through the honeysuckles with all her soul in her eyes coming up the slope at easy canter rode a young officer with broadbrimmed hat and dusty field dress alert slender sinewy of only medium height and not more than twentyfive years with a handsome suntanned smiling face a picture of healthful wholesome young manhood and behind him at the regulation distance came what aunt chloe in her darky dialect more than once had declared the very spit of him a young trooper in similar slouch hat and dusty field dress younger probably by three or four years but to the full as alert and active as healthful and wholesome to look at his face now all aglow with a light that was sweet for girlish eyes to see the leader swung his hat and blithely shouted as he curbed his eager horse howdy miss dora bless your heart aunt chloe i knew youd have the buttermilk ready no rawdon i shant dismount this to the young orderly who had sprung from saddle and with his rein over his arm stood ready to take that of his officer merciful saints but isnt that good after thirty miles of alkali he had swallowed a brimming goblet of the cool refreshing drink and chloe was delightedly refilling father home miss dora he went on cheerily over at the stables mr lanier was the smiling answer the face of the girl was sunshine and roses now yet merely a glance or two had passed for trooper rawdon had instantly swung once more into saddle and was reining back to his place stables going yet why i thought it must be supper time colonel sent me ahead to find him three of e troop horses act like theyd been eating locoweed thats what kept us colonel buttons always findin some way of sendin you in ahaid marse lanier grinned chloe ah dont wonder dey says you

doctor mayhew in case i miss him give him the colonels message and say the squadron should be in by and with that and a wave of his hand and a smiling goodnight he took the rein of the troop horse and away they sped to the stables then chloe vanished opportunely the young trooper stood one instant looking gratefully after his officer and those curvetting steeds eager to reach their home and supper dora with glistening eyes and glowing cheeks retreated within the shelter of the bowered porch then bounding up the steps and turning with outstretched arms thither rawdon followed ten minutes later at swift trot came a third horse and rider the horse all that a cavalry horse should be in gait and build the rider well nigh as marked in build and proportions he too was wellmade and muscular though somewhat heavy and stocky he was as soldierly if not as young as the two so recently there in saddle it was the face that repelled for it was black with wrath and suspicion in front of the little cottage of the veterinary surgeon he hurriedly dismounted threw the reins over the post at the horseblock and strode angering through the gate the murmur of blissful voices had ceased at first sight of him dora her face paling met him at the head of the steps hardly noticing her by look or word he brushed by turned sharp to his left and in an instant the two men were face to face rawdon spoke the newcomer his tone curt domineering insolent what do you mean by letting an officer lead your horse to stables go you to yours at once take my horse too and groom him rawdon flushed to his forehead said not a word came forth into the light and then turned squarely my orders were from lieutenant lanier sergeant and they were distinctly to stop here go you at once and do as i say was the instant rejoinder and the veins in the sergeants face were swelled almost to bursting his eyes were fiery his lips were quivering in his wrath indeed sergeant fitzroy began the girl rebukefully those were lieutenant laniers orders hang lieutenant laniers orders no stripling sub can give such orders in this regiment how dare you delay there go you townskip or ill kick you through the but now with blazing eyes dora mayhew threw herself in front of him tall lithe and slender herself she seemed just the height of the young trooper she defended if you raise hand or foot against rawdon sergeant fitzroy its the last time you come inside our gate no ill not stand aside before you strike him youll have to strike me and then and there sergeant fitzroy realized that the fears and forebodings of the past month were more than grounded if angered before he was maddened now brushing her light form aside with one sweep of his powerful arm he sprang forward at the young soldiers throat just as a tall lean man with grizzled beard but athletic build bounded up the steps and caught his wrist none of that in my house fitzroy came the order stern and compelling in gods name what does this mean and still grasping the sergeants arm the speaker with his face nearly as white as his stable frock fairly backed the raging englishman against the wooden pillar and held him there let go mayhew raved the sergeant ive ordered that young rip to stables and he refuses to go he was ordered to stay papa until you came protested dora her eyes ablaze lieutenant lanier that mans superior officer gave him the colonels message to you he was ordered to go by lieutenant laniers superior the officeroftheday whom i represent was fitzroys answer and the longer he stays the worse t will be for him no officer ever authorized you to come to my quarters and lay violent hands on a man behaving like a gentleman which you are not was the cutting rejoinder of the older man and it stung fitzroy to fresh fury was he the model rider of the regiment to be braved like this and in presence of the girl he loved let go you must mayhew he hissed through clenched teeth you have no authority you are only a civilian you can be broke and fired if i report this outrage and what i know let go he shouted freeing himself by furious effort now you rawdon come with me no stop corporal watts he shouted to a noncommissioned officer swinging up the pathway toward the guardhouse on the bluff four men of the guard at his back come this way he continued for at first no attention was paid to his hail come here and take charge of this man its the order of the officeroftheday doubtfully reluctantly leaving his patrol disgustedly waiting corporal watts slowly descended the incline crossed the broad hardbeaten road then obviously embarrassed at the presence of dora mayhew demanded further information before he obeyed by this time rawdon pale and silent was standing at the foot of the steps indignation resentment and trouble all mingling in his face too well he and other young soldiers had learned to know the weight of sergeant fitzroys spite but the trouble in his eyes gave way to sudden relief two officers were coming swiftly round the corner of the corral lanier foremost i say again corporal watts this man is to be taken in charge at once it is captain curbits order as officeroftheday i came direct from him was fitzroys final order but it failed do nothing of the kind corporal watts said a quiet voice at sound of which sergeant fitzroy whirled about and turned if a possible thing a full shade redder there at the gate stood lieutenant lanier there a dozen yards away but trudging fast as dignity would permit came the officeroftheday a jerk of the head to the corporal in response to his instant salute and that young soldier much relieved strode away to join his men then captain curbit turned on sergeant fitzroy you told me nothing of the facts in this case sir lieutenant lanier says he directed this man to wait here with the colonels message while he rode to stables pardon me miss dora come this way sergeant and there was nothing for it but to obey abashed humiliated rebuked and in her presence where he had looked but a moment before to humble and humiliate his rival fitzroy could only lift his hand in salute follow the captain out of earshot and there make his plea as best he could leaving lanier and the silent young trooper dora and her gravefaced old father in possession of the field for a moment they watched fitzroy eagerly gesticulating as he stood at attention before his superior hell give you no more trouble i fancy said lanier in low tone to the veterinarian ill say goodnight again miss dora and he walked cheerily away but mayhew looked after him long and anxiously then upon the young people before him then upon the still protesting sergeant across the way maybe not maybe not he muttered with sorrowing shake of the head but few men can give more trouble than him when hes minded and i reckon hes minded now ii nearly six long months went the regiment afield on the hardest campaign of its history then at last by way of reward it had been ordered in to big fort cushing for the winter it was close to town close to the railway things that in those days thirty years ago seemed almost heavenly the new station was blithe and merry with christmas preparations and pretty girls all the married officers families had rejoined half a dozen fair visitors had come from the distant east the band was good the dancing men were many the dancing floor was fine and the dance they were having on friday night december was all that even an army dance could be until just after eleven oclock then something happened to cast a spell over everybody bob lanier was officeroftheguard bob had asked the colonel to let him turn over his sword to a brother officer who being in mourning could not dance and the colonel had curtly said no the colonels wife was amazed she did not dream he could do such a thing six girls were sorrowful three were incensed and one was cruelly hurt she was under parental orders to start for home on the morrow it was to be her last dance at the fort she liked bob lanier infinitely more than she liked her fathers dictum that she must like him not at all as for bob lanier the garrison knew he loved her devotedly even before she knew it herself of course she came to the dance as the guest of captain and mrs sumter she even had to go up and smile on the colonel and his wife who were receiving she and kate sumter had been classmates roommates at vassar and kate born and reared in the army had never been quite content until her friend could come to visit the regiment her fathers home a winsome pair they were these two sweet girl graduates of the june gone by while the regiment was stirring up the sioux on the way to the big horn and yellowstone everybody had lavish welcome for them and to miriam arnold the month at fort cushing had been quite a dream of delight until there came a strange and sudden missive from her father bidding her break off a visit that was to have lasted until february and all relations with lieutenant robert ray lanier up to this moment these relations had been delightful yet indefinite for reasons of his own mr lanier had made no avowal of his love to her even though he had disclosed it to every one else he was a frank fearless outandout young soldier a prime favorite with most of his fellows bob had his enemies frank men generally have he could hardly believe the evidence of his ears when just after sunset rollcall he had confidently approached the colonel with his request and had received the colonels curt reply time and again during the recent campaign the veteran soldier now in command had shown marked liking for this energetic young officer then came the march to the settlements and sudden unaccountable change twice or thrice within the past ten days he had shown singular coldness and disfavor tonight strong and sudden dislike and lanier amazed and stung could only salute and turn away everybody by half past ten had heard of it and most men marvelled nobody at eleven oclock was very much surprised when in the midst of the lovely lorelei waltz of keler bela a group of young maids matrons and officers near the doorway opened out as it were and bob lanier officeroftheguard came gracefully gliding and circling down the room miriam arnolds radiant happy face looking up into his it was a joy to watch them dance together but not to watch the colonels face when he caught sight of them except lanier every officer present was in full uniform without his sabre lanier was in the undress uniform of the guard but with the sabre not the long curved clumsy steelscabbarded weapon then used by the cavalry but a light prussian hussar sword that he had evidently borrowed for the occasion for it belonged to barker the adjutant as everybody knew as barker realized to his cost when in less than ten seconds the commander summoned him mr barker you will at once place mr lanier in arrest for quitting his guard and disobeying my orders i shall have to get my sabre sir stammered the adjutant meaning the regulation item over at his quarters there it is sir before your eyes mr lanier at least can have no further use for it until a courtmartial acts on his case good lord thought barker how can i go up to bob and tell him to turn over that sword so that i can properly place him in arrest and here too and of all times but the colonel would brook no delay direct mr lanier to report to me in the anteroom said he marching thither forthwith and that message the luckless adjutant had to deliver at once bob saw it coming in barkers sombre visage the girl on his arm understood nothing but noted the hush that had fallen even though the music went on saw barker coming and something told her it meant trouble and turned her sweet face white miss arnold may i offer myself as a substitute for the rest of this dance bob the chief wants to see you a second was the best that barker could think of they praised him later for his mendacity yet what he said was true to the letter it took little more than a second for the colonel to say mr lanier go to your room in arrest and bob saluted turned and went unslinging the sword on the way illustration mr lanier go to your room in arrest now that was the first touch to spoil that memorable december night but it was only a feather to what followed the waltz soon ceased but the colonel called for an extra and led out a lady from town the wife of a future senator keep this thing going he cautioned his adjutant and certain of his personal following which was large and loyally they tried but the piteous face of the girl he had left at the door of the ladies dressingroom and in the hands of mrs sumter was too much for barker moreover he much liked lanier and bemoaned his fate colonel button was hopping mad as the quartermaster put it and as all men could see yet at what laniers offence when fairly measured had not been so grave it had happened half a dozen times that the officeroftheguard making his rounds and visiting sentries in the course of a dance evening would casually drop in by one door and out by another taking a turn or two on the floor perhaps just waltzing in and waltzing out as they said and no one the worse for it even when the colonel happened to be present nor could men now see what it was that so angered the commander against lanier disobeyed his orders flatly suggested captain snaffle who stood by the colonel on every occasion when not himself the object of that officers satire or censure disobeyed no order said sumter as stoutly simply did what many another has done and nobody hurt nor would lanier have been noted perhaps if he had not first asked to turn over his sword to trotter but even that could not fully account for the colonels rancor and though the music and dance went on men and women both with clouded faces found themselves asking the question what could have angered him so at lanier and in a corner of the ladies dressingroom two pretty girls with difficulty soothed by mrs sumter were vainly striving not to cry their eyes out kate sumter dismayed at the almost uncontrollable grief of her friend who strange to military measures imagined that bobs arrest was but the prelude to his being shot at sunrise or something well nigh as terrible not ten minutes after lanier went out and went silent but in unspeakable wrath paymaster scott came dawdling in and though but a casual visitor at the post just back that day from a tour of the northward camps and forts along the indian border he saw at a glance that something had gone amiss the colonel was laboriously waltzing three or four couples were mechanically following suit but most of the men were gathered about the buffet and most of the women huddled at the dressingroom door and scott marching over to pay his respects to the colonels wife and explain his coming at so late an hour noted instantly the trouble in her serious face he had known her long and liked her well as despite occasional differences at whist he did her husband captain snaffle was speaking with her at the moment mrs snaffle was at her side why did they tell her at all mrs snaffle was asking with much spirit and obvious effort to control a racial tendency to double the final monosyllables sure they might have known t would sc frighten the life out of her sc frighten who asked scott who was friends with everybody and for more reasons than his office a welcome guest wherever he went snaffle shot a warning glance at his wife which fell as he said unaided its bobby lanier meejor only you mustnt sp refer to it mrs snaffle when selfcontrolled discreetly shunned such vowels as betrayed her origin a totally useless precaution since all men knew it and liked her none the less lanier oh yes i thought it was bob i saw a while ago streaking it across the parade its bright as day in the moonlight with the snow whats bob got to do with frightening folk and now he was shaking hands with all three something very unfortunate has happened major said mrs button mr lanier was officeroftheguard and asked to attend the dance mr trotter offering to take charge of the guard colonel button felt compelled to decline and he came any way you know of course that couldnt be overlooked hm said scott gravely and reflectively and who is so frightened miriam arnold a very charming girl who is visiting the sumters indeed it looks as though she cared for him its no secret that hes in love with her ah yes well then it was she i saw getting into the fosters sleigh at the side door oh i think not i hope not cried mrs button a flush mounting to her face i wanted to say a reassuring word after a little but at the moment mrs sumter was seen coming forth from the dressingroom half a dozen women were upon her at once with sympathetic inquiries to these she spoke briefly yet courteously and escaping on the arm of the regimental quartermaster came straightway to mrs button you will forgive my girls for not saying goodnight she cordially spoke miriam has been quite upset by a letter from home and this little episode this evening which she cannot understand as we do has so unstrung her that mrs foster offered to send them over home in her sleigh the side door had been barred but mr horton pried it open for them so they had no need to come this way and face everybody and explain you know how sorry i am said mrs button of course they are excusable for leaving as they did why where are the others going the music had suddenly stopped there was a scurry on the part of the men at the anteroom several had run to the entrance others were following some one among the women with startled eyes and paling face sprang up saying its fire always a dread at windswept cushing almost at the same instant the colonel and scott reached the veranda without a dozen officers were there intent and listening i tell you i heard it plainly said one of their number and the foster sleigh isnt back heard what sir demanded the colonel whats the trouble a cry for help or something over yonder barker and blake are gone there was a stir at the guardhouse too and as though to confirm this much at least there presently appeared round the corner of the building the sergeant of the guard in his fur cap and overcoat and with him a burly soldier bleeding at the nose and bristling with wrath one hand covered a damaged eye with the other he saluted captain snaffle who had edged to the front of the group sir i have to report trooper rawdon assaulting a noncommissioned officer for an instant there was silence then major scott gave tongue trooper rawdon cried he why hes been with me nearly a month and now has a months furlough from general crook hes the best man of the escort refused to obey my orders to go to his quarters sir and assaulted me when i tried to enforce em sergeant blunt says he wont confine him unless captain snaffle orders it one moment sergeant interposed colonel button has any disturbance any cry for help been heard at the guardhouse or was this the explanation and he looked with disfavor on the battered complainant number five sir hasnt called off half past leven ive sent the corporal to see whats the matter number five cried two or three men at the instant and without a word captain sumter hurried away on a bee line across the snowcovered parade following the tracks of the adjutant number five repeated the colonel thats just back of sumters quarters and he stepped out into the moonlight for clearer view afar over across the glistening level a few lights glimmered faintly in the row of officers quarters bounding the northward side of the garrison but neither along their front nor that of the westward row was there sign of moving humanity the moon at its full in that rare clear atmosphere illuminated the post the frozen slopes beyond and the dazzling range of the rockies with a radiance that rendered objects visible almost as at midday only the hurrying form of captain sumter could be seen half way across the parade the fosters sleigh that by this time should have been back at the assembly room was nowhere in sight sumters quarters were about the middle of the row laniers were at the eastward end for the moment the complaint of the aggrieved sergeant was ignored all men stood waiting watching then on a sudden two or three black forms darted from the shadow of the middle quarters one came running out across the parade hardly slackened speed at the hail of captain sumter pointed back with one hand shouted something that doubled sumters pace but hurried onward toward the group it was conroy corporaloftheguard the adjutant orders me to report number five sick sir he panted to the colonel i found him all doubled up in the coalshed back of the majors t wasnt him hollered t was somebody at captain sumters they got the steward over from the hospital but they want the sergeant and some of the guard to search the back buildings who wants them demanded the colonel the adjutant sir lieutenant blakes with him there has been some prowlers and the young ladies were frightened they are safely home asked the colonel then wheres the sleigh theyre home all right sir and the sleigh went on out of the east gate to the store i suppose number six didnt stop it one moment interposed the colonel sergeantoftheguard take four of your men and report to captain sumter or to the adjutant now corporal when was this cry heard just after the young ladies got home sir leastwise thats what i was told we didnt hear it at the guardhouse was the officeroftheguard over there not the new one sir but and then the corporal suddenly stopped contrite and troubled but what demanded the colonel instant suspicion in his eyes and tone do you mean that lieutenant lanier was there out of his quarters out of his head if he was growled the paymaster who loved him well and was deeply concerned over his trouble i i didnt see him sir answered the young soldier but in manner so confused that it simply added to the commanders suspicion come with me horton said the colonel to his quartermaster and turning back for his cap and overcoat then once again the voice of the aggrieved and importunate sergeant was heard this time with convincing appeal i beg the colonels pardon but if he wants to get the truth as to this nights business it would be well to arrest trooper rawdon or hell be off for good and all find him then sergeantoftheguard and have it done said button report it to the officeroftheday as my order iii that ended the dance but not the excitement women and girls were seeking their wraps even before the corporal came and now went twittering homeward each on the arm of her escort except in the case of those allied forces the wives of certain seniors who long had lived moved and ruled in the regiment and now in eager yet guarded tones were discussing the events of the hour gone by with these went mrs foster her husband having joined the searching party and her sleigh instead of returning being still missing and unaccounted for not yet midnight and in the space of less than one hour all fort cushing had been stirred by the news a most popular and prominent young officer had been placed in close arrest a prominent if not most popular sergeant had been pummelled an alarming scene of some kind had occurred at the quarters of captain sumter no one outside of the immediate family knew just what had happened and those inside cared not to tell mrs sumter had hurried away the minute she learned that her husband had gone the colonel sternly silent led his wife to their door and there left her saying he had summoned certain officers to join him at once and she who ruled him in all matters domestic almost as she managed the children knew well that when roused he would brook no interference in matters professional and bob lanier a prime favorite of hers had in some way managed to fall under the ban of his extreme displeasure at the office were presently assembled the colonel the adjutant the quartermaster the post surgeon and to them came paymaster scott at the store the only clubroom they had in those days were gathered half the commissioned officers of the post at sumters there kept coming and going by twos and threes from all along the officers line a succession of sympathetic callers who left even more mystified than when they arrived mrs sumter was aloft with kate and their guest and as the captain civilly but positively told all visitors had to be excused one of the girls was somewhat hysterical miriam had had a fright in the dark on their return home and screamed something foolish probably but none the less effective no sumter thought mrs sumter would need no help yet he was so much obliged to the several who suggested going up just to see if they couldnt do something captain sumter was a devoted husband and father a capital officer and a gentleman to the core but the captain could be just a trifle distant at times and this was one of them another house was virtually closed to question to the disappointment of many and the disapprobation of a few bob lanier had closeted himself with his classmate and most intimate friend dad ennis then after a brief colloquy with barker the adjutant had caused a big card to be tacked on his door whereon was crayoned in bold black letters busy but at quarter past twelve the assistant surgeon doctor schuchardt called as was known for the second time and entered without ceremony when the officeroftheday came tramping along the boardwalk at and turned in at the gate he struck the panel with the hilt of his sabre by way of hint that his call was official and not to be denied ennis therefore came to the door but came with gloomy brow i am ordered by colonel button to ask certain questions of lieutenant lanier said the official from the depths of his fur cap hows that doc called ennis over his massive shoulder can your patient see the officeroftheday not yet with my consent came the stout answer shout your questions captain sang out the patient with much too little humility of manner yet lanier knew curbit well and knew his mission to be unwelcome therefore in captain curbits most official tones ab imo pectore came question the first is trooper rawdon in hiding anywhere about your quarters to which truculently came response in laniers unmistakable voice he is not if i know it do you know or suspect where he is neither and there is no reason why i should have you seen him tonight an instants pause then i dont know whether i have or not you dont know exclaimed curbit puzzled and beginning to bristle i dont know repeated lanier positive and beginning to rejoice suppose the colonel tells me to explain that began curbit but doctor schuchardt set his foot down summarily here said he this things got to stop and he came to the door in his shirt sleeves leaning half way out with one hand behind him laniers in a highly nervous and excited state he has had a fall and im trying to get him to bed and asleep he doesnt know whom he has seen since he got home in arrest and you can say so for me all right shoe was the philosophical answer its none o my funeral and personally i dont give a cuss if they never find him but there are just steen reasons why the old man wants to see that young man rawdon forthwith and as many for believing hes skipped then skip after him you can track anything but a ghost in this newfallen snow curbit lowered his voice thats exactly the trouble doctor go to the back of the quarters and see for yourself his trail starts and ends here in all its history fort cushing had never known such a day of bewilderment as that which followed guard mounting was held as usual at eight am and colonel button awaiting in his office the coming of the old and the new officersoftheday directed his adjutant to drop his own work at their entrance and give attention to what took place half a dozen other officers with little or no business to transact at that hour made it their business to be present drawn thither from sheer sympathy as some declared and downright curiosity as owned by others the office building was large and roomy the colonels desk was close to the door beyond it were tables spread with maps magazines and papers a big stove stood in the middle and a dozen chairs were scattered about for it was here the officers met one evening each week in the one bookschooling to which they were then subjected a recitation in regulations or tactics across the hall was a smaller office the adjutants and beyond that the room where sat the sergeantmajor and his clerks the windows snowbattered and frostbitten gave abundant light from the skies but none on the surroundings the view being limited to scratchhole surveys there was nothing to distract attention from what might be going on within and all eyes were on the two burly captains who entered at furcapped furgloved in huge overcoats and arctics the wind had begun even earlier than usual to whine and stir as it swept down from the bleak northwest and the mercury had dropped some ten degrees since the previous evening blizzard coming said scott as he glanced at the sullen skies and scott knew the rockies as he did the paymasters manual i report as old officeroftheday sir said curbit with brief salute tendering the guard report book the colonel went straight to business as he glanced over the list of prisoners no sign of trooper rawdon no sir the patrol sent to search in town got back at reveille his horse and kit all right all right sir nothing missing that he was supposed to have police notified to watch all trains and stages yes sir and sergeant stowell who commanded the paymasters escort remains in town with a couple of men to help there was impressive silence in the office the colonel sat with troubled brow looking grimly over the roster of the guard the written remarks of the officeroftheday and the hours of his inspections of sentries etc barker the adjutant had dropped into a chair a few feet back of the furcapped officers and though listening as bidden was gloomily contemplating the frostcovered panes of the nearest north window eight men had gone with sergeant stowell as escort to the paymaster when nearly four weeks earlier he had set forth on his trip then the little iron safe was full of money seven men had come back with him when as the safe was well nigh empty the paymaster said he hardly needed an escort of the eight who started four were casuals who belonged to companies stationed at fort frayne well up in the indian country and there they remained when the duty was over of the seven who came with stowell three belonged at fort frayne a corporal and two men of captain raymonds troop and they came fortified with the orders of their post commander a copy of which was now in barkers hands what i dont understand said the colonel whirling his chair to the right about and addressing the paymaster is how or why those men should be down here it seems simple answered scott placidly he being entirely independent of the post commander from frayne i had to go to the cantonments up along the big horn and we doubled the size of the escort accordingly when we got back there these three were permitted to come all the way whether to buy christmas things for the frayne folk or for affairs of their own i didnt inquire to whom did you assign them for rations and quarters demanded the colonel of barker captain snaffle sir c troop are they there the others at least corporal watts and trooper ames are there sir trooper rawdon as you know is not he has not been seen about the quarters since some time last evening moreover the few personal belongings he had are gone again a pause then presently you arrested kelly i see the man who was on number five yes sir both doctor schuchardt and the steward said his sickness was due to drink the sergeant and corporaloftheguard are willing to swear he was perfectly sober when they stationed him the men say he hadnt touched a drop of liquor for a month he must have drunk after he was posted as sentry for he vomited whiskey at the hospital i believe he was doped that he could get whiskey anywhere along back of the officers quarters said the colonel reflectively as well as reflecting is not improbable that it should have been doped judging from the way one or two have misbehaved is not impossible captain snaffles cook it seems was indulging some of her friends with a surreptitious supper at his expense that very possibly is how kelley came to grief the others seem to have hidden their tracks thus far then as though with sudden resolution he turned abruptly again the usual orders for the present captain said he to the new incumbent and you are relieved captain curbit to the old but i shall need to see you later so do not leave the post the man that leaves the post this day said major scott with a squint through the upper and unincumbered panes of the nearest window may need a seven days leave and that colonel said a quiet voice at the commanders elbow is what i applied for earlier pardon me sir but i need to know your decision for i should now be going to town it was captain sumter who spoke and the colonel flushed promptly at sound of his voice i had intended sending for you sumter said he but these rather engrossing matters had to be taken up first i have your application he continued fumbling among the papers on his desk it is an awkward time and these are awkward circumstances it will leave your troop without an officer mr lanier will be here colonel here but in close arrest frowned the colonel and you havent had a first lieutenant since i have been in command my misfortune sir but hardly my fault answered captain sumter tersely yet respectfully general sheridan selects his aidesdecamp where he will and last month you thought it a compliment to the regiment and to my troop you feel that you ought to go asked the colonel dropping the subject like a hot brick and resuming the previous question our guest miss arnold is in no condition to travel alone said captain sumter gravely my wife decides to accompany her at least to chicago and i desire to go with my wife the colonel bit his lip and bowed i see said he miss arnold was very much shaken by what happened after she got home rather by what happened before she got home was the calm yet suggestive reply and it stung the commander to the quick captain sumter said he flushing angrily for no one of his officers held he in higher esteem your attitude is that of opposition if not of rebuke to the official acts of the post commander then let me disclaim at once the faintest disrespect colonel button but as mr laniers troop commander and personal friend i beg leave to say that so far as i know his offense is one which his comrades have committed time and again without rebuke which simply goes to show sir responded the colonel with glittering eyes that you do not know the twentieth part of his offense for a moment the silence in the office was painful men looked at each other without speaking sumter stood before his commander turning paler with the flitting seconds at last he spoke if that be true colonel button of course i cannot think of going i withdraw my application and turning slowly left the office between him and the adjutant flashed one quick glance there was something to come yet the officersoftheday had gone curbit to shed furs and sabre at his quarters and say thank god snaffle his junior in rank but senior in years a veteran of the old dragoons to plod wearily back towards the guardhouse for a conference with lieutenant crane commanderoftheguard in the office of the sergeantmajor the clerks were busily at work consolidating the morning reports of the ten companies six of cavalry four of infantry stationed at the post a note on that of captain snaffle had already caught the eye of the sergeantmajor who had bustled in to impart the tidings to his immediate superior the adjutant and was disappointed to find them known already instead of carrying three enlisted men present as casually at post the return of troop c had but two trooper rawdon whose horse horse equipments and field kit were safely stored in the troopstables since noon the previous day was himself accounted for nowhere in view of the fact that he had not been seen and could not be found there was nothing remarkable about that with the morning report book however there was handed in a copy of an order duly submitted by corporal watts to snaffles first sergeant and by him to his captain which read as follows fort frayne wyoming december s o extract no on arriving with his detachment at fort cushing and in compliance with the telegraphic instructions from department headquarters trooper g p rawdon troop l th cavalry is granted thirty days furlough at the expiration of which he will report to the commanding officer of fort cushing for transportation to his proper station by order of lieutenantcolonel kent douglas jerrold second lieut th inf post adjutant iv just as the paymaster predicted the wintry storm broke with the early afternoon a genuine blizzard came shrieking down from the mountain pass to the northwest charging madly through the post blinding the eyes and snatching the breath of the few hardy men who had to venture out of doors driving before it a dense white snowcloud sweeping clean the westward roofs and prairie wastes and banking up to the very eaves on the lee side of every building even the sentries had to be severally taken off post and lodged within number five so it was reported had been blown bodily into the snaffles kitchen even the commanding officers orderly who had barely managed to make his way back after dinner was now relieved only by hauling himself hand over hand along the picket fence and turning his back to the gale every ten seconds to catch his breath had he succeeded in returning to his post even stable duty was abandoned so far as grooming was concerned for though the men could readily be blown from barracks to their steeds no power could fetch them back for supper veteran first sergeants told off a stout squad in each troop and sent them with a sackload of rations to reinforce the stable sergeant and grooms there to stay to feed guard and water the horses unless the roofs blew away and all were buried in drifts there was safety if not comfort in the sheltered flats below the bluffs but the telegraph wires went with the first hour the stage of course couldnt be hoped to return from town and so far as getting news from the surrounding universe was concerned fort cushing might as well have been in nova zembla and the sumters three with miriam arnold had set forth at noon intending to intercept the eastbound express and the colonels spirit was raging in sympathy with the storm and in spite of his wife for some one had started a tale that sumter and his household had ostentatiously called upon robert ray lanier in close arrest in utter disfavor and inferential disgrace now while an officer in arrest may not quit his quarters under seven days and may not even thereafter visit his commanding officer unless ordered or his brother officers unless authorized by that magnate there is no regulation prohibiting other officers or their households visiting him nevertheless they who publicly do so lay themselves liable to the imputation of sympathizing with the accused at the expense of the accuser and some commanding officers are so sensitive that they look upon such demonstrations as utterly subversive of discipline and aimed directly at them and of such was colonel button a brave soldier a gentleman at heart a kind if crotchety commander and a lenient man rather than a disciplinarian much given himself to criticism of his own superiors or contemporaries he could not abide it that he should lack the full and enthusiastic support much less be made the object of the criticism of his officers or men a vain man was button and dearly he loved the adulation of his comrades high or low veteran irish sergeants knew well how to reach the soft side of the old man astute troop commanders like snaffle saved themselves many a deserved wigging by judicious use of blarney sterling straightforward men like major stannard like sumter raymond and truscott of his captains men who could not fawn and would not flatter were never buttons intimates he admired them he respected them but down in his heart he did not like them because they were in a word independent and during the long and trying campaign that began early in june and closed only late in november button had made more than one error that set men to saying things and at least one blunder that had called for rebuke it was supposed at the time that the rebuke would end it but to buttons wrath and indeed that of most of his friends the story appeared in exaggerated form in many an eastern paper what made it worse was that as told in boston philadelphia and other far eastern communities where the indian is little known and much considered buttons interests were bound to suffer for he was declared to have butchered defenseless women and children in a surrendered village a most unjust accusation in spite of the fact that certain squaws and boys had died fighting with their braves by night when bullets could not well discriminate button had but just got his promotion to regimental command and friends at court were working hard for his further advancement to the grade of brigadiergeneral a fact that hurt him in an army so benighted as then was ours in believing that generalships should be bestowed only upon the seniors and servicetried among the colonels we have broadened much since then and as it was once said that every french soldier carried the baton of a marshal in his knapsack so now may the silver star be hidden in the pocket of the lieutenants of every staff department as well as those of the fighting force there are none who may not aspire so button believed it of sumter that he and his on the way to the railway station went in and condoled with bob lanier and doubtless vituperated him the commander when in point of fact no one of their number had seen or spoken with bob sumter merely left a big basket filled with fruit and a little note with friendliness from mrs sumter then sprang into the curtained escort wagon and was whisked away then came the storm and then a sunday and monday in which no man went either way between the fort and town and then a third in which the gale went down and the garrison first dug itself out and then tunnelled in to the colonels the adjutants office and other submerged quarters and on the morning of that third day captain sumter in snowcovered furs reported his return in person to his post commander and explained that he had been stormbound at the station in the meantime it was then barely nine oclock guard mounting the first held since saturday was just over the morning reports the first rendered since saturday were just in and the staff and company officers for the first time since saturday were beginning to gather at headquarters and to compare notes all had much to tell stannards woodpile snaffles stormshed and barkers cow had blown away somebody had just reported sumters north dormer window torn out by the roots which moved button to say i hope your quarters sustained no damage in your absence i do not know sir i came direct to the office to report ah true your household started before the storm only started sir they went no farther than the surgeons quarters where we learned the train was six hours late i had business in town and went on they remained then the ladies have not gone east neither they nor any one else since early saturday morning the road is blocked the paymaster too he went in right after luncheon i cannot say sir i neither saw nor heard of him about the station it is crowded with people three trains are stalled there unable to go either way and now with your permission colonel oh certainly certainly sumter i didnt wish to detain you i hope youll find the ladies well whereat the captain withdrew giving place to the quartermaster who had hurried in an anxious look in his eyes that he should have numerous losses and damages to report was to be expected that he should appear in the least concerned was not a faithful and loyal staff officer was horton but one of the most philosophic if not phlegmatic souls in the service it took nothing short of a national disaster seriously to disturb his equanimity therefore at sight of his face the colonel was almost instantly on his feet can i have a sergeant and twenty men at once sir armed and mounted the ambulance with the paymaster never reached town order them out at once mr barker was buttons instant answer turning to his adjutant who went out like a shot what time did they start about two saturday afternoon it was blowing a gale then and the snow so thick we lost sight of them within a hundred yards major scott declined an escort said he and the clerk and the two men inside were more than enough he had only three thousand dollars left and thought that too little to tempt anybody everybody knew he was just back from a long pay trip not going yet they have disappeared utterly i had men ride the length of the creek valley twixt here and town and there isnt a sign of them the silence in the office was oppressive men looked at each other in dumb consternation how did you learn they hadnt reached town demanded button sergeant fitzroy just came out hed been in there with sergeant stowell to help find rawdon he said major scott had a section engaged in the pullman for omaha and fitzroy says he never claimed it says he searched every stable for the ambulance but there was no sign of it and he says there was a gang of half a dozen toughs that had been hanging about town for a week and theyve cleared out id like to go and get into riding rig sir go and ill have a troop out after you if need be then turning to his adjutant barker have sergeant fitzroy sent for at once another moment and a trig wellgroomed soldier floridfaced muscular yet burly in build stepped briskly in and stood attention his right eye and cheek were still heavily bruised and discolored his nose was somewhat swollen the colonel had looked upon him with sombre eyes the night of the dance it annoyed him that a noncommissioned officer should have taken such a time and place to offer a complaint he still disapproved moreover he had given sergeant fitzroy no authority to go as volunteer aid to sergeant stowell how did you happen to be in town sergeant was the abrupt demand fitzroy colored to the brows but the answer was prompt i understood the colonel to say find him referring to trooper rawdon friday night and i went in saturday morning thinking to help then we couldnt get back sir my order was to the sergeantoftheguard not to you interposed button curtly sergeant stowell was sent and that was enough sergeant stowell was looking for a man in uniform sir and had never seen rawdon except in trooper dress and would never perhaps have known him then how should you was the sharp query fitzroy started i had known him longer sir and much better i had occasion to reprimand him once or twice and knew him and his pals if the colonel will pardon me as none of the others knew him there was that young civilian lowndes that went along with us and got into trouble and there were others in fact if the colonel will pardon me again sir i do not hold a high opinion of trooper rawdon and if the colonel were to investigate its my belief he could trace many a disloyal trick and tale to that man whats more and now the speakers tone betrayed undue and most unprofessional excitement and it seemed as though he had quite forgotten himself and his official surroundings for he finished with voice querulous and upraised if paymaster scott came to grief he has nobody to blame but his pet and himself no more of that sir broke in the colonel angrily unless you are ready to prove your words give me two days and half a chance colonel button was the confident answer and ill do it v as captain sumter said the ladies had gone no further than the surgeons quarters that memorable saturday and with sumters full consent they had not gone even that far friday afternoon he had wired his protest to the father of miriam arnold and with startling emphasis the reply had come early saturday morning i repeat that i desire my daughter to return at once it angered this honest gentleman and soldier the tone was abrupt if telegrams can be said to have either tone or manner but that wire settled the matter miriam said she must obey and nothing short of doctor larrabee senior surgeon of the post had prevailed against her decision he himself had met the covered vehicle at his gate and with calm but forceful courtesy had insisted on their alighting your train is half a day late said he youll be wiser waiting here than at the frowsy station besides i wish to see this young woman again so saying he fairly lifted miss arnold from the furrobed depths of the dark interior and deposited her on the windswept path run in said he then similarly aided mrs and miss sumter their hand luggage and wraps came next and sumter drove away saying hed be back to them in abundant time for the train which he was though not until tuesday morning it was thursday before the road was open or the telegraph again at work less than half an hour the trio spent under the doctors hospitable roof before two oclock the wind had increased to a gale the snow was driving swift and hard i checked you just in time said he therell be no train either way this night and so by two oclock and just as the paymaster was driving away down the front of officers row mrs and miss sumter with miss arnold escorted by the two medical officers were struggling across the open space between the surgeons houses and the rear fence of the long line and presently entering the back gate at sumters it was an odd arrangement somewhat peculiar to frontier stations of the day the enclosure of fort cushing was diamondshaped the entrance gate was at the eastern apex the hospital and surgeons quarters stood on a line with this gate their front perpendicular to the long axis of the diamond their rear elevations therefore were not far from officers row from the front of sumters house around by way of the main gate to the doctors door the first to the left north of the post traderss was quite a walk from back door to back door however it was less than two hundred paces we are near neighbors doctor larrabee had been saying though my wife thinks it a long walk on a windy day i could reach you day or night almost in a minute as for schuchardt and bob lanier they could talk to each other out of their back windows this morning but you couldnt hear a bugle across there now is he sitting up mrs sumter inquired i thought from what we heard doctor schuchardt was trying to keep him in bed he wont stay was the brief answer i doubt if he slept a wink last night but schuchardt was even less communicative in answer to mrs sumters appeal that young but gifted physician had looked perturbed and finally answered mr laniers hurt is more mental than physical therefore the more difficult for me to reach youve seen him this morning twice mrs sumter and im going again as soon as weve seen you home and the moment they reached the rear stormdoor and their furhooded furmantled charges were safely within schuchardt excused himself miriam arnolds eyes following with a mute message that he felt if he did not hear but larrabee lingered stamping and shaking off the snow he followed into the warm and cozy army quarters cook and housemaid both looked astonished at the unexpected procession through the kitchen mrs captain snaffles chef like her mistress of hibernian extraction sprang up in some confusion from her chair and the cup of tay over which the three had been chatting as is the way of our domestics at such times and places she had reason to know the mistress of the house did not well approve of her or of these frequent visitations we shall probably dine at home said mrs sumter somewhat coldly to her own retainers and bestowing no notice upon their visitor there may be no train till tomorrow and with that led the way to the parlor almost immediately without waiting for the coming of the attendants with their handbags miss arnold fled upstairs followed at a glance from her mother by kate you see how wretchedly nervous she continues said mrs sumter how could we have let her go alone how should we let her go at all said larrabee indeed with a glance from the clouding window over the stormswept parade i repeat there will be no going anywhere for anybody just now has has she told you anything as yet mrs sumter was gradually emerging from her winter coat of furs for a moment she hesitated then closed the door leading back to the diningroom and returned to him as he stood there warming his hands at the great parlor stove then indispensable in our frontier homes his fine intellectual face in its silvergray fringe of crisp curling hair was full of sympathy and interest it was a face to confide in and all fort cushing swore by its senior surgeon doctor said she calling him by the title he best loved miriam says she believes it was all a mere delusion a dream she blames herself bitterly and begs us to think no more of it to forgive her but but and the kind dark eyes studied the gentle matronly face but oh why should i attempt to conceal it you know and we have reason to know she did see some one some one right there in her room some one who went out like a thief through the window and down the roof to the shed and away in spite of sentries or or anybody some one who was in there when they so unexpectedly got home you saw yes i saw the tracks in the fresh snow on the roof i could see them when i came hurrying over murmured the doctor captain sumter had the snow swept off before reveille what was the use of advertising it further mr barker and mr blake saw it too they hold it was some garrison sneakthief looking for jewelry yet not so much as a ring or a pin was touched only her desk did she tell of that no kate was the first to see it she flew upstairs when she heard the scream found miriam a senseless heap on the floor the desk open on the little table by the window the contents scattered the window up and somebody bounding and slipping away in the moonlight then she heard the challenge and scuffle outside and thought the guard had him and gave her whole attention to miriam until mr barker shouted from the lower hall oh yes cook and maggie both declare they were in their room but i believe they were next door at the snaffles i believe the back door was left open for whoever it was and nothing is missing nothing he was frightened off evidently but captain sumter wished to have it all kept quiet until he could confer with the detectives in town he has a theory of his own she had lowered her voice and now walked to the hall door as though listening for sounds from aloft whither kate and miriam had vanished miss kate has a level head presently spoke larrabee what does she say doctor that is what troubles me kate wont say anything its the first time she ever kept a secret from me and now tears of genuine distress were welling in mrs sumters eyes it was half after two and the wind was shrieking through the open space back of the line when doctor larrabee bending almost double managed to fight his way homeward schuchardt occupant of the adjoining set to his own had not yet returned at sumters gate the senior surgeon encountered the corporaloftheguard nearly blind and well nigh exhausted he had been sent round to relieve the men on post and bid them make the best of their way to the guardroom he was even then searching for number five who had most justifiably in fact involuntarily taken refuge as previously explained had he not been blown into the snaffles kitchen he might like barkers cow have been blown away you will probably find doctor schuchardt at lieutenant laniers quarters shouted larrabee at the corporal with kindly intent take number five in there and get thawed out tell him i think a nip of whiskey advisable under the circumstances and thus it happened that two stormbeaten soldiers presently shoved their way through laniers back gate and banged at the kitchen door nobody answering they presently entered passed through that deserted apartment and hearing voices further on the corporal ventured into the dark hallway leading through the little frame house now fairly quivering in the blast here he caught sight of two officers big powerful men in fur caps and canvas overcoats just pushing forth through the front door into the fierce blast without one was doctor schuchardt the other lieutenant ennis joint occupant with lanier of the tiny premises as corporal cassidy later expressed it he felt like id lost a bulging pot on an ace full he couldnt run after and beg them to come back yet he and his comrades were stiff from cold and almost breathless from exhaustion suddenly number fives carbine slipped from his frozen glove and fell with a crash on the kitchen floor the next instant the voice of lieutenant lanier was heard who the devils that corporal cassidy sir the post surgeon told me to bring number five in here and thaw him out wed find doctor schuchardt but the doctors just gone sir and but by this time mr lanier himself appeared in the hall his feet in warm woollen slippers his hands in bandages well i should say come right in here you two pull off your gloves and get out of those caps and things man alive this to number five why didnt you come before this is no time to stand on ceremony or stay on post either my strikers stormbound somewhere id help you if i could but i cant help yourselves now best you can rub and kick all you want to dance if itll warm you and all the time he was crowding them up about a roaring stove where presently he made them sit while he bustled about at a buffet in the adjoining room youll have to help me corporal presently he cried one hand cant mix and pour and lift theres sugar theres hot water on the stove theres glasses and heres whiskey mix it hot and down with it and so hospitably and heartily after the manner of old frontier days and men the young officer administered to his humbler comrades cheered and warmed and insisted on their eating with their second tumbler and when in course of half an hour the two stood before him glowing grateful and resuming their buffalo coats and fur caps and gloves honest cassidy tried to say his say d troops fellers never can brag enough about their lieutenant sir and though we dont belong to d troop it hasnt taken this to tell us why if ever the time comes when me or quinlan here can do the lieutenant a good turn hell hell know it after which they were gone rejoicing in their newfound strength yet reaching the nearest barracks only after severe struggle and later still the crowded suffocating guardroom where now some thirty men were huddled in a space intended for twenty at most where cassidy and number five were speedily telling to eager appreciative ears their unusual and rejoiceful experience well aint he the dandy lieutenant though queried casey of f troop and did he give you yer new cap too quinlan sure the wan you marched on wid had the mange cassidy snatched it from his comrades head mother av moses if he hasnt lifted the lieutenants but he broke off short one glance he had given the band within a sudden cloud swept over his face there was an instant of indecision then he whipped his own cap from his head and thrust it on quinlan im a liar said he its me own hes had then you wear two sizes jim cassidy an both different quinlan had pulled the headpiece down and was staring in at the soft lining whats this he began when the corporals fingers closed like a vise on his arm shut up quinlan the whiskeys gone to yer noddle come here and cassidy led him wondering to the barred corridor without and slammed the door behind them not a word do you whisper of this to any man pat quinlan said he never relaxing his grasp you heard what that cockney fitzroy was swearin to this morning sure youd never say the word to back that whelp an harm the lieutenant vi god helps those who help themselves quoth lieutenant blake on hearing of the incident at laniers quarters but god help those who help other fellows unless the old man likes it blake was but a casual at fort cushing at the moment summoned thither as a witness before a general courtmartial then in session but there was nothing casual in his friendship for bob lanier two years campaigning in arizona and one in wyoming had made these subalterns fast friends despite the difference of ten years in their ages and nearly twenty files in rank blake being one of the senior and lanier one of the junior lieutenants of the regiment blake was no pet of the post commander blake had a way of saying satirical things of seniors whom he did not fancy and button was one of these blake should have returned to his proper station the day after the dance but like everybody else so far as heard from he had been held by the storm and therefore happened to be in the clubroom at the store along toward eleven oclock on tuesday watching the distant deployment over the southeastward slopes of the barren upland fully half the mounted force of the garrison was on search for the paymasters outfit and with blake stood half a dozen infantry officers and two or three of the th to them on his way to rejoin his searching troop had entered big jim ennis laniers chum and classmate and ennis looked the picture of smothered wrath half an hour previous he had been seen trotting up from stables to the adjutants office summoned thither by the orderly of the commanding officer a few minutes later that same hardworked orderly had been seen sprinting to the surgeons quarters and doctor larrabee wrapped in furs and meditation obeyed the summons stood in the presence of an irate commander not more than fifty seconds came forth wrapped in gloom and took the short cut back of the majors house to his own bailiwick at the hospital about the only officer not to put in an appearance that morning out of doors afoot in saddle or adrift in snow was lieutenant lanier about the first officer button wished to see was bob and about the last was blake yet such was the freakishness of fate that the first man to hail him with illtimed jocularity was blake and the last of his officers whom he was destined that day to set eyes on was bob lanier whom schuchardt in answer to the commanders summons had earlier declared unfit to leave his quarters if it had not been for the startling announcement about the paymaster colonel button would have fought that matter out with the doctor then and there first however he had to send forth his mounted men by scores in search of the missing officer and party this done he had once more summoned schuchardt then he sent for ennis and had what they termed a red hot row in his exasperated frame of mind button had been ready to believe almost any story at the expense of lanier and such is the perversity of human nature it added to rather than diminished his wrath that his revered senior surgeon should promptly corroborate the statements of both schuchardt and ennis and further assume personal and entire responsibility for the episode of saturday afternoon in laniers quarters that episode had started many a tongue and one of buttons henchmen thinking to win favor at the fountainhead by mention of new iniquity on the part of the culprit had deftly enlarged upon it snaffle of course was the fellow at fault and he justified it on the plea that lanier was demoralizing two men of his troop the story he told was that lanier had been carousing at his quarters with certain enlisted members of the guard when told of it button was furious so much so that for the time he forgot about sumter and the ladies of the sumter household and the north dormer window of sumters quarters reported stove in by the storm nor had sumter himself much time for domestic duties before the order came for him and his troop to turn out to aid in the search he found the family fairly tranquil under the circumstances he had sent a messenger galloping out from town to assure his wife of his safety when tuesdays dawn showed the storm sufficiently abated a devious course the rider took for the road was blocked in a dozen places and every ravine and hollow was packed to the brim with snow but he bore glad tidings and banished all anxiety on account of the husband and father their anxieties now were mainly for miriam their guest mrs sumter had not half finished what she had to say concerning miriam when the summons came that called the captain forth to join the searching squadron but he had heard enough to increase the anxiety in his fine soldierly face he went up with mrs sumter and looked critically over the damage to the window in what had been miriams room she had moved per force to the front to katherines room saturday night for toward sunset the stormsash was torn out of the north dormer and the window blew in with a crash by dark the room was bank full of snow that sergeant kennedy and a brace of loyal troopers had been shovelling out since seven that tuesday morning without making any great addition to the huge drifts at the back front flank and rear most of the houses along the line were packed solidly to the attic windows on several the boys and girls were already coasting from the peak of the roof down over the back yards sheds and fences and out toward larrabees halfsubmerged hospital it was easy to see how and why the stormsash had failed to withstand the buffeting in his frantic haste and panicky flight the intruder of friday night had wrenched a hinge from its fastening the sash had sagged at the windward end and the rest was easy for rude boreas that sash is probably somewhere down in the back yard sergeant sumter quietly remarked to faithful kennedy its under fifteen feet of snow but when it comes to tunnelling look after it see that it isnt injured and call me as soon as you find it mrs sumter looked quickly at her lord she well knew the reason of his instructions did you show that scrap of lining she asked a moment later as they stood alone before the parlor fire they have it was the answer i expect two of them out any moment and then had come the sudden summons to turn out and with only brief greeting to his daughter and a hurried kiss and caress captain sumter had mounted and spurred away it must have been after twelve for orderly call and mess had sounded in front of the adjutants office when one of the hospital attendants came floundering up the row from laniers and made his way to sumters door a little note in his hand he would wait he said for an answer and the maid bade him step inside while she ran upstairs mrs sumter answered her knock at the door of miss kates room into which the damsels were now doubled to the disappointment of that somewhat volatile domestic mrs sumter closed the portal before proceeding to open the missive but her announcement from mr lanier caused miriam arnold to sit bolt upright dear mrs sumter it read ive been living since saturday mainly on your kindness and that delicious fruit it was more than good of you to take such care of your incarcerated sub and im ashamed to have sent no earlier thanks but weve been banked in until this morning and that rascal striker of ours is missing he hasnt been about the house since friday night like barkers cow he may have blown away i reckon theyll find him her and the paymasters outfit snowed under somewhere down toward nebraska safe but possibly starving schuchardt has gone with the command so has ennis and im all alone with nothing to read if you have anything moral instructive and guaranteed to soften the unrepentant sinners heart something i could read with profit as well as pleasure dont send it but tell me how you all stood the storm and how you are it is so hard to get anything but admonition out of shoe and dad is now more unreliable than ever i hope miss arnold is entirely recovered yours most sincerely r r lanier the last thing a man mentions in a note is the first thing he wants answered said mrs sumter sagely what shall i tell him for you miriam tell me what is to be done to him was the sole reply as the girl settled back dejectedly upon the pillows ive tried to child answered her hostess kindly patiently there isnt a court in the army that would sentence him to more than a brief confinement to limits and reprimand yet mrs sumter spoke with much less confidence than on saturday had not her husband had to tell her his application for leave was withdrawn and why had not doctor larrabee admitted to her that the colonel spoke of misdeeds far more serious for which lanier must suffer was there not indeed a story in circulation mainly in the snaffle set of a twodays escapade when the regiment camped near frayne and then a financial transaction in which lanier had been involved something growing out of an affair up on the yellowstone something including that young civilian friend of his the collegian turned cowboy mr watson lowndes even as she strove to assure miss arnold for the twentieth time that a military arrest was far more portentious in sound than in effect something in kates determined silence and miriams insistence added to the effect of these rumors could it be that the boy had confided to the daughter hitherto his stanch friend and ally that which he dare not confide to her his captains wife could this account for the fact that though it was impossible to conceal his love for miriam he never yet had owned it to her to her to whom it was now obvious that the avowal would mean so much so very much then another thing weighed heavily upon the brave heart of this loving friend and mother never had she known her child to be so silent so strange as now ever since friday night she seemed to avoid all mention of the affair to shrink from the subject she who had ever been frankness itself she who had never had a thought the mother did not share she had become fitful and nervous she seemed oppressed with some secret in the long hours of their enforced confinement with the lamps burning on the groundfloor by day as well as by night mrs sumter had pondered much over the result of her husbands investigations although miriams desk was open and its contents lay scattered on the table nothing was missing even to the packet of tenand twentydollar greenbacks in its secret drawer if robbery had been the object of the intruder he had neglected his opportunity or else been frightened off in time if robbery was not his object then what could it have been the house was deserted at the moment of his entrance that was now settled for first the cook and then maggie had owned to having run over to mrs snaffles kitchen for a moment and the probability was they stayed the best part of the evening the lights had been left turned low in the upper and lower halls in the kitchen and the captains den army doors were seldom locked or bolted any one could enter front or rear a marauder if such he was in this instance might have been there from tattoo at until discovered some two hours later and been there undisturbed but why should the situation so strangely affect her daughter could it be that she too cared for bob lanier the thought for the moment made the mothers heart stand still she was writing her reply to his note when maggie again appeared two gentlemen to see the captain mum and mrs sumter hurriedly closed the note and went belowstairs to meet them she knew well who they were and why they had come a branch office of the rocky mountain detective agency had been maintained long months at the great and growing railway station they had been summoned by her husband and that was enough yet she shrank from meeting them shrank from the thought of the questioning that must ensue they might ask to speak with kate even with miriam but they did not they asked to be shown the room with the stormbattered dormer by this time emptied of its load of snow they asked to see miriams desk yes the lock had been forced and by a big knife they begged that mrs sumter would not mention that to any one but the captain yet awhile they were confident he would soon return they smiled at the idea of the paymaster being held up and robbed in broad daylight by any gang in their neighborhood they admitted that many questionable characters were in town there always were toward the holidays and just now of course the town was overcrowded three big trains still stranded there while they were yet at their work there came sounds of stamping feet at the front door and in came sumter stiff from cold but brimful of energy found scott and his clerk at least he cried most dead and half frozen the drivers gone i fear he was blown or pitched off the mules ran away before the gale those inside the ambulance were helpless two dropped off behind and are lost the thing finally capsized and went to pieces and they managed to reach a little cattle shack two miles south of town theyve found laniers striker too whats left of him by this time kate had come downstairs and with pallid face was listening dumbly to her fathers words she seemed hardly to heed the presence of the strangers not until the captain had emerged from his furs and stood robust and ruddy yet a little short of breath did she lay her hand upon his arm and ask her question have they found rawdon rawdon no not a sign of him anywhere is that the young fellow that those sergeants have been hunting for asked one of the detectives we managed to find out about him he was in town early as three oclock friday and he left on number six that night do you mean to tell me said sumter gazing blankly at the speaker that he wasnt out here when this happened not unless he had wings that train leaves at whereupon kate sumter slowly withdrew her hand then turned away vii another day went by major scott and his clerk under larrabees skilful touch were gradually regaining strength and beginning to answer questions at first their senses seemed dulled as though they could not shake off the frost that benumbed them at first they could tell little of the cause of the mishap the ambulance was curtained in even at the rear through which the two scared troopers had managed to slip to their doom not until the snows melted in the spring and the contents of the ravines should be revealed was it likely they would be heard of again the railway was still blocked the wires were still down fort cushing stood isolated from the outer world and no less than five of its garrison were absent and unaccounted for the two men detailed to drive in with the paymaster two bacchanalians who being in town when the storm broke had dared each other to face the gale and tramp out and finally a young trooper named cary who had arrived with the same recruit squad that brought them rawdon and had been on terms of friendship if not indeed of intimacy with him they had been together that very friday afternoon in addition whereabouts unknown was sergeant fitzroy of snaffles troop absent with leave said the morning report acting under the verbal instructions of the commanding officer said his captain along toward dusk on tuesday others of the searching squadron sent afar down the valley had come back reporting that the ambulance mules were found huddled together half starved and still half harnessed in a log shack or shelter to which their instinct had guided them after their heels had made chopsticks of the running gear the ambulance body was snowed under somewhere and nowhere in sight the driver a civilian employed in the quartermasters department had totally disappeared scott the paymaster thomas his clerk and rafferty laniers soldier servant or striker as then called were still half dazed rafferty indeed so much dazed that no coherent words had yet escaped him one more unfortunate the driver of fosters sleigh was in trouble not until two hours after the dance had he turned up with the missing equipage a cockandbull story and a case of what the corporal called jag he swore that having got chilled through waiting he just thought to get one hot whiskey at the store sentry number six said hed mind the team while the driver went in and the next thing he knew theyd rund away hell for leather and he their driver had to follow two miles to flints ranch close to town where he might have taken a nip or two more it was his first offense and foster forgave it should be remarked however that number six declared that it was not he with whom the driver left the sleigh but two fellers ie troopers who happened to be near the store however that did not seem much to matter at the time and fort cushing was in unhappy frame of mind colonel button was in most inhospitable mood and chafing because he could not communicate with the general commanding the department mrs button was confined to the house and denied to all but one or two intimates bob lanier was still in close arrest no man could say what might be the result for barker the adjutant declared he knew no more than they the old man had something up his sleeve several somethings against him but was confiding in no one for he and stannard were at odds over the matter he and sumter were practically estranged because of it and for the first time in regimental history button seemed to be giving all his attention to snaffle and men of his stamp and set they were not more than three or four in number they had been rather tolerated than sought in the past but now the colonel seemed to have use for them alone and there was sorrow and estrangement at sumters never before as mrs sumter declared had katherine ever had a secret from her mother now there was a matter upon which it seemed she could not talk moreover miriam arnold was affected in precisely the same way she shrank from all mention of that mysterious affair of friday night not only were they unable to speak of it to mrs sumter they avoided it among themselves it was now wednesday and there had been a procession of callers to inquire for miss arnold the girls felt that they must dress and come down and face them are you sure you feel equal to it miriam was mrs sumters anxious question i am sure i do not was the weary answer but all the same i must and being a girl of pluck and much ashamed of the breakdown of friday and saturday miss arnold made her effort and did remarkably well so long as people refrained from prodding her about her strange adventure the alleged details of which in exaggerated form were garrison property by this time there could be no doubt said nine out of ten of the soldiery it was the work of some sneakthief in uniform in all probability that young swell rawdon who was gone but among a certain select few still another theory obtained and wednesday night when sergeant fitzroy returned to the post and asked to see the colonel that officer who was at dinner sent answer that he would be at the office at eight oclock and further sent word to captain snaffle to be there at the same hour a spell of sharp cold had followed the blizzard the skies were dazzling at night with the radiance and sparkle of the stars the young people of the garrison were out in force rejoicing in the snow sports the moonlight the exhilarating air the men had made some famous slides over at the bluffs and the children along the officers lines were playing hide and seek about the drifts and tunnels at the northward end of the parade they gathered in force about the office to cheer the colonel as he came forth from a long conference which left him so absorbed he hardly noticed their gleeful salute they pelted two prime favorites who followed with drooping head and woebegone visage and never once responded to the fun and the youngsters asked one another what on earth could have happened to cassidy and quinlan who were always so ready to frolic with them then captain sumter had been sent for and was admitted to a fiveminute talk with the colonel at his quarters and came away with grave and troubled face to a tenminutes conference with his gentle wife that left her sorely worried and distressed ask kate he said as once more he set forth into the night ive got to tramp and think this over before i do anything further and at that moment kate and miriam had gone in to talk awhile with mrs stannard it was best they should not stay home subject to incessant interview it was just about quarter of nine the lights at the office were still burning for the colonel had intimated that he might be back barker was bending over some of the post papers and reports at his desk and wondering why on earth the colonel should be colloguing with snaffle crane sergeant fitzroy and sending for cassidy and quinlan that was a queer outfit of snaffles at best it seemed odd that the most pronounced britisher in barracks outside of the band should be a sergeant in the troop commanded by the nearest thing to an irishman among the captains true fitzroy as stable sergeant was quite independent and being very ambitious and zealous had attracted the attention of other captains to wit canker and curbit rival troop leaders who each at one time or other had offered to make fitzroy first sergeant if he would transfer but fitzroy preferred to stay where he was in c and it was easier to suggest than it was to assert the real reason barker was busy with these reflections when the colonel once more entered and began pacing moodily up and down the room the adjutant rose but at a signal resumed his seat and waited he was as he whimsically described himself a relic of the previous administration in those days officers might serve long years on the staff and never know an hour of company duty barker had been in the adjutants office under three different regimental commanders and as etiquette required had tendered his resignation to button on that officers promotion to the colonelcy button as promptly and courteously replied that he hoped lieutenant barker would consent to serve as righthand man until he reached his captaincy which could not be very far off but already button was repenting barker is too much wedded to the old order of things said he barker has his likes and dislikes a weakness the colonel denied to himself and barkers a little inclined to imagine that nobody can run a regiment as atherton did for which at last there was this much foundation that barker thought if he did not say that atherton ran it much better than button ever could hope to and button instinctively knew and infinitely resented it it must be owned of button that he hated the mere mention of his predecessors name methods and opinions it was unlucky indeed perhaps that the views of one of the former colonels had been recorded in black and white as follows in my opinion lieutenant lanier is one of the finest young officers in the cavalry full fifteen minutes the colonel went striding up and down the long apartment used for office assembly and schoolroom once in a while he would turn across the hall and into barkers smaller room pause as though half minded to speak then turn out again twice he went to the door looking over across the glistening heaps and drifts and letting in a lot of cold air twice he muttered something about its taking snaffle and his sergeant an unusually long time to do a simple thing and at last as the trumpeters were heard with much stamping of feet and blowing of hands gathering for the oldtime nightly walk around that preceded tattoo rollcall button abruptly turned on his adjutant and said barker how long have you known mr lanier ever since he joined sir and you knew him in his cadet days as an instructor knows a cadet yes sir and you told me you never heard of his writing to newspapers never sir answered barker rising from his chair and facing his commander and i repeat that i believe it impossible for him to have had anything to do with those inflammatory articles about the campaign you consider him absolutely square above a lie or a trick of any kind barker faltered just one minute what did the colonel mean by a trick mischief there had been once or twice tricks had been played and one only this last summer during the campaign a trick too that if truth were told lanier should have known about at least it had been played for his benefit and had pulled the wool over the colonels eyes i consider him as square a man as i know and utterly above a lie of any kind was the final answer and yet you hesitate you know or have heard rumors said button suspiciously i have heard rumors and slanders colonel button was barkers probably injudicious reply for he closed with and so many of them that i disbelieve nine out of ten well here said button impulsively here are you and stannard and sumter three of the old liners as you are called in your respective grades and i see plainly enough you three and god knows how many more are tacitly condemning my attitude toward lanier you think if you dont say that i have treated him with harshness and injustice have listened solely to his accusers and enemies now ive had enough of this there is nothing that requires a commander to show his hand to his subordinates but as matters stand in this regiment oh come in major stannard i sent for you purposely and sumter as well to meet me here at tattoo and at the moment as the united force of field musicians began the stirring strains of the old cavalry curfew call the march of the bear the two seniors solemnly entered the presence removing their fur caps as they bowed to the commander as i was saying to barker as matters stand in this regiment some half a dozen at least of the men referred to as its representative officers are apparently resentful of my arrest of lieutenant lanier and attribute my course to pique because he saw fit to show himself at the hop i declined to permit him as officeroftheguard to attend you think possibly that because men like captain snaffle lieutenant crane and one or two of that set have been in consultation with me the matters at issue are beneath your notice here the three assailed officers exchanged glances but said not a word in protest for the colonel went impulsively on they at least are loyal to their commander and to the best interests of the regiment now i mean to show you mr barker said he impressively go to lieutenant lanier and say that i desire his presence here at once and barker took his cap and cape and departure without a word down the line in the moonlight the snow heaps were sparkling as though crusted with brilliants the black square of the field music was trudging out across an acre of the parade swept clean by the recent gale the children in laughing little groups were returning from their hour at the slide and here and there from the deep cut or tunnel in front of each officers doorway dark muffled figures were emerging and striding away toward the barracks subalterns en route to the companies to supervise rollcall just as barker neared stannards at the head of the row two cloaked and hooded forms hurried forth and barker almost collided with them oh good evening miss kate good evening miss arnold was his embarrassed greeting then with attempt at jocularity for which he later could have kicked himself im just in time to see you home and head off hobgoblins and hoboes no wonder the two walked the faster and gave but perfunctory replies indeed i beg pardon he blundered on im just bound for laniers any message you might say we wish him speedy deliverance answered kate sumter with unlookedfor spirit and effect for the adjutant in dismay at his own awkwardness darted swiftly ahead shouting hold on steve to an officer with whom he would rather not have wasted a moments time indeed poor barker was sore distressed he could not help hearing scraps of the talk that had passed at the office between the colonel snaffle crane and certain summoned enlisted men fitzroy cassidy and quinlan among them even that poor devil who had been on duty friday night as sentry on number five had been marched into the awful presence of the commanding officer and ordered to tell who gave him the whiskey that had been his undoing even promising immunity from punishment but he was irish and true to his faith and his friends even they who had betrayed him and hed die first he said never would he sphlit on the best feller in the foort and barker had heard many things that pointed to lanier so many that his heart seemed to stop as he entered the door and sank at sight of the trouble in the face of the young soldier sitting there in conference with ennis and doctor schuchardt silently lanier heard the summons there was no reason why he should not go said the doctor the air will do you good he added and well be here when you come back five minutes sufficed to reset the bandages and get him into his furs ten minutes more and for the first time since friday evening the accused officer stood in the presence of his colonel with three tried and trusted comrades near to see him through mr lanier said button presently i have sent for you in deference to the sentiment in your behalf entertained by officers of such standing in the army as these gentlemen who are here present i am free to say that i have had grave reasons for forming a most unfavorable opinion of your conduct even of your character it has been my intention to forward charges of a serious nature against you and to urge your trial by general courtmartial but such is my regard for these gentlemen and the element they represent that i stand ready to abandon my views and adopt theirs on your simple word can i say more there was a moment of silence then lanier spoke it depends sir i think upon what you wish me to answer button colored turning to his desk he took from an envelope several newspaper clippings you know what these are doubtless mr lanier do you care to say what part you took in their preparation i am glad to say i took no part was the answer no part at all and you do not even know the author laniers dark eyes never swerved from their gaze i took no part sir i did not say i do not wish to say that i do not know the author was the calm reply then you admit or permit me to infer that you know him a member of this command for no one else knew the facts and moreover that you shield him i am shielding no man colonel button i would not shield a member of this command who wrote such wrong of it yet you know the author and you will not tell what little i know came in such a way that i cannot tell was the resolute answer buttons forehead furrowed deep and his voice trembled with anger enough said or refused to be said on that head we will go to the next who personated you the night you left your troop at laramie and went contrary to orders to that frolic at the post a look of amaze came into the young officers face the answer came slowly painfully i took part in no frolic sir i went contrary to an order that had held good while we were out on the campaign but that we did not suppose was binding there i went to the post that night to help a fr a man who who needed money for an immediate journey no one personated me to my knowledge i have the written report of the officeroftheday whom i ordered to inspect your tent that you were there asleep at eleven pm subsequently i learned that you were away from taps until nearly reveille you could have heard that from me sir and why i was gone if need be and now it was plain that mr lanier was growing angry this was a point gained by the colonel he tried for another officers who make comrades and intimates of enlisted men take chances that colonel button interposed lanier hotly i protest protest you may but listen you shall was the instant rejoinder it is well known you interfered with a noncommissioned officer in the proper discharge of his duty that was last june and it was in behalf of that young man rawdon it is well known that you were hobnobbing with other enlisted men here and gave them drink and food in your quarters on more than one occasion it is well known you lent civilian clothing to your protйgй for his latest escapade colonel button gentlemen cried lanier this is beyond all right indeed stannard and sumter were on their feet in expostulation but the colonels blood was up bang went his bell and the orderly fairly jumped into the room call sergeant fitzroy said he and in another moment fitzroy stood before them a civilian coat and waistcoat hanging on his arm briefly now sergeant where did you get those demanded button from the room that trooper rawdon occupied in town sir its the suit he wore about town last friday and so saying he held them forth lanier slowly took the coat astonishment in his eyes glanced at the tag inside the collar bearing the name of his own new york tailor for a moment he searched it within and without then handed it quietly back it is enough like mine to deceive anybody but the owner said he do you mean to tell me began button indignantly that this is not mine interposed lanier yes sir and that one very like it will be found in my closet at home mr barker will go with you and you will resume your confinement in arrest and button in his anger was lashing himself to language his hearers never forgot and that some could hardly even long months after forgive in my time as a young officer nothing tempted one of our members to violate an arrest but you pale as death lanier faced him surely sir a cry for help that i thought might mean fire there was no cry for help interrupted the colonel there was no sign of fire even if there had been it should mean nothing to a man of honor when ordered in arrest that is the only creed of a gentleman and then with the lone trumpet of the musician of the guard wailing its goodnight to the garrison the sweet solemn strain of taps the adjutant led his stunned and silent comrade home viii ennis and schuchardt were still there and started at sight of laniers white face without a word he led on to an inner room where ennis sprang to his side help me off with these he said and bring a lamp come upstairs barker and wondering both the others followed there were but two sleeping rooms aloft in the little bachelor set ennis had the one facing the parade laniers looked out upon the hospital and surgeons quarters at the back into this room marched bob lanier and threw open the door of the single closet wherein was hanging uniform and civilian garb in some profusion ennis held the lamp on high and with his free hand lanier began throwing out the contents a new uniform dress coat an older one that had done duty for the three previous years two sack coats or blouses the police officers overcoat of the day several pairs of blue trousers with the broad stripe of the cavalry and these as they came were flung on the bed by barker and shoe then appeared a suit of evening clothes carefully handled then a brown business suit of tweeds then a light drab overcoat and then the closet was well nigh empty and lanier faced them with the simple words its gone whats gone demanded ennis why that dark gray mixture sack suit i brought from leave last year it always hung way back in here who wants it now id like to know demanded ennis our colonel who accuses me of costuming rawdon for his getaway and the three friends looked at each in something like consternation then barker spoke its only fair to the colonel to tell the rest bob rawdons box that he left for safe keeping with a friend in town had not only the suit you saw at the office but a new fur cap with your name in it there were other things that looked queer the day of the storm quinlan came over to the guardhouse after his visit here wearing a new cap instead of his old one and cassidy swooped on it thinking it yours for it was here he got it and the name in that cap was rawdon it leaked out somehow fitzroy hunted the story down the name was burnt out when cassidy brought it back to me said lanier slowly he claimed that in lighting his pipe poor cassidy lied every way he could think of to save you said barker ruefully its the young cad you befriended and helped along thats tricked you in the end and youre not the only man im afraid roped rafferty in i suppose said schuchardt while a light of superior wisdom stole slowly over the face of lieutenant ennis rafferty doubtless to the extent of bribing or wheedling him out of bobs new cits but those were not mine that fitzroy had burst in lanier of course not hes left you a worn suit in place of the new whered he steal that one i wonder there isnt another officer of your size and build at the post but here ive got to go back and report and my report will be in these words mr lanier has been robbed too and barker made for the stairs one moment called ennis you said bob wasnt the only man this fellow had tricked do you mean he paused suggestively i mean yes that theres more than one man and theres at least one poor girl in the garrison to mourn that fellows loss and be d to him and with that barker was gone button listened to his adjutants report with something almost like a sneer stannard and sumter heard it with grave faces but without a word snaffle who had drifted in sniggered with obvious triumph gentlemen said the colonel you have not heard the half of what i know and every day brings something new this comes in from laramie today brought with the mail that lay over at the chugwater during the storm read that stannard and stannard took the paper and glanced over it blinked his eyes sniffed and said ive heard about that case and ill take laniers story any day against that fellows affidavit major stannard said button severely you are speaking contemptuously of your superior officer colonel button answered stannard with high held head but with firm hand on his temper i am speaking contemptuously of my superior officers informant not of the commanding officer of fort laramie if you care to look you will see that he quotes not asserts that this money was advanced to mr lowndes on mr laniers statement that the young man was summoned home by the serious illness of his mother and that he mr lanier would be responsible for the transaction mr lowndes has never repaid it and mr lanier when appealed to four weeks since not only refused to make it good but abused and cursed me for simply asking for what was my own now sir concluded stannard i havent sought to learn the facts in the case but ill bet ten dollars to ten cents you have yet to hear them very good gentlemen answered button rising in obvious chagrin it is quite evident in your opinion mr lanier is a persecuted saint and i am an abandoned sinner but just as soon as i can reach omaha this case shall be laid before a general courtmartial and meanwhile i waste no more words defending my actions whereupon with formal goodnight sir from stannard and sumter and a grumpy dismissal from the indignant commander the illstarred conference broke up snaffle pouring balm into buttons ready ear as he saw him home went in and drank his health at the wellstocked sideboard and then started straightway across the parade to his troop quarters and late as it was called for his first sergeant the men were mostly in bed as they should be at such an hour but there had been an informal dance and many of the sergeants were still at the hop room beyond this brightly lighted building and about in the rear of the infantry barracks at the westward end was the slide into the creek valley whereat so many of the officers children had been coasting early in the evening and where now nearly eleven oclock half a hundred young people of both sexes wives and daughters of quartermasters employees and of the elder sergeants attended by their gallants from the garrison were having a merry time of it the moon shone in brilliance the night air frosty and still was full of exhilaration the officeroftheguard merely cautioning the revellers to control their impulse to shout had gone on his way with implied permission to keep up the fun and presently other officers appeared upon the brow of the bluff interested observers one of them the junior medical officer of the post was known to all for his duty it was to attend the families of the soldiery resident in the little village of their own just west of the quartermasters corral and sheltered by the long line of bluffs from the northerly gale deep in snowdrifts lay the snug little cabins cottages and shacks wherein dwelt these blithehearted folk many of the girls as pretty and to the full as coquettish as their sisters of the official circle in the big fort enclosure above still farther to the west lay three little houses on the level bench by the swiftrunning stream the homes of the corralmaster the wagonmaster and the veterinarian civilians all as then ordained yet men who had lived their lives with the army on the frontier and it was one of these the veterinary surgeon a grayhaired man of nearly sixty who presently came toiling up the hillside touched his fur cap front in salutation to tall lieutenant ennis and begged leave to speak a moment with doctor schuchardt whom he led slowly away looking gravely after them and pondering many things in mind ennis none the less had attentive ear for the chatter and gossip of a neighboring group that had suspended their sledding for the moment and were curiously watching the pair theres no more the matter wid dora mayhew than there is wid me cept one said a redcheeked maid of laundress row to the eager group about her shes been daft about that young dude rawdon ever since he came last spring to frayne yes an deef to cockney fitz laughed another and ennis turning quickly noted the group four young noncommissioned officers and three of the garrison girls all of them toying with the name of good old mayhews bonny daughter she whom that veteran english horseman had taught and guarded with such jealous care to the end that jealousy burned in the hearts of a dozen other girls less favored in face or fortune well had ennis known of sergeant fitzroys aspirations few in the regiment had not and few there were who did not know that in spite of mayhews avowed dislike for him the girl had for a time encouraged it may have been only to pique the others for fitzroy was clever welltodo a rising man in the service indeed one who had money in the bank and men in his toils said elder women in the quarters then in april to fort frayne had come this handsome young fellow rawdon with better looks better manners and even as it seemed better money for rawdon was lavish where fitzroy was near and the favor of the young girl who had toyed with the englishman turned from him to this unknown then the whole command went forth to war and to a summer of sharp work then with the late october headquarters band and six troops had been transferred from frayne to cushing close in to civilization then had come fitzroys new opportunity with rawdon left at frayne then had come rawdon himself then the night of mystery then the day of the storm and when the skies above were clear again rawdon was gone no man knew whither leaving a trail of suspicion accusation and a weeping wellnigh desperate girl behind and in this web of intrigue and mystery bob lanier had become deeply even dangerously involved ennis was sorely worried it was to see mayhew the two friends had come and lo mayhew had met them on the way himself in trouble and perplexity where did you say she was now ennis heard the doctor ask as they rejoined him she went to speak with mrs stannard but said ladies were there so she came back a while ago i could hear her crying in her room before she went the second time and poor mayhews head was drooping and you wish me to see her tonight if youd be so good doctor shell soon be home i was going over in search of her now wait said ennis listen there was a flurry among the revellers a few rods away two men had run toward the corner of the nearest barrack looming black against the northward sky others could be seen hurrying after them then could it be yes sharp and clear came the sound of a shot from away over toward the hospital another nearer another still nearer and distant shouts and then the blare of the trumpet come on its fire said ennis and sprang in pursuit of the leaders shoe and mayhew following its fire went up the cry along the hillside fire echoed the nearest sentry letting fly the load in his rifle fire shouted the few wakeful fellows in barracks tumbling instantly every man from his bunk to his boots and into his ready clothes fire yelled the sergeantoftheguard as he tore in among his sleeping comrades fire echoed the cry from barrack to barrack as the men poured forth into the night and then as ennis rounded the corner and came in full view of the wide open parade with the long line of quarters beyond his heart leaped for his throat in wild dismay my god lieutenant its your house panted a racing trooper my god and bobs all alone sobbed ennis as he sped through the snow for already from the front dormer and from the lower windows the flames were mounting high in the trail of a black volume of smoke and over the crackle and roar of the fire the rush and clamor of men the thrilling alarum of echoing bugle and trumpet there rose on the night air the scream of a girl imploring instant aid and this time at least there could be no doubt for the cry was save him save him of the minutes that followed no man could give collected account all ennis saw as he came staggering round to the rear of the flaming furnace that once was a house was a wildeyed girl being led away by a group of sympathetic women and a little group of men bundling a slender yet vigorously protesting form in a snow drift where one or two others were being rolled and buffeted while others still with a keening irishman in their grasp were lugging him back to hospital while corporal cassidy with his hair singed close to his head his face and hands seared and his clothing soaked smoking and a general wreck was striving to evade his handlers and stand attention to the colonel who for his part was bending over bob lanier just emerging from his third involuntary plunge in the drifts and sputtering objurgations on his wouldbe benefactors in gods name lanier almost wailed the colonel as at last that young gentleman likewise singed and scorched and soaked and dripping yet preternaturally cool for one just out of a blazing hell found his feet and faced his commander in gods name why didnt you jump when they told you there was nothing but snowdrifts below there was a colonel coming said bob with a grin of mingled anguish and satisfaction who held that sort of thing to be breach of arrest ix few men slept the rest of the night for talking over the stirring scenes of that spectacular fire indeed there had been a strenuous fight to keep it from spreading and the graysons quarters next door were badly scorched and the graysons woefully scared before the little bachelor hall had burned itself out big jim ennis had lost pretty much everything he owned except what he had on lanier was not much better off as to the origin of the fire bob merely said that he had turned the lights low in the sittingroom and obedient to shoes orders had gone up to his roost too wrathful and amazed over what had occurred even to think of sleep to think in fact of anything but the colonels words so absorbed was he as he slowly undressed he never noted the sounds from below until his room of a sudden seemed filled with smoke and throwing open the door he was amazed to find the hallway ablaze the stairs impassable running to his dormer window he yelled fire at the top of his voice sentry number five heard and came running down along the back fence saw the peril let drive a shot and gave the yell that roused every one at the hospital poor rafferty half crazed half dazed and by no means half dressed coming leaping along among the first and there at his back window choking with smoke and tossing out clothing and other belongings stood mr lanier some men went searching for ladders up the line of back yards the post hook and ladder truck being of course on the far side of the garrison there being no extension and sheds to this little box as to the larger quarters up the line other men began shouting and lieutenant grayson imploring mr lanier to jump for already the flames had burst through the windows below then came the episode the regiment laughed over swore over talked over many a long year thereafter to graysons appeal bobs only answer was a calm and deliberate give my compliments to the colonel will you and tell him that my quarters being all ablaze id like an extension of arrest then sumter and stannard came in tumultuous and ordered him down and blake and curbit and the rest of the card party came tearing after them and berated him for an absurdity and implored him not to be an ass and then a bright tongue of flame licked in through the transom behind him and the door panels burst from the heat and all the room at his back suddenly blazed with fire and then went up the cry from that agonized girl at sound of which lanier started and strove to climb to the little windowsill with a lurid sheet lapping down about his head and then a brace of young irishmen cassidy foremost came scrambling up a human pyramid smoking and singeing below them they reached the blazing eaves and burst through the fringe of flame dragging bob forth and on to the edge and then tottered all together into that blessed mound of snow beneath fast melting in the glare of that fiery furnace then came the commander and the swift running soldiers and all the antiquated fire apparatus and most of the families soon the hooks were locked in the blazing framework and speedily the little bachelor den was torn into hissing and smoking fragments meantime lanier and cassidy blake horton and nearly a dozen daring fellows who had risked their skins to save their lieutenant had been led over to hospital to be cooled off and lotioned and bandaged and variously put to bed and when at last not a spark could be found in the black unsightly ruins and even they had been buried under bushels of snow the colonel and his menatarms went back to quarters and many of the officers to the store to talk it all over especially what bobby had said to button and thus were we brought to the morning of thursday the sixth since the eventful night when miriam arnolds shriek had alarmed the garrison miriam whose voice had now been heard a second time upraised in frantic dread and appeal but this time for the young soldier who on the previous friday night forgetful of his arrest had rushed forth at her cry but this night had to be dragged miriam who now lay sick from maidenly shame that in one wild appeal to save her lover she had so betrayed herself with thursday noon came resumption of telegraphic communication and the longstalled railway trains from east and west with thursday afternoon came wires from arnold the father begging to know had his daughter started and back went the electric message that she neither had nor could nor would for a week full details by post with thursday evening came stacks of belated letters with whole bales of newspapers said the stage driver to follow and with thursday midnight long after every one had gone to bed there came a tapping at major stannards storm door and presently a fumbling at the bell knob a clanging of the bell what now thought the sleepy major as he scuttled downstairs in slippers and dressinggown whos there he growled as he unbolted the door that fire down the line had made people nervous there was no saying how it started it is mayhew sir said a solemn voice ive come not hoping only praying i may find my daughter here good god said stannard come in and led forthwith his aged and trembling comrade within doors seated him by the still glowing stove in the front room and struck a light in less than a minute mrs stannard too had joined them her kind blue eyes filled with tender pity and sorrow she at least was not entirely unprepared poor motherless dora had no lack of friendly counsel and fond womanly sympathy when once she could be brought to lay her burden there if only she had earlier sought that wise and winsome monitor but mrs stannard had not been at frayne in the early summer not until the major was assigned to station at cushing had the good wife joined him and meanwhile there had been no hand to guide only a fond and passionate young heart and now with his gray hairs bowed in sorrow to the dust poor mayhew had come to tell his piteous tale ever since young rawdon had gone with the paymaster she had been fitful and nervous ever since their coming to cushing four weeks agone she had been watching waiting listening often weeping and when letters came for her with the postmark of fetterman or laramie red cloud or the cantonment in the hills he could not but note her feverish eagerness and her instant escape to her own room to read her treasure alone oh yes he knew they must be from rawdon he had liked the lad knew there was good stuff in him and he could not bear that fellow fitzroy who was a military loan shark a man who fattened on the needs or weaknesses of his comrades he hated to think of his bonny girls losing her heart to fitzroy he owned he rather welcomed rawdons advances and rejoiced that she too seemed to prefer him but god he had never looked for this oh where had she gone and why he had found her at home and in tears after the fire all morning long she had been in an agony of nervousness then that afternoon some time somehow she got a message or letter and then kissing him and saying she would be better in bed had gone to her room but not to sleep at eleven oclock old chloes sobbing aroused him he found it all deserted dora had disappeared leaving not one word to comfort him they lost no time those men of the field and the frontier stannard was dressed and out in twenty minutes had summoned ennis field and others among the young officers had routed out half a troop and could have had the entire garrison for few were the soldiers who would not search all night or work all day for good old mayhew and his pretty daughter perhaps that was one reason why until this night so many maids and mothers among the sergeants families envied and slandered her mayhew had been far from wise and dora indeed had none to guide kindly and cordially treated as he and she had been by the officers and their wives being in fact superior socially to the snaffle household if not to certain others there was yet this bar to hold them back they dined and danced not with the commissioned element of the post whereat mayhew was stationed they were of finer clay than the people of the rank and file and so with the families of the forage and wagonmaster the chief packer and old ordnance sergeant shell they made up a little middle class of their own when doras heart had gone out ungrudgingly to handsome clever educated george rawdon whom all men could see had been reared among gentlefolk and who as further fascination was supplied from some unknown source with money which he spent with lavish hand the moon was in the fourth quarter now yet still bright enough to aid them and up and down the creek bank went the searchers probing every pool searching every shallow it was odd or was it odd that for half an hour no man no matter what he thought went down and banged at the door of c troops stable where in cozy quarters and solemn state guarded by the sentries on either flank slept that surly magnate among the noncommissioned officers fitzroy the stable sergeant of snaffles troop whatever had befallen poor dora mayhew it was not to join cockney fitzroy she had fled had she fled to join anybody was the question that racked so many a heart for with the possible exception of gentle mrs stannard the girl had made no confidant it was stanch old chloe who would have it that her pet and pride from childhood her solemn charge since the poor mothers death eight years before had never left her fathers roof to do harm to herself and break their hearts if morning came without her she surely had been lured away and if marss rawdon had really gone who was there who through love or fear or threat or artifice of any kind could lure her it was this full fifteen minutes after lieutenant field and two of his men had trotted off to town that started old stannard and big jim ennis down the valley from the veterinarians through sudstown where girls and women were huddling and whispering at the news through the hay and woodyards where the sentry challenged sharply so often had he halted searching parties in the last ten minutes past the little shack where dwelt the farriers and blacksmiths many of them alight for the story had gone sweeping and so at last they came to the long cavalry stables standing gable ends to the north like so many companies in close column and at the sixth of these farthest from the bluff whereon stood the barracks and quarters they stopped and banged at the door no answer even when the sentry came to their aid and hammered with the butt of his carbine they went round and rattled at the window of the sergeants room still no response and at their beck the sentry yelled for the corporaloftheguard who had followed down expectant ill have him out said he and ran round to the south end and presently came back panting but triumphant he had roused the two stable orderlies they would open up in a minute they did with much blinking of eyes and some demur but stood abashed when the burly major strode in big jim ennis at his heels the latter hesitated not one second his weight went in with the battering ram of that muscular leg and massive foot and the sergeants door flew open before them the room was empty fitzroy and fitzroys furs were gone nor was that all snatching a stable lantern from the hand of one of the shaking grooms ennis swung it high aloft two empty stalls stood close at hand i thought so said he then grabbed the nearest orderly by the coat collar who took lieutenant fosters sleigh and team demanded he and how long ago sergeant fitzroy sir came the answer with a doleful whine just before the third relief at halfpast eleven no time to see the colonel now said ennis major stannard ive got to gallop into town but a dozen men if need be should trail that sleigh go it boy was the instant answer and im behind you x on the principle that disaster ever demands its victim the sentry of the second relief the immediate predecessor of the soldier now on post at the north line of the stables was stirred up at once and ordered to explain even as stannard was hastening the movements of the men detailed to mount and trail the foster team even as ennis was galloping townward on a mission of his own captain langley of the infantry officeroftheday began his stern examination of the luckless guardian orders are orders even a stable sergeant could not take or send an animal out at night except the building stood in danger of destruction by flood fire or tornado save on written order of a commissioned officer and in presence of the corporaloftheguard and stoner the sentry of the second relief admitted he knew these were the orders but the fellers had never supposed they applied to sergeant fitzroy who did pretty much as he pleased in fact fitzroy hitched up and drove away without so much as a word to him he the sentry was too little surprised to think of ordering halt even as langley drew from him the admission the word came up that the squad had started hot foot on the trail it led straight away to town and the stable orderlies had sworn that fitzroy started alone therefore unless dora mayhew had circled the fort and joined him on the bleak eastward prairie it was most unlikely she had gone with him and up to one oclock there was none to hint with whom or how except afoot she could have gone then however came revelation the sentry stationed at the northwest face of the post admitted having seen a rig from town making wide circuit clear around behind the fort on the westward bench which was swept almost clean of snow it had kept well out beyond hailing distance stood a moment or two up at the edge of the bluff then whirled about and went the way it came what hour was this just before they called off eleven oclock why had he not mentioned or reported it well he thought it might have been some of the officers they sometimes came out late and went in home the back way whereat in some confusion captain langley dropped that phase of the investigation by two oclock that rig also had been trailed back to town where it was lost in the tangle of wheel tracks there ennis and field and several troopers with one or two interested citizens were in quest of tidings there they were joined by mayhew himself who had one more hope dora had a friend a few years older than herself with whom she had been intimate at fort riley they went daily to school together when children and wept when parted now her friend was married to a conductor of the union pacific railway and living in town it might be that dora had gone to her they found the house and hammered at the door and lower windows and succeeded only in waking a chinese servant who said all gone blong omaha and refused further information they went to the three stables in town and all had rigs out some of them two or three none to the proprietors knowledge had been to the fort most of them had gone to a dance at arena a cattle town six miles east and it was high time they were returning for now it was after three whats all the row about anyhow demanded the night watchman of one of these establishments there was that cockney sergeant fellow here along about midnight asking questions and raising hell the town marshal had a rumpus with him and went to bed mad the halfdozen hangerson about the railway station and the roisterers at the one openallnight saloon were growing inquisitive if not impudent the stationmaster had gone home but the lone operator to whom one after another field ennis and mayhew had appealed declared that no young lady had gone on number six for the reason that number six hadnt gone and wouldnt go till long toward daylight she broke down somewhere about seven oclock at medicine bow but ennis and mayhew came at him a second time with a second question could he tell them anything of mr and mrs osborn osborn being a conductor and mrs osborn doras friend of whom previous mention is made had they gone to omaha no for mr osborn was round here early in the evening and had to be here at six oclock am to meet and take number five over the mountain division then john chinaman had lied said poor mayhew grieving sore and quite ready to break down but ennis was spurred to new energy keep your heart old man said he the more i think of this the more im sure theres light ahead and im going after it go to the hotel lie down and leave the rest to me and still jim ennis felt by no means confident he could be in time he knew the mayhews only slightly he had never before been stationed at regimental headquarters had seen and known dora only since their coming to fort cushing and therefore had not learned to share bobs honest admiration for her she might be all bob thought her a loving child and a truehearted girl in spite of her infatuation for this presentable young trooper whose antecedents nobody knew ennis had often marked him during the campaign and noted his regard for bob and felt kindly disposed toward him until mid september when two troops were sent in to frayne with the pack train and orders to load up with rations and escort it back rawdon was missing from the column when it camped the first night out on the return and only caught them by a daring night ride through the sioux country when they were two days march beyond his captain raymond had sternly rebuked him and promised him further punishment when they reached the regiment but lanier had heard of it and interceded thereby making rawdon still more his friend but now the heart of dad ennis was hot against him for fear that what barker said might all be true that rawdon had wrecked an old mans heart and home and ruined an old mans beloved daughter with just two troopers at his back toward four in the morning big jim went spurring on through the dim moonlight town and station far behind following a meandering sleigh and wagon track across the wide dreary upland riding as a rule parallel with the railway while such sleighs as tried the journey had evidently been making many a detour snow there was in abundance in the coulйes and ravines snow in sheets in the lee of every little ridge or hummock but elsewhere the icy sod was swept hard and clean and the sharp hoofs rang as though they struck macadam three miles out two rigs were passed westward bound filled with town folk who had been to arena for the dance had they seen or heard aught of mr and mrs osborn he asked no they knew them well by sight and would be sure to note them had they come to the dance five miles out a stage was encountered loaded with exuberant revellers who had remained after the dance for a spree and were now consumed with wrath because certain officers of the law from their own town too had hustled them out a hull sleighful of em three or four anyhow came over there with that cockney sergeant you fellers keep at the fort lookin for deserters you after deserters well heres hic hopin you dont get em it was all jim ennis wanted to know come on men he cried and spurred ahead his wondering troopers following now what the mischief is that man fitzroys game thought ennis as he pushed on through the bitter cold of the december morning it had not been difficult to learn that the sergeant after much search and inquiry in town had started for arena taking with him as it happened two of the rocky mountain police who had business there and were tired of waiting for the train ennis reasoned it was after dora that fitzroy had gone that in his jealous misery he had kept watch upon her had followed to town on hearing of her flight had followed further and this it was that gave ennis the hope that she was accompanied by such worthy people as the osborns if that were so it could mean but one thing it was to join rawdon perhaps to be joined to rawdon osborn had sent two messages by wire and received two early in the evening ennis had learned this through the operator though the contents were withheld rawdon probably dared not come to cushing city there he might still be arrested on sight yes ennis had it now dora mayhew had fled to arena to meet and marry george rawdon fitzroy had followed fast in hopes of blocking it and just as the twinkling switchlights of the little prairie station hove in sight ahead there came a sound that startled him the whistle of a railway engine not a mile behind number six at last and coming full tilt the very train perhaps that they the young couple hoped and meant to take and might have taken on their eastward way had not fitzroy keeneyed quickwitted and vengeful been there in time to bar the move and then in the soldier soul of big jim ennis was born a strange sudden and somewhat unprofessional spirit of opposition starting out in the hope of finding and restoring to her fathers roof the sorrowing fugitive jim ennis veered right round to the purpose of succoring a maiden in distress if marriage was rawdons motive in bidding her join him then rawdon was honest after all and who was he or who was fitzroy to stand in the way and stop it no by all the arts of peace and the articles of war rawdon was right and d be the man that sought to check him five minutes later with the big engine and train coming hissing and grinding to a stop at the platform ennis sprang from his panting horse tossed the reins to one trooper and followed by the other shouldered his way through a little knot of staring townsfolk and up to a group at the edge of the platform a trimbuilt young fellow in civilian dress was struggling in the grasp of two detectives a terrified girl was clinging to his arm tears streaming down her face a clericallooking elderly stranger was expostulating a man in the cap and dress of a railway conductor was vehemently arguing with a stocky sergeant of cavalry who seemed master of the situation and greatly enjoying his own importance a palefaced young woman whom the conductor of number six addressed as mrs osborn was imploring his aid when to the amaze of the sergeant this big subaltern in boots and spurs bulged in between him and conductor osborn and demanded to know the nature of the trouble ive run down this man at last sir gulped fitzroy flustered but making valiant effort at control as you see sir only in the nick of time oh mr ennis cried dora throwing herself upon him and clasping his arm rawdon has done no wrong we are married here are our friends to prove it why should they arrest him colonels orders lieutenant arrest him wherever found said fitz stoutly and ive a sl stage here to take him back on charges of your own invention sergeant fitzroy said ennis icily no one of which youll ever prove have you any warrant for this man this to the detectives none sir the sergeant said he was a deserter running off with the doctors daughter hes no deserter hes on furlough by order of general crook travelling i take it with his own wife and unless you want to burn your fingers to the bone let go then lieutenant burst in fitzroy hes a prisoner by order of colonel button then as senior officer on the spot ill take charge of him also sergeant fitzroy of you and the sleigh you feloniously made way with stand aside sir now gentlemen how about this train ordered right on lieutenant to meet number five at beaver switch then its a case of all aboard for those bound eastward well hear the rest when you return from furlough rawdon for now the young man was trying to speak instead of seeking to speed away i did my best to be in time for the ceremony mrs rawdon continued ennis gallant and impressive as he swung her suddenly aboard but with my usual luck i lost the chance to kiss the bride for answer she quickly turned flung her arms about his neck and her warm lips swept his cheek one for you mr ennis she cried and then again and this for mr lanier xi friday again and late in the day and bob laniers arrest lacked but a few hours of its first full week and bob was in bandages and bed in a sunny room of the hospital ennis after a long night in saddle and a short spat with the colonel was taking a much needed nap stannard and his wife had gone down to doctor mayhews to meet mrs osborn who had come to spend the afternoon paymaster scott was up and about and in his independent way had been saying unrelishable things to button who was in most peppery frame of mind a wire had come from department headquarters to say an inspector would follow instead of ordering a general court to try lieutenant lanier they have ordered a colonel out to try me by gad said button for thats just what it all amounts to and of all colonels to investigate matters at cushing there wasnt one in the army button would not rather have had than the very one who was coming bluff blunt rasping old riggs best known to fame and fort cushing as black bill why said button to scott this sending one field officer of cavalry to sit in judgment on the official deeds of another is nothing short of of infamous and im amazed at crooks doing it it aint crook said scott not without a little malicious delight in buttons disgust hes away up at washakie and of course his adjutant general dont want to act or even advise until he knows all about it youve seen fit to charge lanier with all manner of things and i dont wonder headquarters are staggered but bill riggs to come and overhaul my regiment when its notorious he never could command even a twocompany camp without having everybody by the ears such men arent fit to be inspectors indeed there was much to warrant poor buttons disgust he had preferred most serious charges against lanier he had accused him of quitting camp on campaign quitting his guard in garrison quitting his quarters when in arrest failing to quit himself of a money obligation drinking and consorting with enlisted men and in his letter of transmittal he had intimated that there were other misdeeds he might yet have to uncover all said button on the information of veteran officers and sergeants of the regiment notably captains curbit and snaffle lieutenants crane and trotter sergeants whaling and fitzroy and now here were both medical officers both of his majors two of his best captains seven of his subalterns and ninetenths of the women folk at fort cushing taking sides with lanier and issue with him their colonel and commander and here too were lieutenant and mrs foster highly connected influential wealthy insisting that his most active and important witness the unimpeachable sergeant fitzroy had corrupted their coachman run off with their sleigh and ruined this was mrs foster their horses foster first lieutenant of snaffles troop seldom on speaking terms with his captain had discovered the deed at morning stables just five minutes before the aggrieved sergeant drove in with the missing property and lieutenant ennis as escort foster was in a fury over it the more so because fitzroy had maintained respectfully enough but most stubbornly that the circumstances were such that he felt justified in making immediate use of any property under his care or charge that he would explain everything to his captain and the colonel but begged to be excused in the lieutenants present frame of mind from arguing the matter with him and the story snaffle told button before foster could reach him went far to strengthen fitzroys position snaffle said that so far from fitzroys corrupting the coachman the boot should be on the other foot were fitzroy corruptible that foster would find his coachman a doubledyed liar when he came to the truth of that runaway the night of the dance that fosters sleigh and carriage and driving horses had no right in a government stable anyhow were only there on sufferance which was true for foster kept saddlers besides all the law allowed him and that under the circumstances when as was well known at least twenty officers and troopers on government mounts had gone forth at night in violation of standing orders without the commanding officers knowledge or consent all on the plea of rescuing mayhews daughter lieutenant foster ought to be ashamed of himself for abusing fitzroy for taking the sleigh in hopes of having a warm nest to fetch the poor girl home in as soon as hed found her sure did mr ennis expect her to ride back on his cantle on so bitter a night faith fitzroy was worth the whole pack of em put together if theyd only let him alone and that at nine oclock when ennis was sent for was the colonels way of looking at it moreover he had a rasp up his sleeve for our massive young friend on half a dozen other counts in point of fact mr ennis that girl has simply fooled the whole party and is probably laughing at all of you a girl that will run away without a word or line to her father and marry an outandout adventurer a mere nobody has neither heart nor head anyhow and now youve interfered in a matter of discipline just as mr lanier did and i gave you credit for better sense you know i had ordered that fellows arrest ennis took it all all this and more in grave silence and subordination he would have gone without a word but button would not so have it button demanded his reasons and began hitting back before ennis had named even two this brought on the spat as barker irreverently described it and left the colonel in no judicial mood in which to see stannard sumter and others as see them he had to in course of the day but flatly he swore that sergeant fitzroy should not go in arrest it was only too clear they sought to make a victim of him and so all fort cushing seemed in turmoil and trouble as the sun of the d went out and black bill came in yet that sun must have been potent for mrs stannards face as homeward she sped after a long talk with mrs osborn was radiant with sunshiny smiles youre not to know anything yet luce at least until you get it from doctor mayhew for you never could keep it and for a week at least its got to be kept well one thing you can tell said the major that is if you know and put a stop to an awful amount of censure that poor girls getting why did she leave no word for her father because she expected to be home in two hours and the reader can judge just how full and satisfactory must that answer have been but were matters mending for mr lanier was the question still troubling mrs stannard neither kate nor miriam had she seen since the night of the fire miriam arnold was confined to her room kate sumter would not leave her and yet over these two devoted friends there still hovered a spell the mutual trust and faith seemed shaken the old confidence or intimacy was gone now whatever mrs osborn had told that so cheered mrs stannard it is certain the latter could not contain herself long and that even as the major was summoned toward nine of the evening to join the solemn conclave at the colonels where by this time button had opened proceedings by giving black bill the best dinner a frontier larder and cellar afforded she bustled over to the sumters was delightedly welcomed by her friend and neighbor whose husband too had been called to council and presently these two sages were in confidential chat to them presently entered the captain electric bristling he wanted the bundle of latest newspapers they had not half read them and colonel button was all eagerness to see some articles concerning the campaign about which riggs had been twitting him asking him whom he had subsidized at this late hour to rescue his reputation etc riggs had seen three long wellwritten letters in the great new york morning mail obviously the work of a correspondent on the spot an eyewitness to the scenes he had described and these letters refuted the calumnies recently heaped on button and his comrades gave him in fact high praise for soldiership bravery energy even though the writer owned himself by no means one of the colonels circle if indeed one of his personal friends and admirers only the sumters at cushing subscribed for the morning mail riggs had seen the paper at omaha it took a search of some minutes before even the first was found then sumters eyes danced as he read and mrs sumter exclaimed over another and for the first time in a week sounds of cheer arose in that little home presently mrs stannard read aloud a spirited stirring paragraph describing a dash led by lieutenant lanier and then sumter made a swoop for all three pages and said the quicker button can see these the sooner hell come to his senses and begging pardon for the rudeness took the papers and his leave and almost collided with kate who at sound of the name and the glad ring of the voices had crept downstairs for the news and so she had to come in and see mrs stannard and hear some few at least of the details of dora mayhews romantic runaway marriage and while they were being told tattoo was sounded and then mrs stannard asked if she might not creep upstairs and see miriam she thought she might cheer her a bit this left mother and daughter alone together and again and even more painfully mrs sumter noted how sad and unresponsive was kate at mention of lanier it must have been nearly an hour later when sumter came hurriedly in threw his furs off in the hall and with troubled face reentered the parlor his wife rose instantly laid her head upon his arm and asked what has happened a scene the like of which i never thought to hear of in this regiment we had adjourned to the office snaffle had been drinking a bit and got angered and flustered when riggs crossexamined him one thing led to another and finally in exasperation he blurted out im sick of being called the accuser of mr lanier by god ive defended him ive hidden worse things than ever i told you yet and now ill stand it no longer you twit me with spying and slandering then by all thats holy you shall say here and now whos the better man t was lieutenant lanier himself that leapt from the window this night a week ago the back upper window of sumters quarters thats how his hand was cut and torn and ive got three men thatll swear to it he broke off suddenly for kate had turned flung herself from the room and into the arms of mrs stannard one long look into the sorrowful eyes of his wife and sumter quickly followed and drew the sobbing girl from those kind arms into his own my child my child he said surely you did not see him no no no was the instant answer no again she sobbed then tell me what it means kate daughter it is i demand it oh father father it was it was what i heard when she screamed and fell what did you hear the other voice his voice it said plainly miriam hush dont you know me xii bob said mr ennis sauntering in to his comrades bedside the following morning im instructed to pay you a kiss laniers bandaged head spun on the pillow he had but one girl in his mind wh who he demanded ennis threw his head back and laughed nine times out of ten when a fellow is asked will you take it now or wait till you get it hes wise to take it now if im any judge i should say youd better wait till you can get it which may be in less than a week ennis if you can quit being an ass long enough to tell me what you mean and where youve been ill thank you if you cant i wish youd get out ugashe concluded bob with a lapse into apache and the pillow well it probably isnt just the kiss you were thinking of no more was when i got it but robert my son and fellow soldier its my recorded conviction that the most enviable member of the regiment this day of our lord is your twin trooper friend rawdon i saw him off on his wedding tour and he didnt have on your clothes laniers head popped up in an instant the one visible eye all eager interest where were they married when did they get off was lowndes there were the questions that flew from his lips arena on number six dont know was the categorical answer rawdon brought the parson out from omaha and the osborns gave her away of lowndes ive seen nothing since the night you staked him at laramie and what ive heard of him you refused to listen to of that callow specimen of the effete and ultrarefined back bay district youve long since had my opinion hes too good and gentle for this western world of ours bob and he and his shuddering kinsfolk suffer too much by contamination oh shut up dad his people did wire him that his mother was desperately ill they merely wanted to get him away from the campaign hed been gambling the pesky little fool with some of the rawhide crowd was all out of cash and dared not tell his guardian thats all there was to it soons he gets his money hell square up thought perhaps he had since rawdon had enough to marry on lowndes owed him ten times what he owed me i reckon to them thus engrossed in confidential chat there suddenly entered the two doctors black bill the inspector it seems had given notice that he must needs have speech with the culprit if that bandaged blistered and unprincipled young man were in condition to see him black bill and his host had been having a night of it button was in high fettle over the amazingly truthful and unlookedfor articles in the mail and as eager to know and reward their author as he had been to apprehend and punish the earlier detractor button had begun to wobble as bill expressed it in his spleen against lanier until so suddenly braced by the truculent stand of captain snaffle whose halfdrunken words the previous night were by this time known all over the post the matter was now in the hands of colonel riggs however and it was his to determine what further action to take snaffle had named as his witness sergeant fitzroy private kelley who though drunk on duty had not been so drunk said snaffle and fitzroy that he could not recognize an officer when he saw him and the third witness to the amaze of barker and the derision of ennis when told of it was no less a person than poor tom rafferty laniers own striker and hitherto devoted henchman and to the consternation of stannard sumter and others captain snaffle had been able to back his words riggs sent for the two availables fitzroy and kelly and the two had declared they could not be mistaken that they had heard miss arnolds scream followed instantly by the crash of glass fitzroy admitted that he was at the moment at captain snaffles back door said he ran round to the sumters gate that he distinctly saw the figure of a man in a soldiers overcoat and fur cap leaping and sliding down the roof and that a moment later he grappled with it in the dark woodshed dropping his hold only when angrily ordered to do so the voice adding instantly im lieutenant lanier kelly was ready to swear to practically the same facts though he thought there was two of them which under the circumstances was not to be wondered at fitzroy declared that a moment later rafferty rushed to the spot recognized the lieutenant and by him was sternly ordered to leave as yet rafferty was in no condition to affirm or deny the excitement of the fire had brought on a relapse and the wild irishman was wilder than ever ravinglike as the steward said in the big post hospital and these statements presently did colonel riggs lay before lieutenant lanier in presence of doctors larrabee and schuchardt as well as lieutenant ennis ive known you three years young sir said he and ive believed in you from the first i have reminded sergeant fitzroy of his previous allegations against trooper rawdon as to the scuffle and assault and so far from showing confusion fitzroy promptly said certainly that took place barely half a minute later and within ten yards of the spot he says his whole idea first was to drive rawdon from the scene and prevent his finding his officer in so humiliating a plight he says he sought in every way at first to shield the lieutenant but when all these other facts came out about the cap the clothing the lieutenants absence from his quarters his lacerated hand etc there was no help for it he finally yielded to the pressure of captain snaffles questions and told the truth kelly miserably admitted his knowledge of it and when rafferty came to his senses he too was to be catechised now mr lanier theres the situation do you care to say anything to me or would you prefer to take counsel and bob lanier leaning on his elbow looked quietly up in the colonels bearded face and answered colonel riggs i reckon both those men think theyre telling the truth and i may have to prove theyre not do you mean you were there queried old riggs in genuine concern there sir of course i was there quick as i could get there but not quick enough by any manner of means riggs looked grave indeed you say you may have to prove it was not you dont you know youll have to if these witnesses are further sustained fully sir and when my need is known there will be witnesses for the defense the doctors tell me rafferty may not come round in less than a week when the time arrives ill be ready and that was the way it had to be left that was the condition of affairs when the eighth and final day of laniers close arrest arrived longer than eight according to law the colonel could not keep him in sooner than eight more according to larrabee the doctors could not let him out yet there came a compromise and a change the idea of bob lanier spending christmas in hospital said mrs stannard it was not to be thought of a sunshiny room on the ground floor of the majors big house was duly prepared and thither just before sunset on christmas eve our young soldier was piloted by schuchardt and ennis making the trip afoot across the rearward space yet being remanded to a huge easy chair and partial bandages immediately on his arrival black bill with his incomplete report had gone back to omaha to further mystify the adjutantgeneral and to eat his christmas dinner the order for the courtmartial hung fire until the preliminary investigation could be concluded fort cushing set itself to enjoy the sweet festival as best it might while such a problem remained unsolved veterinary surgeon mayhew had taken seven days leave an eastbound train and at three pm the day before christmas came a telegram from arnold esq of standish bay massachusetts announcing that he would leave forthwith for the west bringing his sister with him the sumters told mrs stannard and she told bob lanier it has been said that this young gentleman was an outspoken fellow with a hitormiss way of saying things when once his mind was made up and by this time it would seem he had made up his mind mrs stannard if you think a girl could stand the sight of such a guy fawkes as this i would give much to speak ten minutes to miss miriam arnold youre not a guy fawkes said mrs stannard with fluttering heart youve lost something of your mustache and eyebrows but very little of your good looks only only what why its going to be so much harder to see her now than it was before before she and mrs stannard faltered before she saw me playing saint somebody or other at the back window and screamed nobody knows i heard it except you and you wont tell moreover it isnt about that that i have to speak mrs stannards bonny face showed instant disappointment theres theres another matter said bob with trouble in his tones i so hoped faltered that arch matchmaker so did i mrs stannard said downright bob but not with charges hanging over my head first ive got to meet the enemy and yet he wished to see and speak with miriam who not once had set foot out of doors since the night of the fire whose sweet face flamed at every recurring thought of that incident whose selfbetrayal covered her with shame and confusion indescribable who would give years of her young life if she could only escape from fort cushing and hide herself a thousand miles away but not until that stern puritanical father should arrive was leaving to be thought of a week agone and the tidings of his coming would have filled her with dread now she heard them with relief father coming and aunt agnes aunt agnes who never before had been west of the hudson aunt agnes whose forebears had warred against witchcraft and woodcraft against village crones and forest children against helpless old women and stealthy young savages all without mercy when delivered into their hands was it in partial reparation for the rapine the swindling and stealing dealt out by her pilgrim forefathers to the indian of the east that aunt agnes had become the vehement champion of the indian of the west president of a famous peace society was she and secretary of the standish branch of the friends of the red man a race whom the original and redoubtable miles had spitted and skewered and shot without stint or discrimination and now was aunt agnes hastening westward with her brother to reclaim their one ewe lamb from the wolf pack of the wilds and incidentally to see for herself something of the haunts and habits of the red brother in whose behalf these last six months her voice had been uplifted time and again it was the year of a great indian war the blood of hundreds of our soldiery had been shed without protest from these of puritan stock but they shuddered at thought of reprisals aunt agnes coming to cushing aunt agnes to meet the colonel and his redhanded horde of ruthless slayers no wonder the christmas day that dawned for miriam arnold in that stirring centennial year bade fair to be the gloomiest of her life yet who can tell what a day may bring forth sumter came in cheery and laughing for the late family breakfast guardmounting was long over but he had been detained by the colonel it is almost comical said he to see buttons delight in those letters in the new york papers hes as curious now to know the author of those as he was furious at the supposed author of the others what others faltered miriam arnold her eyes filling with strange apprehension her face visibly paling some bitter attacks on him that appeared in the boston and philadelphia papers about that night surprise of lone wolfs village the one he accused mr lanier of having started accused mr lanier and miriam arnold with consternation in her voice was half rising from the table i had thought it best to say nothing to you about it miriam dear said mrs sumter gently you had so many worries but mrs sumter captain interrupted miriam wildeyed do you mean colonel button accused mr lanier of those letters illustration but do you mean colonel button accused mr lanier of those letters that was the backbone of his grievance against lanier said sumter gravely and intently studying her face why and he didnt deny it didnt tell what he knew denied it yes but refused to tell what he knew said it came in such a way he could not tell why miriam what do you know for a moment it looked as though she were on the verge of hysterical breakdown kate sprang to her side and threw an arm around her but with gallant effort she regained selfcontrol i know just who wrote those wicked stories and i told mr lanier and i know and im ashamed i ever had to know who first told them xiii stannard had been summoned to omaha much to buttons curiosity and disquiet mrs stannard left temporarily widowed was none the less radiant a romance was unfolding right under her roof and the heart of the woman was glad her patient was sitting up in spick and span uniform and a sunshiny parlor plainly furnished as were the frontier quarters of that day and generation the room looked very bright and cosey this crisp december evening christmas had come and gone with but faint celebration as compared with former years there had been several callers masculine and regimental during the earlier afternoon but now they were off for stables there had been an influx of army wives and daughters to wish bob lanier many happy returns for this was his birthday shrewd woman with all her gentle kindliness and tact was mrs stannard she had sent word to all her cronies of the interesting event and suggested a call more significance therefore would be attached to a neglect to an acceptance of the hint perhaps this is how it happened that just about four pm when most people were gone mrs sumter came quietly cheerily convoying her two girls and presently bob lanier was smiling into the eyes of miriam arnold whose hand he took last and clung to longest of the three not since the night of the fire had he set eyes on her not since the night of the dance had he spoken with her and he was startled to see the change bravely though she bore herself the flush that mantled her cheek was but momentary and left her pallid and wan miriam looked as though she had been seriously ill kate sumter had given him only hurried and almost embarrassed words of greeting mrs sumter however had extended both her hands in an impulse of loyal liking and friendship and it is doubtful if bob even saw the daughters face certainly he never noted the lack of heart in her manner his eyes had flitted almost instantly to miriam arnolds and there they hung a few minutes of swift purposeless chat ensued mrs stannard and mrs sumter doing most of it then somehow three women seemed to drift away and become engrossed in matters of their own over by the navajocovered lounge and then miriam lifted up her eyes and looked one moment into the young soldiers face the bandages had been removed though his left hand was still encased in a huge white kid glove a discard from the hand of ennis eyebrows and mustache had suffered much and a red streak ran from the left temple down toward the neck yet bob looked fit and debonair and happy in spite of his weight of martial woes its the first chance ive had to thank you for the dance we didnt finish said he noting with a thrill the tremor of the little hand that fluttered for that moment in his grasp do you think it a thing to be thankful for i dont i wouldnt have lost it for a months pay to put it mildly and it will take more than a months pay to repair later damages said he trying to smile and be unsentimental how very much more than that you may lose said she do you think i could have danced with you if i had dreamed what what you were doing you were dancing like a dream said he do you mean i was dancing like a nightmare you were doing what was sure to involve you in grave trouble and it wasnt kind to me mr lanier im all contrition for the anxiety it caused you miss miriam and for absolutely nothing else i wish you to know that i did nothing unusual colonel button was angry with me for a very different matter one moment she was silent then with lips that quivered in spite of her effort a quiver that he saw and that set his heart to bounding madly with lowered voice she hurried on and that too involves me or mine and you then uplifting her swimming eyes you would not tell and then the barrier of his pride was swept away miriam he cried his hands eagerly seeking and seizing hers only faintly resisting there was no need to tell he was standing facing her now close to the curtained window his back toward the twittering trio near the diningroom door and imperceptibly edging thither at mrs stannards suggestion of coffee was this prearranged bob never saw nor heeded she did however and well knew its meaning and the woman in her that thrilled and throbbed at sight of the passion in his eyes the worship in his face coquetting with her own delight would have torn herself away to follow them but her little hands were held in a grasp against which she might struggle in vain he was lifting them to his heart and as he drew them he was drawing her she had to come her long curling lashes sweeping the soft cheeks now once more blushing like the dawn oh mr lanier he heard her murmur as though pleading and warning one swift glance he tossed over his shoulder at the last form vanishing through the doorway then his dark eyes glowing and rejoiceful fastened on hers and quick and fervent came the next words there is only one thing that need be told that must be told because ive just been brimming over with it all these weeks ah how the bonny head was drooping now but drooping toward him and now i can keep it back no longer miriam miriam i love you i love you have you nothing to tell me one instant of thrilling suspense then with a sob welling up from her burdened heart the barrier of her pride and reserve went as his had gone a moment ago oh you know you know it who hasnt known it since that awful night she cried and then found herself folded weeping uncontrollably almost deliriously in his arms his lips raining kisses on the warm wet cheek a moment he held her closewrapped to his heart then gradually yet with irresistible power turned upward the tearstained blushing exquisite face so that he could feast his eyes upon her beauty then with joy unutterable his lips sank upon the soft quivering mouth in the first love kiss she had ever known and their troubles vanished into heaven at the touch mrs stannard you were a jewel and a general now how about the major for conference with the judgeadvocate of the department read the order that summoned him and from that conference forth went our doughty dragoon in search of conquest it is understood said the officials that you know the circumstances under which lieutenant lanier became responsible for the money borrowed at laramie by or for that young mr lowndes also that you know him there were other matters but that came up first stannard knew and was quite willing to set forth with a plainclothes member of the omaha force on a mission for and from headquarters in a derby hat and civilian suit of the fashion of the latter much too snug for him our squadron leader of the sioux campaign looked little like a trooper as he sauntered with his detective companion into the lobby of the paxton a few minutes later and listened to his modernized tale of the prodigal son it was all known to the police lowndes had run through the purse and patience of his eastern kindred some two years before lowndes had been transported to a cattle ranch near fort cushing in hopes of permanent benefit but speedily neglected the range for the more congenial society of the fort he was well born and bred he was made free at first at the mess but wore out his welcome he went on the campaign for excitement and got much more than he wanted he took to gambling among the scouts and packers and sergeants for the officers had soon coldshouldered him but he was a college man a secret society man as had been lieutenant lanier before entering the point since the campaign lowndes had been going from bad to worse had gambled away the money sent him by his relatives and they were now sorely anxious about him moreover he was needed as a material witness for the defense in the case of lieutenant lanier and would answer no letters to his postoffice address he hadnt been near the ranch in nearly a month hadnt been seen about cushing city since the blizzard was believed to be somewhere in this neighborhood in disguise and even as the story was being told there came bounding down the broad stairway from above a slender wellbuilt youth in whom the civilization of the east was stamped in the stylish trimfitting travelling suit with cap to match in the further items of natty silken scarf and the daintiest of hand and foot covering it was the erect jaunty carriage that caught the majors eye in build bearing and gait the approaching stranger was bob lanier all over he came straight toward them and was tripping lightly swiftly by when stannard sprang to his feet rawdon he cried voice and manner at once betraying the soldier and the habit of authority and command it was as imperative as the crisp curt halt of veteran sentry and effective as though backed by levelled bayonet but if stannard for an instant looked for demur resistance attempt to avoid or even a trace of confusion on the part of this transmogrified trooper the idea as quickly vanished a wave of color it is true swept instantly to the young fellows temples but the sudden light of recognition in his handsome eyes was frank and fearless quickly he whirled about courteously he raised his cap instinctively his heels clicked together as he stood attention to his squadron leader of the summer agone i beg the majors pardon said he i did not expect him here and had never seen him in civilian dress and now the detective too was on his feet and curiously noting the pair youre on furlough i understand but i heard my wife said you were in chicago mrs stannard was right sir my wife and her father are there now visiting my sister doctor mayhew told me of the charges against lieutenant lanier and that is what brings me back at once going back at once began the major mollified yet mystified i presume you know more of these matters than any one else with possibly two exceptions sir i hope to nab one of them here lowndes queried stannard lowndes answered rawdon then youre just the man we want that afternoon as the union pacific express stood ready at the union station for the start there boarded one of the sleepers a burly thickset bluffmannered man in huge fur overcoat close followed by two younger companions one of these latter erect and graceful in bearing alert and quick in every movement with clearcut and handsome features was dressed with care and taste evidently a man accustomed to metropolitan scenes and society the other a youth of probably his own age though looking elder was sallow shabby with a dejected downattheheel expression to his entire personality that told infallibly of failure and humiliation at a sign from their leader he dropped dumbly into a section settled himself next the frosty window with his head shrunk down in his worn coatcollar and his slouch hat pulled over his eyes better pull off that overcoat and make yourself comfortable lowndes said the younger man youve a long journey ahead whereat a tall spare elderly gentleman in the adjoining section slowly lowered his newspaper and turned half round while a tall spare elderly sharpfeatured woman beside him in prim travelling garb sprang from her seat and brushing the burly man aside precipitated herself upon the shrinking object in the corner mortimer watson lowndes cried she where on earth have you been for answer mortimer watson bowed his flabby face in his hands and wept dismally two days later the colonels office at fort cushing was the scene of a somewhat remarkable trial it had no force in law yet was held to be conclusive there was no array of uniformed judges sitting by order as a general courtmartial the tribunal consisted in point of fact of a single man acting as judge jury and attorney to wit black bill riggs inspectorgeneral of the department of the platte to the unspeakable disgust of most of the officers and the outspoken disapprobation of many of their wives only those closely concerned in or connected with the case were invited to be present certain others who had just happened in thinking to hear the proceedings were indeed invited to leave colonel button as post commander and principal accuser was of course at his usual desk colonel riggs his jealously regarded rival was seated at a little table whereon was much stationery and a stack of memoranda lieutenant lanier somewhat pale but entirely placid occupied a chair to the left of that table with captain sumter as his troop commander and counsel by his side captain snaffle was in support of the post commander to crossquestion if he saw fit barker the adjutant was present as a matter of course a headquarters clerk sat facing riggs prepared to take notes and the trim orderly stood outside the closed door three or four people in civilian garb sat awaiting summons in the adjutants office across the hall and sergeant fitzroy with trouble in his eyes and wrath in his heart was flitting uneasily about in the domain of the sergeantmajor if you are ready colonel button began riggs with elaborate courtesy i am and let me briefly say that i have seen trooper rafferty at the hospital also certain other men named by captain snaffle but in order that all parties may be given opportunity to hear and to examine and at the request of lieutenant lanier who desires the fullest investigation and publicity i have invited you and the captain to hear what i consider the really valuable evidence will you call in trooper rawdon snaffles face was a sight when the door opened and there entered a very selfpossessed young man in stylish and becoming civilian dress who nevertheless stood bolt upright with his hand raised in salute hwats he mean by coming here in cits said snaffle in hoarse whisper to his commander yes colonel riggs if this mans a soldier why isnt he in uniform with perfect respect at a nod from riggs the newcomer replied my uniforms and other belongings of mine were taken from my trunk in town during my absence you could have borrowed one said snaffle truculently i told him he need not retorted riggs and now gentlemen well waste no time trying to worry the witness mr rawdon you were a duly enlisted trooper i believe take that chair and am still sir as far as i know but your discharge is ordered as i understand it it was applied for and recommended and general whipple told me in chicago a few days ago it was settled but that would have made no difference sir i should have been proud to wear the uniform until officially discharged riggs wheeled in his chair colonel button it has been fully explained to this man and to the next that what they tell us here is to be just what they would swear to before a court you can decide for yourself on hearing it whether you wish them to swear to it or not now rawdon tell us how you came to enlist as the representative of three newspapers in chicago and the east they were anxious to have an indian campaign and the life of an enlisted man described as it really was i joined a squad of recruits for this regiment right after the news of the crazy horse battle on powder river do you still hold that job no sir and there was a twitch of the muscles about the corners of the mouth suggestive of amusement why i failed to give satisfaction only scraps of my letters were published what did they want criticism principally and confirmation of the stories of abuse and ill treatment of soldiers by their officers were your letters never published three of them eventually after the campaign in the new york morning mail whereupon riggs spun in his chair and rejoicefully surveyed button who sat like a man in a daze staring openedeyed at the witness for the life of him sumter could not suppress a chuckle then as i understand it you were favorably impressed with the life and conditions in spite of hardship and privation yes sir and because i found complete refutation of the stories about the officers both as regarded their dealing with the indians and with their own men were there any persons with the command who knew you and your mission two sir as it turned out trooper cary who enlisted at the same time i did and a civilian mr lowndes who recognized us at fort frayne we were at college together he and cary became very intimate toward the last and yet i think they kept my secret in spite of our falling out do you care to tell us why you fell out i prefer that mr lowndes should do that he and cary had been chums in college days and though we were in the same society i did not know them then as i do now you had trouble with sergeant fitzroy at first did you not almost from the start sir we have heard his version what is yours rawdons frank face clouded and colored one moment but the eyes never flinched it was partly on account of the lady who is now my wife and partly on account of money fitzroy is an outandout usurer and has a dozen sergeants in the regiment in his debt and under his thumb captain snaffles first sergeant among them its a lie said snaffle its the truth said riggs and i have other proofs you will curb your tongue and your temper captain snaffle if you please go on rawdon i had reason to believe he was squeezing doctor mayhew i had learned to love mayhews daughter i had a little money laid by and was getting a good salary i made doctor mayhew take enough to free himself and won fitzroys hate on both accounts you are accused of assaulting him the night of the th what of that i did not even see him or speak to him i had been in town in the afternoon arranging for our marriage doctor mayhew would not hear of it until i had got my discharge but we had decided to be married saturday morning and to go east that afternoon as important business called me mr lowndes will tell you that he owed me much money i had lost my position as correspondent needed the cash and pressed him for it he had promised faithfully to have it ready but ready it was not i knew of his relatives in massachusetts and urged him to telegraph but he said he could get some of it at least at the fort so i drove him and cary out in a sleigh left them at the store and circling the fort spent two hours with miss mayhew then getting uneasy as they did not come drove round back to the store just in time to see lieutenant fosters sleigh going like the wind to town and found rafferty in frantic excitement he said there was hell to pay the lieutenant was in arrest lowndes and cary had run away with some of his clothes thered been a shindy up the row and just then a soldier friend came running skip for your life rawdon said he theres been robbery at captain sumters and sergeant fitzroy swears it was you and that youve struck him and assaulted him the colonel orders you arrested wherever found the patrols are out now there was no time to explain i lashed my team to town caught lowndes in cavalry overcoat and cap the fool and with not a cent to his name i gave cary a note to miss mayhew which he never delivered and took lowndes with me on number six at then you were not at captain sumters that night nowhere near it sir snaffles eyes were fairly popping from their sockets hadnt he said all along it was lanier now another matter continued riggs that night at laramie of which you told me these gentlemen will be interested there was nothing remarkable in that i had heard of the same thing being done at west point i heard in the nick of time of the order to the officeroftheday to inspect for lieutenant lanier i imagined that something very serious would happen to him i knew hed gone to the post with lowndes and why so with my apologies now to the lieutenant i slipped round to his tent and into his blankets did the lieutenant know of it or of the reason never so far as i know i doubt if he knows it now lowndes told me the lieutenant before he entered west point was a member of our fraternity that was enough and so far as i am concerned said riggs that is enough have you gentlemen any questions to ask not now answered button slowly but i desire personally to see the witness later xiv one more witness appeared before this informal court that memorable day and with him as prearranged the tall elderly civilian who had arrived with stannard and his party from the east mr arnold came in hat in hand bowing gravely and profusely with a very puzzled look in his face thank you for coming mr arnold said riggs with bluff civility you have met these gentlemen colonel button mr barker mr lanier captain sumter he pointedly omitted snaffle to whom none the less mr arnold bowed as ceremoniously as to each of the others who had risen at his entrance pray take this chair sir as i have explained to you mr lowndes your nephew could not be compelled to testify before a military court and need not make public admission here of what he told us at rawdons demand during our journey hither i hope this is fully understood mr arnold cleared his throat and beamed benevolently about him the occasion seemed propitious and a moral lesson appropriate and he began my unhappy nephew realizes with i trust genuine contrition that he has been the cause of grave trouble not only to us his kindred in the east but er to you military gentlemen in the west he has prompted as we must admit by mr mr rawdon made a clean breast of his lamentable conduct and has promised mr rawdon to repeat every word of it er to colonel button but as his then well waste no time said riggs impatiently well have him in and i can catch the afternoon train orderly call mr lowndes er i was about to remark proceeded mr arnold that if any er suit for damages or er recovery of money should be in contemplation we desire dont fear sir nobodys going to sue for damages what we want is the quashing of all charges against this young gentleman who has been made to suffer abominably ah come in mr lowndes sit down sir you have met everybody here now as speedily as possible well finish this matter and in four hours well be off for home it was but a dejected specimen of a collegebred man that sank into the chair in front of riggs and faced him with pallid cheek and somber eyes one look he gave at bob lanier a furtive forlorn glance which met no recognition whatsoever lanier looked him over with indifference that bordered closely on contempt but gave no other sign mr lowndes said riggs abruptly there is no need of going over the entire story ill ask you to answer certain questions who was your earliest friend in this regiment the dreary eyes turned once more toward bob and the nervous hands started the slouch hat in swifter revolution mr lanier sir how came that i knew he was of my college fraternity before i entered college and i showed him my pin and certificate that insured a welcome i suppose yes sir he he made me at home in his quarters and tent shared the best he had with you home food drink even clothes and money im told the flush deepened in the dejected face it is all true sir yet you quarrelled with him during the campaign yes sir why i lost money gambling and he wouldnt lend me any more did you ever pay what he had lent you not yet sir even after your quarrel did he not aid you yes at laramie i didnt seem to have any friend left by that time and had to go to him for help when they wired me to come home in point of fact he enabled you to get one hundred dollars at laramie yes i gave my note and he gave his word what did you do with the money tried to win back some that i had lost at poker and lost most of what i had raised i suppose id have lost all of it if rawdon hadnt caught me playing and pulled me out you owed him still more nearly two hundred dollars sir did you go home i couldnt i had only enough to bring me to cushing and they wouldnt send me any more i had to go to the ranch and stay did you try to earn any money yes sir writing about the campaign rawdon lost his position because he didnt send what they wanted so i thought i might the editor didnt know me and asked for references so i sent my stories to to mr arnold and my aunt she often wrote for the papers is that the way the boston and other papers came to publish those scandals at the expense of colonel button she dressed them up a good deal and made it worse than i described faltered lowndes er let me explain gentlemen interposed mr arnold who had been twitching in uneasiness my sister is of a very sympathetic nature and her heart has long been wrung by the injustice meted out to the indian when this unhappy boy wrote those er descriptive letters she had no reason to doubt their entire truth indeed her conviction was that he was concealing or glossing over worse things he seems to have later supplied you with worse things mr arnold for instance i will ask you what was his final explanation of his need for money he begged me to send him two hundred dollars at once saying he would be disgraced if he could not pay lieutenant lanier who had won it from him at cards mr lowndes said riggs did lieutenant lanier ever win a dollar from you never sir and now the miserable head went down into the hot and feverish hands and the silence in the room became something oppressive riggs let him rest a minute then went on now then in your own way tell us what happened that night of the th for a few seconds there was silence then suddenly uplifting his head and looking at no one lowndes desperately plunged into his narrative i i was mad i suppose with debt and misery and i began to drink rawdon told me he must have the money my uncle had flatly refused to send me more i got desperate there was left me only one way and that was through my cousin miriam i knew she was out here and she she had always been my best friend in my troubles at home wed almost been brought up together until they sent me out here she didnt know where i was they didnt wish her to know but i knew if i could see her she would help me rawdon had changed into citizens clothes in town and i had pawned my overcoat so he lent me his cavalry overcoat and a fur cap drove me and cary out to the fort and left us at the store promising to join him at doctor mayhews in an hour we were chilled from the ride and drank more rafferty told me mr lanier was officeroftheguard and everybody else was at the dance we filled rafferty up for caryd made up his mind he was going to rawdons wedding in cits instead of soldier clothes and he was bent on borrowing a suit of lieutenant laniers even though they would hardly fit him he swore hed return them the next day and rafferty let him have them and he put them on in the lieutenants back room then he and i went up the rear fence and caught sight of number five trooper kelly cary knew him and went ahead to fix things with him as he said kelly had seen us come out of lieutenant laniers back gate and was suspicious cary to quiet him told him he was with lieutenant lanier that we were helping rawdon get ready for his wedding he made kelly drink to rawdons happiness and drink three or four times and finally left him with a half full flask up the row toward major stannards then we went to captain sumters kelly told cary the servants were in at captain snaffles the door was open cary watched below while i hunted for my cousins room i found it easily i knew they had sent her money and orders to come home uncle had written me as much i found her desk i knew it well of old and then to my horror i heard her voice and in a second she was in the room she gave one awful scream though i tore off my cap and begged her to know me but she fell in a faint others were coming i broke out of the back window slid and scrambled down the roof to the shed and so to the ground i heard men come running so i dove into the coalshed where the sergeant grabbed me in the dark and i had to make him let go and said i was lieutenant lanier later i crawled through a hole in the fence and started for the store scared out of my wits right at the next gate i crashed into two men grappled and fighting we all three fell in a heap i picked myself and cap up and ran again caught cary at the store just jumping into a sleigh and we lashed those horses every inch of the way left them at a ranch gate and ran to the station the train was a few minutes late rawdon presently came and he took me to omaha as i begged him for i didnt know what could or would be done to me if i was caught he too had to get away or be thrown into the guardhouse and that thats about all you have that overcoat with you yet i believe that cavalry coat its all i have had to wear sir was the rueful answer as rising he took the garment from the arm of his chair and laid it upon the table with the yellow lining of the cape thrown back exposing a rent or gash whereupon captain sumter arose took from an envelope a sliver of yellow cloth and fitted it into the gap this said he i found on the hook of the stormsash and this he continued laying beside it a rusty sheath knife was later found under the snow close under the dormer window then turning the overcoat inside out he displayed on the back lining in stencil the name rawdon and now said riggs we will hear the accused it isnt necessary began button turning in his chair i have heard more than enough it is necessary colonel button if you please for my satisfaction as investigator of course mr lanier is not obliged to speak but a few matters remain to be cleared up there is yet the timehonored problem of who struck billy patterson and button subsided the matter is quite simple said lanier i went direct from the dancing room to my quarters not even stopping for my overcoat i was chilled when i got there the fire was low and i went back to call rafferty he didnt answer so i had to lug in some fuel his overcoat hung in the kitchen and i put that on and just as i opened the back door there came the scream from up the row fire was the only thing i thought of and i saw others running toward captain sumters as i started from the back gate then a man rushed past me going the other way and then the next thing somebody sprang out from captain snaffles back yard tripped me and i went headlong i was on my feet in a second but he had me round the neck ordering me to surrender i wrenched loose and let him have two hard ones right and left before he clinched again somebody else collided with us we all went down the last man was up first and ran away with the first cap he could reach and i followed in an effort to overtake him knowing by that time it wasnt fire but robbery then when i realized no life was in danger i remembered i was in arrest dropped the chase and went straight to my quarters the way i came both hands were bruised and left badly cut i am sorry of course to have struck sergeant fitzroy but the language he used was vile and it seemed to me the only way to convince him i was not trooper rawdon colonel button have you any questions to ask demanded riggs as lanier concluded why didnt you tell me this demanded button i should have been glad to colonel indeed i tried to the last time i was in the office was the deferential reply well gentlemen said the colonel as a parting shot between us we seem to have stirred up a pretty kettle of fish yet in that culinary maelstrom even snaffle disowned either responsibility or complicity he always had said lanier was a perfect gentleman and so ended bobs arrest and most of our story riggs went back with his report that very afternoon rawdon lingered for a word with cassidy quinlan and poor remorseful rafferty then followed unhampered even by his arch enemy fitzroy who slipped away to the stables three minutes after the close of the conference but he was not even there when along in the spring mr and mrs rawdon came out for a visit to doctor mayhew like rawdon he had received his discharge unlike rawdon there was serious objection to his reлnlistment even snaffle dare not take him on again the snows lay long and deep in the ravines and hollows it was not until midmay that the poor victims of the blast and blinding storm were uncovered and the bodies of the missing were found save that of cary cary who having been given up for lost turned up most unexpectedly the very day that fitzroy applicant for reлnlistment was summarily turned down but cary came not of his own volition he marched with a file of the guard carys story was simple enough rawdon and lowndes had hardly got away on the train when sergeant stowell and his party came searching cary hid he was still half drunk some one told him of kellys arrest and charged him with that and with running off the fosters sleigh he dared not face the music he forgot his precious missive to dora mayhew until next day then the storm held him not until the fire night did he summon up courage to sneak home he had no money left and could buy no more liquor he stole into laniers back door to return the civilian suit and recover the cavalry blouse and trousers left hanging in raffertys room he could hear the lieutenant moving about overhead he had to strike a light he struck several matches found the clothes slipped out of the cits and into his own he was cold and numb he knew there was liquor on the sideboard in the middle room the craze was on him and he risked it he struck more matches and threw the burning stumps to the floor drank his fill then stumbled away intending to give himself up to his first sergeant for absence without leave back round by way of the store and the east front he went but before he could reach the barracks came the appalling cry of fire laniers quarters his doing beyond doubt and now in dismay and terror he fled from the post some ranch folk took him in next day and cared for him awhile then sent word to the fort poor cary had lanier to plead for him before his trial but three months hard labor was the least the law would allow he was still doing time when his happier friend of college days came back with his sweet young wife by which time too another wedding was announced as near at hand only two days did mr arnold and aunt agnes allow miriam in which to prepare for the homeward journey but it is safe to say that in that brief time their views of frontier life and people had undergone marked amendment for they had found an old expounder of their faith in the post chaplain for one thing and many surprising facts as to officers men and indians for another there came a bright wintry afternoon at the fag end of the year when the station platform held a lively little assembly waiting for the eastbound express the colonel and his wife were there the former by no means the bloodthirsty warrior of the elders imagination the stannards had come in and the sumters kate and dad ennis the chaplain and both doctors and all these surrounded the brother and sister and held them in cheery converse while bob and miriam sauntered selfcentred away there was a sheltered sunshiny little nook down the platform between the baggage and express sheds with a high board fence at the back to keep off the north wind and human intruders they passed it twice in their stroll but the third time turned in it was so good to get out of the piercing wind as well as out of sight what wonders a few days of delight will do for a girl the pallor and lassitude had gone the soft eyes were brimming with bliss the rounded cheeks had regained all their bloom the sweet rosebud mouth seemed all smiles and warmth and witchery and laniers eyes were glowing as he drew her to his heart and gazed down into the depths of those uplifted to his that brute of a train has been late for a week said he but today it comes on time it is going to be a long long wait for may how does papa seem to take it now papa is quick to make amends when he has wronged any one and now he knows well so does aunt agnes miriam yet she doesnt approve well aunt agnes dont you know shes different shes a good deal like other women i know when shes placed somebody else in a false position she thinks that person ought to be very sorry for her and sympathize with her for having been deceived and misled she thinks you ought to say how sorry you are how can i say im sorry when im so glad all glad well then theres cousin watson dont you know he was always her pet he was brought up by a weak mother and a doting aunt and she knows you dont approve of him does she expect a man to approve of one who maligned him as lowndes maligned me you should see his earlier letters about you why if id known anything of them i would never dared to meet such a paragon and yet after all he turned to and painted me black as an imp of satan what had i done but good to him i never took or won a penny of his a moment of silence then the fond eyes looked up you won something he wanted and thought was his he never had any sense wont you try to forgive him for my sake bob his arms went round and folded her closely his face bowed down to hers there was a wordless moment then the sound of a distant whistle of nearer shouts of train the dark mustache the unsinged side was sweeping very very near the soft curve of those parted lips what ransom will you pay he murmured ive not yet felt these arms about my neck ive kissed you heaven be praised but miriam have you ever kissed me train train train youll be left again came the shrill feminine appeals and with them approaching unwelcome unheeded footfalls with sudden impulsive movement she threw her arms about his neck and upraised her lips to his one moment of silence two seconds of bliss then dad enniss voice barely a dozen yards away come forth into the light you wanderers there was barely time for bobs fervent words if i couldnt forgive him after that id deserve a dozen weeks arrest
