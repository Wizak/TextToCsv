the merrythought or the glasswindow and boghouse miscellany introduction for modern readers one of the most intriguing scenes in daniel defoes moll flanders occurs during the courtship of moll by the man who is to become her third husband aware that the eligible men of her day have little interest in prospective wives with small or nonexistent fortunes moll slyly devises a plan to keep her relative poverty a secret from the charming and as she has every reason to believe wealthy plantation owner who has fallen in love with her to divert attention from her own financial condition she repeatedly suggests that he has been courting her only for her money again and again he protests his love over and over she pretends to doubt his sincerity after a series of exhausting confrontations molls lover begins what is to us a novel kind of dialogue one morning he pulls off his diamond ring and writes upon the glass of the sash in my chamber this line you i love and you alone i read it and asked him to lend me the ring with which i wrote under it thus and so in love says every one he takes his ring again and writes another line thus virtue alone is an estate i borrowed it again and i wrote under it but moneys virtue gold is fate after a number of additional thrusts and counterthrusts of this sort moll and her lover come to terms and are married footnote daniel defoe moll flanders new york new american library pp the latter half of the twentieth century has seen a steady growth of serious scholarly interest in graffiti sociologists psychologists and historians have increasingly turned to the impromptu scratchings of both the educated and the uneducated as indicators of the general mental health and political stability of specific populations although most of us are familiar with at least a few of these studies and all of us have observed numerous examples of this species of writing on the walls of our cities and the rocks of our national parks we are not likely before encountering this scene in moll flanders to have ever before come into contact with graffiti produced with such an elegant writing implement footnote for example e a humphrey fenn the writing on the

york warner books glass being fragile and diamonds being relatively rare it is not surprising that few examples of graffiti produced by the method employed by moll and her lover are known to us today interestingly enough we do however have available to us a variety of renaissance and eighteenthcentury written materials suggesting that the practice of using a diamond to write ephemeral statements on window glass was far less rare in those periods than we might expect holinshed for example tells us that in when elizabeth was released from imprisonment at woodstock she taunted her enemies by writing these verses with hir diamond in a glasse window verie legiblie as here followeth much suspected by me nothing prooued can be quoth elizabeth prisoner footnote holinsheds chronicles of england scotland and ireland london iv and in john donnes a valediction of my name in the window we find two lovers in a situation reminiscent of that of the scene i previously quoted from moll flanders using a diamond the poet before beginning an extended journey scratches his name on a window pane in the house of his mistress here is the first stanza of the poem my name engravd herein doth contribute my firmnesse to this glasse which ever since that charme hath beene as hard as that which gravd it was thine eyes will give it price enough to mock the diamonds of either rock while he is absent the characters he has cut in the glass will the poet hopes magically defend his mistress against the seductive entreaties of his rivals footnote john donne the elegies and the songs and sonnets ed helen gardner oxford clarendon press p in in a satiric letter to the spectator john hughes poked fun at a number of aspiring poets who had recently attempted to create works of art by utilizing what hughes called contractions or expedients for wit one virtuoso a mathematician had for example thrown the art of poetry into a short problem and contrived tables by which any one without knowing a word of grammar or sense may to his great comfort be able to compose or rather erect latin verses equally ridiculous to hughes and more relevant to the concerns of this introduction was the practice of another poet of his acquaintance i have known a gentleman of another turn of humour who despising the name of an author never printed his works but contracted his talent and by the help of a very fine diamond which he wore on his little finger was a considerable poet upon glass he had a very good epigrammatick wit and there was not a parlour or tavern window where he visited or dined which did not receive some sketches or memorials of it it was his misfortune at last to lose his genius and his ring to a sharper at play and he has not attempted to make a verse since footnote the spectator no november but epigrammatick wits of this sort were not universally despised in the eighteenth century in in a critical dissertation prefixd to a collection of epigrams the anonymous editor of the work argued that the epigram itself is a species of poetry perhaps as old as any other whatsoever it has receivd the approbation of almost all ages and nations in the book proper he found room for a number of epigrams which he evidently copied from london window panes here is an example clx to a lady on seeing some verses in praise of her on a pane of glass let others brittle beauties of a year see their frail names and lovers vows writ here who sings thy solid worth and spotless fame on purest adamant should cut thy name then would thy fame be from oblivion savd on thy own heart my vows must be engravd one of the epigrams in this collection suggests that unlike molls lover and hughess poet some affluent authors had even acquired instruments specifically designed to facilitate the practice of writing poetry on glass written on a glass by a gentleman who borrowd the earl of chesterfields diamond pencil accept a miracle instead of wit see two dull lines by stanhopes pencil writ footnote no ccclxxxii in a collection of epigrams to which is prefixd a critical dissertation on this species of poetry london as the title of this epigram also suggests window panes were not the only surfaces considered appropriate for such writing a favorite alternate surface was that of the toasting glass the practice of toasting the beauty of young ladies had originated at the town of bath during the reign of charles ii by the beginning of the eighteenth century the members of some social clubs had developed complex toasting rituals which involved the inscription of the name of the lady to be honored on a drinking glass suitable for that purpose in an issue of the tatler described the process in some detail that happy virgin who is received and drunk to at their meetings has no more to do in this life but to judge and accept of the first good offer the manner of her inauguration is much like that of the choice of a doge in venice it is performed by balloting and when she is so chosen she reigns indisputably for that ensuing year but must be elected anew to prolong her empire a moment beyond it when she is regularly chosen her name is written with a diamond on a drinkingglass footnote the tatler no june perhaps the most famous institution practicing this kind of ceremony in the eighteenth century was the kitkat club in jacob tonson a member of that club published verses written for the toastingglasses of the kitkat club in the fifth part of his miscellany space limitations will not permit extensive quotations from this collection but the toast for lady carlisle is alone sufficient to prove that complete epigrams were at times engraved upon the drinking glasses belonging to this club she oer all hearts and toasts must reign whose eyes outsparkle bright champaign

arthur e case bibliography of english poetical miscellanies notes that this pamphlet was listed in the register of books in the gentlemans magazine for october an instant success with the reading public second and third editions of the pamphlet the third with very large additions and alterations were also published in because as its titlepage declared the third and last edition was the fullest

but in my sight and then they need not fear my flight l n g the titlepage of part i of the merrythought states that the contents of the pamphlet had been taken from original manuscripts written in diamond by persons of the first rank and figure in great britain and that they had been faithfully transcribed from the drinkingglasses and windows in the several noted taverns inns and other publick places in this nation amongst which are intermixed the lucubrations of the polite part of the world written upon walls in boghouses c these statements suggest one of the principal leveling strategies of the pamphlet as a whole the nobility and the rich whatever their advantages otherwise must like the lowest amongst us make use of privies and in the process they are just as likely as their brethren of the lower classes to leave their marks on the walls of those conveniences a number of the verses included in the pamphlet continue the leveling process one in particular p adopts the principal strategy employed on the titlepage from the temple boghouse no hero looks so fierce to fight as does the man who strains to shte others suggest that sexual relations are essentially leveling activities here p is an example toy at hamptoncourt d n molley h ns for her pride shell suffer none but lords to ride but why the devil should i care since i can find another mare l m august another target of the pamphlet was the spectator in general and addison in particular in his dedication j roberts first insists that the graffiti in his collection are notable examples of wit he next goes out of his way to associate the contents of the merrythought with the spectator but i may venture to say that good things are not always respected as they ought to be the people of the world will sometimes overlook a jewel to avoid a t d nay i have even found some of the spectators works in a boghouse companions with pockybills and fortunetelling advertisements footnote roberts was almost certainly the collector of the graffiti printed in the merrythought as well as the author of the dedication but the dedication was itself signed with the name hurlo thrumbo similarly the titlepage listed hurlo thrumbo as the publisher of the work in hurlothrumbo or the supernatural a play by a halfmad dancer and fiddler samuel johnson of cheshire had set all of london talking the irrational amusing speeches and actions of hurlothrumbo the plays titlecharacter gained instant fame and two years later roberts by attributing his collection to the labors of that celebrity had every reason to expect that the book would attract immediate attention for a detailed account of the relationship between johnsons play and the merrythought see george r guffey graffiti hurlo thrumbo and the other

between true wit and false wit particularly abhorrent to him was the rebus the first part of the merrythought alone contains seven rebuses from drinkingglasses at a private club of gentlemen pp as well as several examples of other kinds of wit which addison would have disdained during the twentyfive years that followed the publication of the merrythought series a few additional pieces of graffiti were published in england and america in the new boghouse miscellany appeared but the contents of this book had little in common with the merrythought pamphlets only the scatological humor of the subtitle a companion for the closestool consisting of original pieces in prose and verse by several modern authors printed on an excellent soft paper and absolutely necessary for all those who read with a view to convenience as well as delight revised and corrected by a gentleman well skilled in the fundamentals of literature near privygarden and the generally antiintellectual thrust of its
