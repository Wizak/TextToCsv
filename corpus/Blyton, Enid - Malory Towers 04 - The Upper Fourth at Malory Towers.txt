maloryupper fourth at malory towersblyton enid darrell goes back to school with felicity darrell rivers was very excited it was the day to return to malory towers her boardingschooland this time she was taking her young sister felicity with her felicity stood on the front steps beside her fifteenyearold sister dressed in the same brown and orange uniform feeling excited too she was almost thirteen and should have gone to malory towers two terms before but she had been ill and had to stay at home now it was the summer term and she was to go with darrell at last she had heard so much about her sisters schoolthe fun they had there the classrooms overlooking the sea the four towers in which the two hundred and fifty girls slept the great swimmingpool hollowed out of the rocks on the shore there was no end to the things that darrell had told her its a good thing were going by train this time not by car said darrell youll travel down with the girls then and get to know some of them sallys going by train too sally was darrells best friend and had been ever since her first term at malory towers almost four years ago i hope i get a friend eke sally said felicity nervously im shyer than you darrell im sure i shall never pluck up enough courage to speak to anyone and if miss potts gets cross with me i shall sink through the floor miss potts was the firstform mistress and also the house mistress for north tower the tower to which darrell belonged and to which her young sister would go too oh you neednt be afraid of potty said darrell with a laugh quite forgetting how scared she had been of her when she was in the first form dear old pottyshes a good sort their fathers car drew up at the front door and the two girls ran down the steps mr rivers looked at them and smiled both off this time he said well i remember quite well darrell going off alone for the first time almost four years ago she was twelve thennow youre fifteen arent you darrell yes said darrell getting into the car with felicity and i remember you saying to me youll get a lot out of malory towerssee that you put a lot back daddys said that to me too said felicity im jolly lucky to have an older sister to show me roundthough honestly i feel as if i know every corner of malory towers already now wheres mother said her father and he hooted the horn really this is a dreadful family to collect if your mother appears in good time one of you girls is missing and if you girls are here your mother is not we shall miss the train if we dont look out usually they went all the way down to cornwall to malory towers by car but this time it was impossible so mr rivers was driving them up to london and seeing them off in the schooltrain felicity had sometimes been to see her sister off by train and had felt scared of all the girls chattering and laughing on the platformnow this time she was actually going to be one of them she hugged her tennisracket to her and thought joyfully of the coming term mrs rivers came running down the steps looking very pretty in a simple grey suit with a little blue blouse darrell and felicity looked at her proudly parents mattered a lot when you were at boardingschool everyone wanted to be proud of the way their fathers and mothers looked and spoke and behaved it was dreadful if a mother came in a silly hat or if a father came looking very untidy my dear we were just going without you said mr rivers nowhave we really got everything last time we got five miles on the way and then you said youd forgotten darrells nightcase yes weve got everything daddy said darrell ive checked every single thingnightcases with brushandcomb toothbrush and paste nightthings health certificate everything tennisrackets to carry and bowler hats for riding we cant pack those theyre too awkward felicity glanced round to see if her new bowler hat was there too she felt very proud of it she had only had a jockeycap before they set off in the car to drive to london felicitys heart sank a little as her home disappeared from view three whole months before she would see it again then she cheered up as darrell began chatting about the girls i hope bill will arrive with all her seven brothers on horseback she said its such a sight to see them all galloping up the school drive bill was supposed to come in her parents car the first term she came but she slipped off got her horse thunder and came with all her brothers on their horses too bills real name is wilhelmina isnt it said felicity remembering do even the mistresses call her bill some of them said darrell not the head of course and miss williams our fourthform mistress doesnt either shes a bit starchyvery prim and proper but i like her now i didnt at first it didnt seem long before they were all on the station platform finding their way between hosts of excited girls to a north tower carriage felicity felt shy and nervous oh dearso many girls and they all knew one another and she didnt know anyone oh yes she didthere was sally darrells friend coming towards her smiling hallo darrell hallo felicityso youre really coming to malory towers at last jolly good wish i was coming for the first time too so that i would have years and years of it in front of me like you you dont know how lucky you are i remember someone saying that to me on my first day said darrell i was twelve thennow im going on for sixteen gosh how old yesand dont forget well feel jolly old before this terms out said a familiar voice behind darrell weve all got to work for school certificate my hair will be quite grey by the end of term hallo alicia said darrell warmly did you have good hols look this is my young sister felicity shes a new girl this term is she really said alicia well i must find my cousin then shes a new girl this term too now where is she ive lost her twice already she disappeared and sally and darrell laughed they were sure that alicia wouldnt bother much about any newgirl cousin however she appeared again almost at once bringing with her a twelveyearold girl very like her this is june she said you might as well make friends with felicity june because youll see plenty of her this term and for a good many years to come though whether felicity will want to see much of you after she knows you well is very doubtful darrell looked at alicia to see whether she meant this or not you never knew with sharptongued alicia june looked all right and had a very determined chin and mouth a bit domineering darrell thoughtbut being in the bottom form of the school didnt give you much chance for that kind of thing the older girls just sat on you hard if you didnt keep your place look said alicia nudging darrell and sally theres gwendoline marycome by train instead of carand staging the same old scene as ever felicity and june turned to see they saw a fairhaired girl with large pale blue eyes saying goodbye to her mother and her old governess it was a very sentimental farewell and a lot of sniffing was going on gwendoline always does that said alicia in disgust at her age too you can forgive a firstformer going away from home for the first timebut a fifteenyearold no well it doesnt last long said sally gwendoline wont even bother to remember to wave to her mother im sure once she gets into the carriage sallys mother was talking to darrells parents there were no tears or protestations there darrell was thankful that her mother and father were so sensible she looked at felicity and was pleased to see her young sister looking interested and happy more girls came up and surrounded darrell and the others hallo had good hols i say is this your young sister has she got a temper like yours darrell this was from irene harumscarum as usual her nightcase coming undone and her coat lacking a button already wellfelicity has got a temper said darrell with a laugh all our family have i dont expect felicity will show hers much though shell be too shy her first term i dont know about that said sally slyly i seem to remember you going off the deep end properly in your first term darrell who sent me flying to the ground that firsthalftermand who gave dear gwendoline some very hearty slaps in the swimmingpool oh dearyes i was dreadful said darrell and she blushed really awful im sure felicity will never do anything like that my cousins got a bit of a temper too said alicia with a grin shes only got brothers and you should hear them shout and yell at one another when they disagree heres miss potts said sally as the firstform mistress came up with a list in her hand hallo miss potts have you collected everyone yes i think so said miss potts except irene oh there you are irene i suppose it didnt occur to you to come and report your arrival to me thank goodness belinda is going by car thats one less scatterbrain to see to now youd better get into your carriages there are only four more minutes to go there was a scramble into the carriages sally and darrell pulled felicity into theirsthe new girls are supposed to go with potty in her carriage said darrell but well let you come in ours goodbye mother goodbye daddy well write on sunday and tell you all the news goodbye said felicity in rather a small voice thanks for lovely hols thank goodness we havent got gwendoline in our carriage said alicia we are at least spared the history of all her uninteresting family and what happened to them last hols even her dogs are uninteresting everyone laughed the guard blew his whistle doors slammed and the train moved off slowly parents and girls waved madly darrell sank back into her seat off to malory towers again she said joyfully good old malory towers everybodys back again the journey was a very long one but the train arrived at the staion for malory towers at last out poured the girls complete with nightcases and rackets and rushed to find good seats in the school coaches that took the traingirls on the last part of their journey felicity was tired and excited darrell didnt seem in the least tired but she was certainly excited now we shall see the school and all the rest of the girls she said to felicity happily watch for the first glimpse of it when i tell you and so felicity had the same first glimpse that darrell had had four years back she saw a large castlelike building of grey stone rising high on a hill beyond was the deep blue cornish sea but that was now hidden by the cliff on which malory towers stood four towers stood at the corners of the building and felicitys eyes brightened as she thought of sleeping in one of the towers she would be in north tower with darrelland it had the best view of the sea she was very lucky its lovely said felicity to darrell and darrell was pleased it was going to be nice to have her sister at school with her she felt sure that felicity would be a great success girls who had already arrived by car stood about the drive ready to welcome the traingirls there were shrieks and squeals of delight as the coaches drove up to the magnificent front entrance and swarms of girls ran to help down their friends hallo belinda shouted irene climbing down and leaving behind her nightcase done any decent sketching darrell called a shylooking fifteenyearold sally alicia hallo marylou anyone put a spider down your neck these hols cried alicia seen betty betty was alicias friend as witty as she was and as mischievous she came up and banged alicia on the back here i am youre jolly latethe train must have been even later than usual theres mavis cried sally and daphneand i say hallo there jean seen bill anywhere yes she came on thunder as usual and shes in the stable with him said jean the quiet shrewd scots girl who was now no longer in the same form as darrell but was going up she came with the groom because all her brothers went back to school before we did this term a very tame arrival felicity stood unheeded in the general rush and excitement she hoped that darrell would entirely forget her alicia had completely forgotten about her cousin june that youngster now came up to felicity and grinned our elders are making a fine noise arent they she said were small fry to them lets slip off by ourselves shall we and make them look for us when they deign to remember were here oh no said felicity but june pulled her arm and dragged her away yes come on i know were supposed to go to matron and give in our health certificate and our terms pocketmoney well go and find her on our own but darrell wont like began felicity as she was led firmly away by june so it was that when darrell looked round for her young sister she was nowhere to be seen wheres felicity she said blow whats happened to her i know how awful you feel when youre new and i wanted to take her under my wing for a bit where in the world has she gone dont worry said alicia unfeelingly im not bothering about young june she can look after herself all right if i know anything about that young lady shes got all the cheek in the world well but felicity hasnt said darrell dash it where has she gone she was here a minute ago anyone seen my nightcase came irenes voice in a mournful wail nobody had you must have left it in your coach seat suggested darrellknowing irenes scatterbrain ways irene darted off after the coaches which were now making their way slowly down the drive hie hie she yelled wait a bit what is irene doing said miss potts crossly irene come back and stop shouting but irene had stopped a coach and was climbing up into the one she had ridden in to the school miss potts gaped did irene think she was going home again she did such mad things that anything was likely with irene but irene found her nightcase waved it wildly in the air to show the others she had found it and climbed down again to the drive she ran back grinning got it she said and stood it firmly down on the groundtoo firmly because it at once burst open and everything fell out oh irenewhy does every case you possess always do that said darrell helping her to pick everything up i cant imagine said irene stuffing everything in higgledypiggledy i have a bad effect on them i suppose come on lets go and find matron i havent found felicity yet said darrell beginning to lode worried she cant have gone off with anyone because she doesnt know anyone well anyhow lets go to matron and hand in our health certificates and money and ask if shes seen felicity said sally the drives pretty well empty nowshes obviously not here so they trailed off to matron who had been dealing most efficiently with dozens of girls health certificates and pocketmoney for an hour or more darrell was pleased to see herkindly bustling starched and competent hallo darrell well alicia turned up again like a bad penny i see mother says you always used to say that to her when she came back each term said alicia with a grin yes she was a bad lot said matron smiling not nearly as bad as you though alicia well have to have a talk about how to darn this term by the way dont forget aha irene there you are at last got your health certificate it was a standing joke that irenes health certificate always got lost if irene was given it to bring to matron but the last few terms irenes mother had sent the certificate by post so it had always arrived safely on the morning of the day that school began irene looked alarmed then she smiled youre pulling my leg matron she said its come by post as usual but it hasnt said matron thats the whole point plenty of post for me this morningbut no health certificate its probably in your nightcase irene go and unpack it and look darrell was looking round for felicity but still she couldnt see her she really felt very worried and rather cross why hadnt felicity done as she was told and kept close by her so that she couldnt lose her in the crowd of girls matron she said you havent by any chance seen my little sister have you yes said matron she was here a few minutes ago and handed in her health certificate she said you had her money nice to have her here darrell darrell was astonished felicity had actually gone to matron and given in her own certificate without waiting to be taken it didnt seem like felicity at allshe was so shy wheres she gone now she wondered out loud shes gone to have a look at her dormy said matron and turned to deal with belinda who seemed to have lost all her money and was turning out her pockets in despair belinda i vow and declare that ill ask miss grayling to put you and irene into another tower next term if i have to deal with you two much more i shall go raving mad sally go and see if irene has found her health certificate yet sally went off to find irene in the dormy and darrell went off to find felicity sally found irene sitting mournfully on her bed the contents of her nightcase strewn on the eiderdownbut there was no health certificate there oh ireneyou really are a mutt said sally rummaging round and shaking out the legs of irenes pyjamas just in case she had put the precious piece of paper there i thought your mother always posted the certificate now she does groaned irene she never fails shes marvellous like that well all i can say is that she must have given it to you to post this time said sally and you must have forgotten a sudden light spread over irenes humorous face she slapped sally on the back sally youve got it she said thats just what happened mother did give it to me to post and i forgot it well where did you put it left it on your bedroom table at home i suppose said sally halfimpatient no i didnt said irene triumphantly i put it into the lining of my hat so that i shouldnt lose it on the way to the postbut when i got to the postoffice i just bought some stamps and walked home again so the certificate should be in my hatlining still in fact im sure it is because now i come to think of it my hat felt jolly uncomfortable all day long it took some time to find irenes hat which had tolled under the next bedbut to irenes joy the envelope with the certificate in was actually still under the lining she shot off to matron joyfully with it i put it in my hat to remember to post it she explained but i forgot so it came with me today still in my hat matron didnt understand a word of this but dismissed it as all part of irenes usual irresponsibility and thankfully took the certificate before irene could possibly lose it again did darrell find her young sister she asked irene but irene didnt know ill go and find out she said and wandered off again darrell had found felicity she had found her in the dormy of the firstform with june and several others june was talking away to everyone as if she was a thirdtermer and felicity was standing by shyly listening felicity said darrell going up to her why didnt you wait for me whatever made you go and find matron by yourself you knew i was going oh i took her said june i thought she might as well come with me were both new i knew alicia wouldnt bother herself with me and i didnt think youd want to bother yourself with felicity weve given in our certificates but youve got to give in felicitys money i know that said darrell very much on her dignity what cheek of this new firstformer to talk to her like that she turned to felicity i do think you might have waited she said i wanted to show you your dormy and everything the first evening darrell went back to her own dormy to unpack her nightthings feeling puzzled and cross she had so much looked forward to taking felicity round and showing her her dormy her bed and every single thing how could her young sister have gone off with june and not waited for her did you find felicity asked alicia yes said darrell shortly shed gone off with that cousin of yourswhats her namejune it struck me as rather extraordinary youd think these youngsters would wait for us to take them round a bit i know id have been glad to have a sister or a cousin here the first term i came oh june can stand on her own feet very well said alicia shes a hard and determined little monkey shell always find things out for herselfand as for taking her under my wing i wouldnt dream of putting anyone so prickly and uncomfortable there wait till you hear her argue she can talk the hind leg off a donkey i dont like the sound of her much said darrell hoping that june wouldnt take felicity under her wing surely felicity wouldnt eke anyone eke june no shes a bit brazen said alicia we all are fault of my family you know darrell looked at alicia she didnt sound as if she minded it being a faultin fact she spoke rather as if she were proud of it certainly alicia was sharptongued and hard though her years at malory towers had done a great deal to soften her the trouble was that alicias brains and health were too good she could always beat anyone else if she wanted to without any effort at alland darrell didnt think she had ever had even a chilblain or a headache in her life so she was always very scornful of illness or weakness in any form as well as contemptuous of stupidity darrell determined to see as much of felicity as she could she wasnt going to have her taken in tow by any brazen cousin of alicias felicity was young and shy and more easily led than darrell darrell felt quite fiercely protective towards her as she thought of the cheeky determined young june they all unpacked their nightcases and set out their things for the night their trunks most of them sent on in advance would not be unpacked till the next day darrell looked round her dormy glad to be back it was a nice dormy with a lovely view of the sea which was as deep blue as a delphinium that evening far away the girls could hear the faint plashplash of waves on the rocks darrell thought joyfully of the lovely swimmingpool and her heart lifted in delight at the thought of the summer term stretching before hernicest term in the year the beds stood in a row along the dormy each with its own coloured eiderdown at the ends of the dormy were hot and cold water taps and basins irene was splashing in one basin removing the dust of the journey she always arrived dirtier than anyone else no one would ever guess that the scatterbrain was a perfect genius at music and maths and quite good at her other lessons too everyone liked irene and everyone laughed at her she was humming a tune now as she washed tumtytootytumptytooty ta ta ta oh irenedont say were going to have that tune for weeks groaned gwendoline who always complained that irenes continual humming and singing got on her nerves irene took no notice at all which maddened gwendoline who loved to be in the limelight if she possibly could irene she began but at that moment the door opened and in came two new girls ushered by matron girlshere are the batten twins she said in her genial voice connieand ruth they are fourthformers and will be in this dormy look after them sally and barrel will you the girls stood up to look at the twins their first thought washow unlike for twins connie was bigger fatter sturdier and bolderlooking than ruth who was a good deal smaller and rather shylooking connie smiled broadly and nodded to everyone ruth hardly raised her head to look round and as soon as she could she stood a little way behind her sister hallo twins said alicia welcome to the best dormy in the school those must be your beds up therethe two empty ones together got your nightcases said darrell good well if youd like to unpack them now you can supper will be ready soon the bell will go any minute hope its good said connie with a comradely grin im frightfully hungry its ages since we had tea yeswe get a wizard supper the first evening said sally i can smell it now connie and ruth put their noses in the air and sniffed hungrily the bisto twins said alicia hitting the nail right on the head as usual everyone laughed come on said connie to ruth lets hurry ive got the keys here they are she undid both bags and dragged out everything quickly ruth picked up a few things and looked round rather helplessly here these must be our drawers next to our beds said connie and began to put away all the things most efficiently she took the washingthings to the basin and called ruth come on ruth wed better wash im filthy ruth went to join her and just as they were towelling themselves dry the supperbell went there was a loud chorus of joy hurrah i hope theres a smashing supper i could do with roast duck green peas new potatoes treacle pudding and lots of cheese said belinda making everyones mouth water what a hope said darrell but all the same there was a most delicious supper that first nightcold ham and tomatoes great bowls of salad potatoes roasted in their jackets cold apple pie and cream and biscuits and butter for those who wanted it big jugs of icycold lemonade stood along the table my word said connie to ruth if this is the kind of food we get here well be lucky much better than the other school we went to i hate to undeceive you said alicia but i feel i must warn you that firstnight and lastnight suppers are the only good ones youll get in any term were supposed to be jolly hungry after our long journeys to cornwall hence this spread tomorrow night twins youll have bread and dripping and cocoa as usual alicia was exaggerating and the twins looked rather alarmed darrell looked round for felicity where was she she couldnt have her at the upper fourth table of course but she hoped she would be near enough to say a word to she was too far away to speak toand she was next to that nasty little june june was talking to her animatedly and felicity was listening enthralled alicia saw darrell looking across at felicity and june theyve soon settled in she said to darrell look at young felicity listening to june you should hear the tales june can tell of her family theyre all madcaps like mine darrell remembered how interesting and amusing alicia could be when she produced one of her endless yarns about her happygolucky mischievous family she supposed that june was the samebut all the same she felt rather hurt that felicity should apparently need her so little well if she thinks she can get on by herself all right thought darrell i suppose its best for her reallythough i cant help feeling a bit disappointed i suppose that horrid little june will find out everything she needs to know and show felicity the swimmingpool the gardens the stables and all the things id planned to show her felicity badly wanted to go to darrell after supper and ask her a few things but as soon as she said she was going june pulled her back you mustnt said june dont you know how the older ones hate having young sisters and cousins tagging after them everyone will be bored with us if we go tailing after alicia and darrell in fact alicia told me id jolly well better look after myself because firstformers were such small fry we werent even worth taking notice of how horrid of her said felicity darrells not like that they all are the big ones said june in a grownup voice and why should they be bothered with us weve got to learn to stand on our own feet havent we noyou wait till your sister comes over to you if she doesnt youll know she doesnt want to be botheredand if she does well dont make her feel youre dependent on her and want taking under her wing shell respect you much more if you stand on your own feet she looks as if she stood on her own all right she does said felicity yes perhaps youre right june ive often heard darrell speak scornfully of people who cant stand on their own feet or make up their own minds after allmost new girls havent got sisters to see to them i suppose i shouldnt expect mine to nurse me just because ive come to a new school june looked at her so approvingly that felicity couldnt help feeling pleased im glad youre not a softy said june i was afraid you might be hallohere comes darrell after all now dont weep on her shoulder as if i should said felicity indignantly she smiled at darrell as she came over hallo felicity getting on all right said darrell kindly want any help or advice with anything thanks awfully darrellbut im getting on fine said felicity wishing all the same that she might ask darrell a few things like to come and see the swimmingpool said darrell we might just have time darrell had forgotten that the firstformers had to go to bed almost immediately after supper on the first night but june knew it she answered for felicity weve got to go to bed so felicity wont be able to see it tonight she said coolly we planned to go down tomorrow before breakfast the tide will be in then ive asked i was speaking to felicity not to you said darrell in the haughty tones of a fourthformer dont get too big for your boots june or youll be sat on she turned to felicity and spoke rather coldly well im glad youre settling down felicity sony youre not in my dormy but only fourthformers are there of course a bell rang loudly our bedtime bell said june who appeared to know everything wed better go ill look after felicity for you darrell and with that the irrepressible june linked her arm in felicitys and dragged her off darrell was boiling with rage she gazed angrily after the two girls and was only slightly mollified when felicity turned round and gave her a sweet and rather apologetic smile the brazen cheek of that little pest of a june thought darrell ive never wanted to slap anyone so much in my life all together again going to bed on the first night was always fun especially in the summer term because then the windows were wide open daylight was still bright and the view was glorious it was lovely to be with so many girls again too to discuss the holidays and to wonder what the term would bring forth school cert to be taken this terra groaned daphne how simply horrible ive been coached for it all the hob but i dont feel i know much even now miss williams will keep our noses to the grindstone this term said alicia dolefully well you dont need to mind said bill she had spoken very little so far and the others had left her alone they knew she got not homesick but horsesick as she called it the first night or two back at school she was passionately attached to all the horses owned by her parents and her seven brothers and missed them terribly at first alicia looked at her why dont i need to mind she said i mind just as much as you do well i mean you dont really need to work alicia said bill you seem to learn things without bothering ive been coached in the hols too and it was an awful nuisance just when i was wanting to ride with my brothers i jolly well had to work though i bet you werent coached in the hols mavis are you going in for school cert asked darrell mavis had been very ill the year before and had lost her voice it had been a magnificent voice but her illnesshad ruined it she had always said she was going to be an opera singer but nobody ever heard her mention it now in fact most of the girls had even forgotten that mavis had had a wonderful voice im going in all right said mavis but i shant get through i feel like a jelly when i think of it by the waydid you know my voice is getting right again there was a pause whilst the girls remembered maviss lost voice gosh is it really said sally good for you mavis fancy being able to sing again i maynt sing much said mavis but i shall know this term i expect if my voice will ever be worth training again good luck to you mavis said darrell she remembered that when mavis had had her wonderful voice they had all thought the girl was a voice and nothing else at alljust a little nobody without an ounce of character but now mavis had plenty of character and it was quite difficult to remember her voice i wonder if shell go back to being a voice and nothing else thought darrell noi dont think she will she deserves to get her voice back again shes never complained about it or pitied herself i say said marylous voice whos this bed for at my end of the room there are nobodys things here the girls counted themselves and then the beds yesthat beds over said darrell well it wouldnt have been put up if it hadnt been going to be used there must be another new girl coming well ask tomorrow said alicia yawning how are you getting on twins all right the two new girls answered politely fine thank you they had washed cleaned their teeth brushed their hair and were already in bed darrell had been amused to see that connie had looked after ruth as if she had been a younger sister turning down her bed for her and even brushing her hair she looked at them as they lay in bed their faces turned sleepily towards her connies face was plump and round and her thick hair was quite straight she had a bold look about hersort of pushful thought darrell the other twin ruth had a small heartshaped face and her hair corncoloured as connies was wavy good night said darrell and grinned they grinned back darrell thought she was going to like them she wished they had been absolutely alike thoughthat would have been fun but they were really very unalike indeed one by one the girls got yawning into bed and snuggled down most of them threw their eiderdowns off because the may night was warm gwendoline kept hers on she always liked heaps of coverings and nobody had ever persuaded her to go without her quilt in the summer miss potts looked in some of the girls were already asleep no more talking said miss potts softly a few grunts were made in reply nobody wanted to talk now darrell wondered suddenly if felicity was all right she hoped she wasnt homesick she wouldnt have time to be if june was in the next bed talking away what an unpleasant child thought darrell and the cheek she had it was past believing when the bell rang for getting up the next morning there was a chorus of groans and moans nobody stirred out of bed wellwe must get up said darrell at last come on everybody gracious look at gwendolinestill fast asleep darrell winked at sally gwendoline was not fast asleep but she meant to have a few more minutes snooze shell be late said sally cant let her get into trouble her very first morning better squeeze a cold sponge over her darrell this remark made regularly about twenty times every term always had the desired effect gwendoline opened her eyes indignantly and sat up dont you dare to squeeze that sponge over me she began angrily this beastly getting up early why at home why at home we dont get up till eight oclock chanted some of the girls and laughed they knew gwendoline marys complaints by heart now dont you dare squeeze that sponge over me did your old governess make her darlings bed for her asked alicia did she tie her bib on her in the morning did she feed her sweet gwendoline mary out of a silver spoon gwendoline had had to put up with alicias malicious teasing for many terms now but she had never got used to it the easy tears came to her eyes and she turned her head away shut up alicia said darrell dont start on her too soon alicia nudged sally and nodded towards the twins connie was making ruths bed for her i can do that protested ruth but connie pushed her aside ive time ruth youre slow at things like this i always did it for you at our other school and i can go on doing it here she looked round at the others and saw them watching her any objection she asked rather belligerently dear me no said alicia in her smooth voice you can do mine for me as well if you like im slow at things like that too connie didnt think this remark was worth answering she went on making ruths bed ruth was standing by looking rather helpless what school did you come from asked darrell speaking to ruth but before the girl could answer connie had replied we went to abbey school in yorkshire it was nicebut not as nice as this ones going to be that pleased the fourthformers did you play hockey or lacrosse at your other school asked sally addressing her question to ruth hockey said connie answering again i liked hockeybut i wanted to play lacrosse too will you like lacrosse do you think asked sally addressing her question once more to ruth wondering if she had a tongue and once again connie answered oh ruth always likes what i eke shell love lacrosse sally was just about to ask if ruth ever said a word for herself when the breakfastbell rang the girls hastily looked round the dormy to see if any clothes had been left about and alicia hurriedly pulled her quilt straight gwendoline was last as usual moaning about a lost hairgrip but then gwen always had a moan nobody took much notice of that darrell looked anxiously for felicity as the girls filed into the big diningroom all the north tower girls together south tower girls fed in the south tower east in the east and so on each tower was eke a separate boardinghouse with its own commonrooms diningrooms and dormies the classrooms were in the long buildings that joined tower to tower and so were such special rooms as the lab the artroom and the sewingroom the magnificent gym was there too felicity came in looking neat and tidy miss potts seeing her come in thought how very eke she was to darrell four years ago when she also had come timidly into the diningroom for her first breakfast in front of felicity was june looking as if she was at least a thirdtermer instead of a new girl on her first morning she looked about chirpily nodded at alicia who did her best not to see grinned at darrell who stared stonily back and spoke amiably to mamzelle dupont who was at the head of the firstform table the second form were also there and darrell and alicia had the satisfaction of seeing two secondformers push june roughly back when she attempted to sit somewhere near the head of the table but nothing daunted june she merely sat down somewhere else and said something to felicity who grinned uneasily something cheeky i bet thought darrell to herself well her form will put her in her place pretty soonand shell come up against the second form too there are some tough kids in the secondthey wont stand much nonsense from a pest like june felicity smiled at darrell who smiled back warmly forgetting for the moment that felicity had probably gone to see the swimmingpool before breakfast without her she hoped her little sister would do well in the class tests that day and prove that she was up to standard sally suddenly remembered the empty bed in her dormy and she spoke to miss potts miss potts theres an extra bed in our dormy do you know whose it is were all back oh yes said miss potts let me seetheres one more new girl coming todaywhats her name nowclarissa somethingyes clarissa carter that reminds metheres a letter for her already here it is sallyput it up on her dressingtable for her will you gwendoline took the letter to pass it down the table she glanced at it and then looked again the letter was addressed to the honourable clarissa carter the honourable clarissa carter thought gwendoline delighted if only shed be my friend ill look after her when she comes ill do all i can gwendoline was a little snob always hanging round those who were rich beautiful or gifted alicia grinned as she saw the girls face gwendolines going all out for the honourable clarissa she thought now we shall see some fun an interesting morning the upper fourth were taken by miss williams a scholarly prim mistress whose gentleness did not mean any lack of discipline as a rule the upper fourth were a good lot responsible and hardworkingbut this year miss williams had sometimes had trouble with her form there were such a lot of scatterbrains in it still i think they will all get through the school cert thought miss williams they are none of them really stupid except gwendoline daphne is much better since she has had regular coaching in the holidays mavis has picked up wonderfully so has bill and though little marylou is quite sure she will fail she is quite certain to pass her form did not only consist of the north tower girls but of the fourthformers from the other towers betty hill alicias friend was one of these she was as quicktongued as alicia but not as quickbrained she came from west tower and alicia and she had often groaned because the authorities were so hardhearted that they would not let betty join alicia in north tower miss grayling the headmistress had once asked miss potts north towers housemistress if she should change betty hill over to north tower as bettys parents had actually written to ask if she would i can manage alicia alone said miss potts or even betty alonebut to have those two together in one house would be quite impossible i should never have a moments peaceand neither would mamzelle i agree with you said miss grayling so a letter was sent to mr and mrs hill regretting that it was impossible to find room for betty in north tower still alicia and betty managed to be very firm friends indeed although they were in different towers meeting in class each day arranging walks and expeditions togetherand planning various wicked and amusing jokes and tricks the north tower fourthformers went eagerly to their classroom after prayers they wanted to choose their desks and to sort out their things to look out of the window clean the blackboard and do the hundred and one things they had done together so often before the twins stood and waited till the other girls had chosen their desks they knew enough not to choose till then by that time of course there were very few desks leftonly those for two east tower girls who were still not back and for clarissa carter and for themselves well sit together of course said connie and put her books and ruths on two adjoining desks they were alas in the hated front row but naturally all the other rows had been taken the back row going first it was the only row really safe enough for whispering or for passing a note or two darrell looked out of the window and wondered if felicity had been to see miss grayling yet she must ask her when she saw her at break miss grayling saw all the new girls together and what she said to them always impressed them and made them determine to do their very best darrell remembered clearly how impressed she had been and how she had made up her mind to be one of the worthwhile people of the world i wonder who will be headgirl this term said alicia interrupting darrells thoughts jeans gone up so she wont be welli bet i shant be i never have and i dont expect i ever will the grayling doesnt trust me i expect sally will be said darrell she was head of the second when we were in that form and a jolly good head she madethough as far as i remember you didnt approve at all alicia no i didnt said alicia candidly i thought i ought to be head but ive got rid of silly ideas like that now i see that im not fitted to be head of anythingi just dont care enough part of this was just bravado but quite a bit of it was truth alicia didnt care enough things were so easy for her that she had never had to try hard for anything and so she didnt care if she had to work jolty hard at lessons as i have to do thought darrell shed care all right we value the things we have to work hard for alicia does things too easily gwendoline had chosen a seat in the front row everyone was most astonished alicia eyed her wonderingly could she be sucking up to miss williams no nobody in the world could do that miss williams simply wouldnt notice it then what was the reason for gwendolines curious choice well of course said alicia suddenly and everyone gazed at her in surprise of course what said betty ive just thought why dear gwendoline has chosen that front seat said alicia maliciously at first i thought shed gone out of her senses but now i know gwendoline scowled at her she was really afraid of alicias sly tongue and she thought it quite likely that alicia had hit on the correct reason but alicia did not enlighten the class just then she smiled sarcastically at gwendoline and said dear gwen i wont give you awayyou realty have a very honourable reason for your choice havent you nobody could imagine what she meant not even bettybut gwendoline knew she had chosen a front desk because she knew that the honourable clarissa carter would have to have one there tooand it would be a very good thing to be next to her and help her she flushed red and said nothing but busied herself with her books miss williams came in at that moment and gwen rushed to hold the door the first day of school was always nice and messy as belinda called it no proper lessons were done but tests were given out principally to check up on the standard of any new girls timetables were made out with much groaning irene always gave hers up in despair although she was so good and neat at both maths and music she was hopeless at a simple thing like making out her own timetable from the big class one it usually ended in belinda doing it for her but as belinda wasnt much better irene was in a perpetual muddle over her timetable appearing in the wrong classroom at the wrong time expecting to have a maths lesson in the sewingroom or sewinglesson in the lab all the mistresses had long ago given up expecting either irene or belinda to be sane and sensible in ordinary matters irene with her great gift for music and belinda with her equally fine gift for drawing seemed to become fouryearolds when they had to tackle ordinary everyday things it was nothing for irene to appear at breakfasttime without her stockings or for belinda to lose most inexplicably every school book she possessed the girls loved them for their amusing ways and admired them for their gifts everyone was busy with something or other that first morning darrell made out a list of classroom dutiesfilling up the inkpots doing the classroom flowers keeping the blackboard clean giving out necessary stationery and so on each of the class had to take on a weeks duty together with another girl during the term just before break miss williams told the girls to tidy up their desks i have something to say to you she said it will only take about two minutes but it is something that i am sure you all want to know shes going to say whos to be headgirl this term whispered sally to darrell look at gwendoline see the look shes put on her face she really thinks she might be it was true gwendoline always hoped she might be head of the form and had enough conceit to think she would make a very good one just as regularly she was disappointed and always would be spoilt selfish girls make poor heads and no teacher in her senses would ever choose gwendoline mary i i think probably most of you will know that jean who passed school cert last year has gone up into the next form said miss williams she does not need to work with the school cert form this term she was headgirl of the upper fourth and now that she has gone we must have another she paused and looked round the listening class i have discussed the matter with miss grayling miss potts mamzelles dupont and rougier said miss williams we are all agreed that we would eke to try darrell rivers as headgirl darrell flushed bright red and her heart beat fast everyone dapped and cheered even gwendoline who always dreaded that alicia might conceivably be chosen one day i am quite sure darrell that our choice is right said miss williams smiling her gentle smile at the blushing darrell i cannot think for one moment that you would do anything to make us regret our choice no miss williams i wont said darrell fervently she wished she could go and tell her parents this very minute headgirl of the upper fourth she had always wanted to be head of something and this was the first time her chance had come she would be the very best headgirl the form had ever had what would felicity say it would be a grand thing for felicity to be able to say my sister of course is head of the upper fourth felicity would be proud and pleased darrell rushed off at break to find felicity and tell her but again she had disappeared how absolutely maddening darrell only had a few minutes she rushed round and about and at last found felicity in the courtyard with june the courtyard was the space that lay inside the hollow oblong of the building that made up malory towers it was very sheltered and here everything was very early indeed it was now gay with tulips rhododendrons and lupins and very lovely to see but darrell didnt see the flowers that morning she rushed at felicity felicity ive got good news for youive been made headgirl of the upper fourth oh darrell how super said felicity im awfully glad oh darrell i must tell youi saw miss grayling this morning and she said to me and all the other new girls exactly the same things that she said to you when you first came she was grand darrells mind took her back to her own first morningstanding opposite miss grayling in her pleasant drawingroom hearing her talk gravely to the listening girls she heard the headmistresss voice one day you will leave school and go out into the world as young women you should take with you a good understanding of many things and a willingness to accept responsibility and show yourselves as women to be loved and trusted i do not count as our successes those who have won scholarships and passed exams though these are good things to do i count as our successes those who learn to be goodhearted and kind sensible and trustable good sound women the world can lean on yes darrell remembered those longago words and was very very glad she was beginning to be one of the successesfor had she not been chosen as headgirl that very day head of the upper fourth the school cert form yes miss graylings grand she said to felicity and youre grand too said felicity proudly to darrell its lovely to have a headgirl for a sister clarissa arrives gwendoline was keeping a good lookout for the coming of the last new upper fourth girl clarissa she was about the only girl in the form who had no special friend and she could see that it wouldnt be much good trying to make friends with the twins because they would only want each other anyway i dont like the look of them much thought gwendoline theyll probably go all out for games and gym and walks why arent there any nice feminine girls hereones who like to talk and read quietly and not always go pounding about the lacrosse field or splash in that horrible pool poor lazy gwendoline she didnt enjoy any of the things that gave the others such fun and pleasure she hated anything that made her run about and she detested the cold water of the pool daphne and marylou didnt like the pool either but they enjoyed tennis and walks neither of them went riding because they were terrified of horses bill who now rode every day on thunder before breakfast scorned daphne marylou and gwendoline because they wouldnt even offer thunder a lump of sugar and screamed if he so much as stamped on the ground she and darrell and the new twins arranged an evening ride twice a week together and miss peters the thirdform mistress and bills great friend came with them they all enjoyed those rides on the cliffs immensely felicity was not allowed to go with them because she was only a firstformer to darrells annoyance she learnt that the only other good rider in the first form was june so once again it seemed as if felicity and june were to be companions and enjoy something together itll end in felicity having to make june her friend thought darrell oh dearits an awful pity i dont like june felicity likes sally so much we ought to like each others friends the mere thought of having june to stay with us in any holidays makes me squirm the north tower upper fourth girls paired off very wellexcept for gwendoline sally always went with darrell of course irene and belinda the two clever madcaps were inseparable and very bad for each other alicia was the only one who had a friend from another tower and she and betty were staunch friends daphne and marylou were friends and mavis hung on to them when she could they liked her and did not mind being a threesome sometimes bill had no special friend but she didnt want one thunder was hers bill was better with boys than with girls because having seven brothers she understood boys and not girls she might have been a boy herself in the way she acted she was the only fourthformer who chose to learn carpentry from mr sutton and did not in the least mind going with the first and secondformers who enjoyed his teaching so much she had already produced a pipe for her father a ship for her youngest brother and a bowlstand for her mother and was as proud of these as any of the good embroiderers were of their cushions or the weavers of their scarves so it was really only gwendoline who had no one to go with no one to ask her for her company on a walk no one to giggle with in a comer she pretended not to mind but she did mind very much but perhaps now she would have her chance when the honourable clarissa came how pleased her mother would be if she had a really nice friend gwendoline ran her mind back over the friends she had tried to make there was maryloustupid little marylou there was daphne who had seemed to be so very friendly one term and lien had suddenly become friends with marylou there was mavis who had had such a wonderful voice and was going to be an opera singer gwendoline would have liked such a grand person for a friend in after life but mavis had fallen ill and lost her voice and gwendoline didnt want her any more then there had been zerelda the american girl who had now leftbut she had no time for gwendoline gwendoline thought mournfully of all these failures she didnt for one moment think that her lack of friends was her own fault it was just the horridness of the other girls if only only only she could find somebody like herselfsomebody who had never been to school before coming to malory towers who had only had a governess who didnt play games and somebody who had wealthy parents who would ask her to go and stay in the holidays so gwendoline waited in hopes for clarissas arrival she imagined a beautiful girl with lovely clothes arriving in a magnificent carthe honourable clarissa my friend thought gwendoline and she imagined herself at halfterm saying to her mother and miss winter her old governess mother i want you to meet the honourable clarissa carter my best friend she did not tell any of the girls these thoughts she knew the words they would use to her if they guessed what she was planningsnob hypocrite fraud sucking up to somebody just like dear gwendoline mary clarissa did not arrive till teatime gwendoline was sitting at table with the others so she did not see her until the headmistress suddenly appeared with a strange girl gwendoline looked up without much interest the girl was small and undersizedlookinga secondformer perhaps she wore glasses with thick lenses and had a wire round her teeth to keep them back her only beauty seemed to be her hair which was thick and wavy and a lovely auburn colour gwendoline took another slice of breadandbutter and looked for the jam the new girl was so nervous that she was actually trembling darrell noticed this and was sorry for her she too had felt like trembling when she first came and had faced so many girls she didnt knowand here was a poor creature who really was trembling to darrells surprise miss grayling brought the girl up to the upper fourth table mamzelle dupont was taking tea and sat at the head oh mamzelle said miss grayling here is clarissa carter the last new girl for the upper fourth can you find a seat for her and give her some tea then perhaps your headgirl can look after her when tea is finished gwendoline almost dropped her breadandbutter in surprise goodness she had nearly missed her chance could this small ugly girl really be clarissa it was so she must hurry up and put her plan into action there was a space beside gwendoline and she stood up in such a hurry that she almost knocked over daphnes cup of tea clarissa can sit by me she said there is room here clarissa only too glad to sit down and hide herself sack gladly into the place beside gwendoline alicia nudged darrell got going quickly hasnt she she whispered and darrell chuckled gwendoline was at her very sweetest sicklysweet was the name given by alicia to this particular form of friendliness shown by gwendoline she leant towards clarissa and smiled in a most friendly way welcome to malory towers i expect you are tired and hungry have some breadandbutter i dont think i could eat any thank you said clarissa almost sick with nervousness thank you all the same oh you must have something said gwendoline and took a piece of breadandbutter ill put some jam on it for you its apricotvery nice for a wonder clarissa didnt dare to object she sat huddled up as if she wanted to make herself as small and unnoticeable as possible she nibbled at the breadandbutter but couldnt seem to eat more than a bit of it gwendoline chattered away thinking how good and sweet she must seem to the others putting this nervous new girl at her ease in such a friendly manner but only mamzelle was deceived the dear kind gwendoline she thought ah she is a stupid child at her french but see how charming she is to this poor plain girl who shakes with nerves sucking up said everyone else round the table they said nothing to clarissa feeling that it was enough for the new girl to cope with gwen without having to deal with anyone else as well marylou liked the look of clarissa in spite of her thick glasses and wire round her front teethbut then marylou always felt friendly towards anyone as timid as herself they were about the only people she wasnt afraid of after tea mamzelle spoke to darrell darrell you will take care of clarissa nestce pas she will feel strange at first la pauvre petite mamzelle im awfully sorry but ive got to go to a meeting of all the headgirls of the forms said darrell its in five minutes time perhaps sallyor belindaor ill look after her said gwendoline promptly thrilled that darrell had to go to a meeting ill show her round ill be very pleased to she gave clarissa a beaming smile that startled the new girl and made everyone else feel slightly sick she slipped her arm through clarissas come along she said in a sort of voice one uses to a very small child wheres your nightcase ill show you the dormy youve got a very nice place in it she went off with clarissa and everyone made faces and grinned trust our gwendoline mary to show a bit of determination over things like this said alicia what a nasty little snob honestly i dont think gwendoline has altered one bit for the better since she came to malory towers i think youre right said darrell considering the matter with her head on one side its really rather queeri would have thought that being even a few terms here would have made everyone better in some wayand gwen has been here yearsbut shes just the same sly mean lazy little suckerup how has it made you better darrell said alicia teasingly i cant say ive noticed much difference in you she was decent to start with said sally loyally anyway ive conquered my hot temper said dar tell i havent flown out in a rage for terms and termsyou know i havent thats one thing malory towers has done for me dont boast too soon said alicia grinning ive seen a glint in your eye lately darrellaha yes i have you be careful darrell was about to deny this stoutly when she stopped herself and felt her cheeks going red yesshe had felt her eyes glinting as alicia used to call it when she spoke to that pest of a june well she could glint surely couldnt she there was nothing wrong in thatso long as she didnt lose her temper and she certainly wasnt going to do that i ill glint at you in a minute alicia she said with a laugh a headgirl glint tooso just you be careful what you say darrell has a glint the upper fourth soon began to settle down to its work miss williams was a fine teacher and was quite determined to have excellent results in the school certificate exam mamzelle dupont and mamzelle rougier both taught the upper fourth but though actually mamzelle rougier was the better teacher plump little mamzelle dupont got better results because she was friendly and had a great sense of humour the girls worked better for her than for the other mamzelle this term there was an armed truce between the two french mistresses the english mistresses regarded them with great amusement never knowing from one term to the next whether the two frenchwomen would be bosom friends bitter enemies or dignified rivals miss carton the history mistress knew that the school certificate form was well up to standard except for miseries like gwendoline who didnt even know the kings of england and couldnt see that they mattered anyhow she used her sarcastic tongue on gwendoline a good deal these days to try and whip her into some show of work and gwen hated her the girls grumbled because they had to work so hard in that lovely summer term just when we want to go swimming and play tennis and laze about in the flowery courtyard weve got to stew at our books said alicia i shall take my prep out into the open air tonight i bet miss williams would let us surprisingly miss williams said yes she knew that she could trust most of the upper fourth not to play about when they were supposed to be working and she thought that darrell was a strong enough headgirl to keep everyone up to the mark if necessary so out they went after tea and took cushions to sit on in the evening sun gwendoline didnt want to go she was the only one of course you really seem to loathe the open air said darrell in surprise come on outa bit more fresh air and exercise would take off some of your fat and get rid of those spots on your nose dont make personal remarks said gwendoline nose in air youre as bad as aliciaand everyone knows shes been dragged up not brought up clarissa who was with her looked at gwendoline in surprise gwen had been so sweet and gracious to her that it was quite a shock to hear her make a remark like this gwen was quick to see the look and slipped her arm through clarissas if youre taking your prep out ill take mine of course she said but lets sit away from the sun i hate getting freckled betty saw alicia sitting out in the courtyard and came to join her darrell frowned now there would be nonsense and giggling and no work done belinda and irene began to listen to the joke that betty was telling alicia and irene gave one of her sudden explosive snorts when it was finished everyone looked up startled oh i say thats super roared irene here betty tell the others darrell looked up she was headgirl of the form and she must stop this she knew she spoke out at once betty stop gassing alicia you know jolly well were supposed to be doing our prep dont talk to me as if i was a firstformer said alicia nettled at darrells sharp tone well i shall if you behave like one said darrell shes glinting alicialook out shes glinting said irene with a giggle everyone looked at darrell and smiled darrell certainly had a glint in her eye im not glinting she said dont be idiotic i glint thou glintest he glints she glints chanted betty we glint you glint they glint shut up betty and go away said darrell feeling angry you dont belong to our prep go and join your own ive done it miss glint said betty shall i help you with yours to darrells horror she felt the old familiar surge of anger creeping over her she clenched her fists and spoke sharply to betty again you heard what i said clear out or ill take the whole of this prep back indoors betty looked angry but alicia nudged her go on shes on the boil already ill meet you after weve done prep betty went whistling darrell bent her red face over her book had she been too dictatorial but what were you to do with someone like betty nobody said anything more and prep went peacefully on accompanied by one or two groans from irene and deep sighs from gwendoline clarissa sat beside her working slowly gwen copied whatever she could nobody could cure her of this habit it seemed after an hour miss williams came into the courtyard pleased to see the north tower upper fourth working so peacefully and well times up she said and ive a message from your games mistress the pool is just right now for bathing so you can all go down there for half an hour as you had to miss your bathe yesterday hurrah said irene and threw her book into the air it went into the nearby pool and had to be retrieved very hurriedly idiot said belinda almost falling in herself as she tried to fish out the book i suppose you think thats your history book youre drowning well it isntits mine have we all got to go gwendoline asked miss williams pathetically ive been working so hard i dont feel like swimming dear mecan you actually swim yet gwendoline said miss williams with an air of surprise everyone knew that gwendoline could still only flap a few strokes in the water and then go under with a scream oh we dont all need to go do we said marylou who could swim but still didnt like the water much neither did daphne and she added her pleas to the others youre all going said miss williams you are having to work very hard and these little relaxations are good for you go and change at once thrilled at the thought of an unexpected evening bathe darrell sally and alicia rushed to the changingroom darrell had forgotten her annoyance with alicia but alicia hadnt alicia bore malice which was a pity so she was rather cool to darrell who most unfortunately for alicia didnt notice the coolness at all the others followed chattering and laughing with a rather mournful tail composed of gwen daphne and marylou clarissa came to watch she was not allowed to swim or to play tennis because she had a weak heart lucky thing said gwendoline getting into her bathingsuit no swimming no tennisi wish i had a weak heart what a wicked thing to say said darrell really shocked to wish yourself a thing like that it must be simply horrible to keep on and on having to take care of yourself and thinly i mustnt do this i mustnt do that it is horrible said clarissa in her small shy voice if it hadnt been for my heart id not have been taught at homeid have come to school like any other girl its got much better lately though and thats why i was allowed to come at last this was a long speech for clarissa to make usually she was quite tonguetied as it was she went red as she spoke and when she had finished she hung her head and tried to get behind gwendoline poor old clarissa said gwendoline sympathetically you mustnt do too much you know would you know if you had done too much oh yes my heart begins to flutter inside meas if i had a bird there or something said clarissa its awful it makes me want to lie down and pant really said gwendoline pulling her towelwrap round her well you know clarissa i shouldnt be a bit surprised if i hadnt a weak heart too that nobody knows about if i try to swim for long i get absolutely panickyand after a hot game of tennis my heart pumps like a piston its really painful nice to hear you have a heart said alicia in her smoothest voice where do you keep it gwendoline tossed her head and went off with clarissa beast isnt she her voice floated back to the others i cant bear her nobody likes her really alicia chuckled id love to know what sort of poisonous nonsense gwendoline mary is pouring into poor clarissas ears she said i dont think we ought to kt gwendoline take complete charge of her like this its not fair you ought to do something about it darrell why dont you darrell did not like this direct attack she suddenly realized that alicia was rightshe ought to have made certain that gwen didnt take such utter and complete charge of the rather weak little clarissa she would get all the wrong ideas in her very first termand the ideas you had at the beginning were apt to stick all right she said in a rather snappy tone give me a chancel clarissa has only been here a few days my dear darrell youre glinting again said alicia with a laugh that provoked darrell even more she took hold of herself hastily really she was getting quite touchy it was fun down at the pool the good swimmers had races of course marylou bobbed up and down in the shallow end swinging a few strokes every now and again she always got in quickly even though she hated the water daphne was in too shivering as usual but bobbing beside marylou hoping that darrell wouldnt make her join in the racing mavis was swimming slowly she bad got over her dislike of the water but had to be careful not to overswim or play too much tennis because of her illness the year before only gwendoline still stood shivering on the brink alicia sally and darrell longed to push her in but it was too much fag to get out of the pool if gwen doesnt get in soon she wont get in at all said alicia order her in darrell go on put that glint in your eye and give one of your orders but not even darrells shouts persuaded poor gwendoline to do more than wet her toes she had got hot sitting in the courtyard and now the pool felt icycold ooooh it was clarissa who made her get in she came running up to stand beside gwendoline slid on a slimy patch of rock bumped hard into gwendoline and knocked her straight into the water splash in went gwendoline with a terrible yell of fright the girls clutched at one another and laughed till they cried look at poor clarissas face wept darrell shes simply horrified who did that demanded a furiously angry gwendoline bobbing up and spitting out water beasts all of you when gwendoline heard that it was clarissa who had pushed her in she didnt believe it she made her way over to where an apologetic clarissa was standing who pushed me in clarissa she demanded they keep saying it was you the idiots as if youd do a thing like that oh gwendoline im so very sorry but actually it zoos me said clarissa quite distressed i slipped and fell and bumped against youand in you went of course i wouldnt have done it on purpose im most terribly sorry about it oh thats all right then said gwendoline pleased to see such a very apologetic clarissa it did give me an awful shock of courseand i hurt my foot against the bottom of the poolbut still it was an accident clarissa was more apologetic still which was balm to gwendolines wounded feelings she liked to have the honourable clarissa apologizing so humbly she made up her mind to be very sweet and forgiving and then clarissa would think more than ever what a nice friend she was for anyone to have but the others spoilt it they would keep coming up and yelling jolly good push to clarissa and well done clarissayou got her in nicely and i say clarissa that was a fine shove do it again but i didnt push her protested clarissa time and time again you know i didnt never seen such a good shove in my life said alicia and really gwendoline began to be quite doubtful as to whether clarissa really had meant to push her or not then unfortunately clarissa suddenly saw the funny side of all the shouted remarks and began to laugh helplessly this made gwen really cross and she was so huffy with clarissa that in great alarm clarissa began to apologize all over again look at the twins said alicia to sally sally looked and laughed connie was carefully rubbing ruth dry and ruth was standing patiently waiting for her sister to finish why doesnt connie leave her alone said sally ruth can do everything for herselfbut connie always makes out she cant shes too domineering for words and shes not nearly so good as ruth is at lessons said alicia ruth helps her every night or she would never do the work shes far behind ruth and yet she domineers over her the whole time said darrell joining in i hate to see itand i hate to see ruth putting up with it too speak to her about it said alicia at once headgirl arent you darrell bit her lip why did alicia keep on and on twitting her like this she thought that perhaps it was partly envyalicia knew she would not really make a good headgirl herself and envied those who were and tried to make them uncomfortable she darrell ought not to take any notice but she couldnt help feeling annoyed about it youve got a lot on hand now havent you went on alicia rubbing herself dry looking after young felicityseeing that clarissa doesnt get too much poison from dear gwendoline trying to buck up ruth a bit and make her stand up for herselfticking off betty when she spoils our prep darrell felt herself beginning to boil again then a cool hand was laid on her shoulder and she heard sallys calm voice everything in good time its a pity to rush things and spoil themisnt it darrell you cant put things right all at once darrell heaved a sigh of relief that was what she ought to have saidin a nice calm voice thank goodness sally had said it for her she gave sally a grateful smile she determined to look up felicity a bit more and try to prise her away from that objectionable june she would put one of the others on to clarissa to offset gwendolines influenceand she would certainly have a few quiet words with ruth and tell her not to let connie make such a baby of her why thought darrell its quite absurdwhenever any of us speak to ruth connie always answers for her i really wonder she doesnt answer for her in class too it was quite true that ruth hardly ever answered for herself alicia might say to her ruth can you lend me that french dicky for a moment but it would be connie who said yes heres the dictionarycatch and sally might say ruth dont you want a new ruleryours is broken but it would be connie who answered no thanks sally she can use mine it was annoying too to see how connie always walked a little in front of ruth always offered an explanation of anything before her twin could say a word always did any asking necessary hadnt ruth got a soul of her ownor was she just a weak echo or shadow of her stronger twin it was a puzzle darrell decided to speak to ruth the next day and she found a good chance when both of them were washing paintingjars in the cloakroom how do you like malory towers ruth she asked wondering if ruth would be able to answer if connie wasnt there i i like it said ruth i hope youre happy here said darrell wondering how to lead up to what she really wanted to say there was a pause then ruth answered politely yes thank you she didnt sound happy at all darrell thought why ever not she was well up to the standard of work she was good at all games there was nothing dislikeable about herand the summer term was fun she ought to be very happy indeed erruth said darrell thinking desperately that sally would be much better at this kind of thing than she was erwe think that you let yourself beerwell nursed a bit too much by connie couldnt youerwell stand on your own feet a bit more i mean i know what you mean all right said ruth in a funny fierce voice if anyone knows what you mean i do darrell thought that ruth was hurt and angry she tried again of course i know youre twinsand twins are always so close to one another andand attachedso i quite understand connie being so fond of you and you dont understand anything at all said ruth talk to connie if you like but you wont alter things one tiny bit and with that she walked out stiffly carrying her pile of clean paintjars darrell was left by herself in the cloakroom puzzled and rather cross its not going to be any good to talk to connie im sure thought darrell rinsing out the last of the jars shed be as fierce as ruth shes ruining ruth but if ruth wants to be ruined and made just a meek shadow of connie well let her i cant see that i can stop her she took her pile of paintjars away and made up her mind that that particular difficulty could not be put right you cant drag twins away from each other if theyve always been together and feel like one person she decided why some twins know when the other is in pain or ill even if they are far apart its no good putting those two against me they must do as they like the next thing to do was to ferret out felicity and see how she was getting on she ought to be more or less settled down now perhaps she had made some more friends if only she had others as well as june it wouldnt matter so muchbut darrell felt that the strongminded june would cling like a leech to someone like felicity if felicity had no other friend at all so she found felicity in break and asked her to come for a walk with her that evening felicity looked pleased to go for a walk with the headgirl of the upper fourth was a great honour oh yesid love to come she said i dont think junes fixed anything for tonight what does it matter if she has said darrell impatiently you can put her off surely i havent seen anything of you lately i like miss potts said felicity changing the subject as she often did when darrell got impatient im still a bit scared of herbut my works a bit in advance of the form really darrell so i can sit back and take things easy this first term rather nice yes jolly nice agreed darrell thats what comes of going to a good prep schoolyou always find youre in advance of the lowest form work when you go to a public schoolbut if you go to a rotten prep school it takes years to catch up erhow is june in her work brilliantwhen she likes said felicity with a grin shes awfully good funfrightfully funny you know rather like alicia i should think too like alicia darrell thought to herself remembering how wonderful she had thought alicia in her first term at malory towers isnt there anyone else you like felicity she asked her sister oh yesi like most of my form said felicity they dont seem to like june much though and sit on her hard but shes like indiarubber bounces up again theres one girl i like awfullyher names susan shes been here two terms susan yes shes fine said darrell plays lacrosse awfully well for a kidand shes good at gym too i remember seeing her in a gym display last term yes shes good at games agreed felicity but june says susans too pi for wordswont do anything she shouldnt and she thinks shes dull too she would said darrell well im glad you like susan why dont you make a threesomeyou and june and susan i dont think junes a good person to have for an only friend why you dont even know her said felicity in surprise anyway she wouldnt want susan in a threesome a bell rang in the distance well see you this evening said darrell well go on the cliffsbut dont you go and bring june mind i want you to myself right said felicity looking pleased but alas that evening a meeting was called of all the school certificate girls and darrell had to go to it she wondered if she could possibly squeeze time in for even a short walk with felicity no she couldntshe had that essay to do as well she sent a message to her sister by a secondformer hey felicity said the secondformer compliments from headgirl darrell rivers and she says she cant take baby sister for a walkywalk tonight felicity stared at her indignantly you know jolly well she didnt say that she said what did she say just that said the cheeky secondformer and strolled off felicity translated the message correctly and was disappointed darrell cant go for a walk tonight she told june i suppose shes got a meeting or something i bet she hasnt said that young lady scornfully i tell you these fourthformers like alicia and darrell dont want to be bothered with usand we jolly well wont go bothering them come onwell go for a walk together gwendoline and clarissa darrell forgot about clarissa for a day or two because for some reason the days suddenly became very full up indeed headgirls seemed to have quite a lot of duties darrell hadnt thought of and there was such a lot of prep to do this term gwendoline now had clarissa very firmly attached to her side she sat next to her in class and offered to help her whenever she couldbut this usually ended not in gwen helping clarissa but the other way round their beds were next to each others at night for gwendoline had persuaded softhearted marylou to change beds with her so that she might be next to clarissa shes never been to school before you see marylou she said and as i hadnt either before i came here i do understand how she feels its at night you feel things worst id eke to be near her just to say a few words till she settles down properly marylou thought it was extraordinary of gwendoline to develop such a kind heart all of a sudden but she felt that it ought to be encouraged anywayso she changed beds and to darrells annoyance one night there was gwendoline next to clarissa whispering away like anything who told you you could change beds she demanded marylou said gwendoline in a meek voice butwhy in the world did you ask marylou said darrell im the one to ask surely no because it was marylous bed i wanted to change over darrell explained gwen still in a meek voice she saw that darrell was annoyed and decided to offer to change back again then surely darrell would say all right keep next to clarissa but of course if youd rather i didnt sleep next to clarissathough i only wanted to help her said gwendoline in a martyrlike voice oh stay there said darrell who could never bear it when gwendoline put on her martyract so gwendoline rejoicing inwardly did stay there and was able to whisper what she thought were comforting words to clarissa at night she was too far away from darrells bed to be heardand in any case darrell usually tired out with work and games slept very quickly and heard nothing clarissa thought gwendoline was really the kindest girl she had ever metnot that she had met many however feeling lonely and strange she had welcomed gwendolines friendliness eagerly she had listened to endless talks about gwendolines uninteresting family who all seemed to be wonderful according to gwen and yet appeared to the listening clarissa to be uniformly dull she said very little about her own family though gwendoline questioned her as much as she dared longing to hear of rolls royces and yachts and mansions but clarissa merely spoke of their little country house and their carnot even cars thought the disappointed gwendoline as clarissa had a weak heart and did no games or gym she hadnt much chance to get together with the other girls she either had to rest at these times or merely go to watch which she found rather boring so she looked forward eagerly to the times she could be with gwendoline who was practically her only companion that is till darrell really took the matter in hand seeing gwendolines fair head and clarissas auburn one bent together over a jigsaw puzzle one fine evening when everyone should have been out of doors she made up her mind that something really must be done she went to mavis after all mavis had no real friend she just made a threesome with daphne and marylou she could quite well spare some of her time for clarissa mavis said darrell we think that clarissa is seeing a bit too much of darling gwendoline mary will you try and get clarissa to yourself a bit and talk to her mavis was surprised and pleased yes of course darrell she said id love to secretly she thought that the small bespectacled clarissa was quite well paired off with gwendolinebut if darrell thought otherwise then it must be sol so obediently she went to try to prise clarissa away from the closeclinging gwen come down to the pool with me clarissa she said smiling pleasantly im not bathing todaybut well go and watch the others they want someone to throw in pennies for them to dive for clarissa got up at once gwendoline frowned oh clarissayou cant go just yet why weve nothing much to do said clarissa surprised you come too no i feel rather tired said gwendoline untruthfully hoping that clarissa would stay with her but she didnt she went off with mavis rather flattered at having been asked by her clarissa had not much opinion of herself she thought herself dull and plain and uninteresting and indeed she certainly appeared so to most of the girls darrell beamed at mavis good old mavis she was doing her best thought darrell pleased but poor clarissa didnt have much of a time with gwendoline afterwards gwendoline was rather cold and gave her very short cool answers when she returned from the pool clarissa was puzzled i sayyou didnt really mind my going off with mavis for a bit did you she said at last gwendoline spoke solemnly clarissa you dont know as much about mavis as i do shes not the sort of girl your family would like you to be friends with do you know what she did last year she heard of a talentspotting competition in a town near hereyou know a very common show with perfectly dreadful people in itand she actually went off by herself to sing in the show clarissa was truly horrified partly because she knew that she herself would never have had the courage even to think of such a thing what happened she said tell me wellmavis missed the last bus home said gwendoline still very solemn and miss peters found her lying by the road about three oclock in the morning after that she was terribly ill and lost her voice she thought she had a wonderful voice before that you knowthough i cant say i ever thought much of itand so it was a very good punishment for her to lose it poor mavis said clarissa well personally i think she ought to have been expelled said gwendoline ive only told you this clarissa because i want you to see that mavis isnt really the land of person to make friends withthat is if you were thinking of it oh no i wasnt said clarissa hastily i only just went down to the pool with her gwen i wont even do that if you dont want me to poor weak clarissa had said just what gwendoline hoped she would say and the next time that mavis came to ask her to go for a short walk with her she refused dont bother clarissa said gwendoline she really doesnt want you hanging round her the indignant mavis walked away and reported to darrell that she wasnt going to bother about that silly little clarissa any more she had better find someone else what about daphne daphne came by at that moment and heard her name in a fit of annoyance darrell told her that mavis had been rebuffed by clarissa and that mavis had suggested that she daphne should have a try what about it i dont mind having a shotjust to spoil darling gwendoline marys fun said daphne with a grin so she tried her hand at clarissa too only to be met with excuses and evasions gwendoline had quite a bit to tell clarissa about daphne too you see clarissa said gwendoline daphne isnt really fit to be at a school like this you mustnt repeat what i tell youbut a year or two ago daphne was found out to be a thief clarissa stared at gwendoline in horror i dont believe it she said well just as you like said gwen but she was a thiefshe stole purses and money and broochesand this wasnt the only school shed stolen at either when it was found out miss grayling made her come into our commonroom and confess everything to usand we had to decide whether or not she should be expelled its as true as im standing here clarissa was quite pale she looked across the courtyard to where daphne was laughing with marylou she couldnt believe itand yet gwendoline would never never dare to tell such a lie as that anddid you all say thatyou didnt want her expelled she said at last well i was the first to say she should have a chance and id stick by her said gwen untruthfully for it had been little marylou who had said that not gwen so she was kept onbut as you can see clarissa she wouldnt be a really nice friend to have would she youd never feel you could trust her no i suppose not said clarissa oh deari hate thinking nasty things about mavis and daphne like this i hope there are no more nasty tales to tell did you ever hear how darrell slapped me about a dozen times in the swimmingpool for nothing at all said gwen who had never forgotten or forgiven this episode i had a bad leg for ages after that and you know that girl in the fifthellen well she tried td get hold of the exam papers and cheat by looking at the questions the night before the exam she did really dont said clarissa beginning to think that malory towers was a nest of cheats thieves and idiots and even bill that everyone thinks such a lot of was in awful disgrace last year through continual deceit and disobedience went on the poisonous voice in clarissas ear do you know miss peters had to threaten to send bills horse thunder away to her home because she was so disobedient i dont want to hear any more said clarissa unhappily i really dont well its all true said gwendoline forgetting her own record of deceit and unkindness and not even realizing how she had distorted the facts so that though most of them were capable of simple and kindly explanations she had presented them as pictures of real badness darrell came up determined to get clarissa away from gwendolines everlasting whispering hey clarissa she called in a jolly voice youre just the person im looking for come and help me to pick some flowers for our classroom will you clarissa sat as if rooted to the spot come on called darrell impatiently i shant bite youor even slap you oh dear thought clarissa getting up slowly and remembering gwens tale of the dozen slaps darrell had given her i hope she doesnt go for me has dear gwendoline been regaling you with tales of our dark dreadful deeds said darrell and then as she saw clarissa go red she knew that she had hit the nail on the head bother gwendoline she thought she really is a poisonous little snake a day off three or four weeks went by the school certificate girls worked very hard indeed and some of them began to look rather pale miss williams decided it was time to slack off for a bit go for an allday picnic she suggested go to langley hill and enjoy yourselves langley hill was a favourite spot for picnics it was a lovely walk there along the cliff and from the top there was a magnificent view of the countryside and the sea oh thanks miss williams that would be super said darrell smashing said alicia which was the favourite adjective of all the firstformers at the moment often ridiculed by the older girls langley hill said clarissa why thats where my old nurse lives write and ask her if we could go and have tea with her said gwendoline who didnt like what she called waspy picnics at all it would be nice for her to see you you always think of such kind things gwendoline said clarissa i certainly will write she will get us a wizard tea i know shes a marvellous cook so she wrote to her old nurse who lived at the foot of langley hill old mrs lucy wrote back at once were to go to her for tea said clarissa she says shell have a real spread what fun wed better ask permission said gwendoline suddenly thinking that darrell might prove obstinate if the idea was suddenly sprung on her on the day of the picnic go and ask miss williams clarissa oh noyou go said clarissa who was always scared of asking any mistress anything but gwendoline knew better than to ask a favour of miss williams miss williams saw right through gwendoline and might say no just on principle if gwen went to ask her a favour she didnt trust gwendoline any farther than she could see her so clarissa had to goand with many stammerings and stutterings she at last came out with what she wanted to askand handed over her old nurses invitation yes you can go there for tea so long as you take another girl with you said miss williams thinking what an unattractive child clarissa was with her thicklensed glasses and the wire round her teeth she couldnt help looking so plain of coursebut that dreadful hangdog expression she always wore made it worse the day of the picnic dawned bright and clear and promised to be lovely and hot a whole day off rejoiced darrell and such a day too i vote we take our bathingthings and bathe at the foot of langley hill theres a cove there youll have to take your lunch with you but you can have your tea at the little teaplace on top of the hill said miss williams ive asked the kitchen staff to let you go and help them cut sandwiches and cakes to take with you be off with you nowand come back ready to work twice as hard they clattered off and in half an hour were streaming up the cliffpath on their way to langley hill each girl carrying her share of the lunch i should think weve got far too much said mavis do you i dont think weve got enough said darrell astonished but then my idea of a good picnic lunch is probably twice the size of yours mavis youre a poor eater gwendoline and clarissa panted along agood way behind the others darrell called to them to hurry up she was annoyed to see the two together again after all her efforts to separate them clarissa gets a bad heart if she hurries called gwendoline reproachfully you know that darrell oh gweni hardly ever feel my heart this term said clarissa i believe im almost cured i can easily hurry well said gwendoline solemnly im just a bit worried about my heart clarissa it does funny things lately sort of flutters like a bird you know clarissa looked alarmed oh gwenthats just what mine used to do youll have to be careful oughtnt you to see a doctor oh no i dont think so said gwen bravely i hate going to matron about anything she makes such a fuss and shes quite likely not to believe what i say shes very hard you know clarissa had been to matron once or twice and had thought her very kind and understanding she didnt know that gwendoline had tried to stuff matron up with all kinds of tales term after term whenever she wanted to get out of anything strenuous and that matron now consistently disbelieved anything that gwendoline had to say she merely handed out large doses of very disgusting medicine no matter what gwen complained of in fact alicia said that she kept a special large bottle labelled medicine for gwen on the top shelf of her cupboard a specially nasty concoction made up specially for malingerers look at connie said gwen as they gradually came nearer to the others carrying ruths bag for her as well as her own how can ruth put up with it well theyre twins said clarissa i expect they like to do things for each other lets catch them up and talk to them but the conversation as usual was carried on by connie not by ruth what a heavenly day for a picnic said clarissa looking at ruth beautiful said connie and began to talk about the food in the bags she carried gwen spoke to ruth did you find the pencil you lostthat silver one she asked connie answered for her as usual oh yesit was at the back of her desk after all ruth look at that butterfly said clarissa determined to make ruth speak whatever is it its a fritillary pearlbordered answered connie before ruth had even got a look at the lovely thing then gwen and clarissa gave it up you just couldnt get ruth to speak before connie got her word in they had the picnic in sight of langley hill because they were much too hungry to wait till they had climbed up to the top gwendoline was very thankful she was already puffing and blowing youre too fat thats whats the matter with you gwendoline said alicia unsympathetically gosh what a wonderful scowl youve put on nowone of your best a real snooty scowl belinda overheard and rolled over to be nearer to them she gazed at gwendoline and felt all over herself for her small sketchbook which was always somewhere about her person yesits a peach of a scowl she said a smasher hold it gwen hold it i must add it to my collection clarissa ruth and connie looked surprised a collection of scowls said connie i never heard of that before yes ive got a nice little bookful of all gwendolines different scowls said belinda the one that goes like thisand she pulled a dreadful faceand this oneand this one you must have seen hundreds of times she pulled a variety of faces and everyone roared belinda could be very funny when she lied oh quickgwen is scowling again she said and flipped open her little book you know one term i stalked gwen the whole time waiting for her scowls but she got wise to me the next term and i hardly collected a single one ill show you my collection when i get back if you like clarissa erwelli dont know if gwen would like it she began of course she wouldnt said belinda her quick pencil moved over the paper she tore off the page and gave it to clarissa there you aretheres your darling gwendoline mary she said clarissa gasped yesit was gwen to the lifeand looking most unpleasant too wicked belindaher malicious pencil could catch anyones expression and pin it down on paper immediately clarissa didnt know what in the world to do with the papertear it up and offend belindaor keep it and offend gwendoline fortunately the wind solved the problem for her by suddenly whipping it out of her fingers and tossing it over the hedge she was very relieved it was a lovely picnic there were sandwiches of all kinds buns biscuits and slices of fruit cake the girls ate every single thing and then lazed in the sun darrell reluctantly decided at three oclock that if they were going to have tea at the top of langley hill and bathe afterwards they had better go now oh darrellclarissa and i have been given permission by miss williams to go and have tea with clarissas old nurse mrs lucy who lives at the foot of the hill said gwendoline in the polite voice she used when she knew she was saying something that the other person was going to object to well this is the first ive heard of it said darrell why ever couldnt you say so before i suppose its true youre not saying this just to get out of climbing langley hill and bathing afterwards of course not said gwendoline with enormous dignity ask clarissa clarissa feeling rather nervous of darrell produced the invitation from mrs lucy all right said darrell tossing it back how like you gwen to get out of a climb and a bathe jolly clever arent you gwendoline did not deign to reply but looked at clarissa as if to say what a headgirl disbelieving us like that the girls left gwen and clarissa and went to climb the great hill the two left behind sprawled on the grass contentedly im just as pleased not to climb that hill anyway said gwen this hot afternoon tool i wish them joy of it they sat a little longer then gwen decided that she was being bitten by something she always decided this when she wanted to make a move indoors so they set off to find mrs lucys cottage and arrived about a quarterpast four the old lady was waiting she ran out to greet clarissa and petted her as if she was a small child then she saw gwendoline and appeared to be most astonished that there were no other girls besides but ive got tea for twenty she said i thought the whole class was coming miss clarissa dear oh my what shall we do can you go after the others and fetch them an exciting plan you go after them gwen said clarissa urgently i darent tear up that steep hill theyll be halfway up by now no indeed miss clarissa i wouldnt dream of you racing up that hill and you only just recovering from that bad heart of yours said mrs lucy at once i meant this other girl to go gwendoline was certainly not going to go chasing up langley hill in the hot sun to fetch back people she disliked to enjoy a fine tea let them go without she pulled rather a long face i will go of course she said but i think theres something a bit wrong with my heart tooit flutters you know when ive done something rather energetic it makes me feel i simply must lie down oh dearthats how i used to feel cried clarissa sympathetically i forgot you spoke about your heart today gwen well it cant be helped we cant get the others back here to tea what a pity mourned mrs lucy and took them inside her dear little cottage set on a table inside was a most marvellous homemade tea there were tongue sandwiches with lettuce hardboiled eggs to eat with breadandbutter great chunks of newmade cream cheese potted meat ripe tomatoes grown in mrs lucys brothers greenhouse gingerbread cake fresh from the oven shortbread a great fruit cake with almonds crowding the top biscuits of all kinds and six jam sandwiches gracious said gwen and clarissa in awe what a spread nurse its too marvellous for words said clarissa but oh dear what a waste and such an expense too oh now you neednt think about that said mrs lucy at once your sister came to see me yesterday her thats married and she gave me some money to spend on getting a good spread for you all so here it isand only the two of you to eat it well certainly miss clarissa you did give me to understand in your letter that the whole class were coming no nursei said the whole of our form from north tower were coming for a picnic and could we come and have tea with you explained clarissa i suppose you thought that we meant the whole lot im so very sorry sit you down and eat said mrs lucy but even with such a wonderful spread the two girls could not eat very much after their very good lunch gwen looked at the masses of food in despair and then mrs lucy had a brainwave dont you have midnight feasts or anything like that at your school she said to clarissa i remember your sister her thats married used to tell of them when she went to boardingschool a midnight feast said gwen remembering the one or two she had enjoyed at malory towers my wordthats a super idea mrs lucy could we really have the food for that of course you can then it will get to the hungry mouths it was made for said old mrs lucy her eyes twinkling at the two girls but how will you take it clarissa and gwen considered there was far too much for them to carry by themselves they would simply have to have help clarissa was very excited a midnight feast she had read of such thingsand now she was going to join in oneand provide the food tool i know said gwen suddenly we have to meet darrell and the others at halfpast five at the end of the lane down therethe one that leads up from the cove we will bring some of the girls back here to help to carry the stuff good idea agreed clarissa her eyes shining behind their thick glasses so just before halfpast five by mrs lucys clock gwen and clarissa slipped along to the end of the lane to meet the others but only two were thereand very cross the two were they were alicia and belinda well do you know its a quarter to six and weve jolly well been waiting for you two for twenty minutes began alicia indignantly the others have gone on weve had to wait behind havent you got watches no said gwendoline im so sorry im afraid mrs lucys clock must have been slow well for goodness sake put your best foot forward now grumbled alicia but gwen caught at her arm wait a bit alicia we want you and belinda to come back to mrs lucys cottage with us it isnt far alicia and belinda stared in exasperation at gwen rapidly she told them about the feast and all the food left overand how mrs lucy had offered it to them for a midnight feast a grin appeared on alicias face and a wicked look on belindas a midnight feast that would be a fine end to a very nice day all that food too it simply couldnt be wasted well it would certainly be a sin to let all that wonderful food go stale said alicia cheerfully i quite see you couldnt allow that and im sure we could all do with a feast tonight after our walking climbing and bathing well go back and help you carry the stuff no more was said about being late the four of them went quickly back to mrs lucys cottage she had packed it up as best she could in net bags and baskets the girls exclaimed in delight and thanked her heartily well bring back the baskets and bags as soon as we can promised clarissa my what a load weve got they had indeed it was all the four could do to lug it back to malory towers sally was wailing for them as they came down the cliffpath whatever have you been doing she asked darrells in an awful wax thinking youd got lost or something she was just about to go and report that youd all fallen over the cliff alicia laughed take a look at this basket she said and this bag clarissas old nurse gave us the whole lot for a midnight feast golly said sally thrilled how super youd better hide the things somewhere we dont want potty or marazelle finding them where shall we put titiem wondered alicia and where shall we have the feast it would be better to have it outofdoors tonight its so hot i know lets have it down by the pool we might even have a midnight swim this sounded absolutely grand you go and tell darrell were safe said alicia and we four will slip down to the pool and hide these things in the cubbyholes there where we keep the lifebelts and things sally sped off and gwen clarissa alicia and belinda swiftly made their way down to the pool the tide was outbut at midnight it would be in again and they could splash about in the pool and have their feast with the waves running over their toes the moon was full tooeverything was just right alicia packed the food into a cubbyhole and shut the door then she and the others went up the cliffpath but halfway up alicia remembered that she hadnt locked the door of the cubbyhole she had used blow she said i suppose id better in case anyone goes snooping round you go on you threeand ill come as soon as ive locked up she went down and locked the cubbyhole slipping the key into her pocket she heard footsteps near her as she pocketed the key and turned round hastily thank goodness it was only betty her west tower friend hallo what are you doing here said betty alicia grinned and told her about the hoard of food why dont you ask me to come along said betty any objection no its just that darrell mightnt like it said alicia hesitating you know that we arent supposed to leave our towers and join up together at night thats always been a very strict rule wellis there anything to stop me from looking out of my dormy window hearing something going on at the pool and coming along to see what it is said betty with her wicked grin then i dont see how you can prevent everyone from say come along and join us yesthats a wizard idea said alicia you do that then nobody will know i told you ill call out come and join us and that will make everyone else join inand darrell wont be able to say no right said betty and chuckled i could do with a spree like this couldnt you where did you go today langley hill we went to longbottom and had some good fun i sayi suppose i couldnt bring one or two more west tower girls with me i suppose could i after all its not like being invited if we just pop along to see what the noise is no one will ever know all right bring eileen and winnie said alicia theyll enjoy it but for goodness sake dont say i told you or darrell will blow my head off shes taking her headgirls duties very very seriously she would said betty and laughed well see you tonightand mind youre very surprised when we appear she sped off and alicia went to join the others whatever made you so long demanded belinda we thought you must have thrown a fit and fallen into the pool youll be late for supper now if you arent quick have you told darrell about the food and the midnight feast asked alicia yes said belinda she looked a bit doubtful at first and then when we reminded her that the great fifth had had one last term she laughed and said all right a feast it shae be then good for darrell said alicia pleased did you suggest that down by the pool would be a good place yes she agreed that it would said belinda so were all set the upper fourth winked at one another so continually that suppertime that mamzelle who was taking the suppertable looked down at her person several times to see if she had forgotten some article of apparel had she lost a few buttons was her belt crooked was her hair coming down then why did these bad girls wink and wink but it was nothing to do with mamzelle or her clothing or hairit was just that the girls were thrilled and excited and full of giggles and nudges and winks enough to drive any mistress to distraction mamzelle was indulgent they are excited after their picnic she thought ah how well they will sleep tonight but mamzelle was wrong they didnt intend to sleep at all well that night that evening for goodness sake dont let potty or mamzelle guess theres anything planned for tonight said darrell to the others after supper i saw mamzelle looking very suspicious come into the commonroom now and well arrange the details how gorgeous to have so much food given to usclarissa many thanks clarissa blushed but was too nervous to say anything she was delighted to think that she could provide a feast for the others they all went to the commonroom and sat about to discuss their plans its such a terrifically hot evening that it really will be lovely down by the pool said sally there wont have to be any of the usual screeching or yelling thoughsounds carry so at night and although the pool is right down on the rocks its quite possible to hear noises from there if the wind is right alicia was pleased to hear sally say this it would make it seem natural for betty and eileen and winnie to come and say they had heard sounds from the pool i and sally will keep awake tonight planned darrell then when we hear the clock strike twelve we will wake you all and you can get into dressinggowns and bring your bathingthings wed better fetch them from the changingrooms now or else we may wake up one of the staff if we rummage about late at night is all the food safely down by the pool asked bill who was very much looking forward to this adventure it was the first time she had ever been to a midnight feast yes safely locked in the cubbyhole on the left said alicia ive got the key well have a bathe first and then well feast said darrell its a pity we havent anything exciting to drink i bet if i went and asked old cookie for some lemonade shed leave us some ready said irene who was a great favourite with the kitchen staff good you go then said darrell ask her to make two big jugfuls and stand them on the cold larder floor well fetch them when were ready irene sped off then alicia was sent with mavis to fetch the bathingthings from the changingroom everyone began to feel tremendously excited clarissa could hardly keep still i wish i hadnt had so much supper said gwendoline im sure i shant feel hungry by midnight serves you right for being a pig said belinda you had five tomatoes at supper i counted a pity you hadnt anything better to do said gwendoline trying to be sarcastic oh its wonderful to watch your nice little ways said belinda lazily no wonder youre getting so fat the way you gobble everything at meals dear me what a wonderful drawing i could make of you as a nice fat little piggywig with blue eyes and a ribbon on your tail everyone roared do do begged sally gwendoline began to scowl saw belinda looking at her and hastily straightened her face she wished she hadnt tried to be sarcastic to belinda she always came off badly if she did alicia and mavis came back giggling with the bathingthings anyone spot you asked darrell anxiously i dont think so that pestiferous young cousin of mine june was somewhere about but i dont think shed spot anything was up said alicia i heard her whistling somewhere when we were in the changingroom irene came back from the kitchen grinning all over her face i found cookie and she was all alone she said shell have two thumping big jugs of lemonade ready for us on the floor of the larder any time after eleven oclock tonight the staff go to bed then so she says any time after that will be safe for us to get it whoops this is going to be super said alicia what exactly did you say the food was clarissa clarissa explained with gwen prompting her proudly gwen really felt as if she had provided half the feast herself and she basked in clarissas reflected glory did you ever have midnight feasts at your last school ruth asked darrell seeing that ruth looked as excited as the others connie answered for her as usual no we tried once but we got caughtand my word we did get a wigging from the head i asked ruth not you said darrell annoyed with connie dont keep butting in let ruth answer for herself she turned to ruth again was your last head very strict she asked connie opened her mouth to answer for ruth again caught the glint in darrells eye and shut it ruth actually answered after waiting for a moment for connie well she said i think probably you would call her very strict you see oh not very strict ruth interrupted connie dont you remember how nice she was over im asking ruth said darrell exasperated what would have happened next the form would dearly have loved to knowbut there came an interruption that changed the subject matron popped her head in and said she wanted gwendoline oh why matron wailed gwendoline what havent i done now that i ought to have done why do you want me just a little matter of darning said matron but ive done the beastly darning you told me to said gwen indignantly well thenshall we say a little matter of unpicking and redarning said matron aggravatingly the girls grinned they had seen gwens last effort at darning a pair of navyblue knickers with grey wool and had wondered if matron would notice gwendoline had to get up and go grumbling under her breath i could do her darning for her suggested clarissa to darrell i dont play games or do gymive plenty of time dont you dare said darrell at once you help her too much as it isshes always copying from you clarissa looked shocked ohshe doesnt copy she said loyally going red at the idea of her daring to argue with darrell dont be such a mutt said alicia bluntly gwendolines a turnipheadand shes always picked other peoples brains and always will take off your rosecoloured glasses and see gwen through your proper eyes my dear clarissa thinking that alicia really meant her to take off her glasses for some reason clarissa removed her spectacles most obediently the girls were about to laugh loudly when darrell bent forward in surprise clarissa youve got real green eyes ive never seen proper green eyes before you must be related to the pixyfolkpeople with green eyes always are everyone roaredbut on looking closely at clarissas eyes they saw that they were indeed a lovely clear green that somehow went remarkably well with her wavy auburn hair my wordi wish i had stunning eyes like that said alicia enviously theyre marvellous how sickening that youve got to wear glasses oh its only for a time said clarissa putting them on again looking rather shy but pleased at alicias admiration im glad you like my green eyes gwendoline thinks its awful to have green eyes like a cat if all cats have green eyes then our dear gwendoline certainly ought to have them said belinda at once clarissa looked distressed oh but gwendoline has been very kind to me she began and then everyone shushed her gwen was coming in at the door scowling holding a pair of games knickers and a pair of games stockings in her hands i do think matrons an absolute beast she began i spent hours darning these last weekand now ive got to unpick all my darns and redo them well dont dam navy knickers with grey wool or red stockings with navy wool this time said alicia anyone would think you were colourblind clarissa longed to help gwen but after darrells remark she didnt like to offer and gwen certainly didnt dare to ask for help the girls sat about yawning trying to read longing for bed because they really felt tired but not too tired to wake up at twelve and have a bathe and a feast they didnt take long getting into bed that night even slow gwendoline was quick irene was the quickest of the lot much to darrells surprise but it was discovered that she had absentmindedly got into bed halfundressed so out she had to get again the bathingthings were stacked in someones cupboard waiting dressinggowns and slippers were set ready on the ends of each bed sony for you darrell and you too sally having to keep awake till twelve said irene yawning goodnight allsee you in a little while sally said she would keep awake for the first hour and then wake darrell who would keep awake till twelve then each would get a little rest sally valiantly kept awake and then shook darrell who slept in the next bed darrell was so sound asleep that she could hardly open her eyes but she did at last and then decided she had better get out of bed and walk up and down a little or she might fall off to sleep againand then there would be no feast for she was quite certain noone else would be awake at twelve at last she heard the clock at the top of the tower striking twelve good midnight at last she woke up salty and then the two of them woke everyone else up gwendoline was the hardest to wakeshe always was darrell debated whether or not to leave her as she seemed determined not to wakebut decided that clarissa might be upsetand after all it was clarissas feast they all put on dressinggowns and slippers they got their bathingthings out of the cupboard and sent irene and belinda for the jugs of lemonade the dormy was full of giggles and whisperings and shushings everybody was now wide awake and very excited come onwell go down to the sidedoor out into the garden and through the gate to the cliffpath down to the pool whispered darrell and for goodness sake dont fall down the stairs or do anything idiotic it wasnt long before they were down by the pool which was gleaming in the moonlight and looked too tempting for words irene and belinda had the jugs of lemonade lets get out the food and have a look at it said sally im longing to see it alicia wheres the key of the cubbyhole said darrell blow said alicia ive left it in my tunic pocket ill skip back and get it wont be half a minute midnight feast alicia ran up the cliffpath annoyed with herself for forgetting the key she slipped in at the sidedoor of the tower and went up the stairs as she went along the landing where the firstform dormy was she saw a little white figure in the passage looking out of the landing window must be a firstformer thought alicia whats she out at this time of night for little monkey she walked softly up to the small person looking out of the window and grasped her by the shoulder there was a loud gasp sh said alicia good gracious its you june what are you doing out here at midnight well what are you said june cheekily alicia shook her none of your cheek she said have you forgotten the trouncing i gave you last summer hols for cheeking me and betty when you came to stay with me no i havent forgotten said june vengefully and i never shall you were a beast id have split on you if i hadnt been scared spanking me with a hairbrush as if i was six served you jolly well right said alicia and you know what would have happened to you if you had splitsam and the others would have trounced you too i know said june angrily she was scared of alicias brothers you wait though ill get even with you some time alicia snorted scornfully you could do with another spanking i see she said nowyou clear off to bed you know youre not supposed to be out of your dormy at night i saw you all go off with bathingthings tonight said june slyly i guessed you were up to something you fourthformers when i spotted you and somebody else getting bathingdresses in the changingroom tonight you thought i didnt see you but i did how alicia longed for a hairbrush to spank june withbut she dared not even raise her voice clear off to bed she ordered her voice shaking with rage are you having a midnight feast too persisted june not moving i saw irene and belinda with jugs of lemonade nasty little spy said alicia and gave june a sharp push what we fourthformers do is none of your business go to bed june resisted alicias hand and her voice grew dangerous does potty know about your feast she asked or mamzelle i say alicia wouldnt it be rotten luck on you if somebody told on you alicia gasped could june really be threatening to go and wake one of the staff and so spoil all their plans she couldnt believe that anyone would be so sneaky alicia let me come and join the feast begged june please do no said alicia shortly and then not trusting herself to say any more she left june standing by the window and went off in search of the key to the cubbyhole she was so angry that she could hardly get the key out of her tunic pocket to be cheeked like that by a firstformerher own cousin to be threatened by a little pipsqueak like that alicia really hated june at that moment she found the key and rushed back to the pool with it she said nothing about meeting june the others were already in the water enjoying themselves pity the moons gone in said darrell to sally gosh it has clouded up hasnt it is that alicia back hey alicia what a time youve been got the key yes im unlocking the cubbyhole called back alicia clarissa is here shell help me to get out the things pity its so dark nowthe moons gone suddenly from the western sky there came an ominous growlthunder blow blow blow sounds like a storm said darrell i thought there might be one soon its so terrifically hot today i say alicia do you think we ought to begin the feast now in case the storm comes on yes said alicia ah heres the moon again thank goodness the girls clambered out of the water and dried themselves as they stood there laughing and talking darrell suddenly saw three figures coming down the cliffpath from the school her heart stood still were they mistresses who had heard them it was betty of course with eileen and winnie the three of them stopped short at the pool and appeared to be extremely astonished to see such a gathering of the upper fourth i say whatever are you doing said betty we thought we heard a noise from the pool it made us think that a bathe would be nice this hot night were going to have a feast came alicias voice youd better join us yes doweve got plenty said irene and the others called out the same even darrell welcomed them too for it never once occurred to her that betty had heard about the feast already and had come in the hope of joining them neither did it occur to her that there was a strict rule that girls from one tower were never to leave their own towers at night to meet anyone from another she just didnt think about it at all they all sat down to enjoy the feast the thunder rumbled again this time much nearer a flash of lightning lit up the sky the moon went behind an enormous cloud and was seen no more that night worst of all great drops of rain began to fall plopping down on the rocks and causing great dismay oh dearwell have to go in said darrell well be soaked through and it wont be any fun at all sitting and eating in the rain come oncollect the food and well go back betty nudged alicia shall we come she whispered yes try it whispered back alicia darrell hasnt said youre not to so everyone including betty eileen and winnie from west tower gathered up the food hurriedly and stumbled up the cliffpath in the dark where shall we take the food panted darrell to sally cant have it in our commonroom because its got no curtains and the lights would shine out what about the firstform commonroom asked sally thats not near any staffroom and the windows cant be seen from any other part yes good idea said darrell and the word went round that the feast was to be held in the firstform commonroom soon they were all in there darrell shut the door carefully and put a mat across the bottom so that not a crack of light could be seen the girls sat about on the floor a little damped by the sudden storm that had spoilt their plans the thunder crashed and the lightning gleamed marylou looked alarmed and gwen went quite white neither of them liked storms hope thunders all right said bill tucking into a tongue sandwich her horse was always her first thought i should think began alicia when she stopped dead everyone sat still darrell put up her finger for silence there came a little knocking at the door taptaptaptap taptaptaptap darrell felt scared who in the world was there and why knock she made another sign for everyone to keep absolutely still the knocking went on taptaptap this time it was a little louder still the girls said nothing and kept quite silent the knocking came again sounding much too loud in the night oh dear thought darrell if it gets any louder someone will hear and the cat will be out of the bag gwendoline and marylou were quite terrified of this strange knocking they clutched each other as white as a sheet come in said darrell at last in a low voice when there was a pause in the knocking the door opened slowly and the girls stared at it wondering what was coming in walked juneand behind her rather scared was felicity june said alicia fiercely felicity gasped darrell hardly believing her eyes june stared round as if in surprise oh she said its you is it felicity and i simply couldnt get to sleep because of the storm and we came to the landing window to watch it and we found these on the ground she held up three hardboiled eggs we were awfully surprised then we heard a bit of a noise in here and we wondered who was in our commonroomand we thought whoever it was must be having a good old feastso we came to bring you your lost hardboiled eggs there was a silence after this speech alicia was boiling she knew that june had watched them coming back because of the stormhad seen them going into the firstform commonroomand had been delighted to find the dropped eggs and bring them along as an excuse to join the party oh said darrell hardly knowing what to say thanks yeswere having a feast er why did you use our commonroom asked june innocently and she broke the shell off one of the eggs of course its an honour for us firstformers to have you upper fourth using our room for a feast i saythis eggs super i didnt mean to nibble it though so sorry oh finish it if you like said darrell not finding anything else to say thanks said june and gave one to felicity who began to eat hers too it ended of course in the two of them joining in the feast though darrell really felt very uncomfortable about it also for the first time she realized that the three girls from west tower were still there in north tower where they had no business to be still how could she turn them out now she couldnt very well say look here you must scram i know we said join the feast when we were down by the poolbut we cant have you with us now it sounded too silly for words darrell did not enjoy the feast at all she wanted to send june and felicity away but it seemed mean to do that when the feasters were using their commonroom and june had brought back the eggs also she felt that alicia might not like her to send june away little did she know that alicia was meditating all kinds of dire punishments for the irrepressible june oh dearthe lovely time they had planned seemed to have gone wrong somehow and then it went even more wrong footsteps were heard overhead things happen fast did you hear that whispered sally someone is coming quick gather everything up and lets go the girls grabbed everything near and darrell caught up the brush by the fireplace and swept the crumbs under a couch she put out the light and opened the door all was dark in the passage outside there seemed to be nobody there who could have been walking about overhead that was where the firstform dormy was june and felicity were scared now they shot away at once betty eileen and winnie disappeared to the stairs running down them to the sidedoor they could then slip round to their own tower the others led by darrell went cautiously upstairs to find their own dormy a slight cough from somewhere near a familiar and unmistakable cough brought them to a stop they stood hardly daring to breathe at the top of the stairs that was pottys cough thought darrell oh blowdid she hear us making a row but we really were quite quiet she hoped and hoped that betty and the other two west tower girls had got safely to their own dormy without being caught it really was counted quite a serious offence for girls of one tower to meet girls in another tower at night for one thing there was no way to get from one tower to another under cover the girls had to go outside to reach any other tower what could potty be doing where was she the girls stood frozen to the ground waiting for the sign to move on shes in the thirdform dormy whispered darrell at last perhaps somebody is ill there i think we had better make a dash for it really we cant stand here for hours right the next time the thunder comes well run for it said sally in a low voice the word was passed along and the girls waited anxiously for the thunder the lightning flashed first showing up the crouching line of girls very clearlyand then the thunder came it was a good long rumbling crash and any sound the girls made in scampering along to their dormy was completely deadened they fell into bed thankfully each girl stuffing what she carried into the bottom of her cupboard wet bathingsuits and all no miss potts appeared and the girls began to breathe more freely somebody must have been taken ill in the thirdform dormy potty still seemed to be there at last the upper fourth heard the soft closing of the thirdform dormy and miss potts footsteps going quietly off to her own room had we better take the lemonade jugs down to the kitchen now whispered irene no we wont risk any more creeping about tonight said darrell you must take them down before break fast as soon as the staff have gone into the diningroom even though it makes you a bit late and well dear out all the food left over before we go down and hide it somewhere till we can get rid of it what a pity that beastly storm came the girls slept like logs that night and could hardly wake up in the morning gwen and belinda had to be literally dragged out of bed irene shot down to the kitchen with the empty jugs all the rest of the food was hastily put into a bag and dumped into an odd cupboard in the landing then looking demure and innocent the fourthformers went down to breakfast felicity grinned at darrell she had enjoyed the escapade last night but june did not grin at alicia alicias face was very grim and june felt uncomfortable at break alicia went to find hilda the headgirl of the first form hilda was surprised and flattered hilda said alicia i am very displeased with junes behaviour she is getting quite unbearable and we fourthformers are not going to stand it either you must put her in her place or we shall it would be much better for you to do it oh alicia im so sorry said hilda we have tried to put her in her place but she keeps saying youll give us no end of a wigging if we dont give her a chance but weve given her lots of chances i bet you have said alicia grimly now i dont know how you deal with your erring formmembers hildawe had various very good ways when i was a firstformerbut please do somethingand tell her i told you to right we will said hilda thankful that she had got authority to deal with that bumptious brazen conceited new girl june a week of being sent to coventry would soon bring june to heelshe loved talking and gossiping and it would be a hard punishment for her hilda went off to call a form meeting about the matter feeling very important june was angry and shocked to hear the verdict of her formto be sent to coventry for a week she felt humiliated tooand how angry she was with alicia for giving hilda the necessary authority alicia was quite within her rights to do this when a member of a lower form aroused the anger or scorn of a higher form the headgirl of the offenders form was told to deal with the matter and so hilda dealt with it faithfully and promptly and if she felt very pleased to do it that was junes fault and not hers june was certainly a thorn in the side of all the old girls in the first form it was quite unheard of for any new girl to behave so boldly felicity found that she too had to give her promise not to speak to june oh dearthat would be very awkwardbut she owed more loyalty to her form than to june so she gave her promise in a low voice not daring to look at the redfaced june that evening felicity came to darrell looking worried darrell please may i speak to you something rather awful has happened those crumbs we left in the commonroom last night under the couch were found this morning and so were two sandwiches and potty tackled hilda and asked her if shed been having a midnight feast there last night potty said she thought she heard something but by the time she came out of the thirdform dormy where somebody was ill and went to look in the commonroom it was empty gosh said darrell then her face cleared well whats it matter hilda must have been asleep last night and cant have known anything about it she was asleepand she told potty she didnt know a thing about any feast and that the first form certainly hadnt been out of the dormy last night said felicity some of them woke up in that storm but nobody missed me or june apparently well why worry then said darrell you shouldnt have come along with june last night you know felicity i was awfully surprised and not at all pleased to see you you really ought to be careful your very first term i know said felicity i sort of get carried along by june honestly i cant help it darrellshe makes me laugh so much and shes so bold and daring shes been sent to coventry now and shes as mad as anything she knows its all because of alicia and she vows shell get even with her she will too felicitydo chuck june begged darrell shes no good as a friend shes a little beast really alicia has told me all about her but felicity was obstinate and she shook her head no i like june and i want to stick by her shes not a little beast shes fun darrell let felicity go feeling impatient with her little sister anyway thank goodness potty hadnt found out anything she must be jolly puzzled about the crumbs and the sandwiches it seemed as if the whole affair would settle downand then a bombshell came felicity came to darrell again the next day looking very harassed indeed darrell i must speak to you in private good gracious whats up now said darrell taking felicity to a corner of the courtyard its june i dont understand her she says shes going to go to potty and own up that she was at the midnight feast said felicity she says i ought to go and own up too darrell stared at felicity in exasperation these firstformers but if she goes and does that its as good as sneaking on us said darrell furiously wheres this little pest now in one of the musicrooms practising said felicity alarmed at darrells fury shes in coventry you know so i cant speak to her she sent me a note whatever am i to do darrell if she goes to own up ill have to go too or potty and the rest will think im an awful coward ill go and talk to june said darrell and went straight off to the musicroom where the girls practised daily she found june and burst into the room so angrily that the firstformer jumped look here june whats behind this sudden piousness of yourswanting to go and own upwhen theres no need for anything of the sort cried darrell angrily you know youd get the upper fourth into trouble if you go and split i shant split said june calmly playing a little scale up and down the piano i shall simply own up i was at the feastbut i shant say whose feast ierwant to get it off my conscience youre a little hypocrite said darrell stop playing that scale and listen to me june played another little scale a mocking smile on her face darrell nearly burst with rage she slapped junes hand off the piano and turned her round roughly to face her stop it said june ive had enough of that kind of thing from my dear cousin alicia at the mention of alicias name something clicked into place in darrells mind and she knew at once what was behind junes pious idea of owning up she wanted to get even with alicia she would like to get her into troubleand darrell tooand everyone in the upper fourthto revenge herself on alicias order to hilda to deal with her you are a doublefaced little wretch arent you said darrell scornfully you know jolly well if you own uppoohthat potty will make inquiries and i shall have to own up to the spree in the pool and the feast afterwards ohworse than that said june in her infuriatingly impudent voice girls from another tower were thereor was i mistaken do you mean to say youd split on betty and the others too said darrell taking a deep breath just to get even with alicia ohnot splitor even sneak said june beginning to play the maddening scale again surely i can own upand bettys name canerjust slip out as it were at the thought of june sneaking on everyone under cover of being a good little girl and owning up darrell really saw red her temper went completely and she found herself pulling the wretched june off the pianostool and shaking her violently a voice made her stop suddenly darrell whatever are you doing a real shakeup darrell stared wildly round miss potts stood at the door a picture of absolute amazement darrell couldnt think of a word to say june actually had the audacity to reseat herself on the pianostool and play a soft chord june said miss potts and the tone of her voice made the firstformer almost jump out of her skin come with me darrell said miss potts and you too june they followed her to her room where mamzelle was correcting papers she gazed in surprise at miss potts grim face and at the faces of the two girls tiens said mamzelle gathering up her papers quickly and beginning to scuttle out of her room i will go i will not intrude miss potts miss potts didnt appear to have noticed mamzelle at all she sat down in her chair and looked sternly at darrell and june what were you two doing darrell swallowed hard she was already ashamed of herself oh dearheadgirland she had lost her temper like that miss pottsjune has something to say to you she said at last what have you to say inquired miss potts turning her cold eyes on june well miss pottsi just wanted to own up that i had been to a midnight feast said june hilda said that there had been no midnight feast said miss potts beginning to tap on the table with her pencil always a dangersign with her i know it wasnt a firstform affair said june smoothly i gather from darrells face that it was a fourthform affair said miss potts darrell nodded miserably just the fourthformers and you june i suppose said miss potts wellthere were a few others said june pretending to hesitate one from my form as we as me i wont mention her name felicity was there said darrell but i take responsibility for that she didnt mean to come and miss pottsbetty hill and eileen and winnie were there too there was a silence miss potts looked very grim girls from another tower she said i think you know the rule about that dont you darrell and what could you have been thinking about to invite two firstformers as well of coursefelicity is your sisterbut surely i didnt invite her said darrell andwelli didnt exactly invite the west tower girls either dont lets quibble and make excuses said miss potts impatiently that isnt like you darrell i imagine you were quarrelling with june because she wanted to own up darrell couldnt trust herself to speak she nodded im sorry i behaved like that she said humbly i thought id conquered my temper but i havent im sorry i shook you june june was a little takenabout at this apology and looked uneasy but she was very cockawhoop and pleased with herself she was in pottys good books for owning up she had got darrell into trouble and alicia would get into trouble too and all the othersand she june would get off scotfree you can go june said miss potts suddenly im not sure ive got to the bottom of all this yet darrell had no right to use violence to youbut as she never loses her temper now unless something very serious makes her angry i am inclined to take your owningup with a pinch of salt you may be sure i shall find out whether you are to be praised or blamed june shot out of the room scared miss potts looked gravely at darrell darrell you know that you will have to bear the responsibility for allowing girls from another tower into your tower at night dont you she said and i cannot possibly pass over your behaviour to june in the musicroom whatever provocation you had does not excuse what you did i know said darrell miserably im not a good headgirl miss potts id better resign welleither you must resign or you will have to be demoted said miss potts sadly sally must be head for the time beingtill we consider you can take the responsibility again if you cant control yourself darrell you certainly cant control others the news soon flew through the school darrell rivers has resigned as headgirl did you know there has been a most awful rowsomething about a midnight feast and she actually asked girls from another towerand firstformers as well gosh fancy darrell rivers getting into disgrace felicity heard the news and was filled with the utmost horror she went straight to june quite forgetting that she was still in coventry did you go and split she asked sharply what has happened full of glee at all that had happened june told felicity the whole thing from beginning to end that will teach the fourthformers to have a down on me and get me sent to coventry she said ive paid alicia back nicelyand my word you should have seen darrells face when she was shaking me and miss potts came in and saw her im glad shes not headgirl of her form any longer serves her right felicity could hardly believe her ears she was trembling shivering all over june noticed it with surprise whats the matter she said youre my friend arent you i was but have you forgotten that darrell is my sister said felicity in a choking voice june stared at her blankly in her glee at being topdog she had completely and utterly forgotten that darrell was felicitys sister i fed like darrelli could shake you and slap you you horrid twofaced beast cried felicity as it is im going to hilda to tell her every single thing youve told methats not sneakingthats reporting something almost too bad to be true ugh you ought to be expelled how could i ever have wanted you for my friend and so the friendship between felicity and june came to a most abrupt end and was never renewed again susan was hunted out by felicity and gave her the comfort she needed june kicked herself for forgetting that darrell was felicitys sister but the damage was done felicity had seen june in her true coloursand she didnt like them at all the fourth form were horrified at all that had happened one and all they stood by poor darrell even gwendoline coming to offer a few words of sympathy but gwens sympathy was as usual only on the surface immediately after she had been to tell darrell how sorry she was she was confiding to clarissa that she really wasnt surprised that darrell was in disgrace i told you how she slapped me didnt i she said and she pushed sally over once itll do her good to be humiliated like this i never did like darrell clarissa looked at gwendoline with a sudden feeling of dislike why do you say this when you have just told her youre sorry and that youd do anything you could to put things right she said i think youre beastly gwen and to gwens unutterable surprise the meek weak clarissa turned her back on her and walked away it had cost her a great deal to say this to gwen and she was crying as she walked away she bumped into bill off to ride on thunder here look where youre going clarissa i say youre crying whatevers up said bill in surprise nothing said clarissa not wanting to say anything against gwen bill only knew one cure for unhappinessriding a horse she offered the cure to clarissa now come for a ride its heavenly out now you said you were allowed to ride ifyou wanted to theres a horse free i know miss peters is coming too shes grand another time clarissa would have said no because it was difficult for her to make up her mind to begin anything fresh and she had not yet ridden at malory towers although she had been told that she could but now touched by bills blunt kindliness and feeling that she wanted to get right away from gwendoline she nodded her head all right ill change into my jodhpurs quickly wait for me and in fifteen minutes time to gwendolines enormous surprise miss peters billand clarissa swept past her on the cliff riding fast shouting to one another as they went clarissa well she hadnt even known that clarissa had riding things with her and there she was off with that awful bill and that even more awful miss peters gwendoline really couldnt understand it at all sally was made temporary headgirl i shall really share it with you she told the subdued darrell i shall come and ask you everything and take your adviceand i bet it wont be long before youre made headgirl once more miss grayling told me twice i was only temporary darrell had written to her parents and told them the bad news they would be sorry and upset but they had to know i thought i must tell you before you come to see me and felicity at halfterm wrote darrell please dont say anything about it when you see me will you because i shall howl anyway dears one good thing has come out of an thisfelicitys not friends any more with the horridest girl in her form but with one of the nicestsusan that you saw at the gym display last term darrell had been very touched by the sympathy given to her by her form the twins had been very nice she thought even though ruth as usual had not said a wordeverything had been said by connie and as for clarissa she had been almost in tears when she came to darrell i believe clarissas awfully nice when you can get under her meekness and shyness said darrell to sally what a pity she has to wear those glasses didnt you think she looked beautiful when she took them off the other daythose deep green eyes like water in a pool sally laughed you sound quite poetical she said yes i like clarissa now gwen doesnt quite know what to think about clarissa going off riding with bill does she i never knew clarissa was so fond of horses she and bill gabble like anything about all the horses they have ever knownand gwendoline looks on like a dying duck in a thunderstorm trying to get a word in halfterm next week said darrell oh sally i never dreamt when i was feeling so proud of being made headgirl that id lose my position before even halfterm came im a terrible failure wellplenty of people would like to be the kind of failure you are said sally loyally you may be a failure at the momentbut youre a very fine failure darrell youre a lot better than some people who think theyre a success gwendoline makes a plan halfterm would soon be coming the school was giving all kinds of displaysan exhibition tennis match played by four of the crack school playersa swimming and diving displayand a dancing display in the middle of the great courtyard and after that said daphne gloomily after thatthe school cert exam i feel awfully depressed whenever i think of it think how lighthearted youll be afterwards said belinda yeslike you feel after going to the dentist said clarissa you get all gloomy beforehand and then after youve been you feel awfully happy everyone laughed they knew that clarissa had had bad times at the dentist and they knew that she hated the wire round her front teeth put there to keep them back she was hoping she could have it off before long once ive got rid of that wire and my glasses you wont know me she said and shook back her mass of auburn hair she had been riding quite a bit with bill and gwendoline had felt rather out of things clarissa rode extremely well and could apparently manage any horse in the school stablesand had actually been permitted to try thunder gwendoline found the everlasting horse conversation between the two very trying indeed i once rode a horse who ran away with me and jumped over a hedge before i had even learnt how to jump clarissa would begin and then bill would go on did you really i bet you stuck on all right did i ever tell you about marvel my brother toms horse then would follow a long story about marvel at the end gwendoline would try to get a word in i sayclarissa do you know where we are going for this afternoons walk not yet clarissa would say well bill i simply must tell you about my fathers old horse that lived to be over thirty he and so the horsy conversation would go on till gwendoline felt she could scream horses horrible great snorting stamping creatures how she wished clarissa had never gone out for mat first ride with bill gwendoline was beginning to be very much afraid of the coming exam she was backward in her lessons and because of her habit of picking other peoples brains and of copying their work her own brains worked very badly when she had to think out something for herself the exam paper had to be done with her own brainsshe couldnt copy anyones work thenand indeed gwen knew perfectly well that miss williams would see to it that she gwendoline would be seated much too far away from anyone else to copy she worried about the exam she felt uncomfortably that she might possibly be the only person to failand what a disgrace and humiliation that would be her father would have a lot of hurtful remarks to make and her mother would cry and her old governess would look mournful and say it was all her fault she ought to have taught gwen better when she was small oh dearwhy did these beastly exams matter gwendoline seriously considered the possibility of trying to see the papers beforehandbut that was silly she knew they were always locked up she did not think to herself i am wrong to think of such a thing she merely thought i am silly to think there would be a chance of seeing them could she be ill could she complain of a sore throat and headache nomatron simply never believed her she would take her temperature and say my dear gwendoline you are suffering from inflammation of the imagination as usual and give her that perfectly horrible medicine she thought of clarissas weak heart with envy to have something like thatthat prevented you from playing those awful games and from swimming and climbing up hillsnow that was something really worth while havingsomething sensible unfortunately though it didnt let you off lessons gwendoline thought about weak hearts for a while and gradually a plan began to unfold itself in her mind what about putting it round that her heart was troubling her she put her hand to where she thought her heart was and assumed an agonized expression what should she say oh my heartits fluttering again i do wish it wouldnt it makes me feel so queer oh why did i run up those stairs so fast the more she thought about this idea the better it seemed next week was halfterm if she could work up this weak heart business well enough perhaps her parents would be told and they would be alarmed and take her away home then she would miss school cert which began not long after gwendolines heart began to beat fast as she thought out this little plan in fact she felt a little alarmed feeling it beat so fast with excitement suppose she really had got one noit was only that she was feeling excited about this clever and wonderful idea of hers so little by little gwen began to put it about that she didnt feel very well oh nothing much she told clarissa and bill youll know what i feel like clarissamy heart sort of flutters oh why did i run up the stairs so fast clarissa was sympathetic she knew how absolutely sickening a weak heart was dont you think you ought to tell miss williams or miss potts she said quite anxiously or matron no said gwendoline putting on a pathetically brave face i dont want to make a fuss besides you know its school cert soon i mustnt miss that if alicia sally or darrell had been anywhere near they would have yelled with laughter at all this but bill and clarissa didnt they listened quite seriously well i think you ought to say something about it said clarissa if youd had to go through what ive had tolie up for weeks on end not do a thing give up all the riding and swimming i lovedyoud not run any risk of playing about with a groggy heart gwendoline took to running up the stairs when she saw any of the upper fourth at the top then when she came to the landing she would put her hand to her left side droop over the banisters and groan got a stitch alicia would say unsympathetically bend down and touch your toes gwendoline ohiforgotyoure too fat to do that arent you on the other hand marylou might say oh gwen whats the matter is it your heart again you really ought to have something done about it gwen did not perform in front of either miss williams or miss potts she had a feeling that her performance would not go down very well but she tried it on with mamzelle who could always be taken in mamzelle was quite alarmed one morning to find gwen sitting on the top stair near her room her hand pressed to her heart groaning ma petite qavez vous what is the matter she cried you have hurt yourself where itsits all right mamzelle panted gwendoline itsits nothingjust this awful heart of mine when i run or do anything energeticit seems to go all funny you have the palpitations you are anaemic then cried mamzelle me i once suffered in this way when i was fifteen you shall come with me to matron and she shall give you some good good medicine to make your blood rich and red gwendoline didnt want her blood made rich and red by matron it was the last thing in the world she wanted she got up hastily and smiled weakly at mamzelle its over now im quite all right its not anaemia mamzelleive never been anaemic its just my silly heart itserits a weakness in our family im afraid this was quite untrue but gwendoline added it because she thought it might convince mamzelle it was her heart and not her blood that was wrong mamzelle was very sympathetic and told gwen she had better not play tennis that afternoon gwendoline was delightedbut on thinking it over she regretfully decided that she had better play because she wouldnt possibly be able to convince sally that her heart had played her up again sally just simply didnt believe in gwens weak heart so she played mamzelle saw her and was surprised the brave gwendoline she thought she plays even though she knows it may bring on the palpitations again ah these english girls they have the courage and the pluck gwendoline laid a few more plans she would bring mamzelle up to her parents at halfterm and leave her to talk to them she was certain that sooner or later mamzelle would speak about her heartand then she gwen would be anxiously questioned by her motherand if she played her cards well she would be taken home at once by a very anxious and frightened mother gwen did not stop to think of the pain and anxiety she would give to her parents by her stupid pretence she wanted to get out of doing the exam and she didnt mind how she did it she was quite unscrupulous and very clever when she badly wanted her own way im certain mother will take me home she thought i really dont think i need bother about swotting up for the exam it will be a waste of time if i dont take it look at all the othersgroaning and moaning every evening mugging up latin and french and maths and history and the rest welli shant and to the surprise of everyone gwendoline suddenly stopped working hard and slacked arent you afraid of doing frightfully bad papers asked mavis who was rather afraid of this herself and was working very hard indeed i shall do my best said gwendoline i cant do more its this beastly heart of mine you knowit does play me up so if i work too hard mavis didnt believe in this heart of gwendolines but she was really puzzled to know why the girl was so silly as to waste her time when she ought to be putting in some good hard work preparing for the exam but surprisingly enough it was connie who put her finger on the right spot she had a great scorn for the weak ineffectual gwendoline she was a domineering strongminded girl herself and she could not bear gwendolines moaning and grumbling for some reason or other connie had been touchy and irritable for the last week or two and her bad temper suddenly flared out one evening at gwen gwendoline had come into the commonroom and flopped down in a chair everyone was swotting hard for the exam as usual their heads bent over their books i really must not carry heavy things again began gwendoline in her peevish voice nobody took any notice except to frown ive had to help potty with the books in the library went on gwen great heavy piles its set my heart fluttering like anything shut up said connie were working well theres no need for you to be rude said gwen with dignity if you had a heart like mine and then connie exploded she got up and went to stand over the astonished gwendoline you havent got a heart weak or otherwise youre a big bundle of pretence youre making it all up to get out of school cert i can see through you thats why youre not working isnt itbecause youre banking on your heart letting you out in some way or other youve planned well let me tell you thisi dont care tuppence whether you do school cert or not or whether you work or notbut i do care about my own work and so do the others so shut up about your silly heart and keep away from us with your meanings and groanings till school cert is over with that connie went back to her seat glowering everyone was startledtoo startled to say a word they all felt that what connie said was true you hateful cruel thing said gwendoline in a trembling voice i hope you fail and you will toosee if you dont you only get decent marks because youre always cribbing from ruth we all know that shell pass and you wont i think youre a beast she burst into tears got up and went out of the room banging the door so violently that mamzelle and miss potts working in their room not far away wondered whatever was happening the girls looked at one another alicia made a face well i expect connies rightthough you were a bit brutal werent you connie no more brutal than you sometimes are said connie rather sulkily anyway lets go to work again some of us are not like you aliciaskating lightly over every subject and doing everything well without bothering you dont understand how hard some of us find our work lets get on there was silence in the room as the girls worked away reading making notes learning by heart only clarissa and marylou were really troubled about gwen clarissa still believed in her weak heart and marylou was always sorry for anyone who cried as for gwendoline her tears were not tears of sorrow but of rage that horrible connie if only she could get back at her for her unkind words how gwendoline hoped that connie hadnt spoilt her beautiful plan halfterm at last halfterm came at last it was a really lovely day with bright sunshine and a nice breeze the kitchen staff worked with a will to produce masses of good things for the grand school tea all the girls were excited about seeing their people gwendoline had quite thought that clarissas people were coming and had planned to introduce them to her mother and father then she suddenly heard bill and clarissa planning a picnic together on the halfterm saturday two of my brothers have their halfterm at the same time said bill so theyre coming with mother and daddy well take our lunch up to the top of langley hill shall we and bathe in the cove afterwards before we come back to the tennis exhibition gwen listened in astonishment but what will clarissas father and mother say to that she said wont they want clarissa to themselves they cant come on the saturday worse luck said clarissa they may be able to come over on sunday thoughat least mother might be able to even if daddy cant theyre dreadfully busy people you know so ive asked clarissa to come with us said bill my family will bring enough lunch for twice as many as well be so well have a good time gwen was jealous why she could have had clarissa spend the day with her if shed known well you might have told me your people couldnt come on saturday she said you know how much i should have liked you to spend your time with my people clarissa looked embarrassed she had purposely not told gwen because she had so much wanted to go with bill and her brothersall nice horsy people but she couldnt explain that to gwen so to make up for her remissness she was extra nice to her and promised to go and speak to gwens people when they arrived you might just mention my heart to them said gwendoline i dont really like to make a fuss about it myselfbut you could just say something clarissa of course i will said clarissa who still believed in gwens weak heart i think something ought to be done about it so on halfterm saturday clarissa was led up to mrs lacy gwendolines mother and miss winter her gentle and scaredlooking old governess her father was not there mrs lacy was talking to another mother clarissa sat down on the grass with gwendoline waiting till she had finished darrells mother was near and darrell introduced her to clarissa soon she heard gwen talking to her mother and miss winter well dear said her mother fondly and what has my darling gwendoline been doing this term are you in the exhibition tennis well no mother said gwendoline i was almost chosen but it was decided only to have girls from the fifth and the sixth how stupid said miss winter feeling that gwen would certainly have been better than any fifth or sixthform girl what about your swimming gwen asked her mother you said in one of your letters that you had won a backstroke swimming race and i did think that was clever backstroke is so difficult i remember i could never do it at school because the water kept going over my face clarissa couldnt help hearing this conversation though she was talking to mrs rivers darrells mother she was horrified whatever did gwen mean by all this no im not swimming today said gwen theres a lot of jealousy you know motheroften the good ones arent given a proper chance still i dont really mind i can dive almost better than anyone now as gwen always fell fiat on her stomach hitting the water with a terrific smack whenever she was made to dive this was distinctly funnyor would have been to darrell sally or alicia but it wasnt funny to clarissa it was shocking what terrible liesreal thumping lies however could gwen say such things she was very thankful that she was going out with blunt straightforward bill instead of having to be with gwen and her silly credulous mother she saw very dearly why gwen was as she wasthis mother of hers had spoilt her idolized her believed every word she saidit was sheand probably that pathetic little governess toowho had made gwendoline into the silly conceited untrustworthy girl she was clarissa felt that she really could not go and speak to gwens mother after hearing all gwens untruths she couldnt clarissa was meek and weak in many ways but she was straight and truthful she was really shocked now she got up to slip away before gwen could see she was going but gwen did see and pulled her down again so that she had to smile and say howdoyoudo to gwens mother and governess i mustnt stop im afraid said clarissa hurriedly bills people have come and i mustnt keep them waiting gwendoline looked at her meaningly clarissa knew what that look meant say something about my heart but alas she found that she no longer believed in gwendolines heart she was sure that the girl had lied about that now just as she had lied about the other things a few minutes back and are you in the tennis or swimming exhibitions asked mrs lacy her large pale blue eyes so like gwens looking down at clarissas small face no im not im afraid said clarissa you see poor clarissa has a weak heart said gwen hastily seeing a very good opening indeed here for clarissa to bring up the subject of gwens own heart but clarissa didnt say a word poor child said mrs lacy what a dreadful affliction for a young girl now gwen has always had such a strong heart im glad to say and doesnt she look well nowso plump and bonny gwen looked at clarissa in desperation this was all wrong she gave her a sharp nudge but still clarissa didnt mention gwens weak heart gwen glared at her angrily clarissa was now tonguetied she sat there red in the face her eyes bunking behind their thick glasses wondering how in the world to get away from gwen and her silly mother bill came to her rescue with a shout clarissa i say can you come were ready i must go said clarissa nervously and got up gladly goodbye mrs lacy but clarissa called gwendoline after her dismayed and angry that clarissa hadnt done what she had said she would do who did you say that girl was said mrs lacy i didnt catch the name its clarissa carter said gwen sulkily why did she have to rush off like that rude i call it a most unattractive child said mrs lacy very plain indeed no manners either gwendoline i do hope she isnt a friend of yours oh no mother said gwendoline making up her mind that after clarissas failure to help her that morning she would never be friendly with her again i dont like her at all very plain as you sayalmost uglyand undergrown too not at all clever and rather unpopular i should think so said miss winter she must have been very badly brought up when i compare her with gwendolinewell gwendoline basked in their approval she kept a sharp watch for mamzelle mamzelle was her only hope now the day went by very fast the tennis exhibition was loudly applauded and the swimming and diving were exclaimed at in wonder even the fathers admiring the crisp clean strokes of the fast swimmers and the beautiful diving afterwards the dancing display was held in the amphitheatre of grass in the centre of the great courtyard mothers and fathers sat on the stone ledges surrounding the big circle looking for their own girls as they came tripping in dressed in floating tulle of different coloursand each parent of course felt certain that her own child was quite the nicest there clarissa came back after her picnic lunch with bill and her family she did not go near gwen and would not even look in her direction in case she was beckoned over but gwen made no signshe had finished with clarissa the horrid little twofaced thing most unfortunately for gwendoline mamzelle kept quite out of reach the whole day she was busy helping the dancing mistress dressing the girls arranging their tulle skirts and wings thoroughly enjoying herself gwendoline had to comfort herself by thinking that she would find it easy to get mamzelle the next day she would ask mamzelle to show her mother and miss winter the beautiful bedspread she was making mamzelle would certainly love to do thatshe was very proud of her bedspread i wish this day wasnt over sighed darrell that night it was lovelyand what a smashing tea she was happy because her mother and father hadnt said a word about her not being headgirl any longerbut each of them had managed to convey to her that they understood all about it and were backing her valiantlyher father by an extra hard hug and her mother by linking her arm in darrells and holding it very hard as she walked round the towers with her felicity of course was mad with joy to see her parents again i love malory towers she kept saying thank you for sending me here mummy and daddy i simply love it before the exam the next day the girls expected most of their parents again and could go out with them the whole day long clarissa stood at the window looking out eagerly gwendoline saw her i suppose shes looking for her mother she thought horrid thing i shant even speak to her she saw clarissa suddenly wave in delight then she ran from the room and disappeared down the stairs gwen looked out to see what her mother was likeand if the car was a grand one to her surprise she saw an old austin in the drive and out of it stepped a most ordinarylooking woman she had on a neat blue suit with a white blouse and a scarf tied round her grey hair she wore glasses and had rather large feet in very sensible looking shoes well i dont think much of clarissas motheror her car thought gwen to herself why the car hasnt even been cleaned and fancy arriving with a scarf tied round her head my mother would never dream of doing that she thought of her own mother with her large flowery hats her flowery dresses her flowery parasol her floating scarves and strings of pearls she would be ashamed of anyone like clarissas mother she turned away a sneer on her face glad that she no longer meant to have clarissa for a friend what a lovely sneer said an aggravating voice and gwen saw belinda whipping out her pencil hold it gwen hold it gwen made a noise like a dog growling and went out of the room now she must find mamzelle and tell her that her mother wanted to see the beautiful bedspread this went down very well indeed and mamzelle hurried to get it to show that nice kind mrs lacy every single girl was out for the whole day either with her own parents or with someone elses miss grayling was glad that the halfterm came just before the school certificate exam so that the hardworked girls might have a little time off to enjoy themselves they really were working very hard miss williams reported except gwendoline lacy of course there was an unsatisfactory girl for you by seven oclock everyone was backexcept gwendoline wheres our dear gwendoline asked alicia looking round the suppertable nobody knew then mamzelle looking rather solemn enlightened them poor gwendolineshe has been taken home because of her bad heart said mamzelle she has the palpitations so bad poor poor child and will you believe it when i told mrs lacyah the poor womanabout gwendolines affliction she said that the dear brave child had not complained to her or said a single word truly this poor child is to be admired the girls digested this startling information in astonishment they looked at one another so gwens pulled it off after all said sally shell miss the exam mamzelle overheard yes she will miss the examand how upset she was no mother she said so bravely i cannot go home with youi must do the exam i did not tell you of my trouble because i could not bear to miss the exam that is what she said with my own ears i heard her the upper fourth felt sick what a sham how hateful of gwendoline to upset her mother like that and she had got her way after all and would miss the exam clever deceitful sly gwendoline you were right connie said alicia how right mamzelle whats going to happen to our darling gwendoline mary then isnt she coming back this term that would be too good to be true i dont know said mamzelle i know nuzzings more i am glad i was able to tell mrs lacy just to think that if i had not taken my bedspread to show her she would never have known i suppose gwen asked you to take the bedspread said connie and i suppose one of her palpitations came on whilst you were there mamzelle i do not understand why you talk in this sneering way connie said mamzelle surprised you must not be hard you must have sympathy the girls made various rude noises which surprised mamzelle very much why these poohs and pahs and pullings of faces no no that was not kind mamzelle pursed up her lips and said no more well said darrell in the dormy that night gwens got away with it all rightbut fancy mamzelle falling for all that mamzelle rougier wouldnt she sees right through gwendolinejust like miss williams does all the sameshes lucky getting out of the exam groaned belinda wish i could its going to be awful to swot and swot all this week after such a lovely halfterm and thennext monday the exam im surprised you cant all hear my heart going down with a plop into my bedroom slippers it was very hard to swot in such lovely weather alicia longed for a game of tennis darrell longed for the swimmingpool clarissa longed to go and laze in the flowery courtyard and watch the goldfish jumping belinda wanted to go out sketching irene became plagued with an enchanting tune that begged to be put down on paperbut poor irene had to turn her back firmly on the lilting melody and do pages and pages of french translation there was a lot of touchiness and irritability that week the twins were on edge especially ruth though she had less to fear in the exam than connie who was not nearly so well up to standard irene was touchy because she wanted to get at her beloved music and couldnt darrell was irritable because she was too hot mavis was hot and bothered because she thought she was going to have a sore throatjust as her voice seemed about t get right too only alicia seemed really cheerful and dontcarish and this attitude infuriated the others at times alicia was always the one to finish her work first and go off to swim she could do her work and whistle an irritating little tune all the time which nearly drove the others frantic she laughed at their earnest facess and their heartfelt groans its not worth all this amount of misery she would say its only school cert cheer up conniedont look like a dying duck over that french connie flared up as she had done to gwendoline she banged her book down on the table and shouted be quiet just because things are easy for you to learn you sneer at others who arent so lucky wait till you have a bad headache and have to learn pages of french poetry wait till your mind goes fuzzy because youre tired and want to sleep and you know you mustnt wait till you have a bad night and have to think of things to say in a composition then you wont be quite so hard and dontcarish and sneering and youll shut up that awful whistling too alicia was startled she opened her mouth to retaliate but sally spoke first connie doesnt really mean all that she said in her quiet calm voice were all overworking and were irritable and touchy well be all right when the exam is over after all its an important exam for us and were all taking it seriously and doing our best lets not squabble and quarrel when we want to save ourselves up for next week darrel looked at sally in admiration how did she always know the right things to say she had certainly poured oil on the troubled waters very successfully because connie spoke up at once im sorry i said all that alicia i am overworking and im touchy its all right said alicia rather taken aback by this swift apology sorry about my whistlingand if anyone wants any help theyve only got to ask me ill share these envied brains of mine with anyone after this there was peace alicia shut her book quietly and crept out the others worked on in silence would they ever ever know all they ought to know for the exam why hadnt they swotted more during the year why hadnt they done this and that and the other in fact their thoughts were almost exactly the same as every other examclasss thoughts the week before the exam the week went by and the girls worked more and more feverishly miss williams forbade any work to be done on the sunday before the exam and there were deep groans and then came a surprise gwendoline arrived back at malory towers she came back on the saturday just before supper looking subdued and tearful she had a short interview with miss grayling and then was sent to join the others who had just gone in to their supper why gwen said mavis in astonishment seeing her first we thought you werent coming back ah here is gwendoline back again said mamzelle and how is the poor heart all right thank you mumbled gwen slipping into her seat and trying to look as if she was not there the girls saw that she had been crying and tried not to look at her they knew how horrid it was to have people looking at red eyes jolly lucky youll be next week said sally trying to make light conversation whilst were all answering exam papers youll be lazing away in the courtyard doing what you like there was a little pause ive got to go in for the exam said gwen in a choking voice thats why theyve sent me back its too bad to the girls dismay gwendolines tears began to fall fast into her plate of salad they looked uncomfortably at one another whatever had happened better not say any more whispered darrell dont take any notice of her poor gwen the exam week nobody ever knew what exactly had happened to gwen she was much too hurt and ashamed to tell anyone the story so she said nothing but went about subdued and redeyed the whole weekend everything had gone so well at first her frightened mother had taken her straight home after mamzelle had mentioned gwens strange heart fluttering and palpitations she had made her lie down and rest and she and miss winter had fussed over her like a hen with one chick gwendoline had loved every minute and had at once produced the languid ways and the feeble voice of the invalid she was rather pleased to know that her father was away and not likely to be back at all that week by that time gwen hoped she would be established as a semiinvalid would miss all the exam and might then gradually get better once the exam danger was over the doctor came and listened solemnly to gwens mothers frightened explanations im so afraid its her heart thats wrong doctor she said the games are very strenuous at school you know the doctor examined gwen carefully well i cant find anything wrong he said nothing that a weeks rest wont put right anyway shes a bit fat isnt sheshe could do with a bit of dieting i should think oh but doctorthere must be something wrong with the childs heart insisted mrs lacy miss winter and i have been very troubled to see how she loses her breath and can hardly get up to the top stair when she goes to her bedroom wellwhy not get another opinion then said the doctor i should like you to satisfy yourself about gwendoline ill take her to a specialist said mrs lacy at once can you recommend one doctor the doctor could and did and on wednesday the languid invalid was carefully driven up to london to see the specialist recommended he took one quick glance at gwendoline and sized her up at once he examined her very carefully indeed with so many hms and has that gwendoline began to feel frightened surely she hadnt really got something the matter with her she would die if she had the specialist had a short talk with mrs lacy alone i will think over this and will write to your doctor full details and let him know the result of my considerations in the meantime dont worry he said on friday the doctor got a letter from the specialist and it made him smile there was nothing wrong with gwendolines heart of course in fact nothing wrong anywhere at all except that she was too fat and needed very much more exercise games and more games gym walks no rich food no sweets plenty of hard work and no thinking about herself at all wrote the specialist shes just a little humbug swimming especially would be good for her it would take some fat off her tummy the doctor had to paraphrase all this considerably of course when he telephoned the news to mrs lacy that there was nothing the matter with gwen i should send her back to school at once he said its not good for the girl to lie about like this gwen was angry and miserable when she heard all this she laid her hand to her heart as if it pained her oh mother she said ill go back if you say sobut give me one more weeki feel so much better for the rest mrs lacy promised gwen that she should not go back for another week or more gwen was satisfied so long as she missed the exam she didnt mind then her father arrived home anxious because of his wifes letters and telephone calls about gwen gwen lay on the couch and gave him a pathetic smile he kissed her and inquired anxiously what the specialist had said what nothing wrong he said in astonishment ill go round and see the doctor id like to see the specialists letter myself i shall feel more satisfied then and so it came about that gwens father actually read the candid lettersaw that gwen was called a little humbugknew very clearly indeed that once more his daughter had tried a little deceptiona cruel deception that had caused her parents much anxietyand all because she had merely wanted to get out of working for the exam what he said to gwendoline the girl never forgot he was angry and scornful and bitterand at the end he was sad you are my only child he said i want to love you and be proud of you like all parents why do you make it so hard for me to be proud of you and to love you gwendoline you have made your mother ill with this and you have made me angry and disgustedand very sad i wont do it again sobbed gwendoline terrified and ashamed you must go back to school tomorrow said her father oh no daddy i cant its the exam wailed gwendoline i havent done any work for it i dont care go in for it just the same fail and be humiliated said her father you have brought it all on yourself i am telephoning to miss grayling to apologize for taking you away and to give her the specialists instructionsgames more games gym walksand most of all swimming swimming the one thing gwen detested most of all she dissolved into tears again and wept the whole of the evening and the whole of the way down to cornwall the next day what had she done to herself she hadnt been so clever after all it had all ended in her having to take the exam without working for it and in having to go in for games more than everand probably bathe every single day in that nasty cold pool poor gwen people do often bring punishment on themselves for foolishnessbut not often to the extent that gwendoline did the exam began everyone was jitteryeven alicia curiously enough day after day the work went on whilst the bright july sun shone in through the open windows and the bees hummed enticingly outside the girls were glad to rush off to the swimmingpool after tea each daythen back again they went to swot up for the next days exam something curious had happened to alicia she didnt understand it the first day she sat and looked at the questions feeling sure they would be easy for her so they were but she found that she could not collect her thoughts properly she put her hand up to her head surely she wasnt beginning a headache she struggled with the questionsyes struggleda thing the quickwitted neverataloss alicia had hardly ever done before she looked round at the others puzzledgoodness how could they write so quickly what had happened to her alicia had seldom known a days illness she was strong and healthy and clever she really could not imagine why this exam was so difficult she could not go to sleep at night but lay tossing and turning had she been overworking nosurely notthe others had worked far harder than she had and had envied her for not having to swot so much well what was it then gosh thought alicia trying to find a cool place on her pillow i know what it must feel like now to have slow brains like daphne or a poor memory like gwendoline i cant remember a thingand if i try my brains wont work they feel as if they want oiling the others noticed that alicia was rather quiet and subdued that week but as they all felt rather like that they said nothing quite a few of them went about looking very worried ruth looked white and drawn connie looked anxious gwendoline looked miserable daphne was almost in tears over the frenchwhat a collection they were thought miss williamsjust like every other school certificate form she had ever known when exams were on never mindit would be all behind them next week and they would be in the highest spirits she glanced at one or two of the papers when they were collected darrell was doing fine gwendoline would be lucky if she got quarter marks marylou was unexpectedly good connies was poorruths was not good either how strange ruth was usually well up to standard it was doubtful if she would pass if she completed the rest of her papers badly and alicia whatever in the world had happened to her bad writingsilly mistakesgood gracious was alicia playing the fool but alicia wasnt she couldnt help it something had happened to her that week and she was frightened now it must be a punishment to me for always laughing and sneering at people who arent as quick and clever as i am she thought in dismay my brains have gone woolly and slow and stupid like gwens and daphnes i cant remember a thing how horrible im trying so hard too that my head feels as if its bursting is this what the others feel sometimes when i laugh at them for looking so serious over their work its horrible horrible horrible if only my brains would come back properly im frightened is anything the matter alicia said darrell on the last day of the exam you look all out alicia never complained no matter what went wrong with her no she said im all right its just the exam she sat next to darrell for the exam at the end of the last paper darrell heard a slight noise she looked up and gave a cry alicia had fallen forward over her papers miss williams alicias fainted she called matron was called and as soon as alicia came round again looking bemused and strange she was taken to the san matron undressed herand cried out in surprise youve got measles alicia just look at this rashi never saw anything like it in my life didnt you notice it before wellyesbut i thought it was just a heatrash said alicia trying to smile oh matronim so glad its only measles i thoughti really thought my brains had gone this week i felt as if i was going potty and i was awfully frightened alicia felt so thankful when she got in to bed and rested her aching head against the cool pillow she felt ill but happy it was only measles she had had that awful week it wasnt that her brains had really gone woolly and stupidit wasnt a punishment sent to her for sneering at the others who were slower than herselfit was justmeasles and with that alicia fell asleep and her temperature began to go down she felt much better when she awoke her brains felt better too im afraid youll have no visitors or company this week alicia said sister who was in charge of the san matron had now departed back to school just your own thoughts yesjust her own thoughts thankfulness that she wasnt going to be slow and stupid after allshame that she had been so full of sneers and sarcastic remarks to others not so clever as herselfsadness because she knew she must have done terrible papers and would surely fail she would have to take school cert all over again blow well thought alicia her brains really at work again as her strong and healthy body began to throw off the disease wellid better learn my lessoni shant be so beastly hard again but i honestly didnt know what it was like to have slow brains now i do its awful fancy having them all your life and knowing you cant alter them ill never sneer at others again never at least not if i can remember it its a frightful habit with me now it was indeed alicia was going to find it very hard indeed to alter herselfbut still she had taken the first important stepshe had realized that there was something to alter she would never be quite so hard again the exams were over at last the girls went quite mad and the mistresses let them the swimmingpool was noisy and full the tennis courts were monopolized by the upper fourth the kitchen staff were begged for icecreams and iced lemonade at every hour of the dayor so it seemed girls went about singing and even sourfaced mamzelle rougier smiled to see them so happy after the exam gwendoline wasnt very happy of course miss grayling had taken her fathers instructions seriously and gwen was having more games more walksand more swimming than she had ever had before but it was no good complaining or grumbling she had brought it all on herselfit was nobodys fault but her own the connie affair now we can have a good time for the rest of the term said darrell pleased no more swottingno more long preps even because miss williams says weve done enough well enjoy ourselves it ought to be a nice peaceful end of term with no horrid happenings said sally when alicia comes back it win be nicer still sally was wrong when she said there ought to be a nice peaceful end of term with no horrid happeningsbecause the very next day the connie affair began it began with quite small thingsa missing rubberan essay spoilt because a page was missing apparently torn outa lace gone from one of connies shoes nobody took any notice at firstthings always were missing anyhow and turned up in the most ridiculous placesand pages did get torn out of books and laces had a curious habit of disappearing but the connie affair didnt end there connie was always in trouble about something now my french poetry book has gone she complained now my cotton has gone out of my workbasket now this and now that but conniehow is it that so many things happen to you lately said darrell puzzled i dont understand it its almost as if somebody was plaguing youbut who could it be not one of us would do silly idiotic things like thissort of firstform spite connie shook her head i cant think whos doing it she said i suppose it is someone it cant be a series of accidentstheres too many of them what do you think about it ruth asked darrellbut connie answered first oh ruth cant think who does it either its very upsetting for her because twins are always so fond of one another shes sweet tookeeps on giving me her things when i lose mine well its certainly most extraordinary said darrell im very sorry about it its a horrid thing to happen in the fourth form the girls talked about the connie affair as they called it and puzzled about it one or two of them looked at gwendoline wondering if she had anything to do with it dont you remember how connie flared out at gwen and put her finger on gwens weak spotwhen she was putting over that nonsense about her heart said daphne and you knowgwen has done these nasty tricks before dont you remember she did them to marylou when we were in the second form give a dog a bad name and hang him quoted darrell just because gwen did once do thing like this and got a bad name for it doesnt mean we ought to accuse her of the same thing now for goodness sake wait a bit before we decide anything there speaks a headgirl said irene darrell flushed im not headgirl she said wish i was but seriously it really is jolly queer all this business the things are so very silly tooconnies inkpot was stuffed up with blottingpaper this morning did you know well said belinda how petty yesmost of the things are petty and spiteful and quite futile said darrell you dont suppose theyll get any worse do you i meanstop being petty and get harmful lets hope not said mavis here are the twins hallo connieanything more to report yessomebodys cut my racket handle she said and showed it to them just where i grip it mean isnt it you can use mine connie i told you said ruth who was looking very distressed you can use anything of mine i know ruthbut supposing your things get messed up too said connie id hate that its all very very queer said irene and hummed a new melody she had just composed tootytooiytee mavis sang to itits all veryqueer its allveryqueer i say said darrell your voice is coming back thats just how you used to sing mavis it is really yes i know said mavis her face red with pleasure ive tried it out when ive been alonethough thats not often hereand i thought it had come back too let me sing a song for you and you can tell me if you think ive got my voice back she sang a song that the lower school had been learning who is sylvia what is she the girls listened spellbound yesthere was no doubt about it maviss lovely low powerful voice had come back againbetter than ever and this time it was owned by a somebody not a nobody as it had been before we shall once again hear you saying when im an opera singer and sing in rome and new york and began darrell but mavis shook her head no you wont you know you wont im not like that now or am i do say im not youre not youre not said everyone anxious to reassure a girl they all liked darrell clapped her on the back im so glad mavis that almost makes up for this horrid connie affair youll be able to have singing lessons again next term for a day or two it seemed as if the connie affair was at an end connie did not report any more strange happenings then she came to the commonroom almost in tears look she said and held up her ridingwhip it was one she had won at a jumping competition and was very very proud of it the girls looked someone had gashed the whip all the way down so that in places it was almost cut through i had it out riding this afternoon said connie in a trembling voice i came home and took my horse to the stable you took two horses said bill yours and ruths too i saw you i took the horses to the stable said connie and left my whip there when i went back to look for it i found it like this anyone in the stables said darrell no nobody at all bill had been there of course and june and felicity had tooand i and ruth nobody else said connie well one of those must have done it said darrell but honestly i cant believe any of them did ruth and bill certainly wouldnt my sister felicity wouldnt even think of such a thing and i feel pretty certain june wouldnt either much as i dislike that cheeky little brat anyway both the firstformers had gone by the time id stabled the horses said connie you didnt see them when we left did you ruth no said ruth did you notice anyone else at all when you were grooming your horse ruth asked darrell puzzled she didnt even groom her horse connie answered for her i always do that she stood there looking at all the other horses and would have seen anyone slinking round everyone was puzzled ruth went out of the room and came back with her own whip a very fine one youre to have this connie she said im so upset about all these things happening i insist on your taking my whip no no said connie i dont mind taking things like rubbers and shoelacesbut not your beautiful whip that evening darrell was alone with bill she was worried and puzzled bill she said are you sure there was nobody else in the stable but you and the twins this afternoon i supposeerwell gwendoline wasnt there was she no said bill i hated to ask that said darrell but it is just the kind of thing gwen would do its her own fault if we think things like that of her said bill why does connie groom ruths horse for her asked darrell is ruth so lazy shes always letting connie do things no shes not lazy said bill shes just queer i thinka shadow of connie well i must go and give thunder a lump of sugar darrell see you later she went out and left darrell thinking hard a curious idea had come to her mind she fitted one thing into another like a jigsaw puzzleshe remembered all the unkind things that had been done to connie and she remembered also all the kind things that ruth had done to try and put right the unkind things she remembered also a queer look she had seen on ruths face that evening when connie had refused ruths whip a kind of frightened halfangry look thought darrell just as if shed apologized to connie and the apology had been refused and then something clicked in her mind and she suddenly saw who the spiteful person might be that played all these petty tricks on connie what am i to do about it wondered darrell i cant tell anyone in case im wrong its got to be stopped and im half afraid of going and tackling anyone to get it stopped but i must its serious she got up and went in search of ruth yes it was ruth she wanted and ruth she must tackle darrell puts things right where was ruth she wasnt in the commonroom or the dormy or the classroom where could she be anyone seen ruth asked darrell when she met any girls in her search nobody had but at last a secondformer said she thought she had seen ruth going into the gardeners shed by the stables darrell sped off to look she came to the shed where the gardeners kept their tools and stopped outside the door to try and think what she was to say as she stood there she heard a curious sound somebody was certainly in the shedand the sound was like a kind of groan darrell pushed open the door quietly and looked in ruth was there right at the back sitting on some sacks in her hand she held the cut and broken ridingwhip which she had obviously been trying to mend she didnt see darrell at first she put her hand over her face and made another soundeither a groan or a sob darrell didnt know which ruth said darrell going up ruth whats the matter ruth leapt up in fright when she saw it was darrell she sat down on the sacks again and turned her face away still holding the broken whip ruth said darrell going right up to the girl why did you spoil that lovely whip of connies ruth looked up quickly amazement and dismay on her face what do you mean she said i didnt spoil it who said i did who said so did connie no nobody said so but i know you did said darrell and it was you who did all the other horrid things wasnt ittook this and that hid things and broke things anything you could get hold of that belonged to connie dont tell anyone begged ruth clasping darrells hand tightly please dont i wont do it again ever but ruthwhy did you do it asked darrell very puzzled anyone would think that you hated your twin ruth slapped the broken whip against the sacks she looked sulky i do hate her she said i always have donebut oh darrell i love her too darrell listened to this in surprise but you cant love a person and hate them at the same time she said at last you can said ruth fiercely you can darrell i love connie because shes my twinand hate her becausebecauseoh i cant tell you darrell looked for a long time at ruths bent head and saw the tears rolling off her cheeks i think i know why you hate connie she said at last isnt it because shes so domineeringalways answering for you doing things for you that youd rather do yourselfpushing herself in front of youas if she was at least two years older yes said ruth rubbing her wet cheeks i never get a chance to say what i think connie always gets in first of course i know she must have a better brain than i have but she hasnt said darrell at once actually she ought to be in the lower fourth not in the upper i heard miss williams say so they only put her with you in the upper class because you were twins and your mother said you wouldnt like to be separated connie only keeps up with the form because you help her so much there was a silence darrell thought about everything all over again how very queer this was then a question arose in her mind and she asked ruth at once ruthwhy did you suddenly begin to be so beastly to connie you never were before so far as i noticed it all seemed quite sudden i cant tell you said ruth but ohim so miserable about it well if you wont tell me i shall go and ask connie said darrell getting up somethings gone awfully wrong ruth and i dont know if i can put it right but im going to have a jolly good try dont go to connie begged ruth i dont want you to tell her it was me that was so beastly all the time and oh darrell i was so sorry for connie too when i saw how upset she was at losing her things its dreadful to hate somebody and make them unhappy and then to know you love them and try to comfort them i suppose thats why you kept giving connie your own things said darrell sitting down on a tub queer business this first you hate your twin and do something to upset her like spoiling the ridingwhip she lovedand then you love her and are sorryand come to give her your own ridingwhip i could see you were upset when she didnt take it darrelli will tell you why i hated connie so much lately said ruth suddenly wiping her eyes with her hands i feel ive got to tell someone wellit was something awful whatever was it said darrell curiously you seeconnie adores me and likes to protect me and do everything for me began ruth and so far we have always been in the same class together but connie was afraid she would fail in school cert and felt sure i would pass so you would said darrell and connie would certainly fail wellconnie thought that if she failed and i passed id go up into the lower fifth next term and she would have to stay down in the upper fourth and take the exam again another term went on ruth and that would mean she wouldnt be with me any more so she asked me to do a bad paper so that i would fail tooand then we could still be together darrell was so astonished at this extraordinary statement that she couldnt say a single word at last she found her tongue ruth how wicked to make you fail and feel humiliated when you could so easily pass she cant love you oh but she doestoo much said ruth anyway i said i would do a bad papersomehow i just cant help doing what connie wants even if its something horrid like thatso i did do a bad paperand then afterwards i hated connie so much for making me do it that i did all these horrible things to her poor ruth put her face in her hands and began to sob barrel went and sat on the sacks beside her and put her strong comforting arm round ruths shoulders i see she said its all very peculiar and extraordinary but somehow quite understandable its because youre twins i expect connie should have been your elder sister then it wouldnt have mattered you could have loved each other like ordinary sisters do and youd have been in different forms and things would have been all right cheer up ruth its all been frightening and horrible to you but honestly i can see quite well how it all happened ruth looked up comforted by barrens simple explanation she pushed her hair back and sniffed darrell please please dont tell connie i did all those things she said im awfully sorry now that i did she wouldnt understand and shed be awfully upset and unhappy i couldnt bear that yesbut you cant go on like thisbeing bossed by connie and being just an echo for her said darrell sensibly i dont see any way of stopping it except for us to tell her ill come with you if you like but ruth began to sob so much when darrell suggested this that darrell had to give up the idea a distant bell sounded and she got up youd better go and bathe your eyes she said kindly ill try and think of some way to put things right without telling conniebut its going to be difficult ruth went off sniffing but much comforted darrell rubbed her nose hard as she often did when she was puzzled theres only one thing to do she said and thats to tell miss williams somethings got to be done so that evening after supper miss williams was astonished to find darrell at her door asking for an interview she wondered if darrell had come to beg to have her position as headgirl restored to her but it wasnt that darrell poured out the strange story of the twins miss williams listened in the greatest amazement the things that could go on in a school that nobody knew about even though the girls concerned were under her nose all day long so you see miss williams finished darrell if ruth cant bear connie to be told everything is as bad as before theyll both fail the exam theyll both stay down in the upper fourth instead of going up next term and poor ruth will go on being domineered over and will hate and love connie at the same time it must be horrible very horrible thought miss williams horrified and very dangerous things like this often lead to something very serious later on she did not say this to darrell who sat earnestly watching her waiting for some advice darrell i think it was very clever of you to find this out said miss williams at last and you have acted very wisely all through i do really feel very pleased with you darrell went red and looked pleased can you think how to put things right she asked oh miss williams wasnt it a pity that ruth did a bad exam paper if she hadnt things would have got right of themselvesthe twins would have been in different forms darrell said miss williams after a pause what i am going to say now is between you and me i glanced at all the exam papers before sending them upand ruth didnt do quite as bad a one as she thought in fact i feel pretty certain she will scrape through oh good said darrell delighted i never thought of that so theyll be in different forms next term after all then i think so said miss williams that will give ruth a chance to stand on her own feet and develop a personality of her own instead of being connies shadowand connie will have to stop domineering over herit will all disappear naturally and gradually which is the best thing that could happen in this curious case wont connie know anything then asked darrell wont she have to be told that will be ruths business and no concern of anyone elses said miss williams some day when the right time comes she may choose to confess to connieand perhaps they will even laugh at it all keep an eye on ruth for me will you darrell for the rest of the term youre in her confidence now and i shall trust you to see that nothing else goes wrong between the twins oh i will said darrell pleased to be asked this id love to i like ruth and darrelli shall make you headgirl again in two days time said miss williams and this time i shall be very very proud of you ping everyone was delighted when miss williams announced in her quiet voice two days later that darrell was once more to be headgirl of the form thank you for taking on the position temporarily she said to sally but i am now convinced that darrell deserves to be promoted again why darrell why has miss williams put you back as head this week asked belinda and the others after class but darrell didnt tell them of course miss williams hadnt actually said that it was because of her trying to put right the affair of the twinsbut she knew that it was she had really acted like a responsible headgirl then no more spiteful things were done to connie and gradually the connie affair as it was called was forgotten ruth seemed to forget her dislike and resentment and was very sweet to connie next term thought darrell things will be quite all righttheyll be in different forms and ruth can go ahead with her good brains and connie can work at her own pace and keep her hands off ruth the term was slipping away fast now alicia was better and fortunately no one else had caught measles from her most of the upper fourth had already had them which was fortunate alicia groaned because she felt sure she had failedand would have to take the school certificate all over again she was to come back to school a week before breakingup the girls were very pleased they had all missed alicias quickness and sense of fun gwendoline was perhaps the only one who didnt want her back poor gwenshe had already lost some of her fat through having to play so much tennis and go for so many walks and swimor try toeach day but she certainly looked healthier and her spots were rapidly going clarissa amazed the class one day by coming back from a visit to the dentist and the occulist looking completely different i havent got to wear glasses any more she announced and that awful wires been taken from my front teeth do you recognize me girls hardly said darrell and belinda got out her pencil to make a sketch of this different and most attractive clarissa she stood laughing in front of themher deep green eyes flashing round and her white teeth no longer spoilt by an ugly wire her wavy auburn hair suited her eyes and she looked unusual and somehow distinguished youll be a beauty one day clarissa said belinda her artists eye seeing clarissa at twentyone lovely and unusual in her colouring well welltalk about an ugly duckling turning into a swan clarissa was now fast friends with bill much to the girls amusement nobody had ever thought that the boyish bill who seemed only to care for her horse thunder and for miss peters would make a friend in her form but she had and the two chattered continually together always about horses and rode whenever they could gwendoline didnt care since she had seen clarissa going off at halfterm with the dowdylooking elderly woman in the old austin car she had taken no further interest in her gwendoline wanted a grand friend not somebody ordinary whose people didnt even dean their old car when they came at halfterm so gwen was once more alone with no one to talk or giggle with no one to call her friend we ought to do something to celebrate alicia coming back said belinda shes coming tomorrow yes lets do something said darrell at once something mad and bad said betty who was in the courtyard with the others a trick said irene we havent played a trick for two whole terms think of it what are we coming to we must be getting old and staid yes lets play a trick said sally after all the exams are over and we worked jolly hardwe deserve a really good laugh what trick shall we play asked mavis betty didnt you bring anything back this term last term you brought back that awful spider that could dangle from the ceiling like a real onebut we never got a chance of using it gosh id like to have seen mamzelles face if we had managed to let it down over her desk everyone giggled i didnt bring it back with me this term said betty regretfully i stayed with alicia in the hols and one of her brothers bagged it but i tell you what i have got what asked everyone getting thrilled i havent tried them yet said betty theyre awfully queer things theyre little grey pellets quite flat one side is sticky and you stick it to the ceiling what happens asked irene you have to dab each pellet with some kind of liquid said betty trying to remember at least i think thats rightand then according to the instructions a queer bubble detaches itself slowly from the pellet floats downwards and suddenly popsand makes a pinging sound everyone listened in delight betty its too marvellous for words said irene thrilled lets play the trick tomorrow to celebrate alicias coming back well betty stuck some pellets to the have to get the stepladder to put some of the pellets on the ceiling lets do it when mamzelle takes us shes always fun to play tricks on so with much secrecy the stepladder was hidden in the cupboard outside the upper fourth classroom and just before morning school three fiat grey pellets were quickly fixed to the ceiling where quite miraculously so it seemed to the girls they stuck very tightly indeed and could hardly be seen at all betty brushed each one over quickly with the liquid from a small bottle sent with the pellets then the ladder was bundled into the cupboard again just as mamzelles high heels were heard tiptapping down the corridor daphne flew to hold the door open and the others stood ready in their places merci daphne said mamzelle briskly ah aliciait is very very good to see you back you have had a bad time with your measle well actually i didnt mind my measle very much after the first day said alicia with a grin she was looking very well now it is good that no one got the measle from you said mamzelle sitting down at her desk i had a measle last year said irene and this was the signal for everyone to talk about when they had a measle too mamzelle had to bring the talk to an end because it showed signs of getting very boisterous we will have no more measly talk she said firmly and wondered why the girls laughed so much at this they took quick surreptitious glances at the ceiling every now and again longing to see the new trick at work alicia had heard all about it of course and was thrilled with their novel way of celebrating her return she had suggested that everyone should pretend they could not see the bubbles or hear the ping when they exploded mamzelle will think shes gone crackers she said i know i should if i saw bubbles that pinged round me when nobody else did today i go through the questions that you answered on the exam paper said mamzelle smiling round you will tell me what you put and i will say if it was good or no oh no mamzelle protested alicia we had to do the examlets forget it now its over anyway i did such a frightful paper ive failed i know i cant bear to think of the exam questions now irene nudged belinda one of the grey pellets was beginning its performance a small grey bubble was beginning to form up on the ceiling it grew a little bigger became heavy enough to detach itself and floated gently down into the air all three pellets had been placed just above the big desk belonging to miss williams where mamzelle was now sitting with bated breath the girls watched the bubble slowly descend it looked as if it was about to fall on mamzelles head decided not to and skirted round her hair near her left ear when it got there it burst suddenly and a curious sharp very metallic ping sounded mamzelle almost jumped out of her skin tiens she said quest ce que cest que go what was that what was what mamzdle asked sally innocently a pingcomme qal said mamzelle and pinged again ping did you not hear a ping sally a ping what exactly do you mean mamzelle asked sally putting on a puzzled look that made darrell want to cry with laughter you dont mean a pong do you perhaps she means a pingpong suggested irene and began to giggle so did mavis darrell frowned at them i sit here and suddenly in my ear there comes a ping said mamzelle i feel it on my ear oh i thought you meant you heard it said sally i hear it and i feel it said mamzelle que cest drole go how queer another bubble was now descending the girls trying not to appear as if they were watching it waited for it to descend near mamzelle it floated down and exploded behind her head ping it was a most extraordinary little sound small but very sharp and dear mamzelle leapt to her feet wildly she turned and looked behind her there it comes again she cried it was on my neckand ping it went what can this be i expect its just noises in your ears mamzelle said darrell comfortingly this made irene give one of her terrific snorts and daphne and mavis began to laugh helplessly do you not hear this ping darrell said mamzelle beginning to look scared i am ping another bubble popped with a ping and mamzelle stood with her mouth open in amazement what was this pinging and why could not the girls hear it ahawas it a trick is this a trick she began a bad wicked trick on your poor old mamzelle again i have not ping a little bubble landed fairly and squarely on mamzelles bun of hair on the top of her head and pinged valiantly mamzelle shrieked what is it she cried stop laughing girls tell me what it is this ping she saw irene looking up at the ceiling and she looked too but at that moment no bubble was descending and she saw nothing then a bubble which had actually got almost to the floor without popping pinged just by her foot mamzelle jumped as if she had been shot she leapt up again and made for the door cest unbelievable she cried it is unbelievable i go to fetch help last week of term by this time of course the girls were almost helpless with laughter tears were pouring down darrells cheeks and sally was holding her sides aching with laughter irene appeared to be choking and alicia and betty were holding on to each other helplessly mamzelle rushed to miss williams she was taking a class in the second form and was amazed at mamzelles sudden entrance miss williams i beg you to come with me to your classroom mamzelle besought the astonished miss williams it goes ping right in my earsyes and down by my foot miss williams looked astounded was mamzelle of her head what was all this ping and pong business the second form began to giggle mamzelle what exactly do you mean asked miss williams rather crossly be more explicit in your classroom there are pings and pongs said mamzelle again the girls do not hear them but i do and i i do not like it miss williams come je vmis prie as it looked as if mamzelle was about to go down on her knees miss williams got up hurriedly and went with her to the upper fourth the girls had recovered a little and were on the watch to see who might be coming one or two more bubbles had floated down and burst with sharp pings and another was just about to descend sssst its miss williams said mavis suddenly from the door straighten your faces with difficulty the girls pulled their faces straight and stood up as miss williams entered with mamzelle what is all this asked miss williams impatiently what is it that mamzelle is complaining of i cant make head or tail of it it is a ping wailed mamzelle beginning to despair of making miss williams understand i think mamzelle has noises in her ears said alicia politely she hears pings and pongs she says a bubble fell near mamzelle and burst ping mamzelle jumped violently and dug miss williams unexpectedly in the ribs with her finger there it comes again ping it said dont poke me like that mamzelle said miss williams coldly whereupon another bubble burst and yet another and two pings sounded almost together miss williams began to look puzzled i go said mamzelle and took a step towards the door i go there is something abominable in this room miss williams firmly pulled mamzelle back mamzelle be sensible i heard the noise too i cannot imagine why the girls do not hear it the girls suddenly decided they had better hear the next pingso when it came they all called out together ping i heard it i heard it silence said miss williams and the girls stopped at oncejust in time for a bubble to descend on mamzelles nose and explode with an extra loud ping mamzelle shrieked it was a bobble i saw a bobble and it went ping miss williams began to think that mamzelle really must be mad this morning what was this bobble now and then miss williams herself saw a bobble as mamzelle called it the bubble sailed right past her nose and she gasped it pinged beautifully on the desk and disappeared miss williams looked silently up at the ceiling her sharp eyes saw the three flat pellets thereand saw a bubble forming slowly on one she looked bade at the class which trying not to laugh but not succeeding very well gazed back innocently at her miss williams lips twitched she didnt know what the girls had done nor exactly what the trick consisted ofbut she couldnt help feeling that it was very ingeniousyes and very funny top especially when played on someone like poor mamzelle dupont who could always be relied on to take fright at anything unusual mamzelle take your class out into the courtyard to finish the lesson she said there will be no pings there and if i were you i would give the housemaid instructions to take a broom and sweep the ceiling before you next take a class in this room this last suggestion reduced mamzelle to a state of such astonishment that she could only stand and stare after miss williams departing figure sweep the ceiling was miss williams in her right mind the class began to giggle again at mamzelles astounded faceand then as another ping sounded mamzelle plunged for the door allors she said we have been much disturbed we go to the courtyard come now we will leave behind these bad pings and pongs and go to do some work the story of the pellets and their pings flew through the school and made every girl gasp and laugh there were so many visitors to the upper fourth form room that miss williams grew quite cross she stood a broom by the door anyone else who comes can sweep the ceiling six times she said and let me tell you its not as easy as it looks ohthat has done me good said alicia that night ive never laughed so much in my life mamzelles face when that first bubble pinged i nearly died miss williams was rather a sport about it wasnt she said darrell she spotted the trick all right and wanted to laugh i saw her lips twitching ill be sorry to leave her form and go into the fifth yesnext term most of us will be up in the fifth said sally goodness how queer it will seem to be so far up the school ive liked this term said darrell although it had its horrid bitslike when i lost my place as headgirl i was glad when you got it back again said ruth speaking suddenly on her own as she had done several times lately she looked affectionately at darrell she had had a great admiration for her ever since darrell had put things right for herand had not told connie miss williams had quite casually told ruth that although she had been disappointed in her exam paper she thought probably she had passed all rightand that if connie didnt she hoped ruth wouldnt very much mind her twin being left down in the fourth whilst she ruth went up into the fifth so it looked as if things would be better next term connie would soon get over the separation and after all they would continually see each other in the dormy and at mealtimes the last few days of the term flew by the breakingup day seemed to come all at once the usual pandemonium broke out mistresses began to feel as if they were slowly going mad as girls whirled past them shouting and calling and trunks were hurled about nightcases lost rackets strewn all over the place and an incessant noise raged in every tower the traingirls went off first and were loudly cheered as the coaches moved off down the drive write to us see you next term be good if you can hurrah darrell went to find felicity who seemed to be continually disappearing she found her exchanging addresses with susan june had gone with the traingirls and darrell had noticed that felicity had not even bothered to wave goodbye to her so that friendship was finished with good darrell still thought of june with dislike but now that her little sister was no longer dragged around by june but was standing on her own feet she had lost the desire to slap june hard felicity as soon as i find you and stand you by the front door you disappear again said darrell daddy will be here soon with the car for goodness sake come with me and dont leave me again wheres your bowler hat youve got to take it home with you in case you go riding in the hols it was here a minute ago said felicity looking round oh no lookthat pest of a katie has got itwhat an ass she looksher heads miles too big for it katie katie give me my bowler felicity is there any need to yell like that said miss potts as she hurried by almost deafened oh potty i havent said goodbye to you potty yelled felicity darrell felt quite shocked to hear felicity call her formmistress potty felicity she said dont call her that well you told me that everyone was allowed to on the last day of term said felicity potty belinda came by with irenes musiccase anyone seen irene she wants her musiccase and ive just found it she disappeared and irene came along groaning wheres my wretched music i put it down for a moment and some idiot has gone off with it belindas got it hey belinda belinda mamzelle came walking by with her fingers in her ears and an agonized expression on her face these girls they have gone mad i am in an asylum why do i teach mad girls oh this noise it goes through my head mamzelle mamzelle goodbye my cars come au revoir mamzelle i say is she deaf hurrah theres our car come on irene clarissa
