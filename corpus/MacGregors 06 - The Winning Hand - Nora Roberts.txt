when her car sputtered and died a mile outside of las vegas darcy wallace seriously considered staying where she was and baking to death under the brutal desert sun she had left in her pocket and a long stretch of road behind her that led to nowhere she was lucky to have even that pitiful amount of cash on her as her purse had been stolen outside a diner in utah the night before the rubbery chicken sandwich was the last meal shed had and she figured the stray ten shed found in her pocket was the last miracle she could expect both her job and her home in kansas were gone she had no family and no one to go back to she felt shed had every reason for tossing her clothes into a suitcase and driving away from what had been and what would have been had she remained shed driven west simply because her car had been pointing in that direction and shed taken it as a sign shed promised herself an adventure a personal odyssey and a new improved life reading about plucky young women who braved the world carved a path took risks and blithely accepted challenges was no longer enough or so shed told herself as the miles had clicked away on the odometer of her ancient and sickly sedan it was time to take something for herself or at least to try if she had stayed she would have fallen in line again done what she was told again and spent her life haunted by dreams and regrets but now one long week after sneaking out of town in the middle of the night like a thief she wondered if she was destined for the ordinary perhaps shed been born to follow all the rules maybe she should have been content with what life offered and kept her eyes cast down instead of constantly trying to peek around the next corner gerald would have given her a good life a life she knew many women would envy with him she could have had a lovely home tidily kept by a loyal staff closets bursting with conventionally stylish wifeoftheexecutive clothes a summer place in bar harbor winter getaways to tropical climes she would never be hungry never do without all it required was for her to do exactly as she was told exactly when she was told all it required was for her to keep buried every dream every longing every private wish it shouldnt have been hard shed been doing it all of her life but it was closing her eyes she rested her forehead on the steering wheel why did gerald want her so much she wondered there was nothing special about her she had a good mind and an average face her own mother had described her just that way often enough she didnt believe it was so much a physical attraction on geralds side though she suspected he liked the fact she was a small woman of slight build easily dominated god he frightened her she remembered how furious hed been when shed cut off her shoulderlength hair snipping away until it was as short as a boys well she liked it she thought with a little spurt of defiance and it was her hair damn it she added pushing her fingers through choppily cut toffeecolored locks they werent married yet thank the lord he had no right to tell her how to look how to dress how to behave and now if she could just hold on he never would have that right she should never have agreed to marry him in the first place shed just been so tired so afraid so confused even though the regrets and the doubts had set in almost immediately even though shed given him back the ring and apologized she might have gone through with it rather than stand up under his anger and live through the gossip of a broken engagement but shed discovered hed manipulated her that he was responsible for her losing her job for the threat of eviction from her apartment hed wanted her to buckle and shed nearly obliged him she thought now as she wiped sweat from her face with the back of her hand the hell with it she decided and pushed herself out of the car so she had less than ten dollars no transportation and a mile hike ahead of her she was out from under geralds thumb she was finally at twentythree on her own leaving her suitcase in the trunk she grabbed the weighty tote that contained all that really mattered to her then headed off on foot shed burned her bridges now it was time to see what was around that next corner it took her an hour to reach her destination she couldnt have explained why she kept walking along route away from the scatter of motels gas stations and toward that shimmering ozlike skyline of vegas in the distance she only knew she wanted to be there inside that globe of exotic buildings and shapes where lights were twinkling like a carnival the sun was tipping down below the western peaks of the red mountains that ringed that glittering oasis her hunger had gone from grinding distress to a dull ache she considered stopping for food to rest to drink but there was something therapeutic about simply putting one foot in front of the other her eyes on the tall spectacular hotels glimmering in the distance what were they like inside she wondered would everything be glossy and polished colorful to the point of gaudy she imagined an atmosphere of sex and gambling desperation and triumph with an underlying snicker of naughtiness there would be men with hard eyes women with wild laughs shed get a job in one of those opulent dens of indulgence and have a front row seat for every show oh how she wanted to live and see and experience she wanted the crowds and the noise the hot blood and the cold nerves everything everything that was the opposite of what shed had before most of all she wanted to feel strong ripping emotions towering joys vivid excitement and she would write about it all she determined shifting the tote which filled with her notebooks and manuscript pages weighed like stone she would write tucked in some little room looking out at it all stumbling with exhaustion she tripped on a curb then righted herself the streets were crowded everyone seemed to have somewhere to go even at dusk the lights of the city winked and gleamed and beckoned come in take a chance roll the dice she saw families of tourists fathers in shorts with legs pink from the unforgiving sun children with wide eyes mothers with the frantic look of sensory overload her own eyes were wide the golden brown glazed with fatigue the manmade volcano erupted in the distance drawing screams and cheers from the crowd whod gathered to watch and making darcy gape with glassyeyed wonder the noise smothered the odd buzzing in her ears as she was jostled by the crowd dazed and dazzled she wandered aimlessly gawking at the huge roman statues blinking at the neon passing by the spurting fountains that gushed with shifting colors it was a wonderland loud and gaudy and unapologetically adult and she was as lost and as fascinated as alice she found herself standing in front of twin towers as white as the moon and joined together by a wide curved bridge with hundreds of windows surrounding the building were seas of flowers both wild and exotic and pools of mirrorbright water fed by the rush of a terraced waterfall that tumbled from the topmost spear of a mountain guarding the entrance to the bridge was an enormous five times larger than life indian war chief astride a gold stallion his face and bare chest were gleaming copper his war bonnet flowed with winking stones of rich reds and blues and greens in his hand he carried a lance with a diamondbright tip that winked fire hes so beautiful was all she could think so proud and defiant she would have sworn the statues dark eyes were alive fixed on hers daring her to come closer to go inside to take her chances darcy stepped into the comanche on watery legs and swayed against the sudden rush of cool air the lobby was immense the tile floors a bold geometric pattern of emerald and sapphire that made her head spin cacti and palms grew regally out of copper or pottery urns brilliant floral displays graced huge tables the scent of the lilies so sweet it brought tears to her eyes she walked on amazed by the waterfall that rushed down a stone wall into a pond filled with bright fish the sparkling light that shimmered from huge crystalandgold chandeliers the place was a maze of color and flash brighter and more brilliant than any reality shed known or any dream shed imagined there were shops the offerings in the windows as glittery as the chandeliers she watched an elegant blonde debate between two diamond necklaces the way another might consider her choice of tomatoes a laugh bubbled up in darcys throat forcing her to press a hand to her mouth to hold it in it wasnt the time or place to be noticed she warned herself she didnt belong in such glamorous surroundings she turned the corner and felt her head reel at the sudden brassy sound of the casino bells and voices the metallic ratatat of coins falling on coins whirls and buzzes and hoots the wave of energy pouring out brought a rush to her blood machines were everywhere shoulder to shoulder with their faces spinning with colors and shapes people crowded around them standing sitting on stools pulling coins from white plastic buckets and feeding the busy machines she watched a woman press a red button wait for the spin to end then scream with delight as triple black bars lined up in the center money poured out into a silver bowl in a musical rush it made darcy grin here was fun reckless and impulsive here were possibilities both grand and small and life loud messy and hot shed never gambled in her life not with money money was something to be earned saved and carefully watched but her fingers slipped into her pocket where the last of her crumpled bills seemed to pulse with heat against her skin if not now when she asked herself with another bubbling giggle she could no longer quite control what good was it would buy her a meal she told herself gnawing on her lip but then what lightheaded her ears ringing oddly she roamed the aisles blinking owlishly at people and machines they were willing to take a chance she thought thats why they were here wasnt that why she was here then she saw it it stood alone big and bright and fascinating it stood taller than she its wide face made up of stylized stars and moons the handle was nearly as thick as her arm and topped with a shiny red ball it called itself comanche magic jackpot it proclaimed in diamondwhite lights that flashed on and off and made her dizzy ruby red dots flowed along a black strip she stared fascinated at the number showing within the blinking lights what an odd amount nine dollars and thirtyseven cents she thought again fingering the money in her pocket maybe it was a sign how much did it cost she wondered she stepped closer blinked to clear her wavering vision and struggled to read the rules it was a progressive machine so the numbers would change and grow as players pumped in their money she could play for a dollar she read but that wouldnt get the jackpot even if she lined up the stars and moons on all three lines to really play shed have to put in one dollar times three nearly all the money she had left in the world take a chance a voice seemed to whisper slyly in her ear dont be foolish this voice was prim disapproving and all too familiar you cant throw your money away live a little there was excitement in the whisper and seduction what are you waiting for i dont know she muttered and im tired of waiting slowly her eyes on the challenging face of the machine darcy dug into her pocket with his gaze scanning the tables robert macgregor blade scrawled his initials on a chit the man in chair three on the hundreddollar table wasnt taking his losses in stride he noted mac lifted a brow as the man held on fifteen with the dealer showing a king if youre going to play for a hundred a hand he mused as the dealer turned up a seven you ought to know how to play in a casual gesture mac lifted a hand to call over one of the tuxedoed security men keep an eye on him mac murmured hes thinking about making trouble yes sir spotting trouble and dealing with it was second nature for mac he was a thirdgeneration gambler and his instincts were well honed his grandfather daniel macgregor had made a fortune taking chances real estate was daniels first love and he continued to buy and sell property to develop and preserve to wheel and deal though he was into his nineties macs parents had met in a casino aboard ship his mother had been dealing blackjack and his father had always been a player theyd clashed and theyd clicked both initially unaware that daniel had maneuvered their meeting with marriage and the continuation of the macgregor line in mind justin blade had already owned the comanche in vegas and another in atlantic city serena macgregor had become his partner then his wife their eldest son had been born knowing how to roll the dice now just shy of his thirtieth birthday comanche vegas was his baby his parents trusted him enough to leave it in his hands and he made very certain they wouldnt regret it it ran smoothly because he made certain it ran smoothly it ran honest because it always had it ran profitably because it was a blademacgregor enterprise he believed absolutely in winning and always in winning clean his lips twitched as a woman at one of the fivedollar tables hit twentyone and applauded herself some would walk away winners mac mused most wouldnt life was a gamble and the house always had the edge a tall man he moved through the tables easily in a beautifully tailored dark suit that draped elegance over tough and ready muscle the legacy from his comanche heritage showed in the golddust skin pulled tight over his cheekbones in the rich black hair that framed a lean watchful face and flowed to the collar of his formal jacket but his eyes were scot blue deep as a loch and just as unfathomable his smile was quick and charming when a regular hailed him but he kept moving barely pausing he had work waiting in his office high above the action mr blade he glanced over stopping now as one of the roving cocktail waitress moved to him yes i just came over from the slots the waitress shifted her tray and tried not to sigh as mac gave her the full benefit of those dark blue eyes theres a woman over at the big progressive shes a mess mr blade not too clean pretty shaky she might be on something shes just staring at it you know muttering to herself i thought maybe i should call security ill take a look shes well shes kind of pathetic not a working girl the waitress added but shes either sick or stoned thanks ill take care of it mac shifted directions moving into the forest of slots rather than his private elevator security could handle any trouble that threatened the smooth operation of the casino but it was his place and he handled his own a few feet away darcy fed her last three dollars into the slot youre insane she told herself carefully babying the last bill when the machine spit it back at her youve lost your mind her pounding heart seemed to scream even as she smoothed the bill and slid it back in but god it felt so good to do something outrageous she closed her eyes a moment breathing deeply three times then opening them again grabbed the shiny red ball of the arm with a trembling hand and pulled stars and moons revolved in front of her eyes colors blurred a calliope tune began to jingle she found herself smiling at the absurdity of it almost dreaming as the shapes spun and spun and spun that was her life right now she thought absently spinning and spinning where will it stop where will it go her smile only broadened as stars and moons began to click into place they were so pretty it had been worth the price just to watch to know at least shed pulled the handle click click click shining stars glowing moons when they blurred she blinked furiously she wanted to see every movement to hear every sound wasnt it pretty how neatly they all lined up she thought and braced a hand against the machine when she felt herself begin to tip and as she touched it as her hand made contact with the cool metal the movement stopped the world exploded sirens shrieked making her stagger back in shock colored lights went into a mad dance atop the machine and a war drum began to beat whistles shrilled bells clanged all around her people began to shout and shove what had she done oh god what had she done holy cow you hit the big one someone grabbed her danced with her she couldnt breathe flailed weakly to try to escape everyone was pushing pulling at her shouting words she couldnt understand faces swam in front of hers bodies pressed until she was trapped against the machine an ocean was roaring in her head a jackhammer pounded in her chest mac moved through the celebratory crowd nudging wellwishers aside he saw her a slip of a woman who looked barely old enough to be inside the casino her dark blond hair was short and messily cut bangs flopping down into enormous fawn colored eyes her face was angular as a pixies and pale as wax her cotton shirt and slacks looked as though shed slept in them and as if shed spent her sleeping hours curled up in the desert not stoned he decided when he took her arm and felt the tremble terrified darcy cringed shifted her gaze to his she saw the war chief the power and the challenge and the romance of him hed either save her she thought dizzily or finish her i didnt mean i only what did i do mac angled his head smiled a little a dim bulb perhaps he mused but harmless you hit the jackpot he told her oh well then she fainted there was something wonderfully smooth under her cheek silk satin darcy thought dimly shed always loved the feel of silk once shed spent nearly her entire paycheck on a silk blouse creamy white with tiny gold buttons heartshaped buttons shed had to skip lunch for two weeks but it had been worth it every time she slipped that silk over her skin she sighed remembering it come on all the way out what she blinked her eyes open focused on a slant of light from a jeweled lamp here try this mac slipped a hand under her head lifted it and put a glass of water to her lips what youre repeating yourself drink some water okay she sipped obediently studying the tanned longfingered hand that held the glass she was on a bed she realized now a huge bed with a silky cover there was a mirrored ceiling over her head oh my warily she shifted her gaze until she saw his face i thought you were the war chief close he set the glass aside then sat on the edge of the bed noting with amusement that she scooted over slightly to keep more distance between them mac blade i run the place darcy im darcy wallace why am i here it seemed better than leaving you sprawled on the floor of the casino you fainted i did mortified she closed her eyes again yes i guess i did im sorry its not an atypical reaction to winning close to two million dollars her eyes popped open her hand grabbed at her throat im sorry im still a little confused did you say i won almost two million dollars you put the money in you pulled the lever you hit there wasnt an ounce of color in her cheeks he noted and thought she looked like a bruised fairy well deal with the paperwork when youre feeling a little steadier do you want to see a doctor no im just im okay i cant think my heads spinning take your time instinctively he plumped up the pillows behind her and eased her back is there someone i can call to help you out no dont call anyone his brow lifted at her quick and violent refusal but he only nodded all right there isnt anyone she said more calmly im traveling i my purse was stolen yesterday in utah my car broke down a mile or so out of town i think its the fuel pump this time could be he murmured tongue in cheek how did you get here i walked in i just got here or she thought she had it was hard to remember how long shed walked around goggling at everything i had nine dollars and thirtyseven cents i see he wasnt sure if she was a lunatic or a firstclass gambler well now you have approximately one million eight hundred thousand eightynine dollars and thirtyseven cents ohoh shattered she put her hands over her face and burst into tears there were too many women in his life for mac to be uncomfortable with female tears he sat where he was let her sob it out an odd little package he thought when shed slid unconscious into his arms shed been limp as water and had weighed no more than a child now shed told him shed hiked over a mile in the stunning late spring heat then risked what little money shed had on a yank of a slot that required either steel or insanity whichever it was shed beaten the odds and now she was rich and for a while at least his responsibility im sorry she wiped at her somehow charmingly dirty face with her hands im not like this really i cant take it in she accepted the handkerchief he offered and blew her nose i dont know what to do lets start with the basics whens the last time you ate last night well i bought a candy bar this morning but it melted before i could finish it so it doesnt really count ill order you some food he rose looking down at her ill have them set it up down in the parlor why dont you take a hot bath try to relax get your bearings she gnawed her lip i dont have any clothes i left my suitcase in my car oh my bag i had my bag i have it because shed gone pale again he reached down beside the bed and lifted the plain brown tote this one yes yes thank you relief had her closing her eyes and struggling to calm herself again i thought id lost it its not clothes she added letting out a long sigh its my work its safe and theres a robe in the closet she cleared her throat however kind he was being she was still alone with him a perfect stranger in a very opulent and sensual bedroom i appreciate it but i should get a room if i could have a small advance on the money i can find a hotel something wrong with this one this what this hotel he said with what he considered admirable patience this room no nothing its beautiful then make yourself comfortable your rooms comped for the duration of your stay what excuse me she sat up a little straighten i can have this room i can just stay here its the usual procedure for high rollers he smiled again making her heart bump you qualify i do the management hopes youll put some of those winnings back into the pot at the tables the shops your room and meals your bar bills are on us she eased off the bed i get all this for free because i won money from you this time his grin was quick and just a little wolfish i want the chance to win some of it back lord he was beautiful like the hero in a novel that thought rolled around in her jumbled brain that seems only fair thank you so much mr mcblade not mcblade he corrected taking the hand she offered mac mac blade oh im afraid i havent been very coherent youll feel better after youve eaten gotten some rest im sure youre right why dont we talk in the morning say ten oclock my office yes in the morning welcome to las vegas ms wallace he said and turned toward a sweep of open stairs that led to the living area thank you she ordered her shaky legs to carry her to the rail then lost her breath when she looked down at the sprawling space done in sapphires and emeralds accented with ebony wood and lush arrangements of tropical flowers she watched him cross an ocean of oriental carpet mr blade yes he turned glanced up and thought she looked about twelve years old and as lost as a lamb what will i do with all that money he flashed that grin again youll think of something id make book on it then pressing a button he stepped through the brass doors that slid open into what surely was a private elevator when the doors closed again darcy gave in to her buckling knees and sat on the floor she hugged herself hard rocked if this was some dream some hallucination brought on by stress or sunstroke she hoped it never cleared away she hadnt just escaped she realized shed been liberated chapter two contents prev next the bubble didnt burst in the morning she shot awake at six oclock and stared startled at her reflection in the mirror overhead testing she lifted a hand watched herself touch her cheek she felt her fingers saw them slide up over her forehead and down the other side of her face however odd it had to be real shed never seen herself horizontal before she looked so different she decided sprawled in the huge rumpled bed surrounded by a mountain of pillows she felt so different how many years had she awakened each morning in the practical twin bed that had been her nesting place since childhood she never had to go back to that somehow that single thought the simple fact that she would never again have to adjust her body to the stingy mattress of the ancient bed sent a rush of joy through her so wild so bright she burst into giddy laughter unable to stop until she was gasping for air she rolled from one end of the bed to the other kicked her feet in the air hugged pillows and when that wasnt enough leaped up to dance on the mattress when she was thoroughly winded she dropped down again and wrapped her arms tight around her knees she was wearing a silk sleep shirt in candy pink one of several articles of basic wardrobe that had arrived just after her dinner everything had been from the boutique downstairs and had been presented to her courtesy of the comanche she wasnt even going to worry about the fact that the gorgeous mac blade had bought her underwear not when it was such fabulous underwear she jumped up wanting to explore the suite again the night before shed been so punchy shed just wandered around gawking now it was time to play she snatched up a remote and began punching buttons the shimmering blue drapes over the floortoceiling windows opened and closed making her grin like a fool opening them again she saw she had a wide window on the world that was vegas it was all muted grays and blues now she noted with a soft desert dawn breaking she wondered how many floors up she was twenty thirty it hardly mattered she was on top of a brave and very new world choosing another button she opened a wall panel that revealed a bigscreen television screen a vcr and a complicatedlooking stereo system she fiddled until she filled the room with music then raced downstairs she opened all the drapes smelled the flowers sat on every cushion of the two sofas and six chairs she marveled at the arched fireplace at the grand piano of showy white and because there was no one to tell her not to touch she sat down and played the first thing that came into her mind the celebratory arrogant notes of everythings coming up roses made her laugh like a loon behind a glossy black wet bar she found a small refrigerator then giggled like a girl when she saw it contained two bottles of champagne with the music blaring she waltzed into the bath off the living area and grinned at the bidet the phone the wallmounted tv and all the pretty toiletries arranged in a china basket humming to herself she climbed the curving chrome steps back to the bedroom the master bath was a symphony of pure sensory indulgence from the lakesized motorized tub in sensuous black to the acre of counter under a wallsized lighted mirror the room was bigger than her entire apartment back home tuck in a bed she thought and she could live happily right here lush green plants lined the tiled shelf beside the tub a separate rippled glass shower stall offered crisscrossing sprays lovely clear jars were arranged on glass shelves and held bath salts oils creams with scents so lush she moaned in pleasure at every sniff the adjoining dressing room boasted a walkin closet that contained a robe and a pair of brushed cotton slippers with the comanche logo a tripleglass fulllength mirror two elegant chairs and a table where fragrant flowers spilled out of a crystal vase it was the kind of indulgence shed only read about or seen in movies plush sleek shimmering with wealth now that her initial rush of adrenaline was leveling she began to wonder if there hadnt been some mistake how could this have happened the time and circumstances after shed begun her long hike into town were all blurry around the edges in her mind now snatches of it came clear the whirling lights on the machine her own thumping heart mac blades impossibly handsome face dont question it she whispered dont ruin it even if it all goes away in an hour you have it now biting her lip she picked up the phone and punched in the button for room service room service good morning ms wallace oh she blinked looking guiltily over her shoulder as if someone had sneaked up behind her i was wondering if i could order some coffee of course and breakfast well she didnt want to take advantage perhaps a muffin will that be all yes that would be fine well have that up to you within fifteen minutes thank you ms wallace youre welcome um thank you after she hung up darcy hurried into the bedroom to turn off the stereo switch the tv on and check the news to see if there were any reports of mass hallucinations in his office above the carnival world of the casino mac flicked his gaze over the security screens where people played the slots bet on red or waited for their dealer to bust there were more than a few diehards whod started the night before and were still going at it slinky evening dresses sat hip to hip with jeans ten oclock at night ten in the morning it made no difference there was no real time in vegas no dress code and for some no reality beyond the next spin of the wheel mac ignored the whine of an incoming fax sipped his coffee and paced the room as he spoke to his father on the phone he imagined his father was doing virtually the same thing in the office in reno im going to talk to her in a few minutes mac continued i wanted to let her smooth out a little tell me about her justin requested knowing his sons instincts for people would give him a clear picture i dont know a lot yet shes young he kept moving as he talked watching the screens checking on the placement of his security people the attitude of the dealers skittish he added looked like a woman on the move to me trouble somewhere shes out of her element here he cast his mind back bringing the image of darcy into focus letting himself hear her voice again smalltown midwest id say makes me think of a kindergarten teacher the kind the kids would love and take merciless advantage of she was broke and running on fumes when she hit sounds like it was her lucky day if someones going to hit it might as well be a broke smalltown kindergarten teacher mac grinned she apologizes all over herself nervous as a mouse at a feline convention shes cute he said finally thinking of those big dark gold eyes and id have to guess naive the wolves are going to tear off pieces of her in short order if she doesnt have some protection there was a short pause you planning on standing between her and the wolves mac just steering her in the right direction mac muttered rolling his shoulders his reputation in the family for siding with the underdog was inescapable the press is already hammering at the door the kid needs a lawyer and some straight talk because the vultures circle right after the wolves he imagined the barrage of requests and demands that would come begging for contributions offering investments a smattering of them would be genuine and the rest would be playing one of the oldest games get the money and run keep me up to date i will hows mom shes good hosting some big charity fashion show here today and shes making noises about dropping in on you before we head back east a quick visit justin added she misses the baby uhhuh mac had to grin he knew very well his father would crawl over broken glass for a chance to visit his grandchild in boston so how is little anna great just great shes teething gwen and bran arent getting a lot of sleep right now the price you pay for parenthood i had plenty of allnighters with you pal like i said macs grin widened you pay your money you make your choice he glanced up at the quiet knock on his door that must be the nervous fairy now who our newest millionaire come in he called out then curled a finger when darcy hesitated on the threshold ill keep you posted tell mom i said hi ive got a feeling you can tell her facetoface in a few days good talk to you later the minute he hung up darcy launched into an apology im sorry i didnt realize you were on the phone your assistant secretary whatever came to bring me up and she said i should just come in but i can come back if youre busy i can come back patient mac waited until shed run down it gave him the opportunity to see what a meal and a good nights sleep had done for her she looked a little less fragile incredibly tidy he decided in the simple blouse and slacks hed had the boutique send to her suite and no less nervous than the evening before why dont you sit down all right she linked her fingers together twisted them then stepped to a highbacked deepcushioned chair in hunter green leather i was wondering thinking has there been a mistake the chair dwarfed her and made him think of fairies again perched on colorful toadstools hmm about what about me the money i realized this morning when i could think a bit more clearly that things like this just dont happen they do here hoping to put her at ease he leaned a hip on the corner of his desk you are twentyone arent you twentythree ill be twentyfour in september oh i forgot to thank you for the clothes she ordered herself not to think about the underwear not to so much as consider that he was thinking of it but color rose into her cheeks it was very kind of you everything fit all right yes her color deepened the bra was a lovely champagne color with edgings of lace and was precisely her size she didnt want to speculate how he could have been quite so accurate perfectly howd you sleep like someone put me under a spell she smiled a little now i suppose i havent been sleeping well lately im not used to traveling there was a dusting of freckles over her pert little nose he noted a paler gold than her extraordinary eyes she smelled lightly of vanilla where are you from a little town traders corners in kansas midwest mac thought hit number one what do you do in traders corners kansas im i was a librarian close enough for hit number two he decided really whyd you leave i ran away she blurted it out before thinking he had such a beautiful smile and hed been looking at her as if he were really interested somehow he had lulled her into the admission he pushed away from the desk then sat on the arm of the chair beside hers so that their faces were closer their eyes more level he spoke gently as he might to a cornered puppy what kind of trouble are you in darcy im not i would have been if id stayed but then her eyes widened oh i didnt do anything i mean im not running away from the police because she was so obviously distressed he smothered the laugh and didnt tell her he couldnt imagine her getting so much as a parking ticket i didnt think that but people generally have a reason for running away from home does your family know where you are i dont have any family i lost my parents about a year ago im sorry it was an accident a house fire at night she lifted her hands dropped them into her lap again they didnt wake up thats a lot to deal with there was nothing anyone could do they were gone the house was gone everything i wasnt home id just moved into my own apartment a few weeks before just a few weeks i she pushed absently at her fringe of bangs well so you decided to get away she started to agree to make it simple but it wasnt the truth and she was such a poor and guilty liar no not exactly i suppose thats part of it i lost my job a few weeks ago it still stung the humiliation of it i was going to lose my apartment money was a problem my parents didnt have much insurance and the house had a mortgage and the bills she moved her shoulders in any case without a paycheck i wasnt going to be able to pay the rent i didnt have that much saved myself after college and sometimes i im not very good with budgets i suppose moneys not going to be a problem now he reminded her wanting to make her smile again i dont see how you can just give me almost two million dollars you won almost two million dollars look he took her hand nudging her around until she could see the screens people step up to the tables every hour every day some win some lose some of them play for entertainment for fun others play hoping to make the big score just once some play the odds some play a hunch she watched fascinated everything moved in silence cards were dealt chips were stacked raked in or slipped away what do you do oh i play the odds and the occasional hunch it looks like theater she murmured thats what it is with no intermission do you have a lawyer a lawyer the amused interest that had come into her eyes vanished do i need a lawyer id recommend it youre about to come into a large amount of money the governments going to want their share and after that youre going to discover you have friends youve never heard of and people who want to offer you a terrific opportunity to invest the minute your story hits the press theyll crawl out of the woodwork press newspapers television no i cant have that i cant have that she repeated springing up im not going to talk to reporters he bit back a sigh yes indeed he thought this one would need a hand to hold on the walk through the forest young orphaned financially strapped librarian from kansas walks into comanche vegas and drops her last dollar it wasnt my last she insisted close enough her last dollar in the slot and wins a millioneight darling the press is going to do handsprings with a lead like that he was right of course she could see it herself it was a wonderful story just the kind she wanted to write herself i dont want it to get out they have televisions and newspapers in traders corners hometown girl makes good he agreed watching her suddenly he realized something else was putting panic into her eyes theyll probably name a street after you he said casually i dont want this to get back there i didnt tell you everything because she had no choice but to hope he could help she sat again i didnt tell you the main reason i left the way i did theres a man gerald peterson his familys very prominent in kansas they own quite a bit of land and many businesses gerald for some reason he wanted me to marry him he insisted women are still free to say no thank you in kansas arent they yes of course it seemed so simple when he said it she mused he would think she was an idiot but geralds very determined he always finds a way to get what he wants and he wants you mac prompted well yes at least he seems to think he does my parents were very pleased that he was interested in me i mean who would think id catch the eye of a man like him are you joking she blinked what never mind he waved it away so gerald wanted to marry you and i take it you didnt want to marry him what then a few months ago i said i would it seemed like the only reasonable thing to do and he just assumed i would anyway ashamed she stared down at her linked fingers gerald assumes very firmly he doesnt hear the word no its like a genetic thing she sighed agreeing to marry him was weak and stupid and i regretted it immediately i knew i couldnt go through with it but he wouldnt listen when i tried to tell him there was the whole ring thing too she added with a frown fascinated and entertained mac cocked his head ring thing well it was silly really i didnt want a diamond engagement ring i wanted something different just different but he didnt hear that either i got a twocarat diamond which was properly appraised and insured he explained all about the investment value she shut her eyes i didnt want to hear about the investment value no mac murmured i dont imagine you did i wasnt expecting romance well no yes i was but i knew it wasnt going to happen i thought i could settle she looked past him past the screens i should have been able to settle why because everyone said how lucky i was but i didnt feel lucky i felt smothered trapped he was very angry when i gave him back the ring he barely said a word but he was furious then he wasnt he was very calm and told me he had no doubt id come to my senses shortly once i did wed forget it had ever happened two weeks later i lost my job she made herself look back at mac he was listening she realized with some surprise really listening hardly anyone really listened they talked about budget cutbacks my performance evaluation she continued i was so shocked that it took me a little while to realize hed arranged it the petersons endow the library and they own my apartment building he had to have known id come crawling back sounds to me like you gave him a good kick in the ass not as much as he deserved but a solid shot hell be humiliated and very very angry i dont want him to know where i am im afraid of him something new and icy flickered into macs eyes did he hurt you no gerald doesnt have to use physical force when intimidation works so well i just want to disappear for a while he only wants me now because he cant tolerate being refused he doesnt love me i simply suit his needs in a wife neat quiet well educated and behaved youd feel better if you stood up to him yes she lowered her gaze but im afraid i wont mac considered a moment well do what we can to keep your name out of it the press should run with the mystery woman angle happily enough for a while but it wont last darcy the longer the better okay lets deal with the basics i cant distribute the money yet you dont have any identification for one thing and that makes it sticky youll need to get some your birth certificate drivers license that sort of thing so were back to a lawyer i dont know any just the firm back home who handled things for my parents and i wouldnt want to use them no they wouldnt do not for a woman who wants to start a new life from scratch her smile bloomed slowly drawing his attention to the shape of her mouth the full bottom lip the deep dip centered in the top one i guess thats what im doing i want to write books she confessed really what sort love stories adventures she laughed and leaned back in the cushions of the chair wonderful stories about people who do amazing things for love i suppose that sounds crazy it sounds rational to me you were a librarian so you must love books why not write them she goggled first then her eyes went bright and beautiful youre the first person ive ever told whos said that gerald was appalled at the very notion that id consider writing at all much less romance novels geralds an idiot mac said dismissively weve already established that i guess youd better buy yourself a laptop and get to work staring again she pressed a hand to her throat i could couldnt i when her eyes began to fill she shook her head quickly no im not going to start that again its just that a life can change so completely and so quickly the best and the worst in a blink youre handling this very well youll handle the rest he rose and missed the startled look she shot him no one had ever expressed such casual confidence in her before im not sure its ethical but i can contact my uncle hes a lawyer you can trust him id appreciate it mr blade im so grateful for mac he interrupted whenever i give a woman almost two million dollars i insist on a firstname basis her laugh burst out then was quickly muffled by her hand sorry its just strange hearing that out loud two million dollars a fairly amusing number he said dryly and her laughter stopped instantly i never thought i mean about your part what it means to you this place you dont have to pay me all at once she said in a rush it can be in installments or something on impulse he reached down cupped her chin in his hand and studied her face youre incredibly sweet arent you darcy from kansas her mind washed clean his voice was so warm his eyes so blue his hand so firm her heart did one long slow twist in her chest and seemed to sigh what did you say im sorry he skimmed his thumb over her jawline fairy bones he thought absently and catching himself wondering about her he dropped his hand dont go there mac he warned himself and stepped back the comanche never makes a bet it cant afford to lose and my grandfather doesnt really need that operation oh god im joking more delighted with her than ever he roared with laughter youre easy much too easy theyll eat her alive he thought do yourself a favor keep a low profile until my uncle starts the ball rolling ill advance you some cash he moved behind the desk and unlocked a drawer where he kept the petty cash a couple thousand should hold you weve arranged for credit at the shops here for you i imagine youll want to make arrangements to have your car towed in expertly he counted out hundreds then fifties im having a little trouble breathing darcy said weakly excuse me mac glanced up watched in some alarm as she lowered her head between her knees ill be all right in a minute she told him when she felt his hand on the back of her head im sorry im being an awful lot of trouble no but id definitely prefer it if you didnt faint again i wont i was just a little lightheaded for a second when the phone rang she jolted then sat straight up im taking too much of your time sit he pointed then snatched up the phone deb tell whoever it is ill get back to them he hung up again narrowed his eyes and felt a genuine wave of relief that her color was back better much im sorry stop apologizing its a very annoying habit im she pressed her lips together cleared her throat good he picked up the stack of bills and handed it to her go shopping he suggested go play get a massage or a facial sit by the pool enjoy yourself have dinner with me tonight he hadnt meant to say that hadnt a clue where it had come from oh he was frowning at her now which was only more confusing yes id like that feeling awkward she rose and pushed the bills into her pocket she hadnt brought the lovely little shoulder bag the boutique had sent her because shed had nothing to put in it i dont know what to do first it doesnt matter just do it all thats a wonderful way of thinking unable to help herself she beamed at him just do it all ill try that ill let you get back to work she started for the door but he went to it with her and opened it she looked up again groping for the right words you saved my life i know that sounds dramatic but its the way i feel you saved it yourself now take care of it im going to she offered her hand and because it was irresistible he lifted it to his lips see you later yes later she turned and walked away without her feet touching the ground mac shut the door then dipping his hands into his pockets stood staring at it darcy the kansas librarian he mused not his type as far from his type as they came the little pull he felt he assured himself was just concerned interest almost brotherly almost it was the eyes that were doing it he supposed how was a man supposed to resist those big wounded fawn eyes then there was the shy little hesitation in her voice followed by those quick bursts of enthusiasm and the genuine sweetness of her nothing saccharine or cloying just innocence he supposed which circled right back to the point not his type women were safer when they knew how to play the game darcy wallace didnt have a clue well he couldnt very well hand her the money then toss her into the fray without a shield could he just steer her in the right direction he promised himself then wave goodbye with this in mind he went back to his desk and picked up the phone deb get me caine macgregors office in boston chapter three contents prev next it was a different world perhaps even a different planet and she darcy thought as she stepped cautiously into the sparkling boutique was now a different woman the darcy wallace who so often had her nose pressed against the window of such pretty places was now inside and she could have whatever she wanted that gorgeous beaded jacket there she thought not daring to touch it or that fluid column of ivory silk she could have them both of them all of them because the world had turned upside down and somehow had shaken her out and dumped her right on top she stepped in a little farther peeked into a long glass display cabinet beautiful sparkly things foolishly wonderful decoration for ears and wrists and fingers shed always wanted to wear something that sparkled odd shed never felt that special thrill shed expected when shed worn geralds ring on her finger his ring she realized now of course that was it it hadnt really been hers at all may i help you startled she looked up and nearly backed guiltily away from the display i dont know the woman behind the counter smiled indulgently are you looking for anything special everything seems special the indulgent smile warmed im glad you think so were very proud of our selection id be happy to help you if i can or you can feel free to browse actually i have a dinner tonight and nothing to wear thats always the way isnt it literally nothing when the clerk didnt appear especially shocked by this confession darcy drummed up the courage to go on i suppose i need a dress formal or casual i have no idea realizing the quandary darcy scanned the gowns and cocktail suits on display he didnt say dinner for two yes oh she turned back its not a date exactly willing to play the clerk angled her head business in a way i suppose she pushed at the hair that was tickling her ear yes that must be it is he attractive darcy rolled her eyes that doesnt begin to describe him interested youd have to be dead ten years not to be but its not that sort of thing maybe it could be lets see lips pursed the clerk studied darcy through narrowed eyes feminine but not fussy sexy but not obvious i think i have a few things you might like the clerks name was myra proctor shed worked at the dusk to dawn boutique for five years since she and her husband had moved to vegas from los angeles he was in banking and she had worked in retail most of her adult life she had two children a boy and a girl the girl had just turned thirteen and would surely make her mothers hair gray though at the moment myras hair was a sleek auburn darcy learned all this because she asked and asking helped put her at ease while myra approved or rejected outfits one cocktail dress beaded jacket evening purse and sparkly earrings later myra gave her a gentle nudge toward the salon you ask for charles myra advised tell him i sent you hes an absolute genius what charles demanded when darcy sat in the cushioned silver salon chair happened to your hair an industrial accident a nearterminal illness perhaps mice wincing darcy cowered under the stark white cape that had been draped around her im afraid i cut it myself would you remove your own appendix she could only hunch her shoulders as he glowered down at her with searing green eyes under dark beetled brows no no i wouldnt your hair is a part of your body and requires a professional i know youre right absolutely the back of her throat began to tickle and she swallowed gamely it wasnt the time to laugh however nervously she reminded herself instead she tried an apologetic smile it was an impulse a rebellion actually against what his fingers dove into her hair and began to knead and tug being wellgroomed no well there was this man and he kept telling me how i should wear it and how it should be and it made me mad so i whacked it off was this man your hairdresser oh no hes a businessman ha then he has no business telling you how you should wear your hair cutting it off was brave foolish but brave the next time you want to rebel go to a professional i will she took a deep breath can you do anything with it my dear child ive worked miracles with much worse he snapped his fingers shampoo he ordered shed never felt more pampered in her life it was so beautifully indulgent to lie back to have her hair washed her scalp massaged to listen to the birdlike murmurs of the shampoo girl even when she was back in charless chair she felt none of the stomachquivering anxiety that often rode hand in glove with a haircut you need a manicure charles ordered snipping away sheila squeeze in a manicure and pedicure for what was your name dear darcy a pedicure the thought of having her toes painted was so exotic hmm and youll stop biting your nails immediately chastised darcy tucked her hands under the cape its a terrible habit very unattractive youre fortunate though you have thick healthy hair a nice color well leave that alone he brought a section of hair up between two fingers snipped what do you use on your face i have some moisturizer but i lost it selfconsciously she rubbed at her nose the freckles are charming youll leave them alone too but id rather are you picking up the scalpel he asked arching one of his thick black brows then nodding satisfied when she shook her head im going to do your face myself if you dont like the look you dont pay if you do like it you not only pay you buy the products another gamble darcy thought maybe she was on a roll deal thats the spirit now he angled her head snipped again tell me about your love life i dont have one you will he wiggled those eyebrows my work never fails by three darcy walked back into her suite she was loaded down with purchases and still floating on impulse she dumped everything on the sofa and dashed to the mirror myra had been right charles was a genius her hair looked pert she decided with a chuckle almost sophisticated though it was even shorter than she had dared cut it it was sleek and just a little sassy her bangs didnt flop now but spiked down over her forehead and her face wasnt it amazing what could be done with those tubes and brushes and powders they couldnt make her a raving beauty but she thought she hoped shed stepped up to the threshold of pretty im almost pretty she said to her reflection and smiled i really am oh the earrings she whirled and dashed toward the bags thinking the glitter against her face might just take her that final step then she saw the red message light blinking on her phone no one knew where she was how could anyone call her when no one knew the press had the news gotten out already no no she thought clutching her hands together mac had promised not to give out her name hed promised still her pulse hammered in her throat as she picked up the phone and pushed the message button she was informed she had two new voice mail messages the first was from macs assistant and had her releasing the breath shed been holding mr blade would pick her up for dinner at seventhirty if that wasnt suitable she had only to call back and reschedule seventhirty is fine she whispered seventhirty is wonderful the last message was from caine macgregor who identified himself as macs uncle and invited her to call him back at her convenience she hesitated over that she found she didnt want to face the practical business of it all somehow it seemed much more romantic when it all remained dreamlike and impossible but shed been raised to return phone calls promptly so she pulled out the chair at the desk sat and dutifully made the longdistance call to boston when darcy opened her door and found mac holding a single white rose she considered it another miracle he was something out of one of the stories shed secretly scribbled in notebooks for years tall dark elegantly masculine heartstoppingly handsome with just an edge of danger to keep it all from being too smooth the miracle was that he was there holding out a longstemmed rosebud the color of a summer cloud and smiling at her but what popped out of her mouth was the single thought that had revolved in her muddled brain since her call to boston caine macgregor is your uncle yes he is he was attorney general of the united states yes gently mac lifted darcys hand and placed the rose stem in it he was alan macgregor was president you know i heard that somewhere are you going to let me in oh yes but your uncle he was president she said again slowly as if shed been misunderstood for eight years you pass the history quiz mac closed the door behind him and took a good long study of her a warm hum of approval moved through his blood you look fabulous i really distracted not only by the compliment but the delivery she glanced down i would never have chosen this she began running a hand over the copperhued skirt of a dress that was shorter snugger and certainly more daring than anything in her previous wardrobe myra at the boutique the evening wear boutique downstairs picked it out she said i belonged in jewel colors myra has an excellent eye and likely deserved a raise he thought making a circling motion with his finger turn around turn her laugh was both pleased and selfconscious as she executed a slow twirl a big raise mac decided as the flippy little skirt danced around surprisingly delightful legs theyre not there what her hand fluttered to the dipping bodice checking what isnt there wings i expected to see little fairy wings flustered she laughed again the way this day has gone i wouldnt be surprised to see them myself why dont we have a drink before we go to dinner and you can tell me how the days gone he walked to the bar to take a bottle of champagne out of the minifridge she loved to watch him move it was the animal grace shed only read about sleek and confident and again slightly dangerous but to see it she let out a little sigh it was so much better than just imagining charles cut my hair she began thrilling to the celebratory sound of the cork popping charles in your salon ah that charles mac selected two flutes from the glass shelves and poured the customers tremble but always go back to charles i thought he was going to boot me out when he saw what id done she gave her short locks a tug but he took pity on me charles has definite opinions mac skimmed his gaze over her hair then down until his eyes met hers id say in your case he saw the wings im only to pick up scissors to cut paper from now on her eyes danced as she accepted the glass mac offered or pay the consequences and if i bite my nails ill be punished i was afraid to ask him how oh this is wonderful she murmured after a sip closing her eyes she sipped again why would anyone drink anything else the pure sensual pleasure on her face had the hum in his blood quickening a babe in the woods he reminded himself it seemed wiser all around to keep the bar between them what else did you do oh the salon took forever charles kept finding other things he said were absolutely essential i had a pedicure humor danced into her eyes again i had no idea how wonderful it is to have your feet rubbed sheila put paraffin on my feet can you imagine my hands too feel he took the hand she held out in all innocence it was small and narrow the skin as smooth as a childs he had to check the urge to nibble very nice isnt it delighted with herself darcy smiled and stroked a finger over the back of her hand charles said i have to have a full body loofah and some sort of mud bath andi cant even remember he wrote it all down and sent me to alice at the spa she makes the appointments i have to be there at ten after i work out in the health club because he believes ive been neglecting my inner body too charles is very strict may i have some more sure a little war between amusement and baffled desire waged inside him as he poured more champagne this is a wonderful place it has everything wonderful surprises around every comer its like living in a castle her eyes closed with pleasure as she drank i always wanted to id be the princess under a spell and the prince would scale the walls tame the dragon i always hated when they killed the dragon theyre so magical and magnificent anyway once the prince came the spell would be broken and everything in the castle would come to life the colors and the sounds thered be music and dancing and everyone would be so happy ever after she stopped laughed at herself the champagnes going to my head this isnt at all what i wanted to talk to you about your uncle well talk about it over dinner he slipped the flute from her hand and set it aside he spotted the glittery little evening bag on a table and handed it to her she slanted him a look as he led her to the elevator can i have more champagne at dinner now he had to laugh darling you can have whatever you want imagine that with a blissful sigh she leaned against the smoked glass wall he pushed the button for the circular restaurant on the top floor shed bought perfume he thought something woodsy and perfect for her he decided the best place for his hands was in his pockets did you try out the casino no there was so much else to do i looked around a little but i didnt know where to begin i think you began pretty well already she beamed up at him as the doors opened i did didnt i he led her through a small palmdecked foyer and into a candlelit dining room ringed by windows where silver gleamed against white linen good evening mr blade madam the maitre d made a slight bow and with his shoeblack hair and round body reminded darcy of tweedledee of alice fame another rabbit hole she thought as they were led to a curved banquette by the window she never wanted to find her way out the lady enjoys champagne steven of course right away it must be so exciting living here its like a world to itself you like it dont you very much i was born with a pair of dice in one hand and a deck of cards in the other my mother and father met over a blackjack table she was working as a dealer on a cruise ship and he wanted her the minute he saw her a shipboard romance it made her sigh she was beautiful yes she is beautiful and he would have been dark and handsome and maybe a little dangerous more than a little my mother likes to gamble and they both won her lips tipped up deepening the dip in the center you have a big family unwieldy only children are always jealous of big unwieldy families youre never lonely i bet no she had been he thought there was no doubt of it loneliness isnt an option he nodded approval to the label as the sommelier offered the bottle of champagne thrilled by the ritual darcy studied every step the elegant spin of the white cloth the subtle movement of the sommeliers hands the muffled pop of cork at macs signal a small amount was poured into darcys glass for tasting its wonderful like drinking gold that earned her a pleased smile from the sommelier who finished pouring with a flourish before nestling the bottle in a silver bucket of ice now mac tapped his glass lightly against hers you talked with my uncle yes i didnt realize not until id made the call then i did caine macgregor boston i know i started to stutter she winced he was very patient with me a laugh bubbled up and was partially swallowed the former attorney general of the united states is my lawyer its so odd he said he would take care of things my birth certificate the red tape he didnt seem to think it would take very long macgregors have a way of moving things along ive read so much about your family darcy accepted the leatherbound menu absently your grandfathers a legend he loves hearing that what he is is a character youd like him really what kind of a character how did one describe daniel macgregor mac wondered an outrageous one big loud bold a scotsman who built an empire on grit and sweat and shrewdness he sneaks cigars or my grandmother lets him believe hes sneaking them hell skin you at poker nobody bluffs better he has an amazing heart strong and soft for him family comes first and last and always you love him very much because he thought shed enjoy it he told her of how a young brash daniel had come to boston looking for a wife had set his eyes on anna whitfield and tumbling into love had wooed and won her she must have been terribly brave becoming a doctor there were so many obstacles for a woman shes amazing and you have brothers sisters one brother two sisters assorted cousins nephews nieces when we get together its an asylum he decided making her laugh and you wouldnt change it for the world no i wouldnt she opened her menu i always wondered what it would be like to oh my look at all this how does anyone decide what to order what do you like she looked up gold eyes sparkling everything she sampled all she could manage tureen of duck wild greens little salmon puffs topped with caviar unable to resist mac scooped up some of his own stuffed lobster and held the fork to her lips her eyes closed a quiet moan rippled in her throat her lips rubbed gently together and his blood flashed hot hed never known a woman so open to sensual pleasure or so obviously new to it shed be a treasure in bed absorbing lingering over every touch every taste every movement he could imagine it clearly much too clearly the little sighs and murmurs the awakenings she gave one of those little sighs now as her long lids opened slowly over dreamy eyes its wonderful everythings wonderful it was all flowing through her mind and body soft lights strong flavors the froth of wine and the look of him she found herself leaning forward youre so attractive you have such a strong face i love looking at it from another woman it would have been an invitation from her mac reminded himself it was a combination of wine and naiveté where do you come from kansas she smiled thats not what you meant is it i have no finesse she confessed and when i relax i tend to say things that pop into my head im usually nervous around men i never know what to say he arched a brow obviously i dont make you nervous thats my ego you hear thudding at your feet she chuckled shaking her head women are always going to fantasize about men like you but you dont make me nervous because i know you dont think of me that way dont i men dont she gestured with her glass before sipping men arent quickly attracted to women who arent particularly physically appealing willowy blondes she continued eyeing his plate and wondering how to ask for another bite sultry brunettes glamorous redheads attention focuses on them its only natural and strongly attractive men are drawn to strongly attractive women at least initially youve given this a lot of thought i like to watch people and how they circle toward each other maybe you havent looked closely enough i find you very appealing physically he watched her blink in surprise as he slid a little closer fresh he murmured giving in to the urge to cup a hand at the back of her slender neck and lovely he saw her gaze flit down to his mouth and return startled to his eyes he heard the little rush of breath shudder through her lips it was tempting very tempting to close the slight distance to complete the circle shed spoken of but she trembled under his hand a trapped bird not entirely sure of her wings there he said quietly that shut you up nervous now she could only move her head in short rapid nods she could all but feel his mouth on hers it would be firm and hot and so clever the fingers at the back of her neck had stroked some wild nerve to life she could feel it careen through her bumping her pulse to light speed the dawning awareness in her eyes the flicker of panic behind it had his fingers tightening briefly on her nape you shouldnt dare a gambler darcy he gave her neck what he hoped was a friendly squeeze before easing back dessert dessert would you like some i dont think i could not with her stomach muscles in knots and her fingers too unsteady to hold a fork he smiled slowly want to try your luck when she swallowed he added at the tables oh yes i think i would what should i play she asked him when they walked into the noise and lights of the casino ladys choice well she bit her lip tried to keep her mind off the fact that he had his hand at the small of her back it did no good to tell herself she had no business thinking of him that way maybe blackjack its just adding up numbers really he ran his tongue around his teeth thats part of it fivedollar table he decided until you get your rhythm he led her toward a vacant chair in front of a dealer he knew to be both patient and personable with novices how much do you want to start with twenty twenty thousands a little steep for a beginner her mouth dropped open then curved on a laugh i meant dollars twenty dollars dollars mac said weakly fine if you think you can stand the excitement when he reached for his wallet she shook her head no i have it she pulled a twenty out of her bag it feels more like mine this way it is yours he reminded her and at twenty not a hell of a lots going to be mine again i might win she slid onto a stool beside a portly man in a checked jacket are you winning she asked him he tipped a beer to his lips and winked at her im up about fifty but this guy he gestured toward the dealer hes tough you keep coming back to my table mr renoke the dealer said cheerfully must be my good looks renoke snorted then tapped his cards give me a little one pal the dealer turned up a four your wish my command there you go renoke waved a finger over the cards to indicate hed hold with nineteen when the dealer held on eighteen renoke patted darcys shoulder looks like you brought me some fresh luck i hope so id like to play she added changing twenty the dealer announced and shoved the bill into a slot with a clear plastic box darcy neatly stacked her four fivedollar chips bets put a chip on the outline there mac instructed the cards moved quickly slipping out of the shoe and snapping lightly on felt she was dealt a six and an eight with the dealer showing ten what do i do now take a hit she tilted her head looked up at mac but im beating him and a ten would put me over wouldnt it odds are his down card is over two play the odds oh ill take a hit she pulled a ten then frowned i lost but you lost correctly the dealer told her with a grin she lost correctly twice more and with brows knit in concentration slid her last chip into place and hit blackjack i didnt even have to do anything she wiggled more comfortably on the stool and sent mac an apologetic look i think ill play incorrectly for a while just to see what happens its your game with some surprise he watched her play against all logic and build her little stack of chips up to ten dwindle them down to three then build them back up again she chatted with renoke learned about his two sons in college and neatly stacked her chips a twentydollar stake he mused and she was up to two hundred the woman was a marvel he caught the eye of a dealer at another table a subtle signal of trouble on the brew ill be right back he murmured to darcy giving her shoulder a light squeeze it wasnt hard to spot where the trouble was centered the man in the first chair was down to three hundreddollar chips mac judged him to be roughly forty a little worse for liquor and a poor loser look you cant deal cleaner than that you ought to be fired the man jabbed a finger at the dealer while other players eased out of their chairs and looked for calmer water i cant win more than one hand out of ten and that little bitch who was dealer before yous no better i want some damn action here he thumped his fist on the table problem mac stepped up to the table back off this is none of your damn business its my business a subtle signal had his floor man already moving toward the table stopping im blade and this is my place yeah the man lifted his glass gulped well your place is lousy your dealers think theyre slick but i can spot them he slammed his glass down bled me for three grand already i know when im being taken macs voice remained low his eyes cool if you want to lodge a complaint youre welcome to do so in my office i dont have to go to your stinking office in one violent gesture he knocked his glass from the table i want some satisfaction here mac held up a hand to hold off the two security guards who were moving rapidly in his direction youre not going to get it i suggest you cash in and take your business elsewhere youre kicking me out the man shoved away from the table on his feet he wasnt steady but he was big burly and his fists were clenched you cant kick me out ready violence flashed into macs eyes in a quick icy flare want to bet rage had the man trembling visibly but drunk or not he recognized the cold fury staring him down the hell with it he snatched up his chips sneered i shouldve known better than to trust some indian dive macs hand shot out like a lightning bolt grabbed the man by the shirtfront and hauled his bulk onto his toes stay out of my place his voice was dangerously quiet his eyes flat as ice i see you in here again and you wont leave standing escort this gentlemen to the cashier mac instructed his security team then show him the door yes sir halfbreed son of a bitch the man shouted as he was led away macs head jerked around when a hand touched his arm instinctively darcy backed away from the frigid fury on his face the muscles beneath her fingers were like iron and she quickly dropped her hand im sorry im so sorry he was dreadful plenty more where he came from all she could think was if anyone ever looked at her with eyes that icy that powerfully cold she would shatter into tiny shards there shouldnt be she bent down started to pick up the glass the man had knocked to the floor but mac snagged her hand and tugged her up again what are you doing i was going to clean up the stop his temper was still on the end of a straining leash and the order snapped out you dont belong here he muttered and began to pull her away from the tables and the stillgawking crowd it isnt all fun and games it isnt a damn castle there are people like that in every corner yes but he was striding so quickly through the breezeway to the hotel area that she had to trot to keep up you ought to be back in kansas tucked away in your library i dont want to go back to kansas he pulled her into the elevator and jammed in his master card for her suite theyll gobble you up in one tasty bite i damn near did it myself i dont know what youre talking about exactly he rounded on her frustration fury selfdisgust punching inside his gut her eyes were as big as saucers that delectably curved top lip just beginning to tremble exactly he said again struggling for calm i have to go down and take care of this stay up here but stay up here he repeated pausing between each word then giving her a nudge out of the elevator and into her suite before he did something insane like clamping his mouth on hers you worry me he muttered as she stared at him youre really starting to worry me they continued to stare at each other until the doors shut chapter four contents prev next darcy kept her spa appointments the next morning because she thought it would be rude not to but her heart wasnt in it even being scrubbed with exotic sea salts massaged with oils that made her think of some egyptian handmaiden and having her face packed with thick cool goo the color of ripe pomegranates didnt lift her mood he wanted her to leave and she really had nowhere to go it didnt seem to matter that as soon as the documents came through shed be able to travel to all the dazzling places shed read and dreamed about she wanted to stay here in this wonderful exciting place with all the lights and the sounds and the crowds and the seamy edges she wanted to gamble again to drink champagne to buy more sparkling earrings she wanted just a little more time in a world where men with faces that should be sculpted in copper paid attention to her as if she were worthy of their interest she wanted more than anything a few more magical days with mac before her coach turned into a pumpkin and the glass slipper no longer fit she wanted him to smile at her again in the way that transformed his face into one glorious piece of art he was so lovely not just to look at she thought but to be with he had a way of turning those wonderful blue eyes on her and making her think he really cared about what she thought how she felt what she had to say shed never been able to talk to another man the way she could talk to him without feeling inadequate and foolish or simple she supposed but shed taken up too much of his time gotten in the way shed always been better off fading into a corner and watching other people live once you stepped out too far into those lights you ended up doing something silly or foolish that made those who knew things wish youd slip away again the money wasnt going to change who she was a pretty dress a new haircut it was only gloss under it she was still awkward and average youre going to love this shaking off the blue mood darcy looked over at the technician shed already forgotten the womans name which was in darcys opinion as rude as not keeping the appointment in the first place flat on her back on the padded table she focused on the nameplate pinned to the breast of the soft pink uniform am i angie absolutely to darcys shock angie tugged down the thin blanket and began to paint warm brown mud on her breasts oh too warm no no she would not blush she would not blush she would not blush whats this for to make your skin irresistible nobodys going to see it where youre putting it on darcy said dryly and angie laughed hey this is vegas your luck could change any time maybe youre right giving up darcy closed her eyes she and her new irresistible skin had barely stepped back into her suite when the buzzer sounded her tongue tied itself into knots the minute she opened the door and saw mac got a minute he asked then stepped inside when she only nodded i dont have much time but i wanted to let you know the press has the bit between their teeth the mystery woman angle has them fired up theyll play that for a few more days but it wont stop there theres bound to be a leak sooner rather than later youll need to be prepared for that im not going back to kansas it came out in a burst fueled by an anger that surprised them both mac raised his eyebrows so you said im not going back she repeated i have enough of the cash you advanced me to get a hotel room and youd do that because you said i shouldnt be here i dont believe i did but he remembered his temper of the night before and thought he might have said something along those lines its certainly not what i meant annoyed with himself he dragged a hand through his hair darcy i know ive been taking up a lot of your time you feel responsible for me but you dont have to im perfectly content to keep out of the way i can just stay up here and write thats what i did last night after well after he held up a hand guessing correctly it would stop the flood of words im sorry i was out of line i let that idiot last night get to me and i took it out on you he dipped his hands into his pockets but it did make me realize that you shouldnt have been there and that you certainly shouldnt be wandering around a casino alone shed been on the point of yielding when his final statement put her back up again you think im stupid and naive i dont think youre stupid her eyes flashed fascinating him with the sudden and unexpected fire of gold just naive then probably a bit incompetent and certainly too her mind went on a fumbling search for the word too midwestern to take care of myself in the big bad city his eyebrow arched in a way she found both charming and infuriating you are the one who walked into town with less than ten dollars no purse and nothing but the clothes on her back arent you so what it got me here didnt it point taken he murmured and last night wasnt the first time ive seen an evilminded drunk either im from kansas not dogpatch weve got plenty of drunks in kansas i stand corrected and struggling mightily not to grin and you neednt feel obligated to look after me as if i were some stray puppy who might run out into traffic theres absolutely no reason for you to worry about me i didnt say i was worried about you i said you worried me its the same thing its entirely different how he studied her color was warm in her face her eyes were dark and shining it wasnt just anger she was feeling he realized but bruised pride as well and that was undeniably his fault he sighed youre really leaving me no choice you worry me he repeated and laid his hands on her shoulders because slid them down her arms around her waist watched her lips part in surprise just before he covered them with his the world tilted every coherent thought in her mind tumbled out and scattered hopelessly lost his mouth was just as shed imagined it would be hot and firm and clever but now it was on hers luring her into some exciting airless space where everything shimmered and shook colors brightened blurring around the edges before they melted together and turned as liquid as her bones his tongue swept over hers teasing inviting mixing his dark intimate taste with her own smooth so smooth that glide of tongue that slide of lips that she seemed to coast bonelessly down the long chute of sensation toward a spreading pool of liquid heat her hands had come up to clutch at his arms for balance he could feel the pressure of her short nails through his jacket a contrasting signal of anxiety even as her lips opened and gave nerves and surrender a dangerous mix punctuated by the helpless little whimpers of pleasure that sounded in her throat combined to take him deeper than hed intended to make him want more much more than hed expected what hed begun churned through him and demanded he finish his way then and there and thoroughly she was aroused so was he however innocent she wasnt a child and he wanted her god he wanted her her eyes remained closed as he drew her away he watched the tip of her tongue trace her curvy unpainted lips before she pressed those lips together like a woman lingering over a particularly lush taste even as her lashes fluttered a hot fist of need balled in his gut her eyes were dark and clouded fixed now on his a flush glowed on her cheeks a swallow rippled her throat damn he wanted desperately wanted to take her in one greedy gulp until nothing was left but the sighs why her breath was coming too fast for the words to be steady why did you do that be careful with her he reminded himself very careful because i wanted to is that a problem she stared at him for a long moment no she answered with such weighty seriousness he nearly smiled i dont think so good because im not finished yet oh his arms were tightening easing her close again bodies met again well her eyes drifted shut take your time her innocence was as bright as a beacon and outrageously arousing no not a child he thought again but the odds were weighted heavily against her and he had no right to use that as leverage grappling for control he rested his forehead on hers slow down he ordered himself better yet stop darcy youre a dangerous woman her eyes flew open me the shock in her voice did nothing to relieve the tension centered in his gut the tension was a bad sign he decided a signal not just of desire but of desire for her very specific very exact and completely inappropriate lethal he murmured then stepped back but he kept his hands on her shoulders not quite able to break all contact she was searching his face now her big gold eyes still blurred from the first kiss her mouth pursed in anticipation of the next he could have lapped her up like cream have you ever had a lover she blinked then her gaze lowered to stare at the buttons of his shirt the shirt was black and silky it had felt warm and smooth under her hands she wanted to touch it again to touch him not exactly his brow lifted again despite its infinite and entertaining varieties sex remains a fairly exact pastime she had the distinct impression he didnt intend to kiss her again after all sexual frustration was a new and not entirely pleasant sensation vaguely insulted she frowned up at him i know what sex is no he thought she didnt she didnt have a clue what he wanted to do with her to her if she did he imagined shed run as far and as fast as her pretty fairy legs would carry her you dont know me darcy you dont know the rules around here or the pitfalls i know how to learn she said testily im not a moron some things youre better off not learning he gave her shoulders a light squeeze when the phone began to ring answer the phone she turned on her heel stalked over to the desk and snatched up the receiver yes hello and who might this be the abrupt demand in a thick burr was so commanding she answered immediately this is darcy wallace wallace wallace is it and would you spring from william wallace the great hero of scotland actually confusion had her pushing a hand through her hair hes an ancestor on my fathers side good blood strong stock you can be proud of your heritage lass darcy is it and are you a married woman darcy wallace no im not i she snapped back and her brows drew together excuse me who is this this is daniel macgregor and im pleased to make your acquaintance she managed to close her mouth take a breath how do you do mr macgregor i do fine fine and dandy darcy wallace im told my grandson is paying a call on you yes hes here werent her lips still tingling from his um would you like to speak to him that i would you have a fine clear voice how old might you be im twentythree i wager youre a healthy girl too totally at sea she nodded her head yes im healthy she only blinked at mac when he cursed under his breath and grabbed the phone away from her shall i check her teeth for you grandpa there you are pleasure and no remorse rang in daniels voice your secretary transferred me of course i wouldnt have to be transferred all over hell and back to have a word with my oldest grandchild if you ever bothered to call your grandmother shes feeling neglected it was an old ploy and made mac sigh i called you and grandma less than a week ago at our age boy a weeks a lifetime bull he couldnt stop the smile youll both live forever thats the plan so i hear from your mother who bothers to call home from time to time that you lost yourself a millioneight and change mac ran his tongue around his teeth glancing over as darcy wandered to the window you win some you lose some true enough and was the lass i was just speaking to the one who scalped you yes a wallace good clear voice good manners is she pretty mac eased a hip on the desk he knew his grandfather well not bad if you overlook the hunchback and the crossed eyes idly he flipped open the notebook on the desk as daniels hearty laughter rang in his ear shes pretty then got your eye on her do you mac lifted his gaze from the pages crowded with margintomargin writing and studied the way darcy stood facing the window the sun was a halo over her hair her hands were linked together in front of her she looked as delicate as a wildflower in the unforgiving heat of the desert no he said it definitely finally wanting to mean it i dont and why not are you going to stay single all your life a man your age needs a wife you should be starting a family as daniel blustered on about responsibility duty the family name mac cocked his head and read a page it was about a woman sitting alone in the dark watching the lights of the city outside her window the sense of solitude of separation was wrenching thoughtfully he closed the book again laying a hand over it as he watched darcy watch the city but im having such fun grandpa he said when daniel finally paused for breath working my way through all the showgirls there was a moments pause then a roar of laughter you always had a mouth on you i miss you robbie daniel was the only one who ever called mac by his childhood name and then he used it rarely love mac thought was inescapable i miss you too all of you well if youd tear yourself away from those showgirls you could come visit your poor old granny obviously anna macgregor wasnt within hearing distance mac could imagine the punishment she would mete out if she heard her husband call her poor old or granny give her my love i will though shed prefer you give it to her yourself put the lass back on the phone no no respect daniel muttered i should have taken a strap to you when you were a boy too late now mac grinned behave yourself grandpa ill talk to you soon see that you do mac stayed where he was after he replaced the receiver ill apologize for the macgregors interrogation its all right she kept her back to him stared out at the sun shining on towering buildings he sounds formidable hard shell soft center mmm she hadnt meant to eavesdrop but how could she have helped hearing macs part of the conversation the love and exasperation in his voice had touched her and his words had cleared up her confusion showgirls of course he would be attracted to the long legs the beautiful bodies the exotic faces hed only been curious she supposed thats why hed kissed her but damn him damn him for stirring up all this need that shed managed to live very contentedly without until now i seem to have gotten distracted from the point of coming to see you he waited for her to turn and face him at a casual glance she appeared perfectly composed but he couldnt seem to glance at her casually he was compelled to search and a search of those eyes revealed bruises and storms now youre angry no im irritated but im not angry what was the point she began then paused significantly of your coming to see me that flair for sarcasm surprised him the edge of it pricked at him enough to have him pushing off the desk and shoving his hands into his pockets the point was the press i know youre concerned about your name getting out were being deluged with calls for the full story i can hold them off but its bound to leak darcy the hotel employs hundreds and several people already know your name sooner rather than later one of them is going to talk to a reporter im sure youre right she supposed she should be grateful hed given her something else to worry about im sure you think im a coward not wanting gerald to know where i am i think thats your business i am a coward she said it defiantly tossing up her chin in a challenging gesture that contrasted with her words id rather agree than quarrel rather run that fight but thats why im here isnt it here with you about to become wealthy cowardice works for me he cant hurt you darcy of course he can lifting her hands she gave a weary sigh words hurt they bruise the heart and scar the soul id rather be slapped than battered with words then she shook her head well whatever happens happens how much time do you think i have before my name gets out a day or two then i should make the most of it i appreciate you letting me know you must be busy i dont want to keep you kicking me out she managed a small smile we both know you have other things to do i dont need you to babysit all right he started for the door then stopped and turned with his hand on the knob i wanted to kiss you again he watched her gaze flick warily to his face a little too much for your own good and maybe for my own her heart stuttered maybe im tired of my own good and willing to gamble something dashed into his eyes that made her shudder high stakes bad odds too risky for a novice darcy from kansas first rule is never bet what you cant afford to lose when he closed the door quietly behind him she let out the breath shed been holding why do i have to lose she kept to herself the rest of the day writing furiously in her notebook the garage that had towed in her car called to tell her it was repaired on impulse she asked the mechanic if he knew anyone who would buy it she was finished with it after all and with everything else save her notebooks that shed brought with her from traders corners when the mechanic offered her a thousand dollars she snapped it up without bargaining and hurried out to sign over the paperwork there was a slick little laptop computer sitting on her desk when she returned with a note telling her that it was hers to use during her stay courtesy of the comanche thrilled darcy stroked it examined it experimented with it then settled down to transcribe her notes onto the screen she worked straight through dinner and into the evening until her eyes blurred and her fingers went numb hunger rumbled in her stomach it was tempting to reach for the phone to order something to be brought to the room to stay hidden instead she picked up her purse squared her shoulders she was going out she decided shed have a meal some wine if she wanted then by god she was going to gamble the tables were crowded and the air stung with smoke and perfume when she entered the casino she wanted to watch to study figure the odds mac had said learn the rules she intended to do just that she liked the world here the hardedged brightness of it the thrill of risk she wandered through loitering by a blackjack table long enough to see a man in shirtsleeves with a thin black cigar clamped between his teeth lose five thousand dollars without flinching amazing she studied the spin of the wheel the teasing bounce of the little silver ball at roulette saw stacks of chips come and go odd or even black or red fascinating behind it all was the neverending beeps and whistles and clinks of the slots lights beckoned jackpot she studied the technique of an elderly woman who leaned on a walker and mumbled to the spinning face of a machine and gave a cheerleaders shout when quarters cascaded into the metal dish fifty bucks the woman said shooting darcy a steely smile about time this sucker paid off congratulations its poker isnt it thats right been nickelanddiming me for two hours but its heating up now she gave the machine a friendly thump with her walker then stabbed the red button again lets go sweetheart it looked like fun darcy decided simple uncomplicated and an excellent place to start she walked down the line until she came to an unoccupied machine then slid onto the stool after reading the instructions she put a twenty in the slot and watched her credits light she pushed the button grinning as her hand was dealt in his office mac watched her onscreen he could only shake his head in the first place she was playing like a chump one credit at a time if she wanted to hit she needed to play four a buck a hand now she was holding two kings instead of going for the straight flush it was pitifully obvious shed never played poker before in her life well hed keep an eye on her make certain she didnt lose more than a few hundred he glanced over at the door when a knock sounded then his smile spread with delight when his mother poked her head in hello handsome hello gorgeous he caught her around the waist in a fierce hug and pressed his lips to her soft burnished gold hair i didnt expect you for another day or two we finished up early she cupped his face in her hands and smiled at him and i wanted to see my boy wheres dad hell be right along he got waylaid in the lobby so i deserted him mac laughed and kissed her again she was so beautiful with soft skin exotic eyes a unique shade of lavender and strong facial bones that guaranteed grace and beauty for a lifetime serves him right come sit down let me get you a drink i would love a glass of wine its been a long day with a sigh serena sat in one of the leather chairs stretched out long legs that rustled with silk i talked to caine this morning he tells me hes getting the paperwork finished up for this woman who hit the big machine here the press is full of madam x she added with a short laugh mac poured a glass of his mothers favored white wine i cant think of a title that suits her less really whats she like see for yourself he gestured to the screen the little blonde in the blue blouse at the poker slot serena shifted sipping her wine as she studied the monitor she lifted a brow as darcy held a pair of eights and tossed away the best part of a flush not much of a player is she green as they come serenas gamblers heart warmed when darcy pulled another two eights lucky little thing though and pretty is it true she was dead broke when she walked in here just about down to her last dollar well good for her serena lifted her glass to toast the screen im looking forward to meeting her oh good someones going to give her a little help what alerted mac looked back at the screen and saw a man slip onto the stool beside her he saw the quick flirtatious grin the easy brush of a hand on darcys shoulder and darcys wideeyed attentive smile son of a bitch mac was halfway out the door before serena could leap to her feet mac ive got to get down there but why as her son dashed off serena decided there was only one way to find out why she set her wine aside and hurried after him chapter five contents prev next people were so nice so friendly darcy thought and so helpful she decided as she smiled at the attractive man in the stetson whod settled down beside her at the slots his name was jake and he was from dallas which as he said practically made them neighbors im really new at this she told him confidentially and his sunshine blue eyes laughed into hers why i could spot that right off sugar now like i said first off you want to plug in the maximum credits for each hand otherwise you dont get yourself a full payoff when you hit right dutifully darcy pressed the credit button then punched for the deal she studied her hand thoughtfully ive got two threes so i hold them well now you could jake laid a hand over hers before she could press to hold the cards but you see youre after that royal straight flush right thats the jackpot you got yourself the ace queen and the jack of hearts there couple treys arent going to get you anything even a triples just keeping you in the game she nibbled her lip i should throw away the threes if youre going to gamble he winked at her you should gamble right she furrowed her brow and let the threes go she plucked an ace and a five oh well thats no good still she remembered what the blackjack dealer had said and turned to jake with a smile but i lost correctly there you go she was cute as a brass button he thought sweet as a daisy and looked to be just as easy to pick charmed he leaned in a little closer why dont i buy you a drink and well talk poker strategy the ladys unavailable mac dropped a proprietary and none too gentle hand on darcys shoulder her head whipped up her shoulders tensed mac he had that frigid look in his eyes again she noted not that he spared her a glance the ice was all for her new friend from dallas ah this is jake he was showing me how to play the poker machine so i see the ladys with me jake ran his tongue around his teeth and after a brief internal debate decided he wanted to keep those teeth just where they were sorry pal didnt know i was poaching he rose tipped his hat to darcy you hold out for that royal straight flush now thank you she held out her hand confused when jakes eyes shifted to macs before he accepted my pleasure after a short and silent male exchange jake swaggered off id been doing it wrong darcy began and that was as far as she got didnt i tell you not to come down here at night alone the fact that he was speaking softly didnt lessen the power and fury behind the words it only added to them thats ridiculous she wanted badly to cringe and had to force herself not to you cant expect me to sit in my room all night i was only this is exactly why ten minutes at a machine and youre getting hit on he wasnt hitting on me he was helping me macs opinion of that was short and pithy and put some steel back in darcys spine dont swear at me i was swearing in general he put a hand under her elbow and hauled her to her feet the cowboy wasnt going to buy you a drink to be helpful he was just priming the pump and believe me yours is easily primed she started to shake and realized it was just as much from anger as fear well if he was and it is its my business my place my business she hissed in a breath tried to jerk free and failed let go of me i dont have to stay here if id wanted some overbearing male ordering me around id still be in kansas his smile was as thin and sharp as his name youre not in kansas anymore thats both obvious and unoriginal now let go of me im leaving there are plenty of other places where i can gamble and socialize without being harassed by the management you want to gamble to her shock and god help her excitement he backed her up against the machine with something close to murder in his eyes you want to socialize mac deciding shed seen quite enough serena stepped up a bright friendly smile in place arent you going to introduce me he turned his head and stared hed completely totally forgotten about his mother he saw easily beyond the smile to the command in her eyes and felt twelve years old again of course with a smoothness that blanketed both his straining temper and embarrassment he shifted his grip on darcys arm serena macgregor blade darcy wallace darcy my mother oh not nearly as skilled as mac darcy didnt come close to hiding both her distress and mortification mrs blade how do you do im so happy to meet you i just got into town and was about to ask mac about you still smiling she slid an arm around darcys shoulders now i can ask you in person lets go get a drink mac she added casting a smug look over her shoulder as she led darcy away well be in the silver lounge tell your father where i am will you oh sure mac muttered fine he resisted barely giving the slot a swift kick and instead dutifully cashed darcy out in a relatively quiet corner of a cocktail lounge gleaming with silver tables and rich black cushions darcy ran her fingers up and down the stem of a glass of white wine shed taken one sip to clear her dry throat but was afraid to take more mac was probably right about one thing shed decided she didnt hold her liquor very well mrs blade im so terribly sorry really serena relaxed against the cushions and took stock of the young woman facing her prettier still up close she mused in a delicate almost ethereal way big innocent eyes a dolls mouth nervous hands not the type her son usually looked at twice she reflected she knew very well his taste generally ran to the long lean and in her opinion somewhat brittle sort of woman she also knew him well enough to be sure he rarely very rarely lost his temper over one mac did ask me not to come down to the casino alone at night serena arched a brow i cant see that hed have any right to do that no but hes been so kind to me im glad to hear that what i mean is he really only asked me that one thing its understandable hed be angry i didnt listen its understandable hed be angry because hes used to getting his way serena studied darcy over the rim of her glass thats not your problem he feels responsible for me it was said in such a miserably depressed tone that serena had to swallow a chuckle she had an inkling her son felt a bit more than responsibility hes always taken his responsibilities seriously again not your problem now tell me everything she leaned forward inviting confidences ive gotten it all second hand either from what mac told my husband or the papers i want the whole story straight from the source i dont know where to start oh at the beginning well darcy contemplated her wine then risked another sip it was all because i didnt want to marry gerald really delighted serena inched closer and who is gerald an hour later serena was fascinated charmed and feeling sentimentally maternal toward darcy shed already decided to extend her quick trip to several days when she covered darcys hand with hers i think youve been incredibly brave i dont feel brave no ones ever been as kind to me as mac has and ive made him so angry mrs blade i hope youll call me serena she interrupted especially since im going to offer you some unsolicited advice id appreciate some advice dont change anything now serena squeezed darcys hand mac will deal with it i promise you you be exactly what you are and you enjoy it im attracted to him darcy winced then scowled down at her empty glass i shouldnt have had the wine i shouldnt have said that youre his mother yes i am and as such id be insulted if you werent attracted to him i happen to think hes a very attractive young man of course i mean she trailed off her eyes shifting up then going wide oh she barely breathed as she stared at the man who stepped up to the table you are the war chief justin blade flashed a grin at her then slid into the booth beside his wife you must be darcy he looks so much like you im sorry i dont mean to stare the day i mind being stared at by a pretty young woman is the day life stops being worth living justin draped an arm around his wifes shoulders he was a tall lean man with black hair streaked with silver as bright as the table and his eyes were green sharp and deep in a tanned and weathered face they skimmed over darcy with both approval and interest now i know what mac meant about the fairy wings congratulations on your luck darcy thank you it doesnt seem real yet she glanced around the glittery lounge none of it does any plans for your new fortune other than giving us the chance to win some of it back she smiled now fully oh he is like you actually i seem to win a little every time i play she tried to make it sound apologetic but spoiled it with a chuckle but i have put some back into the shops and salons a woman after my own heart serena declared we do have wonderful shops here and they genuflect when they see you coming justins fingers drifted up into his wifes hair and began toying with the strands it made darcy realize shed never seen her parents touch like that so casually so intimately not in public or private and realizing it made her unbearably sad another round ladies even as he asked justin was signaling for a waitress not for me thank you i should go up i thought id look for a new car tomorrow want company darcy fumbled with her purse as she rose and smiled hesitantly at serena yes if youd like id love it just call my room when you decide what time you want to go someone will find me all right it was nice meeting both of you good night justin waited until darcy was out of earshot before lifting an eyebrow at his wife whats going on in your head serena all sorts of interesting thoughts she turned her head so that her lips brushed his such as our firstborn nearly punched a cowboy for having a mild flirtation with our kansas pixie another wine for my wife carol and a draft for me he said to the waitress before shifting to face serena you must be exaggerating duncans the one who likes to trade punches over pretty women not mac im not exaggerating in the least fangs were bared blade she murmured and murder was in the air i believe hes seriously smitten smitten the word made him laugh then his laughter faded into unexpected anxiety define seriously justin she patted his cheek hes nearly thirty it has to happen sometime shes not his type exactly she felt her eyes sting and sniffled shes nothing like his type shes perfect for him resolutely she blinked back the tears or ill find out if shes perfect before long serena you sound uncomfortably like your father dont be absurd sentimental tears dried up with the insult i have no intention of manipulating or scheming or plotting she tossed her head im simply going to meddle discreetly she finished and beamed at him you are very attractive she skimmed her fingers through the silver wings of his hair lingered there why dont we take these drinks upstairs up to bed war chief youre trying to distract me of course i am her smile was slow seductive and sure is it working he took her hand to pull her to her feet it always has he kissed her fingers always will habitually mac slept from about three in the morning to nine straddling shifts and ending his day after peak hours barring trouble he could safely leave the full responsibility of the casino for that stretch of time to his shift and pit bosses and floor men morning hours routinely were dedicated to the massive paperwork the casino demanded the banking accounting staff meetings the hirings and firings hed taken over as casino manager of comanche vegas when hed been twentyfour and had set the tone the surface was friendly noisy full of movement and action but underneath it was ruthlessly organized and the bottom line was profit as he was one himself he could spot a card counter across the blackjack pit after a fiveminute study he knew when to let them ride or when to move them along employees were expected to be personable and honest those who met his standards were rewarded those who didnt were fired there were no second chances his father had built the comanche out of guts and grit and had turned it into a polished sharpedged jewel in the desert macs responsibility was to keep the sheen high and he took his responsibilities seriously the first half of the year looks good justin leaned back in his chair removed the reading glasses he privately despised then handed mac back the computergenerated spreadsheet up about five percent from last year six mac said with a flash of grin and a quarter youve got your mothers head for math i live for numbers where is mom i thought shed want to sit in on this meeting shes off with darcy mac set down the personnel file hed just picked up with darcy shopping refreshing young woman justins face was as bland as it would have been if hed held three aces makes it hard to regret handing her seven figures yeah mac caught himself drumming his fingers on the file and stopped the press is pushing for a name ive got half a dozen assistants fielding calls even without her name the publicitys humming it cant hurt business the hotel manager reports an upswing in reservations in the last two days play on the machine she hit on is up thirty percent when her story gets out and that pretty face is splashed over the national news theyll flood in here im putting on three extra floor men and id like to promote janice hawber to pit boss you know your staff justin took out a slim cigar well likely get the ripple effect at other locations when mac opened the file justin waved the cigar spiraling smoke lets take a break here whatever happened to that longlegged brunette who liked baccarat and brandy alexanders pamela his father didnt miss a trick mac thought i believe shes playing baccarat and drinking brandy alexanders over at the mirage these days too bad she added a nice shine to the tables she was looking for a rich husband i decided to fold before things got sticky hmm seeing anyone else at macs lifted brow justin grinned just trying to keep up with the tour pal duncan changes dancing partners so often i just give them numbers duncan juggles women like apples mac said thinking of his brother i find one at a times less complicated and no im not dancing at the moment you can report back to grandpa that his oldest grandchild continues to be lax in his duty to continue the line justin chuckled and puffed on his cigar youd think four greatgrandchildren would satisfy him for a while nothing will satisfy the macgregor until every last one of us is married and clucking around a brood of kids mac moved his shoulders restlessly at least he could nag one of the others for a bit pick on dc he does pick on dc justin grinned alan tells me he picks at the boy until dc holes up in his garret paints and swears hell die a bachelor just to spite daniel so then daniel goes to work on ian who just smiles charmingly agrees with everything daniel says and cheerfully ignores him maybe ill slip one of their names into our next conversation strictly in the spirit of selfpreservation and shift his focus for a while the door burst open speak of the devil mac murmured as he got to his feet the macgregor stood in the doorway grinning widely his white hair flowed back from a broad and deeply seamed face offset by eyes that twinkled bright blue and a wild snowy beard his shoulders were as broad as the grill of a truck and the hand that slapped justin enthusiastically on the back was as big as a ham give me one of those pitiful excuses for a cigar daniel boomed then caught mac in a bear hug that could have toppled a rabid grizzly pour me a scotch boy flying crosscountry puts a thirst in a man you had a scotch on the plane caine macgregor strode into the room charmed the flight attendant out of one when i wasnt looking if mom finds out shell scalp me what she doesnt know wont hurt you daniel plopped his bulk into a chair sighed lustily and looked around with great pleasure well now how about that cigar knowing the rules and anna macgregors wrath justin turned to his brotherinlaw anna dump him on you ha daniel thumped the cane he used as much for looks as for convenience he wouldnt stay home she sends her love and her sympathy good to see you caine gave both justin and mac a hard hug wheres rena shopping justin told nun she should be back shortly give me a damn cigar daniel glowered and thumped his cane again and wheres the lassie who skinned you for over a million i want to meet her mac turned to study his grandfather formidable darcy had said it appeared she was going to find out firsthand just how formidable dazed and flushed darcy carted bags and boxes into her suite similarly burdened serena was right behind her oh that was fun with a sigh serena dumped everything on the floor and dropped into a chair my feet are killing me always a good sign of shopping success i dont even remember what i bought i dont know what came over me im a terrible influence you were wonderful it had been one of the most monumental days in darcys life being propelled from store to store having blouses and dresses tossed at her modeling them in front of serenas assessing eyes you know everything about clothes a lifetime love affair darcy run up and put on that yellow sundress im dying to see it on you again try it with the white sandals and the little gold hoop earrings she rose to nudge darcy toward the stairs indulge me wont you honey ill order us up a welldeserved cold drink all right halfway up she turned and looked back i had the best time i dont think ill be able to bring myself to buy that sports car though its so impractical well worry about that later humming to herself serena walked away to order some lemonade the child was starved for attention she thought it was so easy to see and so easy to read between the lines when darcy spoke of her childhood she doubted anyone had ever taken her on a whirlwind shopping spree or giggled with her over foolish lingerie or told her how pretty she looked in a yellow dress it made serenas heart ache to remember how stunned darcy had looked when shed laughed and hugged her as theyd debated over earrings and the wistful glance shed sent the bright blue sports car before shed given her attention to the sober and practical sedan she said was more suitable as far as serena could tell there had been far too much suitable in darcys young life and not nearly enough fun that she determined was going to change when the phone rang darcy called from upstairs oh can you im not ill get it serena picked up the phone ms wallaces suite her eyes gleamed her smile spread as she listened to the voice yes indeed were back her mind calculated at a speed and in a direction that would have made daniel puff out with pride why dont we do that here im sure shed be more comfortable yes nows fine see you in a minute humming again serena strolled to the base of the stairs need any help no there are so many boxes i just found the dress take your time that was justin on the phone you dont mind if we do a little business do you no good ill order up more drinks champagne she decided considering ten minutes later darcy took the first turn on the steps just as the elevator opened she froze where she was staggered by the rich mix of male voices the sudden rush of energy that poured out of the elevator along with them then she could only see mac serena watched the way her sons eyes locked on darcys the way they darkened held and she was sure theres my girl daniel grabbed his daughter in a fierce hug you dont call your mother enough he scolded her she pines ive been spending a lot of time nagging my children she kissed him lavishly on both cheeks then turned to embrace her brother how are you hows diana howre the kids everyones fine dianas tying up a case and couldnt get away shell be sorry she missed you well now daniel leaned on his cane and studied the woman whod frozen like a statue on the stairs youre just a wee lass arent you come on down and lets have a better look at you he rarely bites mac crossed to the base of the steps held out a hand her legs were wobbly and she knew her fingers werent steady so she pretended not to see his hand but he took hers anyway giving it a reassuring squeeze that clutched at her heart darcy wallace the macgregor she was afraid she wouldnt find her voice he looked so big and so fierce with white brows knitted together over sharp blue eyes im happy to meet you mr macgregor the scowl stayed in place another moment then transformed into a smile so wide and so bright she blinked pretty as a sunbeam he gave her cheek a gentle pat with his huge hand tiny as an elf her lips curved up in response its only that youre so big if william of scotland had had more like you he would have won daniel let out his bark of a laugh and winked at her now theres a lass come sit and talk to me you can interrogate her later im caine macgregor she shifted her gaze to the tall man with silver and gold hair and strong blue eyes yes i know im so nervous she clutched her hands together how many legends could one person meet in one day i studied about you in school everyone thought youd run for president i leave the politics to alan im just a lawyer your lawyer he added taking her arm and leading her to a chair at the glossy conference table want me to clear this rabble out while we consult oh no please she scanned the faces around her lingered on macs everyone here has a part in this all right its straightforward enough he sat and opened his briefcase ive got your birth certificate your social security card a copy of the police report from the purse snatching last week youre unlikely to recover anything from that she stared down at the papers he handed her it doesnt matter you got all of this so quickly connections he said with a wolfish grin i have copies of your last two years tax returns there are some forms for you to fill out and sign a number of them all right she tried not to gape at the stack he began to produce where do i start ill explain them as we go along he glanced up wiggling his brows at his family havent you all got something better to do no daniel took a chair for himself cant a man get a drink around here while all this legal mumbo jumbos going on i ordered drinks to distract him serena sat on the arm of his chair and began to tell him about her grandchilds latest accomplishments listening carefully darcy filled out each form she hesitated over the address then wrote in the name of the hotel when caine didnt correct her she relaxed a little and continued to note down the required information your identifications in order caine told her youll be able to reapply for a drivers license credit cards that sort of thing you didnt indicate a bank a bank the transfer of funds will be done electronically from account to account the oversize check mac will present you with is just for publicity photo op and positive publicity for the comanche the actual business is accomplished quickly and efficiently by transferring the amount of your winnings from the comanches account to yours do you want the money sent to your bank in kansas no she refused swiftly then fell into silence where do you want it sent darcy caine asked gently i dont know maybe it could just stay in the same bank here thats not a problem youre aware that the irs gets the first bite she nodded signing her name to the last form under her lashes she watched mac go to the door to let in the roomservice waiter mac wore black trousers and a white shirt both looked soft almost fluid and she wondered about the texture wished she could run her fingertips over them over him youre going to need financial advice what flushing berating herself for not paying attention she looked over at caine im sorry tomorrow morning youre going to have a great deal of money youll need a financial advisor you cant do that i can give you some basic and initial guidance after that youre going to want someone who specializes i can give you some names id appreciate it thats pretty much it he leaned back well open you an account the money will be transferred and youre set just like that just like that oh she pressed a hand to her suddenly jittery stomach god once again she searched out macs face hoping hed tell her what to do what to say but he only watched her his eyes steady and unreadable with an impatient huff for her son serena rose id say this calls for a celebration mac darling open the champagne darcy you get the first glass its so nice of you all of you but she jolted when the cork popped ive never lost a million to anyone more appealing justin took the glass from his son and carried it to darcy enjoy it he leaned down to kiss her cheek warmth spread in her stomach pressure weighed on her chest thank you congratulations caine took her hand covered it with both of his then everyone was lifting glasses and talking she was hugged kissed by everyone with the notable exception of mac he only lifted a hand to her cheek skimmed a finger down it there was laughing and arguments over the time and place for a family dinner which she realized with shock included her serena draped an arm casually around her shoulder while telling caine he was an idiot if he thought shed settle for pizza for such an occasion emotions were clawing at her rising up to squeeze her heart to close her throat and burn her eyes she heard her own breath begin to hitch and clamped down hard excuse me she managed to mumble it before turning quickly for the stairs horribly aware the laughter had stopped she rushed up closed herself in the bathroom she held on carefully turning the water on full in the sink so the sound would cover her sobs she sat on the floor curled up into herself and wept like a baby chapter six contents prev next the suite was quiet when darcy came out again she didnt know whether to be relieved or mortified to realize theyd left her alone she would have to fumble her way through apologies and explanations she told herself but for now she could settle her nerves and emotions she glanced around the bedroom scanning the shopping bags the boxes the right thing to do she told herself was to put everything away to tidy up to put at least this part of her life in order she was just unwrapping a new blouse when she heard footsteps on the stairs clutching the blouse she stared at mac as he stopped at the top of the suite are you all right yes i thought everyone had gone i stayed he said simply then crossed to her he glanced down at the blouse she continued to hold in whiteknuckled fingers nice color oh yes your mother picked it out feeling foolish darcy relaxed her fingers and turned away to hang the blouse in the closet i was so rude leaving that way ill apologize to everyone theres no need for that of course there is she spent several seconds adjusting the shoulders of the blouse on the padded hanger as if their evenness was of monumental importance its just that everything seemed to hit me all at once she went back to unfold slacks then repeated the procedure lining up the edges of the hem perfectly thats understandable darcy its a lot of money itll change your life the money distracted she glanced back then fluttered her hands well yes i suppose the moneys part of it he angled his head what else she started to pick up a box then set it back on the bed and wandered to the window it still felt odd to stand there against the glass with a world shed only begun to touch spread like a banquet at her feet your familys so beautiful you have no idea what you have you couldnt theyve always been yours you see so how could you know she watched the signs of the casino across the street beckoning daring inviting win win win it wasnt so terribly hard to win she thought but it was much much trickier to keep the prize im a watcher she told him im good at it thats why i want to write i want to write about things i see or want to see things id like to feel or experience she lifted her hands to rub her arms then made herself turn back to him i watched your family she looked so lovely he thought and so lost and what did you see your father playing with your mothers hair when they sat together in the lounge last night she saw the confusion in his eyes and smiled youre used to seeing them touch each other casually affectionately so you dont notice when it happens why would you she murmured swamped with envy he put his arm around her and she leaned into him sort of eyes halfclosed she moved her body as if yearning for another settled into the curve because she knew exactly how shed fit there darcy closed her eyes laid a hand over her own heart as she brought the scene back into focus and while he talked to me he toyed with the ends of her hair tangled them combed them through wound the strands around his finger it was lovely she knew he was doing it because there was a little light in her eyes i wonder if it takes another woman to recognize that she opened her eyes again and smiled i never saw my parents touch that way i think they loved each other but they never touched that way that easy and wonderful way some people dont or they cant she sighed and shook her head im not making sense he could see it himself now that shed painted it for him and she was right he realized it was so much a part of his life a part of his family he didnt notice it yes you are its more its all of it everyone piling in here a little while ago you were part of it again so you couldnt have really seen it the way your grandfather hugged your mother so strong and tight for that instant she was the center of his world and he of hers and more when she sat on the arm of his chair he laid his hand on her knee just put it there to touch it was so lovely she said quietly the way she and your uncle argued about where to have dinner and laughed at each other all the little looks and pats and the shorthand of people who know each other and like each other they do like each other he could see that her eyes were overbright again and reached out to touch her hair what is it darcy they were so kind to me im taking money from them a lot of money but everyones drinking champagne and laughing and congratulating me your mother put her arm around my shoulders it made her voice break forced her to fight to steady it it sounds ridiculous i know it but if i hadnt gone up right then i would have grabbed onto her just grabbed on and held she would have thought i was crazy lonely had he thought she was lonely he understood now the word didnt come close she would have thought you wanted a hug he slipped his arms around her felt her tremble lightly go ahead grab onto me its all right he eased her closer pressed his cheek to her hair he could feel her hesitation the battle of emotions that had her standing very still then her arms came around him wrapped tight her breath came out on a long broken sigh were big on grabbing in my family he told her you wont shock any of us if you take hold it felt so good to press up against the strong wall of his chest to hear the steady beat of his heart to smell the warmth of his skin closing her eyes she let herself absorb the comfort of his hand stroking gently over her back its just so foreign to me all of this all of them you especially you her voice was husky and low her hair was soft under his cheek and fragrant as a meadow affection he reminded himself as her slender little body molded to his not lust friendship not passion then she turned her head as if to sniff his neck and needs stirred restlessly better now he started to ease away but she clung his lips brushed her temple lingered he held her let her hold him and told himself it was only because she needed it mmm the dress had thin straps crossing over the smooth flesh of her back his fingers began to trace along them under them she moved in a long catlike stretch under the caress jangling his brain it was the only excuse he had for the fact that his lips trailed down her face found hers and plundered he forgot to be gentle she was pressed against him in the stream of sunlight all gold and soft and willing the kiss demanded surrender and she gave it flowing into his arms like heated wine her mouth yielding under the assault of his as if it had only been waiting had always been waiting her mind was spinning in slow expanding circles that spiraled up toward something desperately wanted the strength of him the power of those arms that wrapped possessively around her was desperately exciting knowing she was helpless against him made her quiver yet she gloried in the power of him this was need she thought wildly this finally this a wild burst of light and energy and raw nerves the thumping heart the racing pulse the explosion of heat thrilled she gave herself to it to him in one strong stroke his hands slid down her back over the curve of her bottom lifting her pressing heat desperately to heat his mouth swallowed her gasps greedily ravenously he could imagine himself filling her buried in her taking her where they stood and driving into her until the hot ball of frustration broke free and gave him peace he caught himself as his hands gripped those delicate straps over her back at the point of rending he looked down into her eyes wide unseeing and still swollen from tears he set her aside so abruptly she staggered scalded her with a look when she crossed her hands over her heart as if to hold it in place youre too damn trusting the words whipped out at her but the lash was for himself its a miracle you survived a day on your own god my god was all she could think was the blood supposed to burn like this it was a wonder her skin didnt burst into flame she lifted her fingers to her mouth where her lips continued to tingle and ache i know you wont hurt me hed come close dangerously close to ripping off her clothes shoving her against the wall and taking her without thought or care now he thought she was standing there staring at him out of eyes filled with arousal and worse much worse trust the hell i wont he said it roughly hoping to save them both you dont know me and you dont know the game so ill tell you dont bet against the house the house always wins in the end always she couldnt catch her breath i won his eyes flashed stick around he challenged ill get it back and more more than youll want to lose so be smart his hand whipped out cupped the back of her neck firmly he wanted her to cringe if she did hed be able to resist all the things he wanted to do run away take the money and run far and fast buy yourself a house with a picket fence and a hatchback in the driveway and shade trees in the yard because my world isnt yours she almost shuddered at his words but if she did shed prove everything he said was true i like it here his lips curved into something between a smile and a sneer honey you dont even know where you are im with you and that she realized with a fresh and towering thrill was all she really wanted you think you want to play with me he angled his hand at the back of her neck to bring her to her toes little darcy from kansas first raise and youll fold your cards and scramble you dont scare me dont i he damn well should he thought and he damn well would for her own good you havent even got the guts to risk having some jerk back home find out where you are youd rather sneak out of your own town like a thief instead of taking a stand now you think you can play with the high rollers with another short laugh he released her and turned to leave not bloody likely his words were a sharp slap of shame to an exposed cheek she winced from the blow but steadied herself youre right he stopped at the top of the stairs and turned back she was still standing by the window with her arms wrapped tight around her body her eyes lit with a passion that contrasted sharply with the defensive stance he wanted quite desperately to go back gather her close again and just hold not simply because she needed it he realized with something kin to panic because he did outrageously her breath came out in one explosive puff youre absolutely right how do we do it the images that careered through his mind had him taking careful hold of the banister excuse me how do we inform the press do you just give out my name or do we have to do something like a release or a press conference the combination of shame and irritation he felt was lethal he took a moment rubbing a hand over his face as he searched for control darcy theres no point in rushing into that why wait she stiffened her spine you said that it was going to leak shortly anyway id prefer to have some control and i can hardly expect you to have any respect for me if i continue to hide this way this isnt about me its long past time you started thinking not just for yourself but thinking of yourself i am and it is about me odd she thought how saying that realizing that felt so calming its about taking a stand not being pushed around pressured or maneuvered i might not be a high roller mac but im ready to play my hand she turned moving quickly before she could change her mind and picked up the bedside phone do you call the press or do i he studied her another moment waiting for her to fold but her eyes stayed level her jaw remained set saying nothing he walked to her took the phone out of her hand then punched in an extension this is blade i need you to set up a press conference well use the nevada suite one hour i pushed her into this behind the service entrance of the nevada suite mac shoved his hands into his pockets and watched as caine briefed darcy on the press conference you gave her breathing room serena corrected if you hadnt run interference shed have been dropped straight into the media days ago without time to settle and prepare she gave her son a quick supportive pat on the arm and without one of the top lawyers in the country beside her shes not ready for this i think you underestimate her you didnt see her an hour ago no and though she wondered what had passed between darcy and her son she resisted prying but im seeing her now and i say shes ready serena linked an arm through her sons and studied the woman listening attentively to caine darcy had topped the yellow sundress with a short white jacket it was a smart look serena decided simple and sunny the girl was a little pale she mused but she was holding her own shes going to surprise herself serena murmured and you she added silently caines going to be right there with her and all of us are here backing her up justin slipped through the heavy door nodded to his son laid a hand lightly on his wifes shoulder were set the natives are a bit restless do you want me to make the announcement ill do it he watched the way his mothers hand lifted to lie over his fathers the way their bodies brushed the unit they made it was something so natural to both of them he realized he wouldnt have noticed or would have taken it for granted until darcy i havent appreciated you enough he covered their joined hands with his not nearly enough justin frowned thoughtfully as mac walked to darcy now what was that about im not sure serena smiled a bit mistily but i like it lets go keep the macgregor distracted so darcy can get through this smoothly darcy was terrified everything caine had told her was already jumbled into mush in her head pride kept her rooted to the spot even when her imagination conjured a picture of herself running like a rabbit her heart drummed hard staccato beats in her head as mac came toward her ready time to stop running she told herself yes im going to go in give them a brief rundown then youll come in and field some questions thats all there is to it he might as well have told her she was to perform a tap dance while juggling swords but she nodded your uncles explained how it works the girls not a moron daniel barked she knows how to speak for herself dont you lass the bright blue eyes demanded confidence were about to find out she squared her shoulders and walked to the side door to peek out so many her stomach did a painful lurch as she scanned the dozens of faces in the ballroom well she stepped back one or a hundred its the same thing dont answer anything youre not comfortable with mac said briefly then stepped out the noise level rose with rustling movements and speculative murmurs as he climbed the short stairs to a long platform confidence darcy reflected watching the way he moved the easy way he stood behind the dais and spoke into the microphone his voice was clear his smile easy when laughter broke out among the gathered reporters she blinked she hadnt heard the words just the tone she understood he was setting a casual and friendly one it was so easy for him she thought facing strangers thinking on his feet being in control the sea of faces didnt have his nerves jangling the shouted questions didnt shake his poise in the least okay caine put a hand to the small of her back she drew in a breath held it let it out okay attention shifted in a wave when she stepped out cameras whirled as photographers jockeyed for a better angle television crews zoomed in a barrage of questions was hurled at her the minute she stepped up to the mike she jolted a little when mac reached down to adjust it for her i her voice boomed back at her making her want to giggle nervously im darcy wallace i ah she cleared her throat and struggled to dredge something coherent out of the jumble of thoughts in her mind i hit the jackpot there was laughter some appreciative applause and the questions shot out too fast to separate one from the other where are you from how do you feel what are you doing in vegas what happened when why how where im sorry her voice frayed around the edges but when mac moved closer she shook her head fiercely she would do this she promised herself and she would do it without making a fool of herself im sorry she repeated ive never talked to reporters before so i dont really know how maybe it would be better if i just told you what happened it was easier that way like telling a story as she spoke her voice steadied and the fingers that had gripped the edges of the dais like a lifeline relaxed what was the first thing you did when you realized youd won after i fainted there was such quick laughter at her answer that her lips curved up in a smile mr blade gave me a room a suite they have beautiful rooms here like something out of a book theres a fireplace and a piano and gorgeous flowers i dont think it all even started to sink in until the next day then the first thing i did was buy a new dress lass has a way with her daniel announced shes caught them serena beamed approval she has no idea how charming she is our boys taken with her daniel wiggled his eyebrows when his daughter sent him an arched look see how he hovers over her like hes ready to scoop her up and cart her off if anyone gets too close hes smitten she wasnt quite ready to give him the satisfaction of agreeing theyve only known each other a few days daniel merely snorted then leaned in close to whisper in her ear and how long did it take you to catch this ones eye he jerked a shoulder toward justin slightly less time than it took me to realize youd maneuvered us together in the first place married thirty years now arent you unrepentant daniel grinned no dont thank me he continued patting her cheek a mans got to look after his family after all theyll make pretty babies together dont you think rena she only sighed at least try to be subtle about it subtles my middle name daniel said with a wink good job caine gave darcy a congratulatory embrace the minute the door closed behind them it wasnt as hard as i thought it would be relief flooded through her and now its over its just beginning caine corrected sorry to put that doeonalert look back in her eyes mac will keep them busy for now he said nodding as his nephew went out to bat cleanup for the press but i told them everything theyre always going to want more and you can expect dozens of calls requesting personal interviews photos offers for your life story my life story that at least made her laugh i barely had a life before a few days ago the contrast is only going to add fuel the tabloids are going to play with this so be prepared for speculation that you were directed to vegas by psychic aliens when she laughed he guided her at a quick pace toward the service elevator he didnt want to frighten her or dull that bloom of success but knew she needed to be prepared the calls to offer you tremendous investment opportunities are going to start too financial advisors legitimate and not are going to camp on your doorstep the stepsister of the cousin of the kid who sat behind you in first grade is going to try to hit you up for a loan that would be patty anderson darcy improvised with a weak smile i never liked her anyway good girl do yourself a favor dont answer the phone for a couple of days better yet we can arrange for mac to have the desk take your calls until things cool off a bit thats like running again isnt it no its protecting yourself and its staying in control if you want to do interviews you can set them up when youve figured out what it is you want to do you contact a financial advisor whatever you do you do at your pace im in charge darcy said when they stopped at the door of her suite exactly if you have any questions or concerns you can call me ill be around through tomorrow after that you can reach me in boston i dont know how to begin to thank you enjoy yourself he gave the hand she offered a squeeze and dont forget how much fun it was to buy a new dress keep it simple she murmured understanding atta girl he bent to kiss her cheek ill see you later alone darcy stepped into the suite keeping it simple wasnt as easy as it sounded she was a rich woman with her fifteen minutes of fame in its initial seconds the message light on her phone was blinking and the phone itself began to ring taking caines advice she ignored it waiting until it stopped then taking the receiver off the hook problem solved she thought for now but she had much deeper much more complex problems that sudden wealth had nothing to do with she was in love and knew there was no point in questioning it debating it or denying it her heart was the one thing shed always been sure of often shed imagined what it would be like to lose it the thrill and the anxiety of the fall shed always wondered who it would be who would make everything inside her yearn how they would be together for in her dreams hed loved her as well but this wasnt a dream or imagination loving mac was simply and brutally real with the physical needs so much sharper and more vital than shed believed herself capable of she wanted him to touch him to taste to fulfill the promise of that frantic kiss she wanted to tremble with the knowledge she was desirable and oh she wanted to know what it was to lose herself in sensations just as much she wanted to curl up against him and know she was welcome there even expected there she wanted to exchange those quiet looks that people who were truly intimate could use as effectively as words to be loved in return that wasnt a simple matter but something about her stirred him and that in itself was a miracle if he could want her perhaps there was a chance for more it wasnt any more impossible she supposed than winning more than a million dollars on the single pull of a lever comforted by that she snuggled into the corner of the sofa rested her head on the big soft pillow tucked there and let herself imagine she dreamed of showgirls dozens of them with endless legs and bountiful breasts showcased in brief glittering costumes and colorful floating feathers she stood among them miles too short wearing layers too plain to be noticed a wren among exotic birds their long legs flashed their lush bodies turned and twirled while she stumbled through the complex routine she couldnt keep up couldnt compete no matter how hard she tried she was always a step behind mac stood watching a small amused smile on his face beautiful women with long curvy bodies spun gracefully seductively around him take your pick they seemed to say his gaze flicked down to her face when she stopped in front of him where did you come from you dont belong here but i want to stay he only patted her cheek then gently nudged her along this isnt the place for you darcy from kansas you dont even know where you are i do know i do and it could be the place for me i want it to be and there was gerald taking her hand tugging her away he had that impatient frown on his face that irritated scowl in his eyes its time to stop this foolishness if you insist on pretending to be what youre not youre only going to embarrass yourself im tired of waiting for you to come to your senses were going home im not going back she murmured it as she broke through the surface of the dream im not going back she said more definitely opening her eyes to find the room had become dark while shed slept she lay there another moment ordering both the dream and the depression that accompanied it to fade im staying here she wrapped her arms around the pillow no matter what chapter seven contents prev next darcy had been at the comanche nearly a week and was amazed at how much of the hotel shed yet to explore shed managed to catch the stunning display of horsemanship presented in the auditorium twice a day where beautiful fast horses and daring riders in authentic comanche costumes teamed up for a spectacular performance shed wandered around the lavish outdoor pool with its sparkling water contained in bright tile cannily shaped in a wide c and dipped her fingers into the smaller lagoon secluded by palms and fed by a musical waterfall shed indulged herself in the spa and treatment center had roamed nearly half the wide array of shops but had yet to slip inside any of the three theaters or walk through the many ballrooms and conference rooms or find an excuse to visit the business center the longer she was a guest of the comanche she thought the more it seemed to grow when the elevator let her out on the roof she stepped into a lush oasis of palms and tangling flowered vines the morning sun showered onto the rich blue waters of the pool shooting diamonds of light onto the surface chaises and chairs in the hotels colors of sapphire and emerald were arranged to offer ease to sun worshipers or those who preferred the shade seated at one of the glass tables under the jewel tone stripes of a slanted umbrella was daniel macgregor he got to his feet when he saw her and darcy was again struck by the raw power of the man who had lived nearly a century had built empires raised a president stood at the head of a fascinating family thanks so much for agreeing to see me like this mr macgregor he winked and gallantly pulled out a chair for her a pretty woman calls and asks to see me alone id be a fool to say no he took his seat across from her instantly a waiter appeared with a pot of coffee do you want breakfast lass no she smiled weakly im too nervous to eat foods just what you need then bring the girl some bacon and eggs you need some meat on you he said to darcy scramble the eggs and dont be stingy with the hash browns and bring me the same right away mr macgregor and that darcy mused as the waiter scurried away was likely the typical response of those who came into daniel macgregors orbit right away mr macgregor and off they rushed to follow orders now he picked up his cup youll eat and see if you dont feel steadier a lots happened to you in a short time anybodyd be a bit rocky my grandsons taking good care of you yes hes been wonderful all of you have been wonderful but the ground seems a bit boggy under your feet yes her breath came out in a whoosh of relief that he understood its all so foreign exciting she added scanning the lush rooftop garden i feel as if ive dropped down into the middle of a book and im vague on the first chapters and dont have any idea how its going to end nothing wrong with enjoying the page youre on no and i have been selfconsciously she lifted a hand to finger the silverandgold twists that dangled from her ear but i have to think about whats going to happen when i turn that page i cant keep buying new clothes and earrings and living in the moment moneys a responsibility isnt it he leaned back lips pursed as he studied her delicate she might look he mused but there was nothing delicate about her brain he had a feeling it was both strong and flexible all the better he decided the wife of his grandson should possess a nimble mind and not a shallow one that it is he said and smiled at her the smile confused her it was so canny and there were secrets dancing in those bright blue eyes a little flustered she picked up her coffee forgetting to add her customary cream there were dozens of calls on my voice mail when i checked it this morning thats to be expected yes i know mac told me it would happen but i didnt imagine there would be so many reporters she laughed a little people from magazines ive read television shows ive watched suddenly want to talk to me i havent done anything i havent saved a life or found the cure for the common cold or given birth to quintuplets his brows shot up do multiple births run in your family no pity he murmured hed have enjoyed twin babies still he brushed that aside as darcy stared at him in confusion youve lived a common fantasy instant wealth and youre young pretty you come from a small town in the midwest and you were down to your last dollar its a good story people who read it or hear it can root for you and imagine it could happen to them yes i suppose thats true its only fair i talk to some of them she paused as the waiter returned with two heaping plates daunted darcy stared down at hers while daniel dug into his with gusto eat up girl you need some fuel she picked up her fork i didnt know they served meals up here daniel grinned they dont just drinks and such as a rule but its a fine thing to break the rules now and then you wanted to be private he reminded her and not many come up here so early in the day the restaurants inside will likely be packed with people wanting the special buffet and the like there are six restaurants she told him i read about them in the hotel guide six and four swimming pools people have to eat and some like to be seen around the pool when theyre not gambling i cant get over how huge this place is theaters and lounges the openair auditorium its a maze and all roads lead back to the casino its not a casual design he added with a wink whatever else there is to do in a hotel of this nature gamblings the hub its beautiful and exciting then you come up here and you can look beyond it all and see the desert i love looking at the desert one of the reasons there arent any windows in the casino wouldnt want any distraction he shot her a warriors grin you should eat a good breakfast then when its settled take yourself a nice swim i swim most every day keeps me young it was more than that darcy thought it was the energy the avid interest in life the delight in the challenge of it that kept him vital she was counting on that interest and that delight um mr macgregor caine gave me a list of names financial advisors brokers that sort of thing daniel grunted and since no one was around to stop him dashed salt on his potatoes you need to protect your capital i understand that particularly since a large percentage of the calls on my voice mail were from people wanting to discuss my finances one offered to fly me into los angeles put me up at the beverly wilshire so that i could take a meeting frowning she buttered a piece of toast most of them sounded very interested in discussing portfolios and investments but none of them were on the list your son gave me that doesnt surprise me i wrote them down i have both lists i wondered if you would mind looking at them i know your son prefers giving me a range of choices but i think id do better if i was pointed in a specific direction lets have a look daniel pulled his glasses out of his pocket perched them on his nose as darcy took her lists from her purse ha vultures flybynights grifters with barely a glance he slapped the first list facedown youll want to stay away from these lass she nodded thats what i thought thats the list of the ones who called this is the one your son gave me he tapped his fingers on the table as he read the second list the boy learned didnt he pleased with the names caine had offered daniel scratched his chin through his beard any one of these would do well for you the best thing is for you to interview the top man at each firm get a feel for it let them woo you then trust your gut she was already trusting her gut but wasnt quite ready to tell him what she wanted ive never had any money never had more to worry about and over than what i could juggle in my checking account month to month last night i tried to imagine what a million dollars would look like i couldnt and now even after taxes i have a bit more than what i cant even imagine daniel poured himself a second cup of coffee anna would scalp him he thought with delight if she knew he was slurping up that much caffeine tell me what you want from your money from it she thought not what she wanted to do with it but what she wanted from it time she said immediately time enough so that i can do what ive always wanted to do ive always wanted to write and always had to steal the time to do it i want that first the time to finish my new book then time to start the next she said with a smile because i want to be a writer and the only way to be one is to write are you any good at it yes i am its the only thing ive ever really been good at really felt confident about i just need another few weeks to finish the one im working on the moneyll buy you more than a few weeks i know i intend to have fun with it too her eyes glinted as she leaned forward im starting to realize that fun wasnt a big part of my life im going to correct that whoever said money couldnt buy happiness must have been happy to begin with because if it cant at least it can buy the opportunity to explore being happy she laughed and settled back im going to explore being happy mr macgregor thats a sensible thing yes i think it is being happy isnt something im going to take for granted she said quietly or something i intend to waste he laid his big hand over hers have you been so unhappy i suppose in some ways i have been she moved her shoulders restlessly but i have a chance now to make choices for myself it makes all the difference in the world so i want to make good choices i think you will he gave her hand a squeeze and a pat youve already started to i want to use the money well and i want to give some back to my grandson oh she laughed again and propped her elbows on the table in the casino yes indeed thats part of the fun isnt it but i meant to give some of that money that time and that opportunity to explore happiness back i want to make a donation to literacy i think it fits doesnt it aye he reached out to pat her cheek it fits and you wear it well i dont know how its done though i thought you would id be happy to help you with it when the waiter came to remove their plates daniel waved a hand leave hers he ordered she hasnt eaten enough now he continued as darcy and the waiter exchanged resigned glances youll have your time your opportunity and youll have given something back unless you intend to toss around money like confetti and you dont strike me as an idiot youll have quite a bit left over what do you want from that she bit her lip easing forward more she said then blinked when he threw back his head and roared with laughter now theres a lass with a head on her shoulders i knew it it sounds greedy but it sounds sane he corrected why should you want less more is better after all you want your money to work for you id call you a fool if you wanted otherwise mr macgregor she took a deep breath and rolled the dice i want you to take my money and make it work for me the blue eyes narrowed do you now and why is that because it seems to me id be a fool to settle for less than the best his eyes remained narrowed fixed on her face so intensely she felt heat rising to her cheeks certain shed gone too far she started to babble an apology then the mouth surrounded by that white beard began to curve neither of us are fools are we lass no sir well then grinning his eyes sparkling with challenge he twisted the gold knob on his cane when it hinged back he slipped out a thick cigar with the lighter he took out of his pocket he touched tip of flame reverently to tip of cigar his bright eyes closing in pleasure as he took the first puffs i know its a lot to ask mr macgregor but daniel he said and grinned fiercely were partners arent we eat he ordered when darcy only stared at him ive a couple ideas for how to get you that more youd like are you a gambler little girl with her head light and her heart soaring darcy bit into a piece of bacon it looks like i am mac had a lot on his mind the media was executing a fullcourt press scrambling for access to darcy reporters were wild for interviews and personal data the morning editions both local and national had played variations on the theme little darcy from kansas hits yellow brick road from kansas to oz on threedollar bet over the rainbow with a million for kansas librarian normally he would have been amused and certainly pleased at the positive publicity the story generated for comanche vegas reservations in the hotel were soaring and he had no doubt that the casino would be three deep at the slots and tables as long as the story was hot he could handle the demands on his time the incessant requests for interviews and photos he could add staff to each shift and intended to work the floor himself during peak periods in fact his parents had already agreed to extend their stay a few days and pitch in and he preferred just now to have his plate overfull god knows he needed the distraction to keep his mind off his libido it was suddenly and insistently on edge due to one small bigeyed woman with a shy smile he wasnt inclined toward a serious relationship and certainly didnt intend to become involved with an innocent naive woman who didnt know the difference between a straight and a flush he considered himself a disciplined man who knew how to control his baser instincts and resist temptations he didnt play at love like his brother duncan nor did he consider it a pesky fly to be swatted aside like his sister amelia and he certainly had no intention of settling down and raising a family at this stage of his life as his sister gwen was doing for mac love was something to be dealt with eventually when there was time when the odds were favorable and when there was a good chance of raking in all the chips he wanted what his parents had perhaps he hadnt realized that quite so clearly until darcy had pointed out just what they did have together but he could admit he had always used them as his yardstick where relationships were concerned it was undoubtedly the reason hed avoided any longterm or serious ones up to this point he enjoyed women but involvement beyond a certain level led to complications and complications invariably led to hurt on one side or the other hed been very careful not to hurt any of the women who had brushed in and out of his life he had no intention of breaking that particular rule now as far as darcy wallace was concerned hed decided it was a bad bet all around she was too inexperienced too vulnerable he was setting her firmly offlimits friendship he ordered himself a steadying hand until she had her feet firmly under her and nothing more then he stepped onto the rooftop garden and saw her she was sitting at one of the tables her big elfin eyes wide and intent on his grandfathers face their heads were close together like conspirators he thought and wondered what the hell was going on between them she looked so fragile he decided so slimly built with those pretty ringless hands clasped together like a schoolgirls shed worked a foot out of one strappy sandal and was waving the shoe by a single strap hooked around toes painted a soft shell pink the image that flashed through his mind of nibbling on those pretty toes and working his way up those slender legs had him muttering a curse lust something he normally accepted and enjoyed was currently driving him mad irritation still simmered in his eyes as he stepped through the palms and up to the table daniel leaned back beamed and wiggled his eyebrows well theres a likely lad want some coffee boy i could do with a cup because he knew daniel well mac didnt trust him a whit he scraped back a chair straddled it and met his grandfathers cheerful gaze whats going on here why im having breakfast with this pretty young thing which youd be doing yourself if you werent slowwitted ive got a casino to run mac said shortly and turned his sharp eyes to darcy did you get some rest yes plenty thank you she jolted when daniel thumped his fist on the table god almighty boy is that any way to greet a woman in the morning why arent you telling her how pretty she looks or asking her if shell take a drive with you this evening im working this evening mac said mildly the day a macgregor cant find time for a sweeteyed woman is a sorry day a sorry day indeed youd like a drive wouldnt you lass up into the hills in the moonlight i yes but there daniel thumped his fist again are you going to do something about this boy or do i have to hang my head in shame considering mac picked up the cigar smoldering in the ashtray he studied it thoughtfully turned it in his hand and whats this lifting his brow mac smiled thinly at his grandfather this wouldnt be yours would it grandpa daniels gaze slid away he studied his own fingernails intently i dont know what youre talking about now grandma would be very displeased if she thought you were sneaking cigars behind her back again idly mac tapped the ash very displeased its mine darcy blurted out and both men turned to stare at her yours mac said in a voice that dripped like honey yes she jerked her shoulder in what she hoped was an arrogant shrug so what so macs teeth flashed in a grin enjoy he suggested and handed her the cigar the challenge in his eyes left her little choice defiantly she took a puff her head spun her throat closed but she managed to muffle most of the cough its very smooth she wheezed as she choked on smoke her eyes teared as she gamefully puffed again mac had to resist an urge to tug her into his lap and nuzzle her i can see that want a brandy to go with it not before lunch she coughed again felt her stomach pitch your grandfather she coughed blinked away tears your grandfather and i were discussing business dont let me stop you done with this he picked up a slice of her bacon he bit in neatly then grinned she was turning a very interesting shade of green put that down darling before you pass out im perfectly fine youre a rare one darcy adoring her daniel rose he tipped up her chin kissed her full on the mouth ill get started on that business we were speaking of he sent his grandson a glowering look dont shame me robbie whos robbie darcy asked dizzily when daniel strode off i am to him occasionally oh she smiled thats sweet youre going to make yourself sick mac muttered and took the cigar from her fingers i didnt think youd do it she let her reeling head fall back i dont know what youre talking about with a sigh mac picked up her water glass and held it to her lips did you really think id rat on him come on sip a little the smokes made you punchy its not so bad i kind of like it she turned her head to smile at him you wouldnt have told about the cigar it wouldnt have mattered my grandmother knows he sneaks them every chance he gets i wish he were my grandfather i think hes the most wonderful man in the world he likes you too steady now im fine she studied what was left of the cigar as it smoked in the ashtray i may just take it up but she drank the water again to cool her throat he shouldnt have teased you that way about taking me for a drive with a few deliberate taps mac put out the cigar hes decided you suit me oh the idea wound through her mind then warmed her heart really the macgregors fondest wish is to see all of his grandchildren married and producing babies and the more he has to do with it the better he actually arranged for my sister and two of my cousins to meet men hed specifically picked out for them what happened in those cases it worked which only makes him more difficult to control hes on a streak and just now he angled his head skimmed his gaze over her face hes decided youll do for me i see she supposed the quick thrill and sense of glee was inappropriate but it was very hard to control the curve of her lips im flattered so you should be i am after all the oldest grandchild and hes a fussy man when it comes to family but it irritates you mildly he admitted as much as i love him ive no intention of going along with his grand schemes i apologize if he got you out here this morning to put ideas in your head but im not looking for marriage her eyes went wide and dark excuse me i suspected when i was told the two of you were together up here that hed been planting seeds the warmth that had settled inside her iced over and went rock hard and of course someone like me would be fertile ground for such seeds her tone was so quiet so pleasant he missed the flash he cant help it and your name being wallace put a cap on it strong scot blood he said with a grin and a burr hed consider you tailormade to bear my children and since youre not in the market for a wife or children you thought it only fair to nip in the bud any ideas he might have planted in my vulnerable mind in that area he caught the underlying frost in the tone now more or less he agreed cautiously darcy you arrogant selfimportant insulting son of a bitch she sprang to her feet so abruptly the table jerked the water glass toppled over and crashed on the tiles as she stood vibrating with temper her fists clenched and eyes blazing im not the emptyheaded dimwitted needy fool you seem to think i am thats not what i meant more than a little wary he got to his feet thats not at all what i meant dont stand there and tell me what you didnt mean i know perfectly well when im being considered a cornforbrains moron youre not the first whos made that mistake but i swear to god youre going to be the last im perfectly aware that you dont want me i never said do you think i dont know im not your type furious she shoved the chair into the table and sent another glass crashing you prefer bigbusted showgirls with eight feet of leg and yards of hair what where the hell did that come from straight out of her dream the night before but shed be damned if shed tell him i dont have any delusions about you just because i would have slept with you doesnt mean i expected you to sweep me off to the altar if all i wanted was marriage i could have stayed exactly where i was she still looked like a fairy he noted one who could and would spitefully turn an incautious man into a braying jackass before you break any more glassware let me apologize he put a restraining hand on the back of the chair before she could jam it into the table again i didnt want my grandfather to put you in an uncomfortable position youve accomplished that all on your own mortification mixed with temper to send her color high it may surprise you to know that i asked daniel to meet me here this morning and though it may crush your outrageous ego it had nothing whatsoever to do with you it was a business meeting she said rather grandly business he squinted against the sun what sort of business i dont believe thats any of your concern she told him coldly but since youll undoubtedly harass daniel over it ill tell you daniel has agreed to be my financial advisor intrigued mac slipped his hands into his pockets and rocked on his heels you asked him to handle your money is there any reason i shouldnt no hoping to cool her off a bit he smiled and inclined his head you couldnt do better precisely and he mac thought couldnt have done any worse darcy i dont want your apology her voice glittered with ice i dont want your excuses or your pitiful reasons i believe we both understand perfectly well the status of our relationship she snatched up her purse you can bill me for the cost of the glasses he couldnt stop the wince as she stormed off slapping her way though the palms he had both feet up to the knees in his mouth he decided grimacing at the sparkle of shattered glass on the tiles getting them out would be the first problem he thought the second problem would be a great deal more complex just how was he going to deal with the fact that the woman who had just ripped the skin off his hide utterly fascinated him chapter eight contents prev next for the next two days darcy concentrated on her writing for the first time in her life she decided she was going to do what she wanted when she wanted if she wanted to work until three in the morning and sleep until noon there was no one to criticize her habits dinner at midnight why not it was her life now and sometime during those first furious hours she realized she was finally living it she was going to miss daniel she thought hed returned east the day before with a promise to keep in close contact on the investments he was making for her hed issued an open invitation for her to visit his home in hyannis port darcy intended to take him up on it shed grown very fond of the macgregors they were warm generous and delightful people even if one particular member of the clan was arrogant insulting and infuriating he actually thought sending her flowers was going to make up for it she sniffed as she glanced over at the lush arrangement of three dozen silvery white roses shed instructed the bellman to place on the conference table they were the most beautiful flowers shed ever seen which he undoubtedly knew she thought hardening her heart as she sat at the desk she hadnt acknowledged them or the sweet basket of buttoneyed daisies that stood perkily on her bathroom counter or the vase of stunning tropical blooms that graced the bureau in the bedroom the roses had come first she remembered tapping her fingers on the desk barely an hour after shed stormed back into her room after the conversation with mac the bellman had knocked on her door the note with them had been a smooth apology shed easily ignored it was no ones business but hers that shed tucked the card away in her lingerie drawer the daisies had come the next day with a request that she call him when she had a moment shed tucked that card away too and had ignored the request just as shed ignored his insistent knocking at her door the previous evening this morning it was birdsofparadise and hibiscus with a much pithier request damn it darcy open the door with a short humorless laugh she turned on her laptop she would not open the door not to him not the literal door of her room or the metaphorical door to her heart it wasnt simply mortifying that shed allowed herself to fall in love with him it was typical she thought and clenched her teeth pitiful lonely woman meets sophisticated handsome man and tumbles facefirst at his feet well shed picked herself up now hadnt she he could send her an acre of flowers a ream of notes but it wasnt going to change a thing she had her direction now as soon as she completed the draft of her book she was going to a realtor she intended to buy a house something big and sand colored that faced the open mystery of the desert and the majestic ring of mountains something with a pool she decided and skylights shed always wanted skylights settling here had nothing to do with mac she told herself she liked it here she liked the hot winds the sprawling desert the pulse of life and promise that beat hi the air las vegas was the fastest growing city in the us wasnt it and reported to be one of the most livable it said so in the glossy hotel guide on her coffee table why shouldnt she live here when the phone rang she merely scowled at it if it was mac thinking she was the least bit interested in speaking to him he could mink again she ignored the call rolled her shoulders once then dove back into the story mac prowled his office restlessly while his mother scanned the printout of bookings for the next six months youve got a wonderful lineup here mmm he couldnt concentrate and it infuriated him hed only wanted to warn her about his grandfathers tendency for plots and schemes for her own good he thought moving from window to window as if to improve his view and hed apologized repeatedly she didnt even have the courtesy to acknowledge it hed come close far too close to using his passkey and circumventing the control on her private elevator and that he reminded himself would have been an unforgivable invasion of her privacy and a breach of his responsibilities to the comanche but what the hell was she doing in that suite she hadnt had a meal outside of it since that breakfast on the roof she hadnt stepped foot in the casino or any of the lounges sulking it was so unattractive he decided and sulked a bit himself it serves me right for trying to look after her he muttered what serena glanced over then shook her head she knew very well shed had only the stingiest slice of her sons attention for the past hour mac whats wrong nothings wrong do you want to see the entertainment schedule she lifted her eyebrows and waved the printout im looking at it oh right he turned to scowl out the window again with a sigh serena set the papers aside you might as well tell me whats bothering you ill just nag you until you do anyway whod have thought she could be so stubborn the words exploded out of his mouth as he whirled back if she can be this damn perverse how the hell did she get pushed around so much serena hummed in her throat then crossing her legs settled back women rarely ruffled mac she mused and took it as a very good sign i assume youre talking about darcy of course im talking about darcy frustration simmered in his eyes i dont know what the hell shes doing locked in that suite day and night writing what do you mean writing her book serena said patiently shes trying to finish the first draft of her book she wants to have that done before she starts querying agents how do you know because she told me we had tea in her suite yesterday it took monumental control to keep his mouth from falling open she let you in of course she let me in i talked her into taking a short break from it shes a very disciplined young woman and very determined on this and talented talented i persuaded her to let me read a few pages of the book shed finished last year serenas lips curved up into a pleased smile i was impressed and entertained does that surprise you no he realized it didnt not in the least so shes working thats right thats no excuse for being rude rude darcy im tired of the silent treatment he muttered shes not speaking to you what did you do mac set his teeth and shot a withering look at serena why do you assume i did anything darling she rose crossing over to lay a hand on his cheek as much as i love you youre a man now what did you do to upset her i was simply trying to explain the macgregor to her i came across them with their heads together and grandpa started in on why didnt i take this pretty young girl for a drive in the moonlight you know the routine yes i do daniel subtle macgregor she thought with a windy sigh exactly how were you trying to explain him to her i told her he wanted his grandchildren married settled and producing more little macgregors that it appeared hed picked her out for me i apologized for him and explained that i wasnt looking for marriage and she shouldnt take him too seriously serena stepped back the better to stare at her firstborn and you used to be such a bright child i was only thinking of her he retorted i thought he was setting her up how was i supposed to know shed asked him to meet her on business i admit i put my foot in it he jammed his hands into his pockets i apologized several times i sent her flowers ive called not that shell answer the damn phone what the devil am i supposed to do grovel it might be good for you serena murmured then laughed as he hissed at her mac gently she cupped her hands on his face why are you so worried about it do you have feelings for her i care what happens to her she stumbled in here like a refugee for gods sake she needs someone to look out for her she kept her eyes level on his so your feelings for her are brotherly he hesitated just a moment too long they should be are they i dont know loving him she skimmed her fingers back into his hair maybe you should find out how she wont talk to me a man who has both macgregor and blade blood in his veins wouldnt let something like a locked door stop him for long she smiled kissed him firmly my moneys on you darcys eyes were closed as she tried to visualize the scene before letting the words come now finally though danger shadowed every corner her two main characters would come together no longer would they resist this vital and primitive pull no longer would needs that swam in the blood and slammed in the heart be denied it was now had to be now the room was cold and smelled of damp the blazing fire had yet to conquer the blue haze of a winter moon slipped through the windows he would touch her how would he touch her a brush of knuckles on her cheek her breath would catch strangle in her throat shudder through her lips would she feel the heat of his body as he drew her close what would be the last thing running through her mind in those seconds just before his mouth lowered took possession of hers insanity darcy thought and she would welcome it keeping her eyes closed darcy let the words run through her mind and onto the page the sudden shrill of the phone was so abrupt and out of place in her chilly cabin in the mountains she snatched it up without thinking yes yes hello darcy the voice was grave undeniably irritated and all too familiar gerald the passion and promise of the scene vanished replaced by nerves ah how are you how would you expect me to be youve caused me a great deal of trouble im sorry the apology was automatic making her wince the moment it was out of her mouth i cant imagine what you were thinking of well discuss it give me your room number my room number nerves shot directly to panic where are you im in the lobby of this ridiculous place you chose to land in its beyond inappropriate which i should have expected given your recent behavior but well straighten it out shortly your room number darcy her room her haven no no she couldnt let him invade her sanctuary i ill come down she said quickly theres a seating area near the waterfall its on the left of the reception desk in the main lobby do you see it i could hardly miss it could i dont dawdle no ill be right down she hung up pushed away from the desk despair closed in and was resolutely fought back he couldnt make her do anything she didnt want to do she reminded herself he had no power here no control he had nothing that she didnt give him but the hand that picked up her purse wasnt completely steady her legs wanted badly to shake as she walked to the elevator she concentrated on keeping her knees from knocking together all the way down the lobby was crowded with people families of tourists who wandered through to toss coins into the pool at the base of the waterfall or to see the liveaction show in the openair amphitheater guests checked in checked out others were lured by the ching of slots and headed for the casino gerald sat in one of the curvedback chairs near the bubbling pool his dark suit was without a wrinkle his hard handsome face without a smile as he scanned the activity around him with a glint of derision in his dark eyes he looked successful darcy thought removed from the chaotic whirl around him cold she decided it was his cold nature that had always frightened her his head turned as she approached even as his eyes skimmed over her registering both surprise and disapproval of her choice of pale green shorts and a peach blouse he got to his feet manners she thought hed always had excellent manners i assume you have an explanation for all of this he gestured to a chair the gesture she mused was just one of the ways he took control sit darcy and shed always quietly obeyed this time she stood i decided to relocate dont be absurd he dismissed this with a wave of his hand before taking her arm and pulling her firmly into a chair do you have any idea what embarrassment youve caused me sneaking out of town in the middle of the night i didnt sneak of course she had she thought he merely arched a brow adult to child you left without a word to anyone youve been irresponsible which again i should have expected taking a trip like this without any planning what did you expect to accomplish escape she thought adventure life she linked her fingers together laid them in her lap and tried to speak calmly i wasnt taking a trip i was leaving theres nothing for me in traders corners its your home not anymore dont be more foolish than necessary do you have any idea what sort of position youve put me in i find my fiancée gone im not your fiancée gerald i broke our engagement some time ago his gaze never wavered and ive been more than patient giving you time to come to your senses and calm your nerves this is how you behave las vegas for pitys sake he placed his hands neatly on his knees and leaned forward people are gossiping about you now and that reflects poorly on me youve been splashed all over the national news some sort of threeday wonder i won nearly two million dollars thats news gambling he sneered on the word then leaned back again ill handle the press of course the interest will die down soon enough and its a simple matter to put a positive spin on the incident to play down the sordid sordid i put money into a slot machine i hit the jackpot whats sordid about it he spared her a weary glance i wouldnt expect you to understand the underlying thrust of this darcy your innocence at least does you credit well arrange for the money to be transferred no her heart was beginning to pound in her throat you can hardly leave it in nevada my broker will invest it properly well see that you get a nice allowance from the interest an allowance she thought through the dull buzzing in her head as if she were a child who could be indulged with carefully controlled spending money its already being invested mr macgregor daniel macgregor is handling it shock reflected in his eyes as his hand shot out to grip hers my god darcy youre not telling me youve given over a million dollars to a stranger hes not a stranger and actually he has slightly under a million for now there are taxes and living expenses to consider how could you be so stupid his voice rose making her cringe back from it and the disgusted fury in his eyes put it together a simpleton could see it macgregor has a financial interest in this hotel and now he has the money you took from this hotel im not stupid darcy said in a quiet voice and daniel macgregor isnt a thief my lawyer will draw up the necessary papers to transfer the funds what there are left of them well have to work quickly he glanced at his watch ill have to call him at home inconvenient but it cant be helped go up and pack while i deal with this latest mess youve made the sooner i get home the sooner this can be mended did you come for the money or for me gerald she flexed her hand in his then let it lie passively she would never win in a physical altercation so she concentrated her efforts and her anger into the verbal it occurs to me that your pattern would have been to call and order me home once you knew where i was you wouldnt have bothered to rearrange your busy schedule and come in person you wouldnt have felt the need youd have been so sure id have tucked my tail between my legs and come back when you snapped your fingers i dont have time for this now darcy go pack and change into something suitable for travel im not going anywhere fury had his fingers biting into hers as he jerked her to her feet do what youre told now i will not tolerate a public scene then leave because youre about to get one a hand dropped lightly onto her shoulder she knew before he spoke that it was mac is there a problem here no she didnt look at him couldnt gerald this is mac blade he runs the comanche mac gerald was just leaving goodbye gerald mac said in a mild tone that flashed just around the edges i believe the lady would like her hand back neither darcy nor i require your interference mac stepped forward until they were eyetoeye i havent begun to interfere but id be happy to his smile was lethal in fact ive been looking forward to the opportunity dont more angry than frightened now darcy pushed her way between them im perfectly capable of handling my own problems is this what youve been up to darcy disgust laced geralds voice as he stared down at her letting yourself be seduced by this person deluding yourself that he would want anything more from you than to cheat you out of the money you took from him and some cheap sex on the side she felt the ripple behind her sensed that mac was braced to attack and quickly swung her hands back to grip his arms please dont please the muscles seemed to vibrate against her restraining fingers it wont help please she ignored the interested onlookers who were busy pretending not to watch perhaps it helped just a little that her back was firmly pressed against the solid wall of macs chest but she knew she had to stand on her own now or shed never manage to do so gerald what i do where i do it and with whom has nothing whatever to do with you i apologize for ever agreeing to marry you it was a mistake i tried to rectify but you never wanted to hear me other than that i have nothing to be sorry for she drew a fresh steadying breath while she watched his jaw clench he wanted to hit her she realized and found she wasnt surprised if she hadnt found the courage to run he would have ended up using fists as well as words sooner or later intimidation wouldnt have been enough the certainty of that gave her the will to finish it you maneuvered and manipulated me because you could and thats why you wanted to marry me at first anyway after that you insisted on it because you couldnt and wouldnt accept some little no one refusing you and having to explain a broken engagement to the neighbors his face had gone stone cold im not going to stand here while you air our personal business in public youre free to leave anytime you came here because im suddenly some little no one with a great deal of money that ups the stakes and so does the press im sure a few enterprising reporters have made their way to traders corners and it wouldnt take much for any of them to dig up that wed once been engaged embarrassing for you but it cant be helped im telling you now as clearly as i know how that youll never get your hands on me or my money that im never coming back i live here now and i like it i dont like you and i realize i never have he stepped back from her abruptly i can see now that youre not the person i believed you to be i cant tell you how happy that makes me cut your losses gerald she said quietly and go home he angled his head studying both her and mac with equal disdain as far as i can see the two of you are well suited to each other and this place if you mention my name in the media ill be forced to take legal action dont worry darcy murmured as he strode away i seem to have forgotten your name already well done unable to resist mac lowered his head and pressed a kiss to the top of hers she only closed her eyes however it was done its over thanks for offering to help you didnt appear to need it but she was starting to tremble now let me take you upstairs i know the way darcy he turned her around leaving his hands on her shoulders you wouldnt give me the satisfaction of breaking his face you owe me she drummed up something that passed for a smile all right i always pay my debts he kept an arm around her shoulders as he walked her to the elevator instinctively he rubbed a hand up and down her arm to ease the trembling did you get my flowers yes theyre very nice her voice went prim pleasing him thank you he used his passkey to access her floor my mother tells me youve been working thats right so the reason you havent answered my calls or let me into your room is because youve been busy writing not because you hold a grudge she shifted uncomfortably i dont hold grudges usually but youre making an exception for me i suppose okay youve got two choices you can forgive me for being i believe arrogant and insulting was the way you put it or im going to be forced to go after gerald and pound my frustrations out on him you wouldnt do that oh yes he smiled darkly i would she stared at him even after the elevator doors slid open you would she realized with something between shock and horrified delight it wouldnt solve anything but id enjoy it so much so are you going to invite me inside or do i go find him she jerked a shoulder and tried not to be pleased come in im probably too distracted to work anyway thanks he glanced toward her desk hows it going very well my mother said you let her read a couple pages she made it hard to say no would you like a drink some coffee nothing right now are you going to let me read some of your book when its published you can read the whole thing he shifted his gaze from the desk to her face her color was back which relieved him shed looked much too pale and much too fragile downstairs i can make it hard to say no too it runs in the family but youre a little shaky at the moment so ill wait its just a reaction she cupped her elbows in her palms i was afraid when he called but you went down and met him it had to be done you could have called me you didnt have to do it alone yes i did i had to know i could it seems foolish now to realize id ever been intimidated by him hes so pathetic really she hadnt understood that before she thought now hadnt seen the sorry man under the bully still if i hadnt been i might not be here i might not have met you i have to be grateful for that she clasped her hands together i appreciate you not hitting him after he insulted you that way his eyes stayed on her face i wouldnt have hit him for me new emotions swam into her eyes i knew when you came it would be all right that i would be all right and i wasnt afraid anymore he thought that weve been i was glad he did because id never let him touch me and he thinks you have he knew it was a mistake to cross to her the odds were weighted wrong for both of them hell stew about that for a long time its almost as good as beating him senseless the warmth spreading in her chest was nearly painful im glad you were there so am i are we friends again his knuckles brushed her cheek made her breath catch strangle in her throat and shudder through her lips is that what you want to be her eyes were wide and dark her lips parted full of anticipation invitation and irresistible not entirely he murmured and lowered his mouth to hers she knew now what thoughts scrambled through the brain in those last seconds before the mating of lips wild and desperate images so bold and tangled they had no name she stretched up to her toes her body pressing into his her hands streaking up his chest to grip his shoulders as she let herself tumble into those shockingly bright colors and shapes her mouth was so eager so soft and warm and giving he wanted more of it her body was so slight so pliant so ready he wanted all of it the need was huge raw as a groan and forced him to fight for control darcy he started to ease her away swore that he would but her arms wound around his neck please her voice was husky a tremble of urgency oh please touch me the whispered request was as seductive as a rustle of black silk desire swarmed through him roaring in his head throbbing in his loins touching wont be enough you can have enough she could drown in need she thought frantically already she was going under make love with me her voice sounded desperate and very faraway as her lips raced over his face melted onto his take me to bed it was as much demand as offer everything inside him responded to both i want you he tore his mouth from hers to press it to her throat its insane how much i want you i dont want to be sane i dont want you to be just once be with me he let the wheel spin he swept her up in his arms and watched her eyes turn gold with awareness the fact that she weighed little more than a child terrified him i wont hurt you i dont care but he did he nuzzled a sigh from her as he carried her to the stairs and started up the first time i brought you up here i wondered about you who is she where does she come from he laid her on the bed stroked his fingers down the column of her throat what am i going to do with her i still havent figured it out when i woke up and saw you i thought i was dreaming she lifted a hand to his cheek part of me still does he turned his head to press his lips into the cup of her palm ill stop if you ask me he took her mouth again going deep sinking in for gods sake dont ask me how could she why would she when nerves and pleasure and needs were dancing just under her skin the spread was slick under her back and his hands were already stroking small separate fires into life over her body his mouth drew and drew and drew from hers as if she contained some life force he craved craved no one had ever made her feel wanted like this his fingers trailed over her as though he found her delicate special and when his hand closed over her breast molded it her mind emptied she was unbearably responsive her body arching giving inviting him to do as he wished gently he ordered himself go gently here he blurred her mind and his with kisses as he opened her blouse and began to explore warm smooth flesh her trembles aroused him almost brutally every quiver of her muscles was a miracle to be exploited then savored for he found he could savor the texture of that skin curving subtly above the cup of her bra the flavor of her throat where the pulse beat so hard and fast he drew her up nibbling tortuously at her mouth as he slipped her blouse aside hesitantly she reached for the buttons of his shirt she wanted to touch him to see to know a sound of dizzy delight escaped her when she saw her white hands against the dusky gold of his chest so strong she thought fascinated by the ridge of muscles under her fingertips so hard and strong and male thrilled she leaned forward to press her lips to his shoulder to absorb the taste he felt something like a growl working through him and pushed down a sudden violent need to devour instead he took her face in his hands watching her drinking her in even as his mouth took hers again watching still for those flickers of surprise and pleasure in her eyes as he slipped her bra aside as he cupped her breasts in his hands skimmed his thumbs over nipples that went hot and stiff then he laid her back to capture one sensitized point with his mouth her hand fisted in the spread dragging at it as hot liquid sensation flooded her system a pulse was pounding between her legs all but burning there she heard her own moan a wanton throaty sound of pleasure as she wrapped around him racked by edgy questing needs easy he wasnt certain if he were calming her or himself but her restless movements beneath him had control nearly slipping out of his hands he rolled with her tugging away the spread shed tangled around them sinking with her into the pool of pillows he dragged at her shorts drawing them down away then toyed with the last barrier the little swatch of blushcolored lace oh my her hips jerked and her vision blurred i cant you should be dancing through the woods under a full moon he murmured it delighting in her body the shape of it the glorious response of it to every touch he traced a scatter of freckles on her quivering belly and smiled as he shaped a star shouldve figured it then he slid a finger under the lace pressure slammed into her a smothering weight of velvet that had her fighting for one gulp of air heat flashed with the shock of a fireball her eyes went blind the stunned cry ripped from her throat and the pressure burst into a flare of pleasure dark as moonless midnight she went limp with it the hand that had gripped his shoulder sliding bonelessly to the tangled sheets so hot he thought and his hands werent completely steady as he drew the lace down her legs so wet so beautifully ready he felt his heart slamming in his chest as her heavy eyes flickered open and that clouded gold fixed on him ive never i know he was the first and it made him mad to have her again he murmured and brought her close so desperately close that her hips arched up to meet him when he came into her his muscles screamed his blood seemed to snarl as he met both heat and resistance hold on he panted it linked his hands with hers she felt herself reaching again flying toward that astonishing peak the pain was a shock so mixed with pleasure she couldnt separate the two then she was opening for him taking him into her mating and there was only pleasure movement and magic combined to sweep her off on some high curving wave that crested so slowly so gracefully that she seemed to tremble on its peak endlessly before sliding down and down into a quiet and shimmering pool resting there with him on her in her she wrapped herself around him and sighed his name chapter nine contents prev next she could smell the heady and exotic fragrances of the tropical bouquet on her dresser the sun poured through the windows and beat warmly against her face if she kept her eyes closed she could picture herself in some lush and deserted jungle gloriously naked and tangled around her lover her lover what a marvelous phrase that was she let it repeat in her mind over and over as she turned her head to press her lips to his throat but when he started to shift she tightened her grip do you have to move his mind didnt seem to want to clear she was still inside it as completely as he was still inside her youre so little ive been working out she wanted to keep tasting it the hot dusky flavor of his throat im starting to get biceps he had to smile he eased back just enough to pinch her upper arm where the tiny muscle melted like wax under his fingers wow she laughed okay im almost getting biceps in a few more weeks nobodys going to call me pencilarm you dont have pencil arms he murmured distracted by the texture of her skin along her elbow theyre slender smooth she studied his face marveling at the concentration in his eyes as he traced his finger from her shoulder to her wrist did he have any idea just what that absent brush of fingers did inside her body she didnt see how he could or how he could possibly understand what it was like for her to look at that beautifully sculpted profile and know that for a little while he belonged to her was it because she was in love with him that their lovemaking had taken on such a brilliant sheen was it because he was her first her only that she couldnt imagine being so close so intimate with anyone else whatever the reason she would treasure what hed given her and she would hope shed given him something he would remember in return i have to ask her smile was a little apologetic i know its probably pitifully typical but well i need to know his gaze had come back to her face and it was wary he was afraid she would ask him how he felt what he wanted where this was leading since he was still struggling with the first part of that he had no idea what followed was i was it how did one phrase it was it all right she asked him then tension in his stomach dissolved darcy struck by a wave of tenderness he lowered his mouth and kissed her long and deep what do you think i stopped being able to think her eyes opened slowly glowed into his everything got jumbled i always imagined that id remember all the details sort of stepbystep but i couldnt pay attention there was so much to feel sometimes he wanted her mouth again and took it thinkings overrated thoughts just slide out of my head when you do that her hands stroked down his back as she floated on the kiss and when you started to touch me everything got so hot he groaned against her mouth then swallowed her gasp as he hardened inside her you dont have to pay attention he told her just let me have you her breath came fast and thick shattered on each long slow stroke she came on a moan and a shudder that ripped through him like claws he gripped her hips lifted them more give me more this time he demanded and drove deep dragging her over the edge with him later when she was alone she caught her reflection in the mirror over the bed her eyes went wide with shock at the image of herself hair tousled face glowing her naked body sprawled over a tangle of sheets could this be darcy wallace the dutiful daughter the conscientious librarian the shy and pitiful doormat from kansas she looked ripe she decided aware and oh so satisfied then she bit her curving lip as she wondered if shed have the nerve to look up into the mirror the next time mac made love with her the next time overcome with joy she hugged a pillow and rolled he wanted her she didnt care what the reasons were it was enough that he did there had been simmering promise in the kiss theyd shared before hed left her hed asked her to have a late supper with him in his office he wanted her was it so impossible to believe she could find a way to make him keep wanting her and to find a way to turn that wanting into love curling into the pillow she rested her head it would be a gamble she would be risking what she had now in the hope for more because hed been right she admitted what hed said in the rooftop garden had been a bullseye she did want marriage and family and permanence she wanted children she wanted desperately to be able to take this love that threatened to flood right out of her heart and give it and for once in her life she wanted to feel loved in return not the lukewarm affection of duty not the kindly indulgence of affection but the hotblooded and dangerous love that sprang from passion and lust and blind need the kind of love that could hurt she thought squeezing her eyes shut the kind that lasted and grew and shot up and down the hills of the roller coaster and demanded screams of delight and terror she wanted it all and she wanted it with mac blade how would she win his heart she sighed a little absently snuggling into the pillow as her limbs grew heavy she would figure it out she promised herself and sighed toward sleep after all the only way to win was to play and she was on a hot streak she wore the beaded jacket shed fallen in love with on her first day at the hotel under it was a daring little excuse for a dress in lipstick red the jacket gave her confidence made her feel glamorous the dress made her feel just a bit sinful she wanted to try her hand at blackjack again decided she might make it her signature game if she was going to live in vegas and she was and be involved with a man who ran a casino which she hoped to be she needed to be skilled in at least one form of gambling the slots she decided didnt take skill shed proved that herself roulette appeared to be a bit repetitive and craps well it looked wonderfully exciting and rousing but she just couldnt follow the action but the cards were selfexplanatory and they always came up in a different and intriguing order she wandered for a while just enjoying the crush of people the raucous sounds the pulse of excitement the tables were crowded tonight and the cards moved fast and sharp she was toying with joining a game and had talked herself into risking a hundred dollars for the night when serena came up beside her im glad to see you decided to get out for a while angling her head serena took in the glittery jacket celebrating um darcy felt color flood her face she could hardly tell macs mother she was in her way celebrating making love to him i just wanted to dress up i bought all these clothes and ive been living in slacks and shorts i know just how you feel nothing perks up the soul like a great dress and thats a great one thanks you dont think its too red absolutely not so are you going to try your luck here i was thinking about it she nibbled her lip i hate to join a table where everyone knows what theyre doing it must be irritating to have a novice plop down and slow the game its part of the game and the luck of the draw if you stick to the five or tendollar tables most people will be willing to help you out a bit you were a dealer yes i was and a good one would you teach me to deal to play darcy stated and to win well serenas smile spread slowly go get us a table in the bar ill be along in a minute split your sevens eyes sober darcy followed instructions setting the two sevens shed been dealt side by side on the silver table in the lounge and this is supposed to be good right not stressful because now i have two hands to worry about serena just grinned cover your bet on the second hand she dealt darcy her next cards three for ten on your first hand six for thirteen on your second dealer has an eight showing what do you do okay darcy wiped her damp palms on her knees i double down on the first hand then take a hit remembering the ritual shed been taught she counted out the bar nuts standing in the place of chips then tapped a finger on her cards a three thirteen i have to take another one pulled a six for nineteen holding on nineteen yeah now we do this one she tapped her finger on the second hand and winced at the steely eyes of the king she drew well at least that was fast busted on twentythree serena raked in the nuts and cards then turned over her down card dealer has eleven fourteen and breaks on twentyfour so i win on the first hand but i doubled the bet so its like winning twice thats good youre getting it now if you want to buck the house you let that bet ride on the next hand darcy stared down at her pile of nuts its a lot twenty nuts on one hand two thousand serena twinkled at her didnt i mention the nuts are a hundred a pop good god ive eaten a dozen lets go for it is this game open ladies serena tipped up her face for her husbands kiss you got a stake pal you got a chair he snagged a bowl of pretzels from a neighboring table i think i can afford a few hands thousanddollar chips we got us a high roller delighted with the game serena rubbed her hands together place your bets when mac found them a half hour later darcy was sitting hip to hip with his father and giggling as she piled a mix of nuts and pretzels into a sloppy mountain on the table youre not supposed to hit on seventeen when the dealers showing a two darcy said sniffing experimentally at the smoke from justins slim cigar why did you hes a card counter mac pulled up a chair and sat between his parents eyeing his father we dont like card counters around here we ask them politely to take their money elsewhere i taught you how to count cards before you could handle a twowheeler yeah macs grin flashed and spread thats why i can spot em your fathers still as slick as he was when he bet me a walk on the deck of the ship on one hand of twentyone he hit on seventeen then too oh darcys heart sighed thats so romantic serena didnt think so at the time justin sent serena a long slow smile but i changed her mind i thought you were arrogant dangerous and cocky i still do serena added sipping at her wine i just learned to like it are you two going to flirt with each other or play cards mac demanded they can do both darcy told him ive been watching learned anything it was the delivery smooth as silk that flustered her as much as the words she looked at him large eyes shuttered by dark lashes if you dont bet you dont win ive got a couple hours off he spoke to the table at large but his eyes were on darcys as he rose held out a hand ill see you tomorrow he said to his parents then drew darcy to her feet lets go out out theres more to vegas than the comanche good night she called over her shoulder as mac was already pulling her away justin drew on his cigar tapped it idly the boys a goner he decided the minute she stepped outside darcy realized she hadnt been out of the hotel after sunset since she arrived for a moment she simply stood between the tumbling sapphire water of a fountain and the grand gilded statue of the war chief the lights were dazzling the traffic edgy vegas was a woman she thought part honkytonk part siren bold brassy and seductive its so much she decided and theres always more the strips a few blocks long a few blocks wide but you can smell money in every foot of it gamblings the core but its not a onefactory town anymore headliners circus acts wedding bells and rides for the kids he glanced back at the wide and towering double arch that was the comanche we added a thousand rooms five years ago we could add a thousand more and still fill them its a huge responsibility running an enterprise of this size i like it the challenge she wondered or the power or the excitement all of it he turned back then taking her hand stepped back he hadnt gotten beyond her face in the bar those eyes of hers always seemed to capture his mind first now he took in the glittering glamour of her jacket and the invitational red of her dress i should have stolen more than a couple hours you need to be taken out on the town id love a couple of hours where should we go i cant manage a drive into the mountains in the moonlight but i can take you for a walk through a tunnel full of fantasies he took her walking on freemont where the street was covered and full of lights colors circled and bled overhead and the ever present clack of the slots added a musical carnival feel she could marvel at the light show delight in the music and walked hand in hand with him on what was so suddenly and unexpectedly an innocent date he bought her ice cream and made her laugh she rode the elevator to the top of the stratosphere with him thrilled at the idea that she was rising up inside of that towering needle that stood at the edge of the strip and though she stared then gulped at the sight of the rooftop roller coaster the silent challenge in his eyes had her scooting into the car with him ive never ridden a roller coaster in my life you might as well start with a champ he told her i tried a tiltawhirl once at a carnival but she trailed off are you sure this is safe almost everyone who gets on gets off again the odds are good he laughed at the horrified look in her eyes then took advantage as hed intended to when the coaster started its climb and she gripped him in a death hold i want to kiss you okay but you could have done that on the ground she lifted her face which shed buried in his shoulder not yet he murmured but laid his hands on her cheeks not quite yet lulled she smiled and her heart began to beat normally again its not so bad i didnt realize it would be so nice and slow then they dipped spinning fast into a free fall that shot her stomach hard against her ribs and burned whitehot fear into her throat now and he took her mouth greedily as they swung over the edge of the world she couldnt breathe there wasnt even breath to scream they were flying rocketing up plunging down shoved into the void then snatched back while his mouth assaulted hers with a singleminded intensity that left her stupefied speed light screams and that firestorm of stunning heat that refused to be stopped dizzy breathless helplessly caught in the crosshatch of arousal and fear she clung to him and gave him what hed wanted crazed halfterrified surrender her head was still reeling after theyd jerked to a stop her fingers continued to grip his jacket as if fused there god the word exploded from her lips ive never felt anything like that before she shuddered once can we do it again his grin flashed oh yeah she felt drunk and giddy by the time they stood on the street again oh that was wonderful it made my head spin she laughed as he slipped a supporting arm around her waist i wont be able to walk a straight line for hours then youll have to lean on me which was part of my plan laughing again she threw back her head to watch an explosion of fireworks jewel colors shot into the black sky and fountained there everythings so bright here so bold nothings too high or too big or too fast she turned into him nothings impossible here wrapping her arms around his neck she kissed him with a passion that had waited a long time to wake i want to do everything i want to do everything twice then pick the best and do it again he slid his arms under her jacket and discovered to his delight that the dress left her back bare to his hands weve got a little time before i have to get back what would you like to do well her eyes sparkled in the neon ive never seen an exotic dancer and your second choice would be i just wonder what it would be like in one of those places where the women dance topless and slide around on those poles no im definitely not taking you to a strip joint ive seen naked women before no all right she moved a shoulder began to walk casually beside him ill just go by myself some other time he shot her a look narrowed his eyes but she only smiled up sunnily he considered himself highly skilled at judging a bluff and knew when he was up against a better hand ten minutes he muttered and you dont say a word while were inside ten minutes is fine delighted with the victory she tucked her arm through his the patriotic one was doublejointed im sure of it with another fascinating experience under her belt darcy breezed into macs office just ahead of him the one with the little flag over her i know the one you mean every time he thought he had her pegged mac thought she flustered him she hadnt been the least bit embarrassed or shocked instead shed been fascinated the way they slid around on that pole they must practice for hours and the muscle control its phenomenal i cant believe i let you talk me into taking you into a place like that i had no idea obviously no i mean about you she sat on the arm of a chair he was already behind his desk scanning the screens what about me that under that suave sophisticated exterior youre really a fuddyduddy at heart he stared at her unsure if he should be amused or insulted anyone who uses the expression fuddyduddy in a sentence automatically assumes fuddyduddy status i never heard that its written down somewhere are you hungry not really she couldnt sit still and rose to circle the room i had such a wonderful time its been the most incredible day of my life and ive had some incredible days lately everythings churning about inside me she wrapped her arms around herself as if to hold it all in i dont think theres any room for food her jacket caught the lights as she moved glittering like jeweltoned stars that reminded him of the fireworks but it was her face it always seemed to be her face that held his attention champagne she laughed a warm delighted sound theres always room for champagne imagine me being able to say that its like every minute im here is another little miracle he took a bottle from the small refrigerator behind the wet bar watching her as he opened it she was glowing he thought eyes cheeks lips everything about her seemed to pulse with energy and fresh unshadowed joy seeing it feeling it aroused contented and unnerved him be with me shed asked him and being with her on a walk down a crowded street alone in a tumbled bed over a candlelit table was becoming uncomfortably vital but she was glowing how could he take his eyes off her i like seeing you happy then you must be having a good night too ive never been so happy she took the glass he offered twirling around as she sipped can i stay here with you awhile watch the people did she really have no idea how she affected him he wondered stay as long as you want will you tell me what youre looking for when you watch the screens i dont see anything but people trouble scams tells what are tells everybody has them gestures repetitive habits that tell you whats going on in the head he smiled at her you link your fingers together when youre nervous it keeps you from biting your nails you cock your head to the left when youre concentrating oh like the way you put your hands in your pockets when youre frustrated so you dont punch someone he lifted a brow good its easy when youre watching a handful of people but there are so many she added gesturing to the screens how do you pick them out you get to know what to look for this is only backup the first line of defense against scam artists is the dealer he walked up behind her laid a hand on her shoulder so they could watch the screens together then the floor man the pit boss the shift boss and over it all is the eye in the sky this no this is a wink we have a control room with hundreds of screens like this the staff in there watches the casino from every angle and theyre linked to the floor men the shift and pit bosses with radios theyll spot a hand mucker a what card palming the scam artist is dealt say a six and an eight he palms them and switches them with a queen and ace for a blackjack cheatings a problem more now than it used to be when you were dealing with loaded dice and fast hands were talking body computers these days body computers she thought scam artist hand mucking wouldnt that be a fascinating backdrop for a book what do you do when you catch someone cheating show them the door thats it they dont walk out with our money the chill in his voice had darcy glancing back at his face i bet they dont she murmured we run a clean room the cameras there and in all the counting areas help keep it honest but the house always has the edge its not hard to win money in the comanche but odds are you wont keep it because you want to keep playing she understood that it was so hard to stop when there was a chance for more and the longer you play the more youll put back but its worth it isnt it if youve enjoyed yourself if its made you happy as long as you know what youre risking he brought her to her feet and saw that she understood they were no longer talking about table games and slots the dangers part of the allure her heart began to thud as he took the glass from her hand and set it aside that and the whiff of sin you get a taste for it and why stop at a bite or two when you can have all you want his gaze roamed over her face lingering on her mouth then sliding down take off your jacket were in your office his eyes came back to hers and his smile was slow and dangerous i wanted you here the first day you came in now im going to have you here take off your jacket mesmerized she slipped it off let it fall in a colorful pool over the arm of the chair when she realized shed linked her fingers together she pulled them apart and made him smile again i dont mind you being nervous i like it its exciting to know youre a little afraid but when i touch you youll give he reached out to toy with the sassy red strap on her shoulder the dress clung to every quiet curve whatve you got on under there darcy her breath shuddered out hardly anything his eyes flashed a clash of swords in the sun i dont want to be gentle this time will you risk it she nodded would have spoken but he was already dragging her against him his mouth was bruising and hungry and tasted of such raw passion she could only marvel he felt it for her then he was pulling her to the floor and the shock of that alone had her gasping his hands took her over body and mind racing over her taking possessing inciting a fury of sensations all she could think was that it was like the roller coaster a fast and reckless ride glorying in it she yanked desperately at his jacket tugged at his shirt while the pulse pounding in her seemed to scream hurry hurry hurry she moaned as he peeled the dress down and the sound raged through his blood her breasts were small and firm and when he filled his mouth with the taste of them she fisted her hands in his hair urging him to take more desperate for the taste of flesh her flesh he used tongue and teeth until she writhed under him her sobbing breaths like a drumbeat to his greed but still it wasnt enough his mouth streaked down laying a line of heat on skin that had gone hot and damp her muscles quivered beneath his tongue her body shivered under his busy relentless hands his own breath was ragged when he gripped her restless hips and lifted them the fast plunge ripped a scream from her throat the fire that shot through her was molten shocking her system with sensations so acute she feared for a moment they would simply tear her apart the climax rushed through her a towering wave of hot hard pleasure that tossed her high sucked her deep helpless she tossed an arm over her eyes and let it drag her where it would when she thought there could be no more he pulled her mercilessly over the next edge she lay bonelessly as he yanked off the rest of his clothes her skin glowed under the lights flushed and damp her mouth was swollen from his when he drew her up her head fell weakly back leaving him no choice but to plunder her soft mouth stay with me he murmured it as he assaulted her neck her shoulders he shifted bringing her over him brought her down until she took him into her closed that glorious heat around him her moan was long and deep and broken he watched as flickers of fresh pleasure moved over her face and into the clouded eyes that opened and fixed on his take what you want his hands moved up her body and covered her breasts she was already moving her body was unable to rest there was a shock of control of power a nervy kind of energy that demanded movement tantalizing she arched back and drove herself mad everything inside her was as bright as brilliant as reckless and bold as the world she now lived in a world where nothing was too big or too fast or too much he was quivering beneath her and his hands were rough as they gripped her hips a new thrill snaked through her the knowing that she was taking him with her stay with me hed demanded and she wanted nothing more than to obey when the climax bowed her back when it had her melting down on him he rolled her over his body plunging his heart pounding until both body and heart emptied themselves into her chapter ten contents prev next the phone woke darcy at five past nine she thought wearily that her days of working an ordinary eighthour day were over it had been nearly four in the morning when shed given in to exhaustion and even then shed been wrapped around mac since she was alone in the big bed she had to assume hed figured out a way to function on little to no sleep if he could learn so could she she yawned widely reached for the phone with her eyes still hopefully shut hello she mumbled and buried both her head and receiver in the pillow fifteen minutes later she was sitting straight up in bed staring at nothing maybe shed been dreaming she thought and stared at the phone had she actually just talked to an editor in new york had that editor actually asked to see her work she pressed a hand to her heart it was beating fast but steady she could feel the light chill from the airconditioning on her bare shoulders she was wideawake not a dream she told herself bringing her knees up and wrapping her arms tightly around them not a dream at all her story was all over the media the editor had said as much darcy had told reporters that she was writing a book and now the next miracle had happened a publisher wanted to see it it was only because of the attention from the press darcy thought resting her forehead on her knees she was an oddity a story in herself and the publisher would consider her manuscript because of the publics interest in the writer and not the work and that she thought with a sigh didnt make her a writer what difference did it make she sat straight again balling her fists it was a foot in the door wasnt it a chance to see if no not to see she corrected to prove her work had merit shed send the first book in and the opening chapters of the second she would let them stand or fall on their own tossing the sheets aside she scrambled out of bed bundled into a robe and raced downstairs to turn those first two chapters into gems she said nothing to mac to anyone afraid she would jinx herself superstition was another new character trait or perhaps one shed kept buried she worked steadily through the day ruthlessly cutting lovingly polishing her words until she was forced to admit she could do no better while the pages printed out she retrieved her list of agents if she intended to be a professional she told herself then she would need professional representation it was time to take the big risk finally take it they were just names to her faceless power symbols how would she know which one to pick which one would see something inside her worthy of their time and attention the face of the slot had been only stars and moons she remembered shed gambled everything once it wasnt so hard to do it again following impulse she shut her eyes circled her finger in the air then jabbed it onto the list lets see how lucky you are darcy murmured and calculating she had fifteen minutes before offices closed on the east coast picked up the phone twenty minutes later she had representation or at least the promise to read the manuscript and sample of her work and to negotiate if the publisher made an offer more than satisfied darcy typed up a cover letter then called the desk to request an overnight bag and form before she could change her mind she nearly did so while the bellman waited for her to seal the envelope she very nearly gave in to the dozens of excuses whirling in her head it wasnt ready she wasnt ready the book needed more work she needed more time she was sending work shed slaved over to strangers she should ask someones advice before she mailed the pages she should call the agent back and tell her she wanted to finish the second manuscript rather than submitting the first coward she berated herself and setting her jaw handed the bellman the envelope will this go out today yes maam itll be in he glanced at the address on the form new york tomorrow morning tomorrow she felt the blood drain out of her face good thank you she handed him some crumpled bills as a tip then sat down the minute he was gone and dropped her head between her knees it was done there was no going back now in a matter of days she would know if she was good enough finally good enough and if she wasnt she simply couldnt face failing at this not this as long as she could remember shed wanted this one thing had set it aside time after time after time now there was no one to tell her to be practical to accept her own limitations there were no more excuses steadier she sat up took two long breaths shed plugged in her stake she told herself and shed pulled the lever now she would have to wait for the end of the spin when the phone rang she stared at it horrified it was the editor calling back she thought frantically telling her there had been a mistake holding her breath she picked up the phone hello she said with her eyes tightly shut hello yourself little girl daniel his name came out on something close to a sob aye is something wrong lass no no she pressed a hand to her face and let out a quick nervous laugh everythings fine wonderful how are you right as rain the way his voice boomed through the receiver seemed to prove it i thought i should let you know i lost every penny in a leveraged buyout i i she blinked so rapidly the room spun in front of her eyes all of it his laughter roared out forcing her to pull the receiver several inches away from her ear just joking with you lass oh she pressed a hand to her speeding heart haha got your blood moving didnt it im just calling to let you know we made some money already made some already you know darcy girl youre using the same tone

planting seeds ha the boy needs a cuff on the ear did i say a word i ask you well not exactly but where do they get this idea that im scheming behind their backs i didnt drop you into his lap did i no

twilight years doesnt she yes of course its just that damn right i do she does he corrected quickly boys going to be thirty in another month or so and is he settling down to make a family he is not daniel rolled on before darcy could speak and whats so wrong with giving him a bit of a nudge id like to know if you suit him do i she murmured do i suit him im saying so and whod know better he huffed then his voice shifted became sly and persuasive hes a goodlooking young man dont you think yes i do strong stock a good brain theres a kind heart in him too and a fine sense of responsibility hes a steady one stands for his friends and his family a woman couldnt do better than my robbie no i dont see how she could were not talking about she daniel said with some impatience were talking about you youve got a spark for him now dont you darcy girl she thought of the fireworks exploding over the city the night before her spark for mac was every bit as huge and bright and volatile daniel im so desperately in love with him well now please she winced at the booming pleasure in his voice im trusting you with that because i need to tell someone why arent you telling him because i dont want to scare him off there shed said it she thought biting her lip it was no more than a plot so youre giving him some time to woo you and come around to thinking it was his idea now she winced its not really that devious its just what the devils wrong with devious devious gets the job done doesnt it i suppose her lips trembled into a smile how could she help it he cares for me i know he does but i think part of it comes from that fine sense of responsibility im willing to wait until he doesnt feel responsible dont wait too long im hoping i wont have to she smiled i have some ideas she wasnt in the market for a bauble but she rented a car buying one was going to wait until she could decide if the sports car or the sedan suited her new and developing lifestyle she secretly hoped it would be the sports car armed with maps she began the task of familiarizing herself with the city the one beyond the strip she cruised downtown noting the huge building cranes that loomed like giant hovering birds growth was everywhere from the spectacular hotel resorts to the developments that sprawled into the desert she parked and walked the malls the grocery store and drugstores giving herself a chance to observe the me that pulsed here beyond the casinos she saw children playing in yards houses tucked side by side in neighborhoods she saw schools and churches quiet streets and crowded ones she saw sprawling homes that faced the eerie peace of the desert and the tumble of rocks that made the mountains beyond she saw a life she could begin to build circling back she found a library and went inside to gather more information on the place she would make her home it was after seven when she got back to her suite pleasantly tired and more than eager to put her aching feet up she was certain shed walked twenty miles though she hadnt bought a bauble she had made an appointment to view a property the following day she thought she might become a home owner very soon there you are mac stepped up to the elevator the moment the doors opened i was getting worried im sorry i was out exploring she tossed her purse aside and started to smile but her mouth was soon busy against his he knew the sense of relief was out of proportion as was the irritation hed felt when he hadnt been able to find her anywhere in the hotel you shouldnt have gone out alone you dont know your way around responsibility she thought and wanted to sigh i got a map i thought it was time i saw a little more of the city she started to tell him about the house she planned to see the next day then held her tongue the news was hers for now she thought just as the call from new york was hers you spent some time in the sun he ran a fingertip down her nose and made her wrinkle it ill have to remember to get a hat before i turn into one big freckle the airs so hot and dry it must be murder on the skin but i really love it its easy to get dehydrated mmm youre right she walked over to take a bottle of water from behind the bar i saw people with water bottles hooked on their belts like hikers or explorers and so much building going on men in hard hats working a hundred two hundred feet in the air slot machines in the grocery store you went to a grocery store i wanted to see what it was like she said evading all this boom in the downtown area then suddenly youre in a quiet suburban neighborhood with kids and dogs in the yard and it all seems so cozily settled id have taken you around if id known you wanted to go i knew you were busy im not busy now my parents booted me out with orders to take the night off a smile curved her lips i really love your parents so do i come for a drive with me he held out a hand well find some moonlight in the distance vegas shimmered like a mirage the floor of the desert stretched in every direction barely marred by the slice of road overhead the sky was a clear dark sea studded by countless stars and graced by the floating ball of a white moon in the distant hills a coyote called and the plaintive sound carried like a bell on the air that had cooled with moonrise hed put the top down so that she could lay her head back and let starlight shower on her face wind danced lightly across the sand as they sat in silence you forget this exists when youre in there she looked toward the colors and shapes of the city the west wild and dangerous and beautiful a long way from kansas it was too easy to picture her there away from the arid wind the gaudy lights do you miss the green the fields no she didnt have to think about it theres something so powerful in the siennas and soft reds the bakedout greens and browns of this land but you didnt grow up here either she turned her head to look at him you lived back east didnt you the house is in new jersey just outside of atlantic city my parents didnt want to raise a family in hotel rooms over a casino but we spent plenty of time there duncan and i used to hunker down in the security bay over the tables before everything was electronic thats where they watched the room my mother would have skinned me if she knew id taken him up there rightfully so it must have been dangerous part of the appeal right his grin flashed and to her secret joy he began to play absently with her hair theres a story about the night one of the men fell out and landed facedown on a craps table ow was he hurt what happened rumor persists that some guy bet five dollars on his ass the game doesnt stop for much she chuckled and settled her head on his shoulder it was exciting for you being a part of all of that why did you choose to work here and not back east theres only one vegas no point in settling for less than the best her heart gave a little jerk at the sentiment spoken with such casual confidence but she ignored it is the rest of your family involved with the casinos duncans managing the riverboat it suits him down to the ground cruising along the mississippi and charming the ladies youre close yeah we are all of us geography doesnt change that gwens a doctor lives in boston as do several assorted cousins she had a baby a few months ago boy or girl a girl anna after my grandmother i have two or three hundred pictures he added with a smile if youd like to see her id love to you have another sister the youngest mel shes a live wire the eyes of an angel and the right hook of a middleweight i imagine she needed both darcy said dryly you probably teased her unmercifully no more than was my right and duty besides im the one who taught her how to punch no girlie little slaps for my baby sister i bet theyre all beautiful with heartstopping faces and killer smiles she turned her head let herself trace his mouth with her fingertip and between the looks and the breeding theyre a confident bunch the kind who walk into a room take one slow glance around and know exactly where they stand i always envied that innate sense of self i thought the word was arrogance it is but its not always a criticism did you argue all the time as often as humanly possible no one argued in my house they reasoned at least in an argument you have a chance to win ive noticed you hold your own in that area beginners luck she claimed wait until im seasoned a bit ill be a terror she grinned then ill learn how to punch in case arguing doesnt work her lips were still curved when his lowered to them the easy kiss turned dark quickly began to heat rapidly around the edges they both shifted moving into it into each other emotion surged through him so powerfully so violently that fury sprang up to tangle with need i shouldnt want you this much he dragged her head back to try to clear his own but all he could see were those dark gold eyes and what was the shadow of himself drowning in them its too damn much she remembered his words of the night before and gave them back to him take what you need ive been trying to it doesnt stop the words sent a wild thrill soaring through her recklessly she knelt on the seat beside him watched his gaze lower and follow the movement of her fingers as she unbuttoned her blouse try again she murmured he should never have touched her was all he could think because now he couldnt seem to stop he drove the long straight road back to vegas at a fast clip with darcy sleeping like a child beside him her head on his shoulder hed taken her in the front seat of the car like a hormonerattled teenager hed driven himself into her with a blind desperation as though his life had depended on it and lord help him he wanted to do it again hed broken all the rules with her a man who made his living with games knew the rules and when they could and should be ignored hed had no right to ignore them with her shed been innocent and alone and had trusted him hed let his needs and hers step ahead of that now he was so tangled up in her in what he wanted in what was right that nothing was clear he was going to have to step back there was no question of it she needed room and the chance to test those wings of hers no one had ever given her that chance including himself he could keep her he knew it she thought she loved him and he could make her go on thinking it until eventually he thought with an inner lurch that glow of hers began to fade against the neon and glitter and that light of fascinated joy dulled in her eyes keeping her would ruin her change her and eventually break her that was one gamble he wouldnt take caring for her left him only one answer he had to back away and give her a nudge in the opposite direction in the direction that was right for her he should do it quickly for her sake and yes for his own she was the only woman whod ever slipped uninvited into his mind at odd hours of the day and night he wanted to resent it but found that he was already afraid of the time that would come when she would fade into a memory and he was already furious thinking of the time when he would become little more than that to her shed think of him now and then he reflected when she was tucked into some pretty home in a greenlawned suburbia children playing at her feet a dog sleeping in the yard and a husband who wouldnt appreciate the magic of her nearly enough on his way home for dinner it was exactly where she belonged exactly where she would go once he worked up the courage to cut the ties that bound her to him ties of gratitude excitement and sex he thought and despised himself for wanting to hold her with them hed spoken no less than the truth when hed told her she didnt belong in the world he lived in he believed that absolutely she would come to the same truth once the gloss had dulled a bit virtue and sin didnt mate comfortably he glanced down as he drove along the strip and watched the carnival lights from the neon splash over her face he would have to let her go he told himself but not yet not quite yet chapter eleven contents prev next the house grew up out of the sand like a little castle fashioned of soft colors and magic shapes darcys first sight of it shot an arrow of love and longing into her heart it was tucked among palms and desert plants were scattered near the wide sunny deck the soft red of the tile roof accented the cool ivory and buffed browns of the exterior the multilevels gave it a variety of charming rooflines and made her think of artistically placed building blocks it had a tower a canny little spear that had her romantic heart picturing princesses and knights even while the practical part of her nature snagged it greedily as the perfect writing space it was already hers even before she stepped inside she barely heard the realtors professional chatter only three years old custombuilt the family moved back east its just come on the market bound to be a quick mover hmm darcy responded simply as they started up the brick walkway to the door flanked by glass etched with stars stars had been lucky for her she thought she stepped into the entrance onto the sandcolored tiles let her gaze travel up to the lofty ceiling skylights perfect it was an airy space with walls painted a cool soft yellow she would leave them alone she decided listening to her heels click on the tile as she wandered another deck stretched along the back accessed by atrium doors in a quiet blond wood no dark colors here she thought everything would be light fresh her eyes gleamed with pleasure as she looked beyond the deck to the sparkling waters of the swimming pool she let the realtor expound on the wonders of the kitchen the subzero refrigerator the custommade cabinets the granite counters and was charmed by the cozy breakfast area tucked into a bay window that was for family she thought for lazy sunday mornings and rushed school days for quiet late nights and cups of tea she would enjoy cooking here she thought studying the range the double ovens the mirror black cooktop shed always been a plain and pedestrian cook but she thought she would like experimenting with recipes with herbs sauces the maids room and laundry area off the kitchen were easily as big as her entire apartment in kansas darcy didnt miss the irony or the wonder of it shed put a trestle table in the dining room she mused that would suit the tone and go well with the small tiled fireplace for chilly desert nights watercolors for the walls soft bleeding tones shed learn how to entertain have intimate casual dinner parties as well as sparkling sophisticated ones loud bawdy backyard barbecues yes she thought she could be a good and what was better an interesting hostess she toured each of the four bedrooms checking views space approving the builders choice of randomwidth pine for the floors and the bright jazz of contrast tiles scattered in amusing patterns among the neutral colors of the baths she knew she goggled at the master suite and didnt care the twolevel area boasted its own private deck fireplace an enormous dressing area with closets large enough to live in and a bath that rivaled the one at the comanche with a lagoonsized motorized tub in an unexpected clay color the treated skylight above it cut the glare while offering a dazzling view of desert blue sky ferns she imagined in copper and brass pots crowded together all lush and green she would jumble them on the wide ledge behind the tub and every bath would be like swimming in a secluded oasis the tower was octagon shaped generous with windows the walls were cream the floor tiles the color of stone her work station would go there she decided facing the desert not a desk but a long counter perhaps in a sharp deep blue for contrast it would have dozens of drawers and cubbyholes she needed to go shopping for a computer system a fax a desktop copier reams of papers she thought with a giddy burst of joy she would put a love seat on the other side of the room and create a small seating area and shed want shelves there floor to ceiling for books and small treasures she would sit there writing hour after hour and know she was a part of everything around her the realtor had been silent for the past several minutes shed been in the game long enough to know when to sell and when to step back the potential buyer didnt have much of a poker face she mused already imagining the tidy commission its a lovely property the realtor said now a quiet settled neighborhood convenient for shopping but tucked just far away enough from the city to offer a sense of solitude she offered darcy a bright smile so what do you think darcy pulled herself back and focused on the woman im so sorry ive forgotten your name its marion marion baines oh yes ms baines marion marion i appreciate you taking the time to show me through happy to do it but she felt a little hitch in her stomach a sign of a sale slipping away it might feel a little large for your needs you did say you were single yes im single it might seem a bit overwhelming but empty houses often do youd be amazed how it all comes together when its furnished darcy had already seen it come together as she could picture it furnished perfectly in her mind ill take it oh marions smile faltered then spread wonderful im so pleased you want to make an offer if you like we can use the kitchen to fill out the paperwork and i can present your offer to the sellers this afternoon i said id take it ill pay the asking price you well something in that fresh face and youthful eyes had her hesitating even as she ordered herself to keep her mouth shut and close the deal she found herself speaking ms wallace darcy im contracted to represent the sellers but i realize this is the first time youve bought property i feel obligated to mention that its usual to make an offer of somewhat less than the asking price the sellers may accept it or counter yes i know but why shouldnt they get what they want she smiled and turned back to gaze out the window im going to it was so simple really she discovered a few forms to be filled out papers to be signed a check to be written earnest money it was called darcy liked the sound of it she was very earnest about the house she listened as home loans were explained to her fixed interest rates balloon payments mortgage insurance then decided to keep it simple and pay cash when the settlement date was set she breezed out to her rented car thrilled by the knowledge that in thirty short days she would have a home the minute she was back in her suite she grabbed the phone she knew she had to call caine ask him to represent her interests in the settlement or recommend a local real estate lawyer she needed to choose an insurance company and take out a home owners policy she wanted to shop for furniture to pick out dishes and linens and oh shed forgotten to measure the windows for the plantation blinds she wanted but first she wanted to share her news and excitement is mac mr blade available she asked when macs assistant answered the phone its darcy wallace hello ms wallace im sorry mr blades in a meeting may i take a message oh no thank you if you could just tell him i called she hung up deflated as the image in her head of driving him out to the house and telling him it was hers faded it would have to wait she buried herself in work instead pushing herself toward the end of the book if her luck held and the agent shed contacted wanted to see more she intended to be ready when two hours had passed and he hadnt returned her call she resisted the urge to pick up the phone again she made herself coffee then spent another hour tweaking an earlier chapter when the phone rang she pounced hello darcy deb said you called earlier yes i wondered if you could spare an hour theres something i want to show you there was a hesitation a humming kind of silence that had her shifting in her chair im sorry im tied up here in his office mac sat at his desk and realized the first step away was the hardest im not going to have any time for you oh you must be busy i am if anythings wrong i can send the hotel manager or the concierge up no nothings wrong the cool formality of his voice made her shudder nothing at all it can wait if you have time tomorrow ill let you know all right i have to go talk to you later she stared at the phone in her hand for several seconds before replacing it slowly on the hook hed seemed so distant so different hadnt that been mild irritation in his voice an underlying impatience no she was imagining things finding her hands gripped tightly together she swore at herself and separated them he was just busy she told herself shed interrupted his work people hated to be interrupted it was her own sense of disappointment which was foolish that was making her overreact to a very natural incident hed spent the whole of last evening with her she remembered had made wild almost desperate love to her under the stars no one could need a woman so much in the night then flick her off like a pesky gnat the next day of course they could she admitted and pressed her fingers to her eyes it was naive even stupid to pretend it couldnt and didnt happen but not with mac he was too kind too honest and she loved him far far too much he was just busy she insisted shed taken up huge amounts of his time over the past two weeks naturally he would need to catch up to concentrate on business to take some breathing room she wasnt going to sulk about it darcy straightened her shoulders tucked the chair back in place she would concentrate on work herself and take advantage of what was going to be a long solitary evening she worked for another six hours remembering to turn on the lights only when she realized she was working in the dark she drained the pot of coffee and found herself stunned when she came to the end of her book finished beginning middle and end it was all there now she thought giddily all inside this clever little machine and copied onto a small slim disc to celebrate she opened a bottle of champagne though it was a bit of a struggle and drank an entire glass with reckless abandon she poured a second and took it to the desk with her to start refining the draft she put in twelve hours and went through half a bottle of the wine which she counteracted with more coffee it was hardly a wonder that when she finally tumbled into bed she was chased by odd and jumbled dreams she saw herself in the tower of her new house alone all alone and crowded there by mountains of papers and an enormous computer through the window she could see dozens of scenes flip by like a fast forward through a movie parties and people children playing couples embracing the noise laughter and music was muffled by the glass that surrounded her when she pounded on it no one heard her no one saw her no one cared she was in the casino sitting at the blackjack table but she couldnt add up her cards couldnt calculate the math didnt know what to do hit or stand serena elegant in a mannish tux watched her impassively hit or stand she repeated you have to make the choice then deal with it she doesnt know how to play mac stepped up beside her gave her a brotherly pat on the head you dont know the rules do you but she did she did it was just that she couldnt seem to add the cards there was so much at stake didnt they understand how much was at stake never bet more than you can afford to lose mac told her with a cool smile the house always has the edge then she was alone again stumbling along the arrowstraight road through the desert and the lights and colors of vegas were trapped behind the rippling waves of heat floating there no matter how far she walked she couldnt get any closer dust rose in a cloud as mac drove up his hair streaming in the wind youre going in the wrong direction but she wasnt she was going home he reached out touched her cheek in an absent avuncular gesture that made her cringe you dont belong here yes i do her own furious shout woke her sitting up in bed she was stunned by the raw and genuine extent of her anger she seethed with it forced herself to take deep calming breaths the sun was bright on her face because shed forgotten to draw the drapes the night before no more bedtime champagne for you darcy she muttered rubbing her face as if to rub away the edges of the dreams noting it was already nine she gave in to impulse and grabbed the phone serena answered on the second ring its darcy i hope im not calling too early no justin and i are just having our first cup of coffee are you busy today i dont have to be what did you have in mind darcy stood back nervously twisting her fingers as serena walked through the first floor of the house i know this might seem sudden darcy began its the only one i looked at but i had a picture in my head of what i wanted and this this was even better than that its serena turned a last curie then smiled beautiful it suits you so well i think youve made a perfect choice really really swamped with joy darcy steepled her hands at her mouth i was afraid youd think i was crazy theres nothing crazy about wanting a home of your own or investing in excellent property oh i wanted to show someone so badly i raced back yesterday as soon as id signed the contract i wanted to show mac but he was busy and well she moved her shoulders and stepped away before she could see serenas troubled frown as far as serena knew her son hadnt been any busier the day before than normal you told him you bought a house but he didnt have time to come out and take a look no i just told him there was something i wanted him to see i guess its silly but i wanted him to see it first please dont tell him about it no i wont darcy why did you decide to buy a house here in vegas that her response was instant as she walked over to the doorway to gaze out at the desert it pulls at me for some people its water for some its mountains or its big bustling cities for me its the desert i had no idea until i got here and then i knew glowing with pleasure she turned back and i love the strip the fantasy of it the magic and the snap in the air that says anything can happen everything does happen everybody needs a place dont you think that makes them believe they could accomplish something there even if its nothing more than being happy yes i do think that and im glad you found it still she crossed the room brushed a hand over darcys hair but it has to do with mac too doesnt it when darcy didnt answer serena smiled softly darling i can see how you feel about him i cant help being in love with him of course you cant why should you but is the house for him darcy it could be she murmured but its for me first it has to be i need a home i need a place thats what im doing here i know i cant expect him to feel about me the way i do about him but im willing to gamble if i lose at least ill know i played the game no more watching from behind the window she murmured my moneys on you darcys grin flashed like sunlight i ought to tell you that ive fallen in love with macs family too oh baby serena wrapped her close rubbing cheeks and reminded herself she hadnt raised any idiots mac would come to his senses soon show me the rest of the house yes and i was hoping you could go with me to look at furniture i thought youd never ask darcy was glad to be busy to have so many details juggling for space in her mind colors fabrics lamps should she convert the smallest bedroom into a library or would the downstairs den suit that purpose best did she want ficus trees flanking the doorway on the main level or palms every decision was monumentally important to her and a giddy delight though she yearned to share them all with mac theyd had no time alone together for two days he was putting all his efforts into keeping his mind occupied and off her time hed decided and space were what both of them needed to ease back far enough and analyze their relationship he missed her miserably freedom was undoubtedly what she needed he told himself he paced his office giving up on the idea of work she hadnt called him again and from the information hed discreetly drawn from the staff shed been spending nearly as much time out of the hotel as in it flexing those fairy wings he imagined he hadnt let her do that not really hed carried her along deluding himself initially that he was helping her then justifying the rest because hed wanted her and still wanted her shed come into his life lost and wounded and desperate for affection hed taken advantage of that it hardly mattered what his motives were the results were the same he imagined she believed herself in love with him the idea had crossed his mind more than once to take advantage of that as well to keep her for himself to see that she went on believing it as long as possible after all she had no experience no man had touched her before he had touched her shed tumbled from a sheltered existence into a dazzling fantasy world he could sweep her along in that world keep her dazzled and his it would be easy and unforgivable he cared far too much to trap her to clip those wings and watch the innocence tarnish her life was just beginning he reminded himself and his was already set then she burst into his office her eyes huge her cheeks wax pale im sorry im sorry i know youre busy i know i shouldnt disturb you but but what is it are you hurt he had his hands on her in one thumping heartbeat no no she shook her head frantically clutched at his shirt im okay no im not okay i dont know what i am i sold my book i sold my book sold it oh god im dizzy sold it take slow breaths come on slow and deep thats it i thought the book wasnt finished the other one the one last year she said the new one too both of them giving up she dropped her forehead to his chest i need a minute i cant think straight then she jerked her head up again laughing wildly its like sex maybe i should have a cigarette have a seat instead no i cant sit down id bounce right off the chair they bought the book no the books twobook contract can you imagine i beat the odds again who bought the book darcy and how oh okay she gulped in another breath a few days ago i got a call from an editor in new york eminence publishing shed seen me on the news and she asked me to send her some of my work a few days ago the stab of disappointment was sharp and sudden you never mentioned it i wanted to wait until i had an answer boy have i got one now she pressed her fingers to her eyes as tears swam close im not going to cry not yet i picked an agent off my list i knew the publisher only wanted to see my work because of the publicity but there was a chance theyd like it so i hired an agent over the phone yes the obvious disapproval in his tone made her sigh i know it was risky but i didnt want to wait the agent called this morning and said theyd made an offer a very decent offer then she advised me to turn it down as if that part were just sinking in darcy pressed a hand to her stomach i couldnt believe it i had a chance like this what ive wanted all my life and she said to say no why thats what i asked her she said darcy closed her eyes reliving the moment she said i had a strong talent that i told a powerful story and they were going to have to pay more for it if they balked she told me she would take the book to auction she believed in me so i took the chance ten minutes ago they bought them both now i think ill sit down she all but slid into a chair im so happy for you darcy he crouched in front of her so proud of you all my life i wanted this no one ever believed in me she let the tears come now be sensible darcy keep your feet on the ground and i always was i always did because i never thought i was good enough for more youre good enough for anything he murmured more than good enough she shook her head i always wanted to be when i was in school i worked so hard both my parents were teachers and i knew how important it was to them but no matter how much i put into it i brought home bs instead of as theyd look at my report card and thered be this silent little sigh theyd tell me id done well but i could do better if i just worked harder i couldnt do better just couldnt it was the best i could do but it was never good enough they were wrong they didnt mean to be so critical they just didnt understand wanting the anchor she held tight to his hands i used to show them the stories id write just once wanting them to be impressed enthusiastic it just wasnt in them so i stopped showing them and i stopped looking for their approval at least outwardly she sighed wiped at her face with her fingers i never sent off the first book couldnt find the courage to i suppose inside i was always hoping waiting for someone to tell me i was good enough now ive done it and someone has here he pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and pressed it into her hands im not sad she sniffled mopped at her face theres just so much going on inside me so many things have been happening i had to tell you im glad you did news like this cant wait he framed her face in his hands and after a brief internal struggle pressed his lips to her forehead rather than her mouth well have to celebrate he let his hands linger on her face a moment then dropped them and rose well get together for drinks and you can tell me your plans plans youll want to fly into new york for a few days i imagine meet your publisher your agent yes maybe next week so soon he thought and suffered as he looked down at her tearstreaked face and made the break youll be missed around here he said lightly i hope youll keep in touch let us know where you settle settle but im coming back here here he lifted a brow then smiled darcy as delighted as weve been to have you you cant keep living in a high rollers suite he laughed a little and sat on the edge of his desk a high roller youre not youre more than welcome to stay until you finalize your travel plans he was running a business she thought frantically shed been taking advantage of his generosity occupying an expensive suite for two weeks i hadnt thought im sorry ill book another room when i get back until darcy theres no reason for you to come back here of course there is her heart began to flutter hard in her throat i live here the comanches not your home its mine he wasnt smiling now and his eyes had gone cool and hard it was the only way he could face the stunned hurt on her face its time for you to start your own life and you cant do that here youve accomplished something really extraordinary now enjoy it you dont want me anymore youre not just kicking me out of your hotel youre kicking me out of your life no ones kicking you out of anything no she managed a half laugh and balled the handkerchief in her fist how stupid do you think i am youve been avoiding me for days youve barely touched me since i came in the room now youre giving me a little pat on the head and telling me to run along and have a nice life i do want you to have a nice life he began as long as its somewhere else she retorted well thats too bad because im having my life here i bought a house hed prepared himself for a miserable scene for tears for recriminations but he was stunned speechless what you bought what i bought a house have you lost your mind a house here what were you thinking of myself its a new concept for me and i like it you dont buy a damn house the way you do a new dress im not the bubblebrain you apparently think i am i know how to buy a house and ive done it you have no business buying a house in vegas oh really her emotions were careering so fast she didnt know how her words could keep pace do you own the entire city and its environs now well i seem to have found the one little spot you dont have control over i like it here and im staying life is not an endless cruise down the strip and vegas is not only the strip its the fastest growing city in the country and one of the most livable it has an excellent school system job opportunities abound and the housing is very affordable waters a problem and thats an issue thats going to have to be seriously addressed in the near future however the crime rate is markedly low in comparison with other major cities and the areas continuing ability to reinvent itself gives it high marks for potential into the next century she paused her eyes glittering when he said nothing im a writer i was a librarian i damn well know how to research did your research mention how many pawnshops are in vegas per square mile did it touch on prostitution corruption money laundering gambling addictions actually it did she said evenly now sin exists it may shock you to know i was aware of it before i came here you simply havent thought this through youre wrong absolutely wrong i didnt buy this house blind and i didnt buy it so i could keep falling at your feet i bought it for me she said fiercely because i found something i always wanted and never expected to have but dont worry vegas is big enough so that i wont get in your way wait a minute damn it he muttered and put a hand on her shoulder to turn her but she spun around lifting both hands with a look in her eye that warned him to keep his distance dont i dont need placating and i dont intend to cause a scene im grateful to you and i dont want to forget that i fully intend to have a relationship with your parents your family and dont want to put them or you in a position that makes that difficult but you hurt me she said quietly and you didnt have to she walked to the door shut it firmly behind her chapter twelve contents prev so we agree to forgive two million of harisuki and tanakas baccarat losses justin lounged in the wide leather chair pretending he didnt notice his sons inattention that puts them into the casino for ten and twelve million respectively we comp the rooms the meals the bar bills and cover their wives spending spree in the boutique theyll be back he said drawing idly on his cigar and theyll drop the next several million right here instead of across the street you arranged for the limo for them tomorrow he waited a beat mac what yes its taken care of good now that weve finished all that up you can tell me whats on your mind nothing in particular do you want a beer justin indicated assent with a wave of his hand we always had to pry problems out of you your determination to handle everything yourself is admirable but its annoying he smiled cheerfully at his son and accepted the cold brown bottle however in this case prying isnt necessary trouble with darcy no yes no mac repeated and blew out a breath she sold her book actually she sold two books thats wonderful she must be thrilled why arent you i am im happy for her its what shes always wanted i dont think i realized how much she wanted it this will give her a whole new direction is that whats worrying you she wont need you anymore no the whole issue is for her to move ahead with her life this was just some breathing space for her was it mac are you in love with her thats not the point its the only point that counts im wrong for her this place is wrong for her restless he stalked to the window staring out at the carnival of neon and colored fountains once she focuses shell see that why are you wrong for her it seemed to me you complemented each other very well i run a casino my peak hours are when sensible people are tucked into their beds he jammed his hands into his pockets shes lived a sheltered life more a repressed one where shes been held back held down shes just starting to realize what she can do and be and have i dont have any right to interfere with that youre making this blackandwhite sinner and saint i dont think either of you qualify youre a businessman and a good one shes an interesting refreshingly enthusiastic young woman who walked in here a few weeks ago mac reminded him a few weeks ago and at a turning point in her life she cant possibly know what her feelings are you underestimate her but regardless arent your own feelings important ive already let my feelings take over more than once she walked in here untouched mac turned back his eyes swirling and dark i changed that i should have kept my hands off her but i didnt i couldnt now youre going to punish yourself for being human justin concluded youre going to deny yourself a relationship that makes you happy and your reasoning is shell be better off shes dazzled mac insisted wondering why saying it all out loud this way made it sound so wrong and so foolish and only seeing what she wants to see she bought a house for gods sake yes i know and you know mac stared at his father she took your mother to see it the day after she signed the contract i went to see it myself its a fine piece of property an intriguing attractive home its ludicrous to buy a house in a place youve only been for a few weeks and when youve spent most of that time in a hotel casino shes living in a fantasy land no shes not she knows exactly what she wants and im surprised you dont realize that if you dont want her thats a different matter i cant stop wanting her it was like an ache that couldnt be eased i was sure i could wantings easy the first time i saw your mother i wanted her that was as natural as breathing but loving her terrified me sometimes it still does surprised mac lowered to a chair you make that part look easy too you always have youre so matched he decided is that the problem justin leaned over put his hand over macs no not a problem its just that marriages work in our family the odds are against it but they work for us he studied the gold band on his fathers finger thirty years he thought and it still fit that was a kind of miracle i figure they work because were careful to find a mate in the literal sense of the word a match youre seeing your mother and i as a set something that came that way its not true we were a halfbreed excon whod gotten lucky and the privileged daughter of wealthy indulgent parents long odds mac on a pair like that but you were heading in the same direction justin leaned back again eyes sharp the hell we were what we did was beat a new path and there were plenty of bumps along the way youre telling me ive made a mistake mac murmured and maybe youre right he ran his hand over his face im not sure anymore you want guarantees there arent any loving a womans the riskiest game in town you either put up your stake or you back away from the table but if you back away you never win is she the woman you want yes ill ask you again are you in love with her yes admitting it intensified the ache and yes its terrifying sympathizing justin smiled what do you want to do about it i want her back he let out a long breath ive got to get her back how bad have you screwed it up pretty bad it made him slightly ill to realize just how poorly hed played his hand i all but shoved her out the door it may take some fast talk to get her to open her side of that door again so ill talk fast misery vanished in a spurt of reckless energy it was a new hand he thought fresh cards and everything he had was going into the pot id better go down and try to work this out with her she must be sitting in her room miserable when she should be out celebrating i think you lose on that one justin murmured studying the screens theres a pair of starshaped diamond earrings in the jewelry store downstairs mac checked his pocket to make certain he had his passkey for the elevator just in case she should have something special to celebrate selling her book he was suddenly nervous a sensation he wasnt accustomed to do you think the earrings and flowers are overkill justin ran his tongue around his teeth i dont think you can ever overkill in a situation like this but youre not going to find darcy in her room hmm you better take a look screen three second craps table from the left anxious to be on his way mac glanced absently at the screen then looked again his wounded fairy was decked out in that little killer of a red dress with spiked heels to match and was blowing on a pair of dice what the hell is she doing going for an eight thats her point five and a three he said and grinned when he heard his son slam the door on his way out the lady wins come on baby come on doll bring it home the man cheering beside darcy was old enough to be her father so she didnt mind the little pat he gave her butt she took it as a goodluck wish she shook the dice in her hand leaned over the long table and let them fly cheers roared out and money and chips changed hands too quickly for her to follow seven all right she pumped a fist in the air after raking in her pile of chips she began recklessly distributing them again this on the point and this um behind fives my point roll em blondie the man on the other side of her plunked a hundreddollar bill on the table youre hot damn right i am she sent the dice tumbling squinting through the smoke and howled with triumph when the ivories came up three and two i dont know why i thought this game was so hard she grinned then gulped from the fresh glass of champagne someone handed her hold this will you she shoved the glass at the buttpatter and picked up the dice let mine ride she told the croupier god i love saying that she tossed the dice then danced on threeinch heels mac had to elbow his way through a crowd gathered four deep his first sight of her was a tight little butt molded into clinging red he caught her elbow just after her toss and his words were swallowed by the roar of players and onlookers what the hell do you think youre doing she tossed back her head drunk on victory im kicking your ass back up and give me room so i can kick it some more he snagged her wrist as she leaned over to scoop up the dice cash in the hell i will im smoking come on pal let the lady roll mac merely turned his head and iced down the eager player on the corner of the table with a look cash her in he ordered the croupier then dragged darcy through the bitter complaints of the crowd you cant make me stop playing when im on a streak youre wrong this is my place and i can make anybody stop playing anytime the house has the edge fine she jerked her arm free ill take my business elsewhere and im let them know the management at the comanche cant hold up under a run of honest luck darcy come upstairs we need to talk dont tell me what i need to do she pulled away again sharply almost pleased when heads turned and attention zeroed in on them i told you i wouldnt cause a scene but i will if you push me you can kick me out of your casino and you can kick me out of your hotel but you cant tell me what i need to do im asking you he said with what he considered amazing patience to come with me so we can discuss this privately and im telling you im not interested okay the hard way he scooped her up and over his shoulder hed taken ten strides before she broke through the shock and began to struggle let go of me you cant treat me this way you made your choice he said grimly and ignored the stunned looks of guests and staff as he carted her to the elevator i dont want to talk to you im already packed im leaving in the morning just let me go the hell i will he keyed in her floor then dumped her back on her feet youve got a stubborn streak in you and im he broke off when her fist punched into his stomach it didnt do much more than bounce off and cause him to lift a coolly amused brow well have to work on that conceding that she was outgunned darcy folded her arms when the doors opened into her suite she sailed out this may be your place but this is my room until morning and i dont want you in it we need to straighten things out things are perfectly straight thank you just the same darcy you dont understand she shoved away the hands hed laid on her shoulders thats just it isnt it you dont think i understand anything you think im a fluffbrained idiot who doesnt know how to take care of herself i dont think youre an idiot but fluffbrained just the same she countered well im sharp enough to know that you got tired of me and your solution was to brush me off like an irritating child tired of you at the end of his rope he dragged his hands through his hair i know i made a mess of it let me explain theres nothing to explain you dont want me fine im not going to jump off a roof over it she jerked a shoulder and turned away im young im rich i have my career to think of and youre not the only man in the world just a damn minute you were the first she shot a searing look over her shoulder that doesnt mean you have to be the last which had been one of his points exactly one of the reasons hed been so determined to step away but hearing it from her seeing that hot female look in her eyes had a rage bubbling up in him so violently it hazed his vision watch your step darcy ive watched it all my life and im finished i like leaping before i look and so far im landing on my feet if and when i fall itll be my problem and no one elses panic skidded up his spine because he could see she meant it she could do it would do it you know damn well youre in love with me her heart toppled and cracked because i slept with you please however derisive her words her fingers had linked together and twisted it was just enough of a tell for him to call her bluff you wouldnt have slept with me if you hadnt been in love with me if i held you right now if i put my mouth on yours youd tell me without saying a word every defense crumbled you knew and you used it maybe i did ive had a hard time with that and made more mistakes because i couldnt get past it are you guilty or angry mac wearily she turned away again you broke my heart id have given it to you on a platter it wasnt even enough for you not to want it you ignored it i told myself i was doing it for you for me a laugh choked out well that was considerate of you darcy he reached out but her shoulders rounded as she cringed away an ache sliced through him as he dropped his hands again i wont touch you but at least look at me what do you want from me do you want me to say its all right that i understand i wont hold it against you its not all right her breath hitched in a sob that was brutal to control i dont understand and im trying not to hold it against you you werent obligated to feel what i felt that was my gamble but in the end you could have been kind if id trusted my feelings we wouldnt be having this conversation and i dont want to have it here when a hunch came this sudden and strong he knew to ride it out i want to see your house what id like very much to see your house now now she passed a hand over her eyes its late im tired i dont have the keys whats the name of the realtor do you have a card yes on the desk but good to her confusion he walked to the phone dialed the number and in less than two minutes was on a firstname basis with marion baines and jotting down her address shell give us the keys mac told darcy when he hung up shouldnt take more than twenty minutes to get to her place youre a powerful man she said dryly whats the point of this take a chance he smiled in challenge leap before you look do you want a jacket she refused one and would have refused to go with him if she hadnt wanted one scrap of pride to take with her they didnt speak she thought that was best perhaps somehow this quiet drive would settle the nerves and let them part if not as friends with some respect for each other he seemed to know his way he picked up the keys without incident then easily wove toward the outskirts where her house stood a soft silhouette under the slowly waning moon trust you he murmured scanning the shape you found a castle after all it nearly made her smile thats what i thought when i saw it thats how i knew it was mine ask me in youve got the keys she noted and opened her door he waited until shed rounded the hood then held the keys out to her ask me in darcy she fought the urge to snatch the keys from him telling herself he was trying to do what he could to make the situation less miserable she accepted the keys and started up the walk ive never been in it at night there are floodlights in both the house and yard he thought about her out there alone at night is there a security system yes i have the code she unlocked the door and turned directly to a small box beside it she disengaged the alarm then switched on the lights he said nothing but walked through much as his mother had done but in this case the silence unnerved her ive been looking at furniture found many pieces that i like its a lot of space ive discovered i like a lot of space shed put plants on the decks he imagined cheerful pots full of lush green and delicate blossoms shed baby shed want soft colors inside cool and soothing with the occasional flash to shake things up it amazed him how clearly he could imagine it and how easy it was to know her after so little time he switched on the outside lights and watched them flood the blue water of the pool and the rippling sea of the desert beyond it was stunning powerful and in its own way calm as the night sky maybe hed lost sight of this he mused this other side of the world from where hed chosen to live and because of that had refused to accept her place there this is what you want yes this is what i want the tower youll write there she ached a little because he would know yes we never celebrated he turned back she was standing in the center of the empty room her hands linked her eyes shadowed my fault i need you to know darcy how happy i am for you and how sorry i am i spoiled the moment guilt she thought he was too kind a man not to feel it it doesnt matter it matters he corrected a great deal id like to try to explain id like you to try to see it from my viewpoint you fell into my arms literally the first time i saw you you were alone lonely a little desperate completely vulnerable and impossibly appealing i wanted you too much too quickly im good at resisting temptation thats why im good at what i do but i couldnt resist you you didnt seduce me you didnt force me it was a mutual attraction but it wasnt an even hand he stepped toward her relieved when she didnt back away i took you because i wanted you because i could because i needed to knowing youd want and need more deserved more but i didnt intend to give it to you it was a chance i took you told me flat out before we were lovers you didnt have marriage on your mind i didnt fall in bed with you blindly he paused a moment surprised you gambled on me changing my mind the odds might have been long that youd fall in love with me but they werent infinitesimal the edge had come back into her voice your grandfather thinks im perfect for you so does your mother he very nearly choked you talked to my mother i love your mother she said passionately and i have a perfect right to have someone to talk to i didnt mean it that way im getting off the track he said with a sigh the way i saw it you needed a little time to settle to explore the possibilities to have some fun and indulge yourself so youd gamble a little spend some money take a few rides discover sex so you were what tutoring me how much more insulting can you possibly be im not trying to insult you im trying to tell you what i believed and that i was wrong you havent begun to say you were wrong yet maybe you should get started youve got a nasty streak he dipped his hands into his pockets i never noticed it before ive been saving it up so the little country mouse comes to the big city and the clever city mouse lets her taste a bit of sin then shows her the door before she damns her soul to perdition is that close enough a long wide nasty streak you were alone and afraid and over your head and you tossed me a float shut up patience straining he gripped her arms nobody ever gave you a choice you said so yourself no one gave you a chance no one let you bloom god darcy youve done nothing but bloom since you got here since you had that chance that choice how was i supposed to take that choice away from you youve never been anywhere else youve never been with anyone else i wasnt going to watch you living in a hotel wandering through a casino locking yourself to me because you didnt know any better and thats your way of giving me a choice funny thats just the kind of choice people have been giving me all my life i know im sorry so am i she lifted her hands to his arms and pushed until he released her are we finished no not yet oh whats the point of this she strode away from him her sassy shoes clicking on the tiles why do you want a tour of the place now do we pretend were pals what are we doing here i wanted to finish this here because its not my place its yours he waited until she turned back the house always has the advantage i dont know what youre talking about my father told me something tonight id never considered he said wanting is easy but loving is terrifying his eyes stayed locked on hers you terrify me darcy right down to the bone he watched as she wrapped her arms tight around her body when i look at you im scared senseless dont do this its not fair i tried to be fair and all i did was hurt you and make myself miserable im playing a new hand now and when the house has the edge i cant afford to play fair theres no point in backing away he said when she did just that ill only keep coming after you you brought this on yourself id have let you go he caught her ran his hands from her shoulders to her wrists then back again youre trembling scared he touched his lips to the comer of hers that must mean you still love me her breath was hot in her chest tangling in her throat i wont have you feeling sorry for me i dont the kiss was sudden and violent her heart slammed once twice hard against her ribs then began a wild and unsteady beat is that what you think this is this feels like pity to you he took her mouth again diving deep damn this dress drives me crazy i could have killed every man at that table tonight just for looking at you ill have to buy you a dozen more like it youre not making sense i dont know what youre saying i love you this time her heart took one high joyful leap you do i love everything about you he lifted her hands pressed them to his lips then gently untangled her fingers and im asking you to buck the odds and give me another chance her lips trembled then curved im a big believer in another chance i was counting on it this time he kissed her gently easing her into his arms but youre going to have to let me move in here here she was floating drifting close to dreaming you want to live here well i figure this is where youll want to raise the kids kids her dazzled eyes flew open again you want kids dont you he smiled when her head bobbed up and down i like big families and coming from one im a traditionalist if were going to make kids together you have to marry me mac it was all she could say just his name nothing else would get through willing to risk it darcy he lifted her hands again pressed them to his heart want to take a gamble on us his heart beat under her hands and was no steadier than hers it so happens she said with a brilliant smile im on a hot streak he laughed scooped her off her feet in one wide dizzying circle so ive heard
