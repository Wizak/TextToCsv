the great publishing companies of ursa minor it is about the size of a paperback book but looks more like a large pocket calculator having upon its face over a hundred flat pressbuttons and a screen about four inches square upon which any one of over six million pages can be summoned almost instantly it comes in a durable plastic cover upon which the words dont panic are printed in large friendly letters there are no known copies of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy on this planet at this time this is not its story it is however the story of a book also called at a very high level of improbability the hitchhikers guide to tbe galaxy of the radio series that started it all the fivebook trilogy it comprises the computer game towel and television series that it in its turn has spawned to tell the story of the book and the radio series and the towel it is best to tell the story of some of the minds behind it foremost among these is an apedescended human from the planet earth although at the time our story starts he no more knows his destiny which will include international travel computers an almost infinite number of lunches and becoming mindbogglingly rich than an olive knows how to mix a pan galactic gargle blaster his name is douglas adams he is six foot five inches tall and he is about to have an idea the hitchhikers guide to europe the idea in question bubbled into douglas adamss mind quite spontaneously in a field in innsbruck he no longer has any personal memory of it having happened but its the story he tells and if there can be such a thing its the beginning if you have to take a flag reading the story starts here and stick it into the story then there is no other place to put it it was and the eighteenyearold douglas adams was hitchhiking his way across europe with a copy of the hitchhikers guide to europe that he had stolen he hadnt bothered borrowing a copy of europe on a day he didnt have that kind of money he was drunk he was povertystricken he was too poor to afford a room at a youth hostel the entire story is told at length in his introduction to the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy a trilogy in four parts in england and the hitchhikers trilogy in the us and he wound up at the end of a harrowing day flat on his back in a field in innsbruck staring up at the stars somebody he thought somebody really ought to write a hitchhikers guide to the galaxy he forgot about the idea shortly thereafter five years later while he was struggling to think of a legitimate reason for an alien to visit earth the phrase returned to him the rest is history and will be told in this book the field in innsbruck has since been transformed into an unremarkable section of autobahn when youre a student or whatever and you cant afford a car or a plane fare or even a train fare all you can do is hope that someone will stop and pick you up at the moment we cant afford to go to other planets we dont have the ships to take us there there may be other people out there i dont have any opinions about life out therei just dont know but its nice to think that one could even here and now be whisked away just by hitchhiking douglas adams dna deoxyribonucleic acid commonly known as dna is the fundamental genetic building block for all living creatures the structure of dna was discovered and unravelled along with its significance in cambridge england in and announced to the world in march this was not the first dna to appear in cambridge however a year earlier on the th march douglas noel adams was born in a former victorian workhouse in cambridge his mother was a nurse his father a postgraduate theology student who was training for holy orders but gave it up when his friends managed to persuade him it was a terrible idea his parents moved from cambridge when he was six months old and divorced when he was five at that time douglas was considered a little strange possibly even retarded he had only just learned to talk and i was the only kid who anybody i knew has ever seen actually walk into a lamppost with his eyes wide open everybody assumed that there must be something going on inside because there sure as hell didnt seem to be anything going on on the outside douglas was a solitary child he had few close friends and one sister susan three years younger than he was in september he started at brentwood school in essex where he stayed until he says of the school we tended to produce a lot of media trendies me griff rhys jones noel edmunds simon bell who wrote the novelisation for griff and mel smiths famous nonaward winning movie morons from outer space hes not a megastar yet but he gives great parties a lot of the people who designed the amstrad computer were at brentwood as well but we had a very major lack of archbishops prime ministers and generals he was not particularly happy at school most of his memories having to do with basically trying to get off games although he was quite good at cricket and swimming he was terrible at football and diabolically bad at rugby the first time i ever played it i broke my own nose on my knee its quite a trick especially standing up they could never work out at school whether i was terribly clever or terribly stupid i always had to understand everything fully before i was prepared to say anything he was a tall and gawky child selfconscious of his height my last year at prep school we had to wear short trousers and i was so absurdly lanky and looked so ridiculous that my mother applied for special permission for me to wear long trousers and they said no pointing out i was just about to go into the main school i went to the main school and was allowed to wear long trousers at which point we discovered they didnt have any long enough for me so for the first term i still had to go to school in short trousers his ambitions at that time had more to do with the sciences than the arts at the age when most kids wanted to be firemen i wanted to be a nuclear physicist i never made it because my arithmetic was too bad i was good at maths conceptually but lousy at arithmetic so i didnt specialise in the sciences if i had known what they were i would have liked to be a software engineer but they didnt have them then his hobbies revolved around making model aeroplanes i had a big display on top of a chest of drawers at home there was a large old mirror that stood behind them and one day the mirror fell forward and crushed the lot of them i never made a model plane after that i was upset distraught for days it was this mindless blow that fate had dealt me playing the guitar and reading i didnt read as much as looking back i wish i had done and not the right things either when i have children ill do as much to encourage them to read as possible you know like hit them if they dont i read biggles and captain w e johnss famous science fiction series i particularly remember a book called quest for the perfect planet a major influence that was there was an author called eric leyland who nobody else ever seems to have heard of he had a hero called david flame who was the james bond of the tenyearolds but when i should have been packing in the old dickens i was reading eric leyland instead but there you go you can tell kids can you douglas was also an avid reader of eagle at that time britains top childrens comic and home of dan dare dan dare drawn by artist frank hampson was a science fiction strip detailing the banle between jutjawed space pilot dare his comic sidekick digby and the evil green mekon it was in eagle that douglas first saw print he had two letters published there at the age of eleven and was paid the enormous sum of ten shillings each for them the short story shows a certain precocious talent of alice in wonderland often cited as an influence he says i read or rather had read to me alice in wonderland as a child and i hated it it really frightened me some months ago i tried to go back to it and read a few pages and i thought this is jolly good stuff but still if it wasnt for that slightly nightmarish quality that i remember as a kid idve enjoyed it but i couldnt shake that feeling so although people like to suggest that carroll was a big influence using the number and all that he really was not the first time that douglas ever thought seriously about writing was at the age of ten there was a master at school called halford every thursday after break we had an hours class called composition we had to write a story and i was the only person dirk look at tif eagle merrygoround eagle and boys world february short story london transporrt lost property office this is it said mr smith looking in at the window as he went in he tripped over the little step and almost crashed through the glass door that could be dangerous i must remember it when i go out he muttered can i help you asked the lostproperty officer yes i lost something on the bus yesterday well what was it you lost asked the officer im afraid i cant remember said mr smith well i cant help you then said the exasperated officer was anything found on the bus asked mr smith im afraid not but can you remember anything about this thing said the officer desperately tryting to be helpful yes i can remember that it was a very bad whateveritwas anything else ah yes now i come to think of it it was something like a sieve said mr smith and he put his elbow on the highly polished counter and rested his chin oon his hands suddenly his chin met the counter with a resounding crack but before the officer could assist him up mr smith jumped triumphantly into the air thank you very much he said what for said the officer ive found it said mr smith found what my memory said mr smith and he turned round tripped over the step and smashed through the glass door dnadams brentwood essex who ever got ten out of ten for a story ive never forgotten that and the odd thing is i was talking to someone who has a kid in the same class and apparently they were all grumbling about how mr halford never gave out decent marks for stories and he told them i did once the only person i ever gave ten out of ten to was douglas adams he remembers as well i was pleased by that whenever im stuck on a writers block and just sit there and cant think of anythingi think ah but i once did get ten out of ten in a way it gives me more of a boost than having sold a million copies of this or a million of that i think i got ten out of ten once his writing career was not always that successful i dont know when the first thoughts of writing came but it was actually quite early on rather silly thoughts really as there was nothing to suggest that i could actually do it all of my life ive been attracted by the idea of being a writer but like all writers i dont so much like writing as having written i came across some old school literary magazines a couple of years ago and i went through them to go back and find the stuff was writing then but i couldnt find anything id written which puzzled me until remembered that each time i meant to try to write something id miss the deadline by two weeks he appeared in school plays and discovered a love of performing i was a slightly strange actor there tended to be things i could do well and other things i couldnt begin to doi couldnt do dwarves for example i had a lot of trouble with dwarf parts then while watching the frost report one evening his ambitions of a life wellspent as a nuclear physicist eminent surgeon or professor of english began to evaporate douglass attention was caught by sixfoot fiveinch future python john cleese performing in sketches that were mostly selfwritten i can do that thought douglas im as tall as he is in order to become a writerperformer he had to write this caused problems i used to spend a lot of time in front of a typewriter wondering what to write tearing up pieces of paper and never actually writing anything this notwriting quality was to become a hallmark of douglass later work but the die had been cast adams abandoned all his daydreams even those of being a rock star he was and indeed is a creditable guitarist and set out to be a writerperformer he left school in december and on the strength of an essay on the revival of religious poetry which brought together on one sheet of foolscap christopher smart gerard manley hopkins and john lennon he won an exhibition to study english at cambridge and it was important to douglas that it was cambridge not just because his father had been to cambridge or simply because he had been born there he wanted to go to cambridge because it was from a cambridge university society that the writers and performers of such shows as beyond the fringe that was the week that was im sorry ill read that again and of course many of the monty pythons flying circus team had come douglas adams wanted to join footlights cambridge and other recurrent phenomena before going up to cambridge douglas adams had begun the series of jobs that would serve him on book jackets ever after he had decided to hitchhike to istanbul and in order to make the money to travel he worked first as a chickenshed cleaner then as a porter in the xray department of yeovil general hospital while at school he had worked as a porter in a mental hospital the hitchhike itself was not spectacularly successful although he reached istanbul he contracted food poisoning there and was forced to return to england by train he slept in the corridors felt extremely sorry for himself and was hospitalised on his return to england perhaps it was a combination of his illness with the hospital work he had been doing but on his arrival home he began to feel guilty for not going on to study medicine i come from a somewhat medical family my mother was a nurse my stepfather was a vet and my fathers father whom i never actually met was a very eminent ear nose and throat specialist in glasgow i kept working in hospitals as well and i had the feeling that if there is anyone up there he kept tapping me on the shoulder and saying oy oy get your stethoscope out this is what you should be doing but i never did douglas rejected medicine in part because he wanted to be a writerperformer although at least four top british writer performers have been doctors jonathan miller graham chapman graeme garden and rob buckman and in part because it would have meant going off for another two years to get a new set of alevels douglas went on to study english literature at st johns college cambridge academically douglass career was covered in less than glory although he is still proud of the work he did on christopher smart the eighteenthcentury poet for years smart stayed at cambridge as the most drunken and lecherous student theyd ever had he used to do drag revues drank in the same pub that i did he went from cambridge to grub street where he was the most debauched journalist they had ever had when suddenly he underwent an extreme religious conversion and did things like falling on his knees in the middle of the street and praying to god aloud it was for that that he was thrust into a loony bin in which he wrote his only work the jubilate agno which was as long as paradise lost and was an attempt to write the first hebraic verse in english even as an undergraduate douglas was perpetually missing deadlines in three years he only managed to complete three essays this however may have had less to do with his fabled lateness than with the fact that his studies came in a poor third to his other interests performing and pubs although douglas had gone to cambridge with the intention of joining footlights he was never happy with them nor they with him his first term attempt to join footlights was a failure he found them aloof and rather pleased with themselves and being made to feel rather a new boy he wound up joining cules and doing jolly little shows in hospitals prisons and the like these shows were not particularly popular especially not in the prisons and douglas now regards the whole thing with no little embarrassment in his second term feeling slightly more confident he auditioned with a friend called keith jeffrey at one of the footlights smokers informal evenings at which anybody could get up and perform it was there that i discovered that there was one guy totally unlike the rest of the footlights committee who was actually friendly and helpful all the things the others werent a completely nice guy named simon jones he encouraged me and from then on i got on increasingly well in footlights but footlights had a very traditional role to fulfil it had to produce a pantomime at christmas a latenight revue in the middle term and a spectacular commercial show at the end of every year as a result of which it couldnt afford to take any risks i think it was henry porter a history don who was treasurer of footlights who said that the shows that had gone on to become famous were not the cambridge shows but subsequent reworkings beyond the fringe wasnt a footlights show neither was cambridge circus the show that launched john cleese et al it wasnt the cambridge show but a reworking done after theyd all left cambridge footlights shows themselves had to fight against the constraints of what footlights had to produce every year douglas rapidly earned a reputation for suggesting ideas that struck everyone else as hopelessly implausible he felt strait jacketed by footlights and by the fact that nobody in footlights seemed to feel his ideas were particularly funny and with two friends he formed a guerilla revue group called adamssmith adams because two members of the group were called adams and the third as you might already have guessed was called smith will adams joined a knitwear company upon leaving university martin smith went into advertising and was later immortalised as bloody martin smith of croydon in a book written by douglas as douglas explained we invested all our money or whatever it was in hiring a theatre for a week and then we knew we had to do it so we wrote it performed it and had a considerable hit with it it was a great moment i really loved that it was then that douglas made an irrevocable decision to become a writer this was to cause him no little anguish and aggravation in the years to come the show was called several poor players strutting and fretting and this extract from the programme notes has the flavour of early douglas adams by the time youve read the opposite page youll probably be feeling restive and wondering when the show will start well it should start at the exact moment that you read the first word of the next sentence if it hasnt started yet youre reading too fast if it still hasnt started youre reading much too fast and we can recommend our own book how to impair your reading ability written and published by adamssmithadams with the aid of this slim volume you will find that your reading powers shrink to practically nothing within a very short space of time the more you read the slower you get theoretically you will never get to the end which makes it the best value book you will ever have bought the following year adamssmithadams aided in performance by the female presence of margaret thomas who the programme booklet declared was getting quite fed up with the improper advances that are continually being made to her by the other three all of whom are deeply and tragically in love with her took to the stage again in their second revue the patter of tiny minds these shows were popular packed out and generally considered to be somewhat better than the orthodox footlights offerings douglas considers his favourite sketches of this period to be one about a railway signalman who caused havoc over the entire southern region by attempting to demonstrate the principles of existentialism using the points system and another of which he says its hard to describe what it was about there was a lot of stuff about catshaving which was very bizarre but seemed quite funny at the time it was shortly after this that douglas adams gave up performing permanently to concentrate on writing this was due to his continuing upset with footlights and specifically with the footlights show as he explains it is something that happened with footlights that i still get upset about because i think that footlights should be a writerperformer show but in my day footlights became a producers show the producer says whos going to be in it and who he wants to write it they are appointed and the producer calls the tune i think thats wrong that its too artificial my year in footlights was full of immensely talented people who never actually got the chance to work together properly in my case footlights came to us adamssmithadams and said can we use all this material that the three of you have written and we said fine okay whereupon they said but we dont want you to be in it as things turned out martin smith did appear in the show alongside griff rhys jones and future ford prefect geoffrey mcgivern but neither of the adamses appeared something that douglas adams is still slightly bitter about douglas was still hitchhiking over europe and taking strange jobs to pay for incidentals in another bid to get to istanbul he took a job building barns during the course of which he crashed a tractor which broke his pelvis ripped up his arm and damaged the road so badly it needed to be repaired he wound up in hospital once more but knew that it was far too late for him to become a doctor in summer douglas adams left cambridge young confident and certain that the world would beat a path to his door that he was destined to change the face of comedy across the globe of course it would and he did but it did not seem that way at the time the wilderness years following his graduation from cambridge douglas adams began doing the occasional office job working as a filing clerk while trying to work out what to do with the rest of his life he wrote a number of sketches for weekending a radio show that satirises the events chiefly political of the past week due to his inability to write to order and the fact that although many of his sketches were funny they were unlike anything ever broadcast on the show before almost none of these sketches ever went out on the air the footlights show of that year chox not only got to the west end the first footlights show in a long time to do so but it was also televised adams remembers fondly the enormous sum of he was paid for the television rights to his sketches the show was in adamss words a dreadful flop but a number of former footlights personnel came to see it among them was graham chapman chapman was a six foot three inchtall doctor who instead of practising medicine found himself part of the monty python team he was arthur in monty python and the holy grail and brian in monty pythons life of brian at that time the future of monty python was uncertain and the members of the team were diversifying and experimenting with projects of their own chapman liked adamss work and invited him over for a drink douglas came for the drink got chatting and began a writing partnership that was to last for the next eighteen months it looked like it was adamss big break at he was working with one of the top people in british comedy unfortunately very few of the projects that douglas and graham worked on were to see the light of day one that did or nearly did was out of the trees a television sketch show that starred chapman and simon jones it was shown once late at night on bbc with no publicity garnered no reviews and went no further my favourite bit from that show was a lovely sketch about genghis khan who had become so powerful and important and successful as a conqueror he really didnt have any time for conquering anymore because he was constantly off seeing his financial advisors and so on it was partly a reflection of what one heard graham muttering about the other members of monty python i was very fond of that sketchthis sketch rewritten into a short story incorporatcd into the hitchhikers canon and illustrated by michael foreman appeared in the utterly utterly merry comic relief christmas book the second episode of out of the trees was never even made although there was some nice stuff in it my favourite sketch was called a haddock at eton about a haddock given a place at eton to show the place was becoming more egalitarian it got terribly bullied only it gets a rich guardian anyway so the whole exercise is rather futile while out of the trees was not exactly a success the ringo starr show was even less noteworthy it didnt even get to the pilot stage the show was to be an sf comedy starring ringo as a chauffeur who carried his boss around on his back until one day a flying saucer landed and mistakenly gave ringo the powers of his ancestral race the power to travel through space to do flower arranging and to destroy the universe by waving his hand it would have been an hourlong american television special but the project fell through douglas remembers the show with affection and later salvaged one of his ideas from it in hitchhikers this was the golgafrincham b ark sequence other chapmanconnected projects of this time include some work on the holy grail record for which a sketch of douglass was highly rewritten by various hands in its original form it concerned the digging up of marilyn monroe s corpse to star in a movie douglas also helped write parts of chapmans autobiography a liars autobiography he cowrote an episode of doctor on the go it was doubtless his contribution to the record and his two walkon parts in the last series of monty pythons flying circus that caused the original american promotion of hitchhikers five years later to bill him as a member of the python team for completists or people who are interested douglas played a surgeon in a sketch that never gets started and later in a scene where a ragandbone man is hawking nuclear missiles from a horse and cart douglas was one of the squeakyvoiced little pepperpot ladies as the pythons call them it is worth noting at this point that douglas had not really earned much money his aweek rent was being paid from his overdraft he was not happy the collaboration with graham chapman far from being the break it had seemed was a failure that left douglas convinced that he was a yearold washout the collaborations collapse was due to many factors including chapmans then troubles with alcoholism douglass increaslng lack of money the uncertainties about the future of monty pythons flying circus and just plain bad luck at about the time that douglas adams and chapman finally split up douglas was invited to cambridge to direct the footlights revue in the past the director s job had been to go to cambridge every weekend for two or three months take whatever show footlights had roughly worked out so far pull it into shape and stage it professionally unfortunately for douglas in the two years since he had left cambridge the footlights clubroom which was the hub of the society had closed down and been redeveloped into a shopping centre footlights had become homeless and dispossessed and had almost ceased to exist whereas in my year there were tremendous battles and competition to get in i wound up in knocking on peoples doors saying have you heard of footlights and would you like to be in the may week revue it was terrible i got some people jimmy mulville and rory mcgrath from who dares wins charles shaughnessy whos now a daytime soap heartthrob in america on a show called days of our lives and the final show had some good bits but they were few and far between and the whole experience was pain and agony i had to conjure something out of nothing at the end of the show i was completely demoralised and exhausted at this point douglas went to the edinburgh festival with john lloyd david renwick and others with a fringe show called the unpleasantness of something close for which andrew marshall was to write some sketches the show made no money and douglass income for the year was now approaching his overdraft was nearing with his flatmate john lloyd he worked on a film treatment for the stigwood organisation an sf comedy based on the guinness book of records which never got off the ground the attitude being who was john lloyd and who was douglas adams together they also wrote pilots for a television situation comedy to be called snow seven and the white dwarfs about two astronomers living in isolation together in a fictitious observatory situated on top of mt everest the idea for that was minimum casting minimum set minimum number of sets and wed just try to sell the series on cheapness that failed to come to anything while demoralised and very broke douglas answered a classified ad in the evening standard and found himself a bodyguard to an oilrich arabian family a job which involved sitting outside hotel rooms for twelve hours a night wearing a suit and running away if anybody turned up waving a gun or grenade the family had an income of a day which cannot have done much for douglass morale although it provided him with numerous anecdotes and another profession for the book jacket biographies i remember one group of family members had gone down to the restaurant in the dorchester the waiter had brought the menu and they said well have it it took a while for the penny to drop that they actually meant the whole lot the a la carte which is over a thousand pounds worth of food so the waiters brought it the family tried a little bit of all of it then went back up to their room then they sent out one of their servants to bring back a sackful of hamburgers which is what their real obsession was all of douglass attempts to persuade television producers that a comedy science fiction series might not be a bad idea had come to nothing his overdraft was enormous he couldnt pay the rent he had almost convinced himself that he was not and never would be a writer and that he needed a proper job it was coming on towards christmas and a highly depressed douglas adams went to his mothers house in dorset where he did not have to pay any rent to live for the next six months coming into london as necessary he was a yearold flop gherkin swallowing walking backwards and all that john lloyd is probably the most influential producer in british comedy today his successes include not the nine oclock news black adder and spitting image he was also associate producer of the hitchhikers television series and cowrote episodes five and six of the first radio series with douglas adams he also cowrote the meaning of liff with douglas adams of which more later lloyd was a member of footlights in he had intended to become a barrister but was infected by show business and on graduating worked as a freelance writer and as a producer in bbc radio light entertainment he is a phenomenally busy man i wound up interviewing him for this book at nine oclock one monday morning at the spitting image studios in londons limehouse docks squeezed into a crowded schedule while people with urgent problems gestured at him from outside the glass partitions of his office i knew douglas although not very well at university i was at trinity cambridge while he was at st johns which is the next college along douglas did some of the unfunniest sketches ever seen on the footlights stage according to the people in footlights hed do very long sketches there was one about a tree i remember and another about a postbox hed stand up at these footlights smokers and harangue the audience with these long rather wearisome sketches which didnt go down at all well in footlights at that time which was almost all singing and dancing and so he went off with martin smith and will adams and they did two absolutely brilliant college revues packed out at the same time i was doing the trinity revues footlights at that time was a bunch of nancy boys they had this awful club where theyd all go and pretend to be noel coward but when that got knocked down to build a car park footlights became more peripatetic and it began to attract a broader spectrum of people it was thought especially by douglas that the adams smithadamss revues were much better than footlights and indeed they were there was one amazingly funny bit in the interval where they told jokes very slowly to drive people out of the audience into the bar id met douglas a few times at parties but it was only when id left university that i used to go and have lots of hamburgers with douglas in a hamburger bar called tootsies in notting hill and we got to know each other extraordinarily well we eventually wound up sharing a flat i was working as a radio producer and douglas was doing things like writing with graham chapman an absolutely bizarre experience as they used to get phenomenally drunk graham had a room in his house entirely devoted to gin it was just gin bottles that lined the walls and occasionally when i was working in bbc radio id go up there at lunchtime theyd have a few gins before lunch then theyd go to the pub and do all the crosswords in every paper then theyd get roaring drunk and usually graham would take his willy out and put it on the bar it was quite entertaining after work id come back from the office and usually douglas had had a very large number of baths and cups of tea and eaten all the food and wed sit around and write in the evenings there were three of us sharing a house my girlfriend douglas and me i was fully employed but douglas was struggling rather he was very poor and getting broker and broker and his overdraft was going up and up and he was getting more and more desperate we had all these projects douglas and graham had written a treatment for a film of the guinness book of records which fell through so douglas and i started doing it we did rather well the stigwood organisation liked it and they invited us to come to bermuda and discuss it and we were incredibly excited it was dreadfully disappointing we never heard anything more from them and we never even got paid for it it would have been a science fiction thing about a race of aliens who were the most aggressive aliens in the whole universe who somehow got hold of a copy of the guinness book of records and who immediately came down to challenge the world at wrestling and boxing and stamping on peoples knuckles that kind of thing and the united nations john cleese was going to be general secretary of the un i remember agreed to compete but they wanted to do all the silly events like gherkin swallowing walking backwards and all that so they had a guinness book of records olympics and the aliens won all the sensible events but lost at all the silly things then we decided to go and live in roehampton we were very happy until we started advertising for a fourth person to share the house and we had a succession of weird peoplethere was one very bizarre person one day we got back from work to find hed ripped up every carpet in the house the house was rented from a little old lady and hed thrown them out of the window as he said they were smelly the last straw came when we came home to find hed chainsawed the front hedge down because he said it was untidy at that time i was producing weekending and i was always trying to get douglas to produce stuff at that time id write lots of quickies for all sorts of comedy shows while douglas wouldnt at the time i thought he was wrong i thought you had to be able to do everything which i could and he couldnt or wouldnt i fitted in quite easily and i got douglas to write for weekending he wrote a very funny sketch about john stonehouse the idea being that he was pretending to be dead all the time but it just wasnt right for the show it was very funny but wrong then we went our separate ways was a radio producer he was an unsuccessful writer anyway we remained good friends but douglas was at the edge of despair at that time he was absolutely broke if he wanted a drink id have to buy it for him he had started applying for jobs in shipping in hong kong and so on as hed totally given up on being a writer and then simon brett came along when you hitch upon a star was my worst year id decided i was hopeless at writing and id never earn any money at it i felt hopeless and helpless and beached i was overdrawn and in a bad way in hitchhikers theres an element of writing myself back up out of that i was surprised and delighted to find a lot of letters from people in the early days would say i was terribly depressed and upset until i sat down and read your book its really shown me the way up again i wrote it to do this for myself and its seemed to have the same effect on a lot of other people i cant explain it perhaps ive inadvertently written a selfhelp book there are a number of people without whom hitchhikers at least in the form we know it would never have appeared john lloyd is one geoffrey perkins another but without doubt the most important is simon brett who was in producer of a radio comedy programme the burkiss way simon brett deserves more space than can conveniently be given here hes been a producer and director on radio and television he has written for radio and television shows as diverse as frank muir goes into and the cult show after henry as an author he is best known for his excellent mysteries including the series of murder mysteries starring charles paris a lousy actor but a great detective which with their accurate and incisive scrutiny of life inside television radio and theatre in britain today should be compulsory reading for anyone interested in the environments that hitchhikers comes out of he has written a number of humour books and some notable pastiches including his sequel to geoffrey willans and ronald searless molesworth books brett had met adams through john lloyd at that time a junior radio producer himself and felt as he explained to me that douglas was a talent without a niche id encouraged him to write for weekending as he really didnt have any outlets for his humour but it wasnt his thing it can be a restricting market then i started the burkiss way for which he did a few sketches one was the kamikaze briefing another was a parody of von daniken about the world being created by fluffy kittens in bow ties singing raindrops keep falling on my head brett had the wit to see that douglas needed a show of his own rather than to try to cram his own strange talent into someone elses format and on th february douglas travelled up from dorset to see simon who wanted to know if he had any ideas for a comedy show while douglas had promoted the idea of a comedy science fiction series to all manner of unimpressed television producers he had not even thought about it as a radio possibility feeling that radio was too conservative a medium ever to be interested in science fiction so initially the ideas he suggested to simon were very conservative and then and then history differs as far as douglas remembers simon brett said yes those ideas are all very well but what i always wanted to do was a science fiction comedy according to brett it was douglas who suggested it and he who agreed it doesnt much matter really the subject was broached both were enthusiastic and douglas went off to come up with an idea the initial idea was one that douglas had had lying around for a while it was about this guys house being demolished and then the earth being demolished for the same reason i decided to do a series of six shows each of which would deal with the destruction of the earth for a completely different reason it was going to be called the ends ofthe earth its still not a bad idea but it was while i was tinkering with the story idea for the first one that i thought to give the story perspective there really ought to be somebody on earth who is an alien who knows whats going on then i remembered this title id thought of while lying in a field in innsbruck in and thought ok hes a roving researcher for the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and the more i thought about it the more that seemed to be a promising idea for a continuing story as opposed to the ends of the earth which would have been a series of different stories adams did a threepage outline for the first episode of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy with an additional page of future plans for the show as can be seen almost nothing remains the same from the arrival in the vogon hold onwards the outline with the name aleric b crossed out and the lastminute replacement arthur dent written in above it went to the bbc programme development group douglas was lucky in having two allies in the group simon brett and producer john simmonds the chief producer who was although fairly conservative a big fan of douglass kamikaze briefing sketch for the burkiss way kamikaze fx wild flurry of flamenco music which continues for some time voice japan flamenco resumes japan flamenco music continues we vaguely see the narrator going into the band and for instance attacking the piano japanese music starts reluctantly and stops very soon voice thank you japan the war was moving into its final stage the japanese nation was in a desperate situation i didnt say stop the music he goes back to the band again now look what is it is it the money come on flamenco starts again no flamenco wont do what do you mean the chords are easier look weve got all these japanese instruments for you why dont you play something on this lot quick flamenco riff on japanese instruments alright were going to have a chat about this you lot carry on set consists of a bench in a briefing room on which sits one kamikaze pilot with his gear and headband on on the bench are laid out the headbands of many other presumably

deceased kamikaze pilots a commander stands to address the meeting comm now you all know the purpose of this mission it is a kamikaze mission your sacred task is to destroy the ships of the american fleet in the pacific this will involve the deaths of each and everyone of you including you pilot me sir comm yes you you are a kamikaze pilot pilot yes sir comm what are you pilot a kamikaze pilot sir comm and what is your function as a kamikaze pilot pilot to lay down my life for the emperor sir comm how many missions have you flown on pilot nineteen sir comm yes i have the reports on your previous missions here lets see couldnt find target couldnt find target got lost couldnt find target forgot to take headband couldnt find target couldnt find target headband slipped over eyes couldnt find target came back with headache pilot headband too tight sir comm vertigo couldnt find target all the rest couldnt find target now i dont think youve been looking very hard pilot yes i have sir ive looked all over the place comm you see its not actually that difficult bearing in mind that we do have a highly sophisticated reconnaissance unit whose job it is to tell you where to find the targets pilot well its not always accurate sir sometimes one can search for hours and not see a single aircraft carrier comm well where exactly have you been looking for these aircraft carriers pilot er well sir comm i mean i notice for instance that you seem to have more or less ignored the sea i would have thought that the sea was quite a promising area pilot yes sir comm and that the airspace directly above tokyo was not and another thing pilot yes sir comm skip the victory rolls pilot sir youre being unfair i have flown over the sea lots of times i actually attacked an aircraft carrier once comm ah yes i have the details of your attack here mission nineteen lets see take off hours proceeded to target area nice start target spotted hours good climbed to a height of ft prepared for attack went into a power dive and successfully landed on target pilot i had to go wee wees sir caught short but i took off again immediately sir good job too one of our lads crashed straight into it poor devil didnt stand a chance comm what pilot no sir and that really got me upset and i was going to let em really have it i was going to whip it straight out fly in low and lob it straight through the dining room porthole that would have sorted them out comm you were going to do what pilot cut it straight out and let em have it whee splat right in the middle of their breakfast theyd have known we meant business then alright sir comm what were you going to cut straight out and throw into their breakfast pilot my stomach sir oh yes id like to see the expressions on their faces when the great squelchy mass plummetted right into comm wait wait a moment let me just get this clear in my mind you were going to cut out pilot my stomach yes sir kamikaze does hara kiri gesture comm you were going to cut out your stomach and throw it at the enemy pilot yes sir straight at them comm any particular reason pilot die for the emperor sir comm and what purpose would that serve pilot make the enemy feel guilty sir the bbc approved the making of the pilot on st march and by th april douglas had finished the first script it was essentially the hitchhikers script that we know now with a couple of exceptions the longest and most striking of which is the parallel universes speech of fords which gives the gradually eroded rationale for ford rescuing arthur in the first place originally it should be noted he liked arthur and wanted to enlist him as a fellow reporter for the guide by the time douglas came to write the computer game all ford wanted to do was return arthurs towel and get out before the planet was demolished there was also a much longer dialogue between arthur and prosser the council representative which was wisely cut as the style of humour owed more to monty python than to adams himself prosser but you found the notice didnt you arthur yes it was on display in the bottom of a locked filingcabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying beware of the leopard ever thought of going into advertising prosser its not as if its a particularly nice house anyway arthur i happen rather to like it prosser mr dent you may choose to scoff at local government arthur me i wasnt scoffing prosser i said you may choose to scoff at local government arthur alright maybe i was a bit prosser may i continue arthur yes alright prosser you may choose to scoff at local government arthur is this you continuing prosser yes i said arthur ah im sorry its just that it sounded more like you saying the same thing again prosser mr dent arthur hello yes prosser have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if i just let it roll straight over you arthur how much prosser none at all hitchhikers pilot radio script from april to august there were a number of delays the pilot episode was made but after that it was mainly a waiting game the waiting in question being caused by the upper echelons of the bbc taking summer holidays which meant that the committees bodies and groups who were to give the goaheбd to hitchhikers were unavailable this had the effect of driving douglas halfmad and not paying him any money it also had the effect of making him send the pilot script to the script editor of dr who to see if any money might be forthcoming from that direction however on the last day of august word came down from the bbc hierarchy that the series of six episodes had been commissioned simon brett would not be producing it he was leaving the bbc to go to london weekend television as a producer he recommended that geoffrey perkins the most junior of the departments producers be given the job and luckily for everybody concerned he was radio radio narrator on this particular thursday something was moving quietly through the ionosphere miles above the surface of the planet only two people on the surface of the planet were aware of it one was a deaf and dumb lunatic in the amazon basin who now leapt off a fiftyfoot cliff in horror and the other was ford prefect hitchhikers pilot radio script one thing that everyone involved in the creation of hitchhikers is clear on is how definite douglas adams was on what kind of show it was he wanted how it would sound what it would be another thing they are clear on is that he had no idea where it was all going but he was sure that it would be full of ideas full of detail experimental a sound collage unlike anything done on radio before epochmaking a milestone in radio comedy but first he had to write it this was not to prove as easy as it may sound douglas adamss introduction to the radio scripts book gives an impression of this time a period that he described as six months of baths and peanutbutter sandwiches six months spent at his mothers house in dorset filling wastepaper baskets with sheets of halftyped paper of relentless selfediting of depression he would leave notes around for himself to find with messages such as if you ever get the chance to do a proper regular job take it this is not an occupation for a healthy growing lad and underneath those notes other notes reminding him this is not written after a bad day this is written after an average day after producing the pilot simon brett had gone to london weekend television leaving geoffrey perkins in control perkins a yearold oxford graduate had been rescued from a life in the shipping industry by an invitation to come and work in radio and was the most junior of the light entertainment producers he knew douglas vaguely mainly as an embarrassment to the bbc at the time but was interested enough in the show to make a pitch for it and slightly to his surprise he got it possibly because no one else had much idea of what the show was about nor how to do it geoffrey himself had no idea how to go about producing hitchhikers but was relieved to discover over a meal with douglas before the second show that neither of them knew what they were doing this made things much easier douglas for his part was nervous of changing producers so soon but if on that second show they were wary of each other they quickly discovered that as far as putting the show together went their minds worked very much on the same lines complementing each other and working well together they also became good friends was there anything that douglas had panicularly wanted to say during the first series of hitchhikers i just wanted to do stuff i thought was funny but on the other hand whatever i find funny is going to be conditioned by what i think about what my concerns or preoccupations are you may not set out to make a point but points probably come across because they tend to be the things that preoccupy you and therefore find a way into your writing i wanted to i say this in the introduction to the script book i felt you could do a great deal more with sound than i had heard being done of late the people who were exploring and exploiting where you could go with sound were people in the rock world the beatles pink floyd and so on i had the idea of scenes of sound that there would never be a moment at which the alien world would let up that you would be in it for half an hour im not saying we necessarily achieved that but i think that what we achieved came about as a result of striving after that we did spend an awfully long time getting the effects right and the background atmosphere and morchestrating all the little effects the way marvin spoke and all that kind of stuff it was taking so long we were continually having to steal studio time from other shows and pretending we were actually doing far less than we were there was no way we could justify using that amount of time time doesnt actually equal money to the bbc but it comes close theres a complicated but dependent relationship so what we were doing was completely out of line with what normally happens as much as anything we were actually having to invent the process by which we worked because nobody was doing multi track recording electronic effects and so on we went about it the wrong way at the beginning simply because we didnt know and then as we began to understand it we evolved a way to do it it wasnt simply doing it the wrong way and finding the right way it was more dependent on when we were able to get bits of equipment we didnt have any track recorders to begin with and the final version didnt come about until we had an track tape recorder after a while i took more of a back seat because everyone knew how to do it but i was always there just sticking my oar in and making trouble geoffrey perkins tells a slightly different story explaining that douglas was thrown out of the directors cubicle from about halfway through the first series onwards because hed get quite excited about putting bits and pieces into scenes youd just finish a scene and he would say ive been thinking we should go back and do it again why because i think we should have something going bloobledoo bledoobledooblebloobledoobleblob in the background we used to mix the programmes and cut them down which wasnt a great way to do it because everything had music and effects behind it i started off in the early programmes asking what we should cut and hed come back with a list of odd words here and there and we couldnt do that hed say but theres nothing else i want to cut in the end i stopped asking him so i can come across as the vandal of the programme douglas adams had found a natural foil in geoffrey perkins and the ideal hitchhikers producer perkins is currently nowhere near as well known as he should be for his work as a writer peformer in radio s seminal comedy radioactive and bbcs kytv he is smaller than douglas adams wears spectacles with brightly coloured frames and is a perfectionist he was probably the only radio producer who would spend two days simply getting a sound effect right and one of the few people who could bully exhort and cajole scripts out of douglas and get them almost on time the show was something very different in the past and today for that matter as a rule a radio comedy show is rehearsed in an afternoon recorded in front of an audience that evening then edited the following day before being broadcast not only was hitchhikers not recorded in front of an audience as geoffrey perkins has pointed out all they would have seen was an empty stage a number of actors hiding in cupboards and some microphone leads it was put together with almost lapidary detail using the miracles of the bbc radiophonic workshop lots of tape and scissors douglas adams says of perkinss role as producer on a show of that kind he was a very crucial and central part of it when i was writing the script he was the person i would go and argue with about what i was going to have in it and what i wasnt id do the script and hed say this bits good and that bits tat hed come up with casting suggestiorls and hed come up with his own ideas about what to do with bits that werent working like throw them out or suggestions about how i could rewrite id be guided by him or by the outcome of the argument one of geoffreys strengths is that he is very good at casting in some cases i had very specific ideas about casting and in other cases i had none where i had ideas wed follow them or argue and id win or hed win when we were in production id be there but at that point it was very much a producers show the producer gives instructions to the actors and generally if you have anything you want to say or suggestions or disagreements or points you want to make then youd say it to geoffrey and hed decide whether or not to ignore it vary rarely do you as a writer actually start giving instructions to the actors its protocol to be honest id sometimes step over it but you cant have more than one person in charge when i wrote the script i was in charge but when it was made geoffrey was in charge and the final decisions were his right or wrong but we rapidly arrived at a working relationship there sometimes wed get very annoyed at each other and sometimes wed have a really terrific time its exactly the sort of working relationship you would expect perkins says of his involvement with hitchhikers its really impossible to say how much involvement i had in the story we used to have meetings and talk grand designs abortive plots which never quite worked out its a blur of lunches i changed gerbils to mice because douglass exgirlfriend kept gerbils the first episode casting had been done by douglas with simon brett crucial casting since it involved the roles of arthur dent ford prefect and the book the making of the series is covered so well by geoffrey perkinss notes in the original radio scirpts book that it seems redundant to cover the ground again go out and buy a copy of the book if you want to know what happened youll get two introductions lots of notes and the complete texts of the first two radio series well almost complete there are bits in this book that arent in there but youve already got this book the bbc were unsure what they had on their hands a comedy without a studio audience to be broadcast in stereo the first radio science fiction since journey into space in the s half an hour of semantic and philosophical jokes about the meaning of life and earinserted fish they did the only decent thing and put it out at on wednesday evenings when they hoped nobody would be listening with no prepublicity and expected it to uphold radio s reputation for obscurity they were undoubtedly surprised when it didnt after the first episode was broadcast douglas went into the bbc to look at the reviews it was pointed out to him that radio almost never got reviews and that an unpublicised science fiction comedy series was less likely to get reviews than the shipping forecast that sunday two national newspapers carried favourable reviews of the first show to the amazement of everybody except douglas and the listeners the series rapidly began to pick up a following accumulating an enormous audience chiefly by word of mouth people who liked it told their friends science fiction fans liked it because it was science fiction humour fans liked it because it was funny radio fans got off on the quality of the stereo production radiophonics workshop fans doubtless had a great time and most people liked it because it was accessible fast and funny by the time the sixth episode had been broadcast the show had become a cult while the first four episodes were written by douglas on his own the last two were not this came about in the following manner douglas had sent off the pilot script for hitchhikers to the dr who script editor earlier in the year hoping to get a commission out of it to do some scripts the commission came through unfortunately it came through at the same time that the six episodes of hitchhikers were commissioned which meant that as soon as douglas adams had finished the first four episodes of hitchhikers he had to write the four episodes of a dr who story the pirate planet as a result he was facing deadline problems with the final two episodes of hitchhikers he knew how episode six ended but he had run out of words in addition he had just been made a radio producer he turned to his exflatmate john lloyd for help lloyd remembers its odd but hitchhikers was always liked thats the funny thing about it it never had to struggle at all douglas struggled to write it though it took him about nine months to write the first four episodes but everyone from the first day thought it was great and the department was very conservative at the time anyway after nine months douglas was getting desperate as hed caught up with the deadline and passed it as is his wont and theyd already started broadcasting they were already up to programme two or three and finally douglas despaired he rang me up and said why dont you do this with me i think what douglas had wanted was to prove he was a writer in his own right in the past he had done all this stuff and people had said its chapman but now he had proved it hed just started on the fifth episode when i came in id been working for a couple of years on a silly science fiction book of my own that had tons and tons of chapters all unconnected and i dumped it on his lap and said is there anything here you think might make a scene or two so we sat in the garage i was using for a study at that time and wrote the fifth episode together more or less line by line things like the three phases of civilisation and the haggunenon death flotilla who evolved into different creatures we sat down and worked it out word by word it was actually incredibly quick although very painstaking then i was busy on production for episode six so although he used stuff i wrote for it he really put the whole thing together the pressure was fantastic we were writing it hours before it was due to be recorded later on in the second series things got really silly he was writing during the recording having written the thing that was more or less it and it had been great fun as douglas said it was a tremendous relief for him not to have to do it on his own and we both enjoyed it and i didnt think that much about it it was just a job and wed written together before by the broadcast of the first three or four episodes the place had gone absolutely mad i think six publishing companies rang up and four record companies which is extraordinary with radio usually by the time youve done six series of thirteen episodes people have just about heard of it hitchhikers just went whoosh and douglas and i were getting on tremendously well and were tremendously excited when the first publisher called we went out and bought a bottle of champagne it was so exciting we were going to do the book together and then douglas had second thoughts he decided he had to do it on his own he felt the first four episodes were different in kind and that the last two although enjoyable enough didnt have the same sense of loneliness and loss and desperation that characterises hitchhikers in a funny way like marvin who douglas says is andrew marshall but there is a big chunk of douglas as well the thing about hitchhikers is the wonderful bittersweet quality he gets in the thing is terribly sad at certain points it really means something and i think that he felt that the other two episodes were light by comparison douglas adamss version of these events is essentially the same after the dr who episodes i was absolutely wiped outi knew roughly what i wanted to do in the last two episodes so i asked john if hed help and collaborate and we wrote together a bit of the milliways sequence and the haggunenon section and then after that i took over and did the b ark stuff and the prehistoric earth stuff the haggunenon sequence from episodes five and six is omitted from all later versions of the story replaced by disaster areas stunt ship although it has been used in some of the theatrical adaptations of the show douglas adams on the casting for the radio series peter jones that was very curious we didnt know who to cast i remember saying that it should be a peter jonesey voice and who could we get to do a peter jonesey voice we thought of all sons of people michael palin michael hordern all kinds of people eventually simon bretts secretary got very annoyed hearing us talking on and on like this and not spotting the obvious she said what about peter jones i thought yes that would be a way of achieving it wouldnt it so we asked peter he was available and he did it peter was extraordinary he always affected not to understand what was going on at all and he managed to transmute his own sense of i dont know what this is about into i dont understand why this happened which was the keynote of his performance hes great to work with a very talented guy hes never had the recognition he should have had hes terribly good he rarely met the other actors at all because hed be doing his bits completely separately it was like getting session musicians in on a multitrack rock album sitting alone in a studio doing the bass pan stephen moore he was geoffrey perkinss suggestion i had no idea who to suggest for marvin a wonderful actor absolutely brilliant not only did he do marvin so well but whenever i had a character that i didnt have enough clues about or didnt know how it should be played wed say lets give it to stephen and see what happens stephen would find the character immediately and would make it really excellent one of my favourite things that he did was the man in the shack i knew what the character said and why he said it but i had not the faintest idea of how he would sound or what son of a voice he would have mark wingdavey the thing that made me think of him for zaphod was a pan he had in glittering prizes he played a guy who was a film and television producer who always took advantage of people and was very trendy he did that so well i thought he would be good for zaphod david tate he was one of the backbones of the series he can do any voice he could if he wanted to be a very successful actor hes deliberately chosen to be just a voice hes remarkable in hitchhikers he played a large number of pans and always got them spot on he played eddie he played the disc jockey broadcasting to intelligent lifeforms everywhere he played one of the mice one of the characters in the b ark we had him there every week richard vernon hes so funny he carved himself a niche playing all sons of grandfatherly elderly types slartibartfast in hitchhikers hes not actually as old as he appears i originally wrote that pan with john le mesurier in mind susan sheridan its funny trillian was never that wellrounded a pan susan never found anything major to do with the role but that wasnt her fault it was my fault a succession of different people have played trillian in different ways its a weak pan and thats the best i can say she was a delight to work with roy hudd he played the original max quordlepleen he had to come into the studio and do his bit all by himself to this day he still claims he doesnt know what it was all about a slightly unreliable producer arthurford i dont know if this sounds like a silly question but what am i doing here ford well you know that i rescued you from the earth arthurand what has happened to the earth ford its been disintegrated arthurhas it ford yes it just boiled away into space arthurlook im a bit upset about that ford yes i can understand but there are plenty more earths just like it arthurare you going to explain that or would it save time if i just went mad now ford keep looking at the book arthurwhat ford dont panic arthurim looking ford alright the universe we exist in is just one of a multiplicity of parallel universes which coexist in the same space but on different matter wavelengths and in millions of them the earth is still alive and throbbing much as you remember or very similar at least because every possible variation of the earth also exists arthur variation i dont understand you mean like a world where hitler won the war ford yes or a world in which shakespeare wrote pornography made a lot more money and got a knighthood they all exist some of course with only the minutest variations for instance one parallel universe must contain a world which is utterly identical to yours except that one small tree somewhere in the amazon basin has an extra leaf arthur so one could quite happily live on that world without knowing the difference ford yes more or less of course it wouldnt be quite like home with that extra leaf arthur well its hardly going to notice ford no probably not for a while it would be a few years before you really became strongly aware that something was off balance somewhere then youd start looking for it and youd probably end up going mad because youd never be able to find it arthur so what do i do ford you come along with me and have a good time youll need to have this fish in your ear arthur i beg your pardon hitchhikers pilot radio script from mid to the end of it often becomes difficult to disentangle what douglas adams was doing when even he is no longer sure but about the time that the first hitchhikers radio series was broadcast which was about the same time that the pirate planet was recorded douglas was offered a job as a radio producer in radio s light entertainment department he took the job as he explains i felt i had to do it because id set out to be a freelance writer had one disaster after another ended up having to be supported by my parents and so on and i thought well here is someone offering me a solid job with a regular paycheck which may not be exactly what i want to do but im not showing any success in doing what i want to do and this is pretty close to what i want to do i am in trouble and i will take this job also john lloyd and simon brett had paved the way for me getting the job offer and i owed it to them i started as a radio producer with hitchhikers going out and dr who shortly to go out everybody who starts as a radio producer has to start doing weekending so i produced weekending for a few weeks as the most junior member of the department i was getting all the bum jobs like a programme on the history of practical jokes which involved going out and interviewing max bygraves and des oconnor i thought what am i doing here but a lot of people had put themselves out to get me the job and it was a staff job not a contract job according to his contemporaries douglas tended to be a slightly unreliable producer he tended to think you could go on forever but even so it came as a slight shock to the department when after six months he left to become script editor of dr who this as simon brett commented put quite a few noses out of joint however he returned to radio very soon after leaving it for one final production job the radio christmas pantomime it turned out to be the project douglas most enjoyed from that time it was called black cinderella ii goes east and was co produced by john lloyd for no particular reason it was written and cast entirely from exfootlights personnel it was an excuse for such an odd bunch of people apart from the obvious ones we had john cleese playing the fairy godperson peter cook playing prince disgusting and rob buckman playing his brother prince charming the goodies graeme garden tim brooketaylor and bill oddie played the ugly sisters richard baker who used to play piano in footlights was the narrator and john pardoe mp who was then deputy leader of the liberal party played the fairytale liberal prime minister on the grounds that you only get liberal prime ministers in fairytales jo kendall played the wicked stepmother it was terrific but for some reason the bbc and the radio times gave it no publicity at all and it was buried without a trace after slightly less than six months douglass first proper job had come to an end have tardis will travel it has already been mentioned that while hitchhikers was still in the pilot stage douglas found himself with time on his hands during which he needed money and work so once it looked like i had a finished script i thought where else can i generate some work i sent the hitchhikers script to the then dr who script editor bob holmes who thought it was interesting and said come in and see me this was just as bob whod been script editor there for a long time was on the verge of leaving and handing over to tony reed so i met the two of them and graham williams the producer and talked about ideas the one i came up with that they thought was promising was the pirate planet so i went away and did a bit of work on it and they thought it was promising but there was something wrong so i did more reworking and took it back and they still thought it was promising but needed more work and this was going on for weeks and eventually the inevitable happened the plan had been to do some dr who work as a fillin until hitchhikers was ready to go into production and the rest of the hitchhikers scripts needed to be written as a plan this was an abysmal failure at the end of august the six scripts for hitchhikers were commissioned within the week four episodes of dr who were also commissioned this was the start of a period of non stop work confusion and panic that was to last for the next three years the pirate planet was a less than successful story which managed to mix such elements as a telepathic gestalt of yellow robed psychics a bionic pirate captain a planet that ate planets and a centuriesgone evil queen imprisoned in time stasis into a bit of a mess the plot elements had obviously been worked out carefully then edited down to the point of incomprehensibility by the time they reached the screen there were hitchhikers in jokes there were some appalling performances there was a murderous robotic parrot it was teeming with ideas and might have made a fairly decent sixparter douglas adams still has a soft spot for it as he explains in a way i preferred writing the dr who scripts to hitchhikers because i would be made to get the plot straight first in the pirate planet the plot was much more tightly worked out than was apparent in the final show because it had to be cut back so far in terms of time but actually getting the mechanics to work at that time i really loved and felt very frustrated that a lot of that didnt show in the final thing doubtless if he ever did the novelisation he would put back those elements lost in the television screening the dr who people were impressed enough to offer douglas a job as script editor he had only just been given a job as a radio producer he did not know what to do id only just taken this job in radio and it seemed a pretty awful thing to do to leave after six months and go to television i got very mixed up about that i didnt know what to do various people gave me conflicting advice some people said this is obviously what you must do because its much more along the line of what you claim as your strengths and other people said you cant desert radio immediately just like that david hatch said the latter to me very strongly because he was head of the department and he had given me the job but i did take the job and the next person to desert the department was david hatch which made me feel a little better remembering his experiences with the pirate planet douglas assumed that the writing of the scripts and coming up with the ideas was the responsibility of the writer and that the script editors job was chiefly that of making sure that the scripts arrived and were twentyfive minutes long then i discovered that other writers assumed that getting the storyline together was the script editors job so all that year i was continually working out storylines with writers helping others with scripts doing substantial rewrites on other scripts and putting yet other scripts into production all simultaneously it was a nightmare year for the four months that i was in control it was terrific having all these storylines in your head simultaneously but as soon as you stop actually coping then it becomes a nightmare at that time i was writing the book scriptediting the next series of dr who there were the stage productions of hitchhikers going on and the records were being made i was writing the second series of hitchhikers and i was very close to blowing a fuse at the time i was also doing some radio production with john lloyd the work overload was absolutely phenomenal the overload was also reflected in douglass dissatisfaction with dr who at that time the crazy thing about dr who one of the things that led to my feelings of frustration was doing twentysix episodes a year with one producer and one script editor its a workload unlike any other drama series if you are doing a police series say you know what a police car looks like what the streets look like what criminals do with dr who with every story you have to reinvent totally but be entirely consistent with whats gone before twentysix shows each of which has to be new in some extraordinary way was a major problem and there was no money to do it with in real terms dr whos budget has been shrinking but somehow or other you have to deliver the goods twentysix a year is too many i was going out of my tiny mind douglas wrote three dr who stories although only two were actually screened the first was the pirate planet the second was the city of death cowritten with graham williams the producer the third is the legendary lost dr who story shada the city of death was broadcast under the departmental pseudonym of david agnew and was writcen in the following circumstances when i was script editor one of our regular stalwart writers turned out to have been having terrible family problems his wife had left him and he was in a real turmoil hed done his best but he didnt have a script that was going to work and we were in deep trouble this was friday and the producer came to me and said weve got a director coming on monday we have to have a new fourepisode show by monday so he took me back to his place locked me in his study and hosed me down with whisky and black coffee for a few days and there was the script because of the peculiar circumstances and writers guild laws it meant that it had to go out under the departmental name of david agnew it was set in paris and had all sorts of bizarre things in it including a guest appearance by john cleese in the last episode the city of death in contrast to douglass first script was an adult and intelligent script in which little was redundant or unnecessary the humour is never forced and it is obviously being written by a dr who veteran not a newcomer in addition to the cameo appearances of john cleese and eleanor bron in the last episode it contains no less than seven mona lisas all of which are genuine although six have this is a fake written underneath the paint in felt pen and life on earth having been created by the explosion of an alien spaceship something the doctor must go back in time to prevent being prevented it also contains a detective that douglas still has high regard for this story can be seen from the fact that certain plot elements were reused in douglass first nonhitchhikers novel dirk gentlys holistic detective agency as were some elements of shada a six part story that was abandoned halfway through the production because of industrial problems once you get beyond a certain point it becomes more expensive to remount the thing than it is to do the whole production again from the word go thats because when you are casting youre doing it from whos available when you remount you have to cast the people youve already got and this becomes terribly difflcult shada was a return to cambridge for douglas and the doctor featuring a retired time lord whose tardis was his study and a book that held the secrets to the time lord prison planet the scripts for shada show an amusing and intelligent show although adamss script is far more comfortable with the temporal confusion of professor chronotis than with the villains or indeed the plot the character of chronotis the retired time lord is something else that douglas would resurrect for dirk gentlys holistic detective agency adams aroused resentment from many of the shows hard core fans who criticise his stint as script editor for resulting in a show that was too silly selfindulgent and more like a comedy than dr who should be tom bakers doctor even more than patrick troughtons was a cosmic clown always ready with a whimsical remark in the face of danger adams disagrees with this i think its slightly unfair in the things i wrote for dr who there were absurd things that happened in it and funny things but i feel that dr who is essentially a drama show and only secondarily amusing my aim was to create apparently bizarre situations and then pursue the logic so much that it became real so on the one hand someone behaves in an interesting and apparently outrageous way and you think at first that its funny then you realise that they mean it and that at least to my mind begins to make it more gripping and terrifying the trouble is that as soon as you produce scripts with some humour in them there is a temptation on the part of the people making the show to say this is a funny bit lets pull out the stops have fun and be silly one always knows as soon as someone says that that they are going to spoil it so those episodes of dr who werent best served by that way of doing the shows i can understand people saying they werent taking it seriously but in writing it i was taking it terribly seriously its just that the way you make something work is to do it for real i hate the expression tonguein cheek that means its not really funny but we arent going to do it properly douglas worked on dr who for fifteen months during the course of this time he wrote the first hitchhikers book the second radio series the theatrical adaptation produced black cinderella ii goes east and acted as script editor writer and rewrite man for the doctor at the end of this time he had much to his and no doubt everyone elses surprise not gone mad become prone to fits or to throwing himself off tall buildings by this time hitchhikers was enough of a success for douglas to give up the only proper job he had held for more than a few months so he did hg shortly after the hitchhikers radio series first went on the air douglas adams and john lloyd were approached by new english library and pan books both prominent english paperback publishers about doing a book of the series after lunching with both of them a deal was agreed with pan chiefly because they liked nick webb the editor who approached them the book was to start out on an unhappy note douglas had never written a book before and feeling nervous about it had asked john lloyd to collaborate on it john had agreed as he tells it id been working in radio very hard for five years and had gotten bored with it i could see myself a crusty old radio producer at ninety so l was very excited about the prospect of doing this book together then one night we had rather a strange conversation douglas said to me why don t you write your own novel i said but were writing this hitchhikers book together and he said i think you should write your own the next day i got his letter saying ive thought about it very hard and i want to do the thing on my own its a struggle but i want to do it my own lonely way it was the most fantastic shock as if the bottom had dropped out of my whole life wed been trying to write together for so long that when this letter came i simply could not believe it even the fact that hed written the letter at all seemed amazing seeing that we went down the pub every night and as douglas was at that time a radio producer in the office next door to me we worked six inches away from each other looking back i cant see why i reacted like that it seems the most natural thing in the world for douglas to have done it alone and dont think hitchhikers would have been the success it was if we had written it together i genuinely feel that but at the time i was shocked i didnt speak to douglas for two days and i seriously considered getting a solicitor and suing him for breach of contract then i met him in town a few days later he said hows it going i said youll be hearing from my legal representative douglas was appalled he thought i was overreacting i thought he was insensitive these are the kinds of things that start wars i saw an agent and explained to him that we had agreed to the contract and on the strength of that id drunk a lot of champagne spent the money and now wanted redress my agent phoned douglass and made some fantastic demand he said he wanted now and of hitchhikers in perpetuity so whenever the name the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was used id get when he told me about this i was shocked i hadnt wanted anything like that at the time everyone even douglass agent thought that he was in the wrong even his mum then i ran into douglas and he said what are you doing i said you told me to get an agent he said yes i told you to get an agent to write your own bloody book not to sue me for mine eventually we did a deal whereby i took half of the advance and that was the end of it but we had booked a holiday in greece that september to write the book together and i had nowhere else to go so despite all that had happened i went on holiday with douglas he stayed in his room and wrote the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and i went down to the bar and the beach and had a good time douglas showed me the first version of his first chapter and i read it and it was a vonnegut noveli told him that and he tore it up and started again and after that it started to come good i have always thought the books were the best bits of hitchhikers by miles you could see that they are so original and so different that it was obvious that he had made the right decision a number of other things occurred on this holiday the most notable of which was the creation of what was to become the meaning of liff but that will be told in its place as douglas explains it was very silly on the one hand i thought it might be a nice idea to collaborate and on sober reflection i thought no i can do it myself it was my own project and i had every right to say no ill do it myself john had helped me out and been very well rewarded for the work i rashly talked about collaborating and changed my mind i was within my rights but i should have handled it better you see on the one hand johnny and i are incredibly good friends and have been for ages but on the other hand we are incredibly good at rubbing each other up the wrong way we have these ridiculous fights when im determined to have a go at him and he is determined to have a go at me so i think it was an overreaction on his part but on the other hand the entire history of our relationship has been one or the other over reacting to something the other has done so douglas wound up receiving a advance for his first book he would get over five hundred times that amount as an advance for his fifth novel when the series had started bbc publications were offered the idea of doing the book and quite sensibly turned it down after the contracts were signed with pan bbc publications asked to see the scripts since it had occurred to them that they might possibly do a book of hitchhiker s on being told that pan had already bought the book rights bbc publications asked bitterly why the book had not been offered to them arthur you know i cant quite get used to the feeling that just because ive spent all my life on the earth i am therefore an ignorant country bumpkin trillian dont worry arthur its just a question of perspective arthur but if i suddenly accosted a spider i found crawling under my bed and tried to explain to this innocent spider in its spider world all about the common market or new york or the history of indo china trillian what arthur it would think id gone mad trillian well arthur its not just perspective you seeim trying to make a point about the basic assumptions of life trillian oh arthur you see trillian i prefer mice to spiders anyway arthur is there any tea on this spaceship dialogue cut from the first series as with everything douglas had done the book was late apocryphal stories have grown up about douglas adamss almost superhuman ability to miss deadlines upon close inspection they all appear to be true the story about the first book is this after he had been writing it for as long past the deadline as he could get away with pan books telephoned douglas and said how many pages have you done he told them how long have you got to go he told them well they said making the best of a bad job finish the page you are on and well send a motorbike round to pick it up in half an hour many people have complained that the first book ends rather abruptly that is the main reason why although it is also true that douglas knew he was going to have to keep the radio episodes five and six back for the end of the second book if there was a second book meanwhile pan were going through the normal pre production actions of publishing getting covers designed accumulating quotes from celebrities to put on the covers wondering how many copies they would sell the initial print run of copies betrayed a healthy optimism about sales and showed that the publishers knew they were not dealing with just a new science fiction book for which an initial print run is more like but with something slightly special the earliest promoted cover design showed a flash gordontype in a bulky spacesuit with his thumb stuck out holding a sign that said in crude letters alpha centauri it was not used although it was distributed on fliers at the world science fiction convention douglas had suggested a number of people who might be willing to give cover blurbs for hitchhikers to pan these included the monty python team tom baker and science fiction writers christopher priest and john brunner none of these blurbs were ever used although terry jones from python turned in at least a page of possible quotes these included the funniest book i have ever read today terry jones every word is a gem its only the order theyre put in that worries me terry jones space age comedy for everone except for insert the name of the man who writes worse poetry than the vogons and whose name i cant remember terry jones probably the funniest book in the universe terry jones dictated by d adams one of the funniest books ever to have quoted what i said about it on the cover terry jones in the end the only quotes used were in some press releases really entenaining and fun john cleese and it changed my whole life its literally out of this world tom baker the final cover design by hipgnosis and lan wright better known for their record covers than their book covers was ideal and provided a uniformity of design with the first record which was released at the same time as the book during the second week of october the front cover showed the title in friendly red letters and on the back the words dont panic appeared in a similar colourvideoscreenstyle typeface it is worth commenting here on the anomalies of the title the mould was cast by adams on his original threepage outline for the series which was titled the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy but referred to the book as the hitchhikers guide throughout the cover of the first book included the hyphen but lost the apostrophe while the spine back and insides wrote hitch and hikers as two words the tradition continues to the present day british copies of so long and thanks for all the fish for example hyphenated hitchhiker on the cover but wrote it hitch hiker inside while the radio scripts book hyphenated all the way through except at the back where advertisements appear for the book under both titles with hyphens and without in america the problem is very sensibly avoided by referring to it as hitchhiker without a hyphen and making it into one word the matter will not be referred to again the book went straight to number one on the bestseller lists and stayed there this surprised a number of people not least douglas adams nobody thought that radio had that much impact but it does i think a radio audience has a greater overlap with a solid reading audience than television does all power to radio its a good medium within the next three months the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy sold over a quarter of a million copies douglas sent a note to booksellers when sales reached i can only assume that you have all been giving away pound notes with every copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy or possibly even sending press gangs out into the streets because i have just been officially notified that the sales have now passed the point of being merely absurd and have now moved into the realms of the ludicrous whatever you have been doing to get rid of them thank you very much although later douglas was to express dissatisfaction with the instant success of the first book it was like going from foreplay to orgasm with nothing in the middle where do you go after that at the time he was jubilant the beauty of hitchhikers was that it came at just the right time the success of star wars and close encounters of the third kind had created a willingness among the public to regard science fiction as an acceptable form of entertainment science fiction readers had long been in need of something that was actually funny and the radio audience who picked up the book discovered very quickly that there was far more in the first book than there had been in the radio series in fact it can come as something of a surprise relistening to the original radio series to discover quite how many of the more familiar aspects of hitchhikers were not in it towels for example the book garnered rave reviews douglas found himself compared to kurt vonnegut a comparison that was to persist until the release of vonneguts galapagos in at which point some reviewers stated comparing vonnegut slightly unfavourably to douglas adams and the book found itself on many critics years best lists for if the radio series had been a cult success then the book took hitchhikers beyond that to a place in the popular consciousness it was not long before a lot of people found their perceptions of towels white mice and the number fortytwo had undergone a major readjustment why was hitchhikers so successful john lloyd its what william goldman in his book adventures in the screen trade calls a nonrecurrent phenomenon before hitchhikers came along there was no reason why it should and once its there it seems the perfect idiom for its time i dont know why but it catches the spirit of the moment the title says it all for me with hitchhiking and galaxies you have this curious mixture of posthippie sensibilities and being interested in high tech digital technology and all that stuff but its impossible to say why hitchhikers is so successful its just one of these great original products of a diseased mind it makes no concessions to popularity it just gets on and does it not once has douglas toned the thing down so it would sell more copies douglas really was as surprised by its success as anyone he had no idea whether it was any good or not he used to sit around going is this good is this funny what do you think of this script he really didnt know but you cant explain it and because you cant you cant write another book like it and thats what makes it a work of genius jacqueline graham because it was such a wholly original idea and you dont get too many of those and because it was funny but intelligently funny and because it started as a sort of cult thing mostly because its so original and secondly because it makes you laugh geoffrey perkins i know at the time we made the radio series i felt that it was the logical successor to monty python really theres no doubt that hitchhikers appeals to the same kind of audience and has the same sort of comedy that was an initial reason for the success the title plays an important part somebody once described it in an article as a programme somewhat clumsily entitled the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which is a very erroneous judgement i knew it hit a nerve from the start when the letters started pouring in the timing was obviously good it was star wars time there was a lot of interest in space also when people think of space they tend to think of something very comicstrip and here was something very erudite and witty that surprised people but it appealed to everyone the intellectuals compared it to swift and the fourteenyearolds enjoyed hearing depressed robots clanking around all the galaxys a stage there have been three major productions of hitchhikers in the theatrical world two of these have been successful the other was a disaster of epic proportions it is somewhat unfortunate in this case that the disaster is the one that got noticed the first production was put on at the ica institute for contemporary arts in london on stth may presented by ken campbells science fiction theatre company of liverpool staged might be the wrong word for this production the actors performed on little ledges and platforms while the audience seated on a scaffolded auditorium that floated around the ica on air skates filled with compressed air was pushed around the hall at the height of th of an inch by hardworking stage hands the minutelong show was a great success pan galactic gargle blasters were on sale in the bar and for the people who fitted into mike husts airborne seating system it was a great evening unfortunately every hour brought phone calls for tickets all doomed to failure as the tickets for the shows run had been sold out long before it opened apparently an organisation with the same initials as the ica the international communications association got so fed up with misrouted calls for tickets that they wound up closing their switchboard for a week and stopped communicating the reviews were unanimous in their praise a typical review from the guardian having praised the costumes and hovercraft stated chris langham is an utterly ordinary arthur and is thus a beautiful counterpart to the cunning ford the twoheaded schizophrenic beeblebrox mitch davies and stephen williams as a spaceage version of a pantomime horse with two heads two legs and three hands and the pyrotechnics of campbells production at the time it was announced that they were hoping to revive the show as soon as they could find a hall large enough to accommodate a seater hovercraft this was it should be borne in mind before the publication of the book or the release of the first record when nobody knew how much of a cult success hitchhikers was or was going to be the next performance began life some miles due west in the theatr clwyd a welsh theatre company director jonathan petherbridge had taken the scripts of the first radio series and transformed them into a play performed around wales from th january until rd february announced as the first staged production of douglas adamss original radio scripts the company would either perform two episodes an evening or on certain long evenings the entire three hours of script in blockbuster performances during which essential space rations were handed out to the audience at halfhourly intervals not only did the bar sell pan galactic gargle blasters but the coffee lounge sold algolian zylbatburgers the theatr clwyd performance was so successful that they were offered the opportunity to take their production to londons prestigious old vic theatre unfortunately by this time douglas had offered the stage rights to ken campbell who had decided to stage another production at the rainbow theatre in london a rock venue that seated people in august douglas adams displaying perfect hindsight says i should have known better but i had so many problems to contend with at that time i really wasnt thinking clearly the thing at the rainbow was a fiasco douglas wrote additional material for the play including the dish of the day sequence in milliways which subsequently found its way into the literary and televisual version of the show an article appeared in the stage the theatrical newspaper about the rainbow production in july a fivepiece band backs the twentystrong cast of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy a musical based on the radio series that opens at the rainbow for an e week run on july th production has a budget and the front of the rainbow will be redesigned as an intergalactic spaceport tickets and the foyer of the theatre is being converted into the control deck of a spaceship with banks of video screens flying saucers hanging from the ceiling and possibly a talking computer to advise passengers when the trip is going to begin there will be usherettes dressed like aliens probably coloured green says coproducer richard dunkley and a space bar selling galacticsized burgers and the now famous pan galactic gargle blaster one of the diversions will be rock musician rick wakeman soaring down from the roof on a flying saucer and dressed like the legendary mekon sfs most endearing little green man this week workmen installed a vast revolving stage while others completed a backdrop for the day the earth gets demolished in california the people who brought the laserium to the london planetarium were devising a spectacular new bag of tricks coproducer philip tinsley said this will be the first show since rocky horror to appeal directly to young people as the publicity for the show gained momentum a foot inflatable whale was thrown off tower bridge into the thames and made almost no splash in terms of news the police were very very cross said the standard in the of an inch they devoted to it then the show opened in retrospect this may have been a mistake such descriptions as i cannot imagine a more tedious way to spend an evening clumsy without ever being cheerful embarrassing neverending and extremely boring melt into insignificance when placed beside the actual reviews most of which dissected the show with fine and sharp scalpels and left nothing wholesome behind a fairly average example of the putdowns was michael billingtons in the guardian which stated that what happens on the rainbow stage is certainly inchoate and barely comprehensible ken campbell has directed this junkopera and i can only say he gave us infinitely more fun in the days of his roadshow when the highlight used to be a man stuffing a ferret down his trousers what went wrong a number of things the length for one the laser beams sound effects and backing band for another what was almost universally acknowledged as appalling acting for a third douglas adams explained it as the size of the rainbow a seater theatre and because hitchhiker s tends to be rather slowmoving and what is important is all the detail on the way you put it in something that size and the first thing that goes out the window is all the detail so you then fill it up with earthquake effects and lasers and things that further swamps the detail and so everything was constantly being pushed in the wrong direction and all the poor actors were stuck on the stage trying desperately to get noticed by the audience across this vast distance if youd put the numbers we were getting into a west end theatre they would have been terrific audiences a night or whatever but people isnt much when the producers are paying for seats so the whole thing was a financial disaster ken campbell a man almost impossible to get hold of claimed the reason for the success of the ica and failure of the rainbow was simpler than that in the ica we put everybody on a hovercraft we just never found a hovercraft big enough for the rainbow he told me in the shortest interview i did for this book four weeks into the run the show was in financial difficulties on th august the standard reported coproducer dunkley as saying i think we should struggle on the cast and crew agree with me and a certain number of them agreed to wait for their money we had a very negative press and it wasn t known at the beginning how many hitchhikers fans there were the next day however the standard reported that last night the big musical version of the cult radio show did not go on and after playing at times to twenty percent capacity ie people its season has been ended three weeks prematurely richard dunkley reported that everybody concerned had lost a lot of money but it was impossible to say how much it is easy to be wise after the event but it would appear that the biggest mistake was that of trying to create a cult success you dont gain a cult following for something big and bold and heavily hyped a smaller less flashy less expensive production might well have succeeded where the galumphing rainbow production failed as indeed it has helping the fans and public to get over the rainbow disaster was the theatr clwyd production it surfaced again quietly a year later and has been regularly and successfully staged since this production which alone of all post versions includes the haggunenon sequence and indeed actually has an inflatable ravenous bugblatter beast of traal is uniformly popular with critics and public alike and will one hopes still be revived and performed when the rainbow fiasco has completely been forgotten ford and zaphod zaglabor astragard hootrimansion bambriar bangliatur poosbladoooo arthur what the hell are you doing ford its an ancient betelgeuse death anthem it means after this things can only get better they start to sing again the computer bank explodes end credits alternative version childish pointless codswalloping drivel on monday st january at pm the second series of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy went on the air it was heralded by a cover feature in the bbc television and radio listings magazine radio times it is almost unheard of for a radio programme to get such exposure despite the name of the magazine and the five episodes were broadcast at the same time every evening through the week this caused problems to begin with as already detailed at length in douglas was under a great deal of pressure as far as other work commitments were concerned and his normal tendency to put off writing until the last deadline had safely passed was displayed in full when it came to getting the scripts written however when he had agreed to produce the second radio series geoffrey perkins had taken this into account perkins went on holiday in september and before leaving spoke to david hatch controller of radio about the new series hatch wanted to know if they could have the second series of hitchhikers ready to be broadcast in january there had already been a seventh episode of hitchhikers the christmas special recorded on th november and broadcast on christmas eve it had been recorded as a oneoff but had basically taken the plot strands from the end of episode six ie everybody was either stranded back in time with no hope of ever returning or had been eaten by a carboncopy of the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal and had started them off in a different direction which involved zaphods mysterious quest to find the guy who was running the universe this christmas programme was basically done by my moving into douglass flat he scribbled upstairs and i was downstairs typing thats how we got that together geoffrey perkins fit the eighth the first episode of the second series reunited zaphod ford and arthur recording of the second series had begun in may so hatchs request for the show to begin in january was not really that unreasonable geoffrey perkins thought it was a good idea we were working on them at a fairly leisurely pace and i said yes we needed a deadline or we could have gone on till the crack of doom i thought well have made three episodes by then and well do the rest of them over the next five weeks then i went on holiday i came back to find david had done a deal with the radio times they would put us on the front cover if all the shows went out in a week it was madness really the second radio series was onerous for everybody for douglas adams it was especially difficult i was terrified of doing the second series because the first time it was just me in my own private little world writing this thing nobody expected it to be any good the second series the eyes of the world were upon me it was like running down the street naked because it had suddenly become everyone elses property as well due to the deadlines there was another problem much of the second series was a first draft for the first series douglas had written and rewritten selfediting mercilessly on the second series there simply wasnt the time while fit the eighth had been started on th may fit the twelfth was still being mixed shortly before it was due to be broadcast on th january the recordings soon reached the point at which the cast had caught up with the author they were recording part of the show in one part of the studio while i was in another part of the studio actually writing the next scene and this escalated to the point where the last show was being mixed in maida vale about half an hour before it was due to be broadcast from broadcasting house at which point the tape got wound round the capstan and they had to take the tape recorder apart to unwind it then get it onto a motorbike to be taken to broadcasting house at one point we nearly sent them the first half of the tape then we were going to unwind the second half and get it down to broadcasting house before they had finished playing the first half geoffrey perkins paddy kingsland and lisa braun all deserved medals for that the reviews for the series were almost all excellent despite the fact that many of the reviewers had only heard extracts from the six episodes due to the fact that the bits they didnt hear hadnt yet been mixed but noone was going to tell the reviewers that the only voice raised against the series came from mr arthur butterworth who wrote to the radio times saying in just about years of radio and latterly tv listening and watching this strikes me as the most fatuous inane childish pointless codswallopping drivel it is not even remotely funny the radio times cover feature was a source of satisfaction to the cast and crew but an irritant to geoffrey perkins who felt the article was abysmal and overwritten and requested that certain changes be made in it before it was printed to prevent us all from looking like idiots a discussion on radio s critics forum programme found the panel of critics ranged between enthusiasm and bafflement perhaps the most perceptive comment was that of robert cushman the chairman who said the sort of effect that a monty python programme actually has of making everything that appears immediately after it on radio or television or whatever seem absolutely ludicrous it does have that marvellous cleansing thing about it the second radio series contained some excellent sequences some of which like the body debit cards and the robot disco have not been repeated elsewhere other sections were unwieldy and overly strung out the shoe material for example which correctly merited about half a page when it appeared in book form overall though it was less successful than the first series something douglas planned to sort out when he wrote the second book level when the paperback of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy appeared the last page instead of carrying the usual advertisements for other titles by the same publisher carried an advert that read dont panic megadodo publications in association with original records brought you the double lp of the radio series fill out the form and send it off with your cheque or postal order attached despite the fact that it might well have meant the loss of chapter a large number of people sent off for their mailorder copies of a record called the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy a number of record companies had expressed interest in making the vinyl version of the show following the radio broadcasts one company had already got an option on it but since they were not doing anything with it original records stepped in and got the recording rights geoffrey perkins says of the first record it was very difficult we knew it was going to be a double album but we could not very well put half an hour on each side so we sat down and worked out reluctantly which bits to cut i was very happy with it there were a number of things that were improvements like the voice treatments and when trillian says please relax and we put this lovely little tune behind it the infinite improbability sequence itself had only a fraction of the elements that went into the same scene on the radio series but its actually far more telling because theyre clear on radio we had thought that if we threw absolutely everything in it would come out fascinating instead it came out a complete jumble there were bits of everything in it people had left records around in the studio from a previous show and we put a bit of that on anything lying around but when we mixed it all together it was a jumble and a lot of it was completely dropped it was a definite wankoff the cast of the radio show was almost the same as that of the record although the late valentine dyall radios man in black replaced geoffrey mcgivern as deep thought he was also to play gargravarr with a similar voice treatment in the second series considering the record was only available by mail order at least initially it sold amazingly well over units were sold in the first year and it made a number of the music charts the cover was an expanded version of the hipgnosis book cover including some entries from the guide that have never appeared elsewhere the record essentially covered the first four episodes of the radio series edited down somewhat the second record the restaurant at the end of the universe was slightly less successful geoffrey perkins again we all found the first record a very interesting experience by the time we got to the second record it was less so partially because none of us had been paid for the first record now a lot of people like the second record because its more definitive and much more complete than the first unfortunately that is because it is far too long on each side its just a rough cut we had decided to leave it a few days and come back and edit it with a fresh mind i went up to edinburgh for the festival and when i came back three days later they had rushed through the record and cut it i felt it was flabby and i wanted to speed it up very long on both sides and full of blah perkins is still a fan of the first record the nice thing about doing the record was you stuck in bits that you knew people could only pick up on the second or third time through whereas the radio transmission had to be clear the first time in terms of plot the second record is most similar to the last two episodes of the tv series the haggunenon material is missing replaced by disaster areas stuntship the cover of the second record showed a yellow rubber duck presumably in deference to the b ark captains immortal comment that one is never alone with a rubber duck as a publicity stunt related to the duck theme on the release of the second record the window of the hmv record shop in londons oxford street was filled by a display that involved a bathtub filled with twelve live weekold ducklings the stunt brainchild of original records director don mousseau finished rather earlier than expected when complaints were received from animal welfare groups when released in the us the records carried the text of a version of how to leave the planet the two albums were not the only hitchhikerconnected records though

that as a single if the life the universe and everything radio series ever gets made listeners may finally get to hear it a fairly complete listing of all the songs used in hitchhikers can be found in the radio scripts book of mice and men and tired tv producers at pirst i wasnt that interested in doing a visual version of hitchhikers but while i was working on dr who i began to realise that we have an enormous amount of special effects stuff which is simply not being used as it might be if it turns out the way im beginning to visualise it i think it could actually look very extraordinary douglas adams the hitchhiker television series was not a happy production there was a personality clash between myself and the director and between the cast and the director and between the tea lady and the director douglas adams television episode three model shot the heart of gold speeding through a murky sky very few of mice and men and tired tv producers stars and what stars there are are

zaphod hey what trillian you called it the most improbable planet that ever existed into opening credits draft opening to episode three of tv series the television version of hitchhikers begins with a computer readout of time remaining until the end of the world while the sun rises over a quiet english landscape the computer printout was faked so was the english landscape what the audience saw was imitation computer readout while a light bulb was lifted over a model of a landscape the ingenuity and the casual faking of something that seems so natural exemplify the six television episodes of hitchhikers for many people the first perhaps the only exposure to hitchhikers came from the bbc television series certainly it was responsible from its first airing in on bbc for millions of extra sales of the books the idea was first mooted in late by john lloyd associate producer of the television series he explains i was in tv at the time of the tv show and i had done one series of not the nine oclock news and i was looking around for something new to do i didnt know at that time that ntnocn was going to be the absurd success that it became so i was wondering what to do next and hitchhikers was the obvious thing it had been a great success on radio and would obviously be great fun to do visually douglas and i had always been fascinated by science fiction now this was before star wars and all that were still back in the time when people said that science fiction would never get anywhere commercially anyway i wrote to my head of department saying theres this great radio series it would make great tv its just what i want to do he told me he didnt know anything about it so i wrote him a memo saying what hitchhikers had done and how it had been nominated for a hugo award and how it had been repeated more times than any other programme in history that it had been a stage show and a bestselling book this huge long list of credits he said all right lets give it a go and he commissioned the first script which douglas wrote it was an extraordinarily good script douglas had done what he did earlier with the books which was to turn the radio series into something which you would never know had been based on a radio show lt used the medium to the fullest my boss said that it was the best light entertainment script he had ever read he was that excited as i remember alan bell started off as director and i was producer for the first episode although it shaded into a co production as i didnt have much experience with tv budgeting but then the bbc went and scheduled the second series of not the nine oclock news on top of the recording of hitchhikers ntnocn was a real seven days a week job and i couldnt do both i was really angry about it i felt at the time like the bbc felt that they didnt want the junior producer in the department to have two successes at once so they used hitchhikers to give someone else some work i was really furious as i became perforce associate producer which meant nothing i didnt have any clout at the bbc being just a junior producer on attachment theoretically they could have sent me back to radio i said id try to keep an eye on the occasional recording and rehearsal but frankly i didnt have the time and basically i had nothing to do with the tv show alan bell made a big point of this in the tv show as when my credit comes up in the titles it explodes and shoots off into space really the only thing i did on the tv series was writing the original memo and being in on a few early discussions to get things moving and the bbc corporate machinations booted me out lloyd has mixed feelings about the director and producer of the series alan jw bell and on how the television shows eventually turned out i didnt like working with alan hes one of this breed of tv producers who im not saying he isnt hardworking because he is but he wouldnt ever run over time or overspend he just wanted to get the job done hes less interested in the script or the performance than he is in the logistics of how the programme gets made in some of the rehearsals i attended actors were saying the words in the wrong order and mispronouncing them and alan wouldnt correct them he was much more interested in the technical side and technically he knew an awful lot he was very bold and brave on the technical side some of the actual shots in hitchhikers are wonderful but it didnt work for me as a comic performance because it wasnt being directed they hadnt got old perkins there hes a real nittygritty man the sort who would spend hours getting one sound effect right worrying about the script and the attitude and all that things which alan would see as trivial and irritating i remember going to the editing of the pilot and there were some terrible edits and i told alan he had to go back and do it again because it just didnt work his attitude was we havent got any time weve got to go on personally i think hitchhikers on tv was not all it could have been if it had been done properly it would have won all the awards and the only evidence there is that it was a really original show are the computer graphics reading the scripts youd think suddenly television has gone into the s this is unbelievable but then most of the performances and filming were nowhere near as good as say dr who alan is not a great original mind douglas is to give alan bell credit it was a difficult job to do logistically and you cant belgium with tv the way you can with radio the way geoffrey would keep going till the last minute and keep actors hanging around while stuff was written you cant do that with tv theres a limit there does have to be a grip on things which douglas well ive coproduced things with him on radio and he does tend to be a bit daffy he tends to think you can go on forever i suppose hes been a bit spoiled alan did get the thing onto the air which probably douglas would never have done and i cant say that i would have done either it was the first time that douglas had worked with someone on hitchhikers who he felt was less than sympathetic to his ideas and work he wanted john lloyd as producer and he wanted geoffrey perkins around the radio people he knew understood hitchhikers this was not to be alan bell was a television person and had as he admits little time for people from radio who attempted to tell him his job geoffrey perkins explains television people tend to think that radio people dont know anything which has an element of truth in it but they tend to know more about scripts than people in tv ever do and the tv people tended to think that douglas didnt know what he was talking about now on radio when douglas burbled one could say okay might try that or no shut up but the tv attitude was that he didnt know what he was talking about i read the first tv script and i thought it was one of the best scripts id ever seen hed thought up all that graphics stuff it was absolutely brilliant ask people what they remember best of the hitchhikers tv series and the answer is usually the computer graphics the graphics sequences apparently from the screen of the actual hitchhikers guide were incredibly detailed apparently computercreated animated graphics full of sight gags and in jokes and presumably designed for people with freezeframe and slowmotion videos since there was no way one could pick up on the complexities of the graphics sequences in a single watching at normal speed would one have noticed for example the cartoons of douglas adams himself posing as a sirius cybernetics corporation advertising executive writing hard in the dolphin sequence and in drag as paula nancy millstone jennings abound douglas played this part because the actor who was meant to be doing it was moving house that day and an hour away from filming douglas stepped into the breach as it were during the filming of the series and while he wasnt running naked into the sex douglas generally sat in a deckchair and did crosswords sometimes according to a number of the netors and technicians he fell off the chair although none of them were quite sure why could one have picked up on all the names and phone numbers of some of the best places in the universe to purchase or dry out from a pan galactic gargle blaster one of the phone numbers in the graphics of episode six was that of a leading computer magazine who phoned pearce studios responsible for the graphics to ask which computer it was done on and whether a flatscreen television was built into the book prop used on the show the comment beside the phone number was not flattering the computer graphics were all done by hand in january animator and science fiction fan kevin davies was working for pearce studios in hanwell west london when he heard the blipping and bleeping of star wars droid rd from the bbc cutting rooms down the corridor he wandered down to the cutting rooms and met alan jw bell at that point engaged in cutting a sequence of jimll fix it in which a child got to visit the star wars set bell discovered in davies not only a hitchbikers fan with communicable enthusiasm but also through davies he discovered pearce studios led by rod lord who were commissioned to do the graphics for the tv show their quote for episode one was half that of the bbcs own animation department while the trial section produced by the bbcs own animators was so appalling it was unusable pearce studios under animator rod lord did not possess a graphics computer what they did have was animators who worked in a very computerish style warning technical bit how it was done the sound track of peter joness voice was broken down for timing and notes of frame numbers per line of dialogue were taken pencil drawings were made then punched acetate cels were laid on top and the pictures were traced with pens the lettering was a combination of dry transfer and set on an ibm typewriter the artwork would then be photographically reversed out to clear letters and drawings on black backgrounds these were back lit under an ordinary mm film rostrum camera the colour being added with filter gels each line of lettering and each colour required a separate exposure and a separate piece of artwork the babel fish sequence for example needed about a dozen passes under the camera the main difference between this animation and the more usual version was that instead of animating a single frame per drawing several frames at a time were taken to give any moving objects the slightly jerky staggered feel that people expect from computer graphics the television series was entered into the innovation category at the golden rose of montreux tv festival it won absolutely nothing the golden rose went to the usmade baryshnikov on broadzaray in case anyone is interested and apparently left foreign audiences confused and reeling at home it did rather better in the bafta awards for hitchhikers received two of the ten awards rod lord gained a bafta award for the graphics and michael mccarthy received one for being sound supervisor of hitchhiker s end of technical bit i asked paddy kingsland responsible for most of the music and sound effects in the tv series and the pilot for the radio series as well as the second radio series what was so special about the hitchhikers sound effects and what the differences were between radio sound and tv sound i suppose the difference between doing tv and radio was that for radio theyd say we need the end of the world as a sound effect go away and do it on tv the end of the world is composed of hundreds of shots with a closeup of the vogon ship then a closeup of screaming crowds a shot of a laser in space and so on you dont just have one sound effect you have a bit of this and a bit of that ending with a bang which actually then cuts off because youre back inside the spaceship again very quickly the shape is all finished and all you can do is do stuff to fit the pictures that have been done i thought the tv show was good in parts i thought the computer graphic stuff was very good very well thought out and some of the performances were marvellous but inevitably there were things that didnt hang together too well its a problem you get when you mix together film and tv studios and doing it all to a deadline theres no time to sit back and look at the thing and say is that all right and if it isnt to do it again i dont think it had the magic of the radio series because you could see everybody like zaphods extra head that was one of the more spectacular failures of the tv show a tatty prop can be amusing but if you dont have the money to do it right its sometimes better not to do it at all i was pleased with the sound effects of the tv series however it was the detail that did it alan bell had everybody miked up with radio mikes to start with so that they only got the voices of the people and none of the exterior effects so we did things like overdubbing all the footsteps in the spaceships which is never done for british tv to give the effect of them walking through spaceships we got a couple of beer kegs from the bbc club and actually walked around on the beer kegs while watching the screen so when theyre walking along you get these metallic footsteps instead of the rather unconvincing wooden ones you would have got it took ages to do but it paid off i did all the effects for the computer graphics the film would arrive with nothing except for peter joness voice i had to go through it doing all the sound effects and the music tracks as well all the little beeps and explosions and things which took ages to do quite timeconsuming the tv series was interesting to work on although frankly i preferred the radio series the necessity of getting the hitchhikers scripts to the screen somewhere within the budget was responsible for a certain amount of technical innovation alan bell is proudest of his development of a new special effects process of doing glass shots a glass shot in cinematic tradition consists of erecting a tower with a painting done on glass high in the studio then filming through it thus giving the illusion that the glass painting is part of the picture the long shot of the vogon hold in the first episode for example was done like this its a complicated fiddly and expensive process bells solution was simple scenes requiring matte shots were filmed or taped then a photographic blowup of one frame would be made from the photos paintings would be made the paintings would be photographed as slides and the previously filmed segment would be matched up and inlaid into the painted shot this was quicker and easier than painting on glass and is perhaps best displayed in the pier at southend sequence when only a small section of the pier was built in the studio the rest is a perfectly aligned matte painting the plot of the television series is nearest to the plot of the two records from magrathea the travellers are blown straight to milliways and leaving there in a stolen stunt ship we follow arthur and ford to prehistoric earth where the series finishes the places where the hitchhikers tv succeeded best and failed worst were places where douglas had written something into the radio series that could not be done on television the narration sequences are an excellent example one does not need lengthy narrations on television however being stuck with them douglas needed to work out how to make them work and came up with the graphics concept as douglas explained what made it work was the fact that it is impossible to transfer radio to television we had to find creative solutions to problems in a way you wouldnt have had to if you were writing something similar for television immediately the medium dictates the style of the show and transferring from one to another means youre going against the grain the whole time its the point where you go against the grain that you come up with the best bits the bits that were the easiest to transfer were the least interesting bits of the tv show the idea of readouts from the book itself done in computer graphics form was that kind of thing so you get little drawings diagrams all the words the narrator is saying plus further expansion footnotes and little details all coming out at you from the screen you cant possibly take it all in i like the idea of a programme where when you get to the end of it you feel you didnt get it all there are so many programmes that are half an hour long and at the end of it youre half an hour further into your life with nothing to show for it if you didnt get it all thats much more stimulating i wasnt as pleased with the tv series as i was with the radio series because i missed the intimacy of the radio work television pictures stifle the picturing facilities of the mind i wanted to step over that problem by packing the screen with so much information that more thought not less was provoked by the readers sometimes what you see is less exciting than what you envisage cut to model shot of the ship the missiles are on the point of hitting it when the sky explodes with bewildering colours and a montage of totally incongruous images these should include distorted pictures of the passengers stars monkeys stapling machines trees cheese souffles in other words a brief vision of madness included should also be a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias we go back inside the bridge everything is higgledypiggeldy there are a very large number of melons lying about there is also though no one calls attention to it a goat with a scale model of the eiffel tower strapped to its head standing about this goat is never ever referred to but it will continue to be with them for most of the rest of the series zaphod what the photon happened draft script for episode three it was all too easy for douglas to give zaphod beeblebrox an extra arm and an extra head during the radio series no one ever saw him it was a oneoff throwaway line but if one has the televisual task of transforming this into something that works on the screen one thanks ones lucky stars that douglas did not give beeblebrox five heads or fifty unable to find a bicephalic actor or at least one who could learn his lines the bbc resorted to mark wingdavey zaphod on radio and built him an animatronic head and an extra arm mostly stuffed but occasionally when all hands needed to be seen to be working the hand of someone behind him sticking an extra arm out as can be seen quite clearly in the milliways sequence of episode five astonishingly enough one wall of the bridge appears to give directly out onto quite a large sunny patio with grass a deckchair a table with a large brightly coloured sunshade exotic flowers and so on seated in the deckchair with a drink is an extraordinary looking man he has two heads obviously one of these is going to be a fake unless we can find an actor prepared to undergo some very exotlc surgery the real head and the fake head should look as far as possible absolutely identical any shortcomings in the realism of the fake head should be matched by the makeup on the real one the fake should have an articulated mouth and articulated eyes draft tv script for episode two there was a problem with zaphods head it looked false and stuffed and stuck there this is not because it was a less than sterling piece of special effects work but also because things went wrong and even when they didnt the batteries tended to run down in rehearsals so by the time a scene was filmed the head just lolled around expressionlessly as douglas adams says it was a very delicate mechanism and it would work wonderfully for seconds and then break down or get stuck and to get it working properly youd have to spend an hour taking it apart and putting it back together again and we never had that hour so we fudged as best we could as mark wingdavey remembers the difficulty with the television series for me was alan bell who we all know and love i dont think he wanted the original members of the radio show at all because he wanted the freedom to pick and choose a bit but we were supposed to have first option so we came in and read for it they didnt want any input from me on the way the character would look i quite liked the final design but i refused to wear the eyepatch i said give the other head the eyepatch because im not having one its hard enough acting with another head but with one eye as well the other head was heavvvvvy very heavy i was wearing armour plating made of fibre glass and because i wanted to be able to alternate the two right arms i had a special cutout there was a little switch hidden in the circuitry of my costume which switched the head on and off we were under such pressure in the studio that occasionally i forgot to switch it on so im acting away and its just there it cost f by the way more than me costume design for the series was primarily the responsibility of dee robson a veteran bbc designer with a penchant for science fiction it was she who designed ford prefects precisely clashing clothes based on what could be found in the bbcs wardrobes and it was she who gave zaphod beeblebrox yet another additional organ examining the costume worn by mark wingdavey reveals two trouser flies and dees original costume notes explain zaphod has a double crotch padded to give effect of two organs as mark wingdavey explained i said to wardrobe youve seen mick jagger in those tight trousers make me a pair so i had these nine inch tubes down the front of the trousers for filming when we got into the studio dee came up to me to say she was worried about those things i thought they might be a bit obvious so ive cut them down to six inches one of the most famous costumes however was arthur dents a dressing gown over a pair of pajamas the dressing gown first appeared in the books following the television series there is no mention of what arthur is wearing in the first two books that arthur remained in the dressing gown throughout the tv series was alan bells idea douglas had written a sequence on board the heart of gold in which the ship designed arthur a silvery jump suit the whole sequence was scrapped and alan ensured that arthur stayed in his dressing gown as bell explained what was special about arthur was that he was in a dressing gown silver jumpsuits are what they wore in star wars alan jw bell is a bbc light entertainment director and producer having worked on such shows as maigret and panorama as a film editor he won a bafta award for terry joness and michael palins ripping yarns a bafta nomination for the longrunning geriatric comedy last of the summer wine and a royal television society award for hitchhiikers i met him initially in his office at the bbc which still contains a number of items of hitchhikers memorabilia its a show he is proud of and has many fond memories of on his desk was a small plastic fruit machine which he urged me to try i pulled the handle but nothing happened it should have squirted me with water alan pointed out to his secretary that it was her job to keep it filled and we began the interview this was bbc light entertainment the first time i heard of hitchhikers was in a bar somewhere i was asked if id heard it on the radio i hadnt so i listened to it and i thought it was marvellous inspired stuff but there was no way it could be done on tv it was all in the mind all in the imagination so about three months later i was asked to do it and i said that i thought it couldnt be done but they said were going to do it so that was it i had to do it now i work for light entertainment not drama who do dr who and have experience of things like this and we had no idea what the budgeting would be all i could do was put down what i thought it would cost and i was out by thousands of pounds for the first episode for example we had to throw away of model shots of spaceships because they wobble and they looked like models that first episode was about over budget which is vast in tv terms but it had to be done right otherwise it would have been awful the first episode of hitchhikers was made very much as a pilot and alan bell presented it to the heads of department at the bbc some of them didnt like it they didnt understand it nor for that matter did they realise it was meant to be funny and the cost of the first episode over was about four times as much as an equivalent episode of dr who in order to demonstrate the humour of the show alan bell arranged for a laugh track this was done by assembling about a hundred science fiction fans in the national film theatre playing them the first episode and taping their reaction as a warmup to this a ten minute video was played featuring peter jones reading hastily feltpenned cue cards in a bewildered fashion assuring the audience that zaphod beeblebrox would be in the next episode and with the ubiquitous kevin davies demonstrating the use of the headphones this is peter joness only onscreen appearance in the hitchhikers television series the audience loved the show laughed on cue and generally had a good time and while the bbc hierarchy had agreed that the next five episodes should be made although they were made for more like a show one reason why the sets begin to get a little rudimentary towards the end it did not insist on a laugh track this was undoubtedly a good thing as bell remembers the first episode was only a pilot but by the time we had got halfway through they had already commissioned the series but we still didnt know the resources that would be required because all we had to go on were the radio scripts when wed finished it the powers that be thought that the viewers wouldnt know that it was comedy unless we added a laughter track so we hired the national film theatre and showed it on a big screen and gave all the audience headphones so they could hear the soundtrack nice and clearly and they laughed all the way through it did help that that audience was composed of fans while much of the casting was the same on television and radio there were a few variations i wanted to keep everyone from the radio series but sometimes peoples voices dont match their physical appearance for example i wanted someone for ford prefect who looked slightly different and when i saw geoffrey mcgivern i thought he looked too ordinary ford should be human but slightly unnerving so we looked around for someone else my secretary suggested david dixon he was great but i thought wed change the colour of his eyes and make them a vivid blue so we got special tinted contact lenses which looked marvellous in real life but when it came to television the cameras just werent sensitive enough to pick up on it except in the pub scene at the beginning sandra dickinson got the part of trillian after we had interviewed about young ladies for the role none of them had performed it with the right feelings the girl had to have a sense of humour and then sandra dickinson came in and read it and made the lines more funny than any other actress whod done an audition sandra dickinson was a surprising choice for trillian the character was described in the book as a darkhaired darkcomplexioned english woman sandra played it as indeed she is in real life as a small blonde american with a squeaky husky voice as douglas adams said of her she could have done a perfect english rose voice and looking back i think perhaps we should have got her to do it but it was such a relief to find someone who could actually read trillians lines with some humour and give the character some life that we just had her do it as herself and not change a thing another surprise casting came with episode five sandras husband peter davison the fifth and blandest dr who he played the dish of the day a bovine creature which implores diners to eat it as alan bell explains sandra came to me and said that peter wanted to play a guest part in hitchhikers and she suggested the dish of the day i said you cannot put peter davison in a cow skin but she said no really he wants to do it i said ok and we booked him we didnt pay him star status he just did it for the fun of it and he played it very well early on in the press releases for hitchhikers great play was made of the fact that they would not be filming in the quarries and gravel pits in which dr who has always travelled to distant planets and they wouldnt have any of the plastic rocks that made star treks alien worlds so strangely unconvincing instead they would go abroad iceland perhaps or morocco the magrathean sequences one was assured would be filmed somewhere exotic alan bell douglas wanted us to film the magrathean sequences in iceland so i looked up the holiday brochures and it was very cold and there werent any hotels of any note but i had been to morocco years before and i remembered there was a part of morocco that was very spacelike we went to look but we had so much trouble getting through customs without cameras and we met a japanese film crew who said dont come because they deliberately delay you so youll spend more money theyd had all their equipment impounded for three weeks so we ended up in this rather nice clay pit in cornwall where we also did the beach scenes marvin playing beach ball and douglas going into the sea most of the cast and crew have memories of the cornish clay pit some of them have to do with the fact that there were no toilets down there others have to do with david learner the actor inside marvin who due to the length of time it took to get in and out of the marvin costume was abandoned in the clay pit during the occasional rain showers during filming protected from rust by an umbrella prehistoric britain was filmed in the lake district during a cold snap which meant that aubrey morris playing the captain of the b ark in his bath and the extras clad in animal skins who played the pregolgafrincham humans were all frozen to the bone and spent all their time when not on camera bundled up in blankets and drinking tea the other interesting location was that of arthurs house discovered by alan bell while driving lost around leatherhead the gate which is all one sees knocked down by a bulldozer was built especially it was while the pub scenes at the beginning were being filmed that the union troubles began for hitchhikers the precise nature of which no one seems clear on anymore but which apparently involved a trip to the pub by some members of the cast and crew which might have been recreational but which the union representatives assumed was professional and as such they felt they should have been invited or something the computer room at the end of episode four the shooty and bang bang sequence was actually filmed on henley golf course we wanted somewhere near at hand which we could build and blow up alan bell remembered it was just sufficiently out of london that we could warn the locals that if they heard a bang at two in the morning dont pay any attention to it its only us you cant see it on the show but its actually raining into the set it was open at the top union problems continued when the filming returned to the studios the milliways set was actually the biggest set theyve ever put into the bbcs biggest studio the unions said they wouldnt put the set in and we had to cut bits out which was a pity but the way we filmed it you never saw it all at once anyway just parts at a time my reason for that was that well if youve ever watched a variety show theyll spend all their money on a set the singer sings the camera pulls back and you see the set and song after song you see the set and you get bored with it so i said when we do hitchhikers well leave things to peoples imaginations so even though we had this huge set there isnt one shot where you see it all only parts of it because then you think its even bigger than it is you never see the edges of it things got very rushed toward the end the series was structured to be made on a daily basis so that once all the graphics work and location work for each episode was done the studio filming could be done in one day in the studio it should really have been five days at the studio so there was an enormous panic to get everything done in time and the electricians union were in dispute so at pm every night the lights went out the plugs were pulled and that was it theres a scene where you see arthur dent running to hide behind a girder we actually used a shot of simon jones the actor running across the studio to get to his mark the show was a success the fans loved it it garnered excellent reviews most people were pleasantly surprised and befuddled by the computer graphics and it won the bbc a few awards in a year otherwise dominated by itvs brideshead revisited everybody waited expectantly for the second series and waited and waited there are conflicting stories of why the second series never came to be made john lloyd they asked douglas to do a second series as far as i know he went to the bbc and said id be delighted but i never want to work with alan bell again and the bbc most untypically supported alan they said he was the only person to do it that was the end of it i say untypically because if say a comedy star didnt get on with a producer hed go to the head of department and theyd give him a new one theyd do it for a star but not for a writer geoffrey perkins douglas wanted me to produce it i heard that alan bell refused to direct if i were producer and instead said how would i like to be script editor this seemed to me the most thankless task imaginable for the first tv series they didnt know how lucky they were they already had the script from the radio series and records they were in clover they hadnt been through the whole thing of getting scripts out of douglas now i knew that getting those scripts for the second series without any say in the way they were done would be an appalling heartbreaking thing possibly the most thankless task i could ever think up i said no my own impression is that the second series really got to brinkmanship douglas gave the bbc an ultimatum they said no fully expecting him to back down and of course he didnt and neither did they alan bell there was going to be a second series it was all commissioned we had fifty per cent more money the actors were told the dates and during that time douglas went past his script deadline and time was running out we needed to have the information because otherwise six weeks before production what can you do we needed sets built theres no way you can build them in that time the deadlines to deliver the scripts came and went we gave him another three weeks and meetings were going on and that was it it had to be cancelled it was going to begin with a test match in australia but we checked it out and the timing wasnt right so we were looking at headingly or somewhere that was all i knew about the second tv series it wasnt going to be the second radio series at all douglas is very strange he believed that radio was the ultimate series and that tv let him down i dont know maybe it did i had to change a lot of things in production to make it stronger like slartibartfasts aircar anyone who had seen star vfjars would think wed stolen it from there so i changed it to a bubble and he was upset about that we started making lists of his wild ideas he wanted to make marvin a chap in a leotard painted gold if you see it on tv youd know it was an actor the fun of the script is that marvin is a tin box thats depressed if you see a man in a leotard you know its an actor straightaway and whats so unusual about an actor being depressed and anyway there was that gold robot in star wars that impasse went straight to the head of department he wanted the mice to be played by men in mouse skins it wouldnt have worked it would have looked like pantomime he wanted it to be faithful to the radio but you couldnt be faithful to the radio as its visual people have to walk from one side of the set to the other so douglas and i were fighting not that that matters because thats what lifes all about if youre on a production and everybodys enjoying themselves its generally a load of rubbish because people feel passionately about things it was my job to throw out the bad ideas and keep the good the change in role for the black disaster area stunt ship was done by douglas himself john lloyd was the cowriter of some episodes of the radio series when douglas was script editor of dr who and also writing hitchhikers and he was quite happy to farm out to john to write the bits he couldnt write and the black ship bit was one of them when it became a big success douglas very much regretted having shared the credit with john on those episodes so when it came to the tv series he wouldnt at any cost do anything that john lloyd had written because he wanted it to be all douglas adams i think if i was douglas adams id do exactly the same thing we got on quite well but i thought he was a hindrance we used to tell him that the dubbing dates were in three weeks time when wed done it the day before because if he came along he interfered all the time and i have to say not necessarily for the better production suggestion mice ive suggested using the eidophor images in case we can manage to do some very convincing puppetry to give us the appearance of talking mice like the muppets or indeed yoda in the otherwise terribly boring empire strikes back if we do that then of course the mice must look as real as we can possibly make them and not simply joke mice that means that on the actual set in the glass transports we either use little lifesize models or indeed real mice which would be preferable obviously if we can make them appear to be speaking very convincingly then it obviates the need for the very extreme voice treatments we had to use on radio which were detrimental to the actual sense of the lines douglas adamss production notes for tv episode five douglas adams a lot of what alan says is simply not the case whether his memory is at fault or not i dont know all i would say is that as he cheerfully admits he will say what suits him rather than what happens to be the case and therefore theres no point in arguing i wouldnt start seriously moving on the second tv series until wed sorted out various crucial aspects of how we were going to go about it i felt very let down by the fact that though john lloyd was meant to be producer he was rapidly moved aside much to the detriment of the show id always made it clear that i wanted geoffrey perkins at the very least as a consultant neither of these things transpired in the first series it was perfectly clear to myself and the cast that alan had very little sympathy with the script so i didnt want to go into the second series without that situation being remedied in some way and the bbc was not prepared to come up with a remedy that was the argument going on in the background that was why i was not producing the scripts i wasnt going to do the scripts until i knew we were going to do the series in when john lloyd and geoffrey perkins were both involved as producer and script editor respectively in central televisions spitting image there were noises made that the spitting image company would have been interested in making a version of life the universe and everything it would have been interesting one feels that they would probably have been able to get zaphods head right but the television rights were tied up with the film rights and nothing ever came of it the restaurant at the end of the universe marvin its the people you meet that really get you down in this job theyre so boring the best conversation i had was over thirtyfour million years ago trillian oh dear marvin and that was with a coffee machine zaphod yeah well were really cut up about that marvin now wheres our old ship marvin its in the restaurant zaphod what marvin they had it made into teaspoons i enjoyed that bit not very much though zaphod you mean theyre stirring their coffee with my ship the heart of gold hey that was one of the creamiest space strutters ever stacked together cut from script radio episode five each time i come to a different version i always think i could do it better im very aware of what i feel i got wrong what was thin or bad in the first version of it pan of it is that i wrote it serially so i was never sure where it was going and no matter how frantically id plot it out it would never adhere to the plot i had mapped out for it you map out a plot and you write the first scene and inevitably the first scene isnt funny and you have to do something else and you finally get the scene to be funny but its no longer about what it was meant to be about so you have to jack in the plot you had in mind and do a new one after a while it became pointless plotting too far in advance because it never worked since the vast body of the material arrived serially id often reach a point where id go if i knew i was going to wind up here i would have done something else there so writing the books is usually an attempt to make sense of what ive already done which usually involves rather major surgery especially with the second book i was trying with hindsight to make a bit of sense out of it all i knew how it would end with the prehistoric earth stuff and i found myself plotting the book backwards from there the restaurant at the end of the universe is douglas adamss favourite of the hitchhikers books although the circumstances under which it was written were somewhat less than ideal and they were to be far from unique i had put it off and put it off and got extension after extension all sorts of other things were going on at the time like the stage show and the tv series but eventually the managing director of pan said weve given you all these extensions and we have got to have it sudden death or else we have to have it in four weeks now how far have you got with it i didnt like to tell him i hadnt staned it it seemed unfair on the poor chaps hean jacqueline graham who was working for pan explains the predicament after the first book our attitude was a mixture of resignation and exasperation with douglass lateness by the second book we expected him to be late it was built into our planning but at the same time we thought well he cant do it again surely this time hell start on time or hell have a schedule and stick to it but he didnt the whole thing was tremendously late and douglas was getting into a bit of a state about it because it was getting later and later he was sharing a flat at the time with a friend called jon canter and douglas found it impossible to work as the phone kept ringing and jon was always there in the end i said to him why dont you just move out as he had written the first book at his mothers he thought that was a very good idea so i rented him a flat and moved him in that afternoon douglas found the experience more than slightly weird i was locked away so nobody could possibly reach me or find me i led a completely monastic existence for that month and at the end of four weeks it was done it was extraordinary one of those times you really go mad i can remember the moment i thought i can do it ill actually get it finished in time and the paul simon album had just come out one trick pony and it was the only album i had id listen to it on my walkman every second i wasnt actually sitting at the typewriter it contributed to the sense of insanity and hypnotism that allowed me to write a book in that time when the manuscript for the restaurant at the end of the universe was turned in douglas stated that that would be the final hitchhikers book its the last of all that i hope he announced to one daily paper i want to try another field now like performing the book again a paperback original from pan was a critical success while most critics had been a little wary of the first book initially mostly not reviewing it at all its sales had made it a major book oddly enough the only part that british critics found too highly monty python and too downtoeanh was the colonisation of eanh by the golgafrincham detritus the oddly because this is the section most american critics picked up on most easily and singled out for praise marvin turns from the teleport and trudges away marvin i suppose some people might have expected better treatment after having waited for five hundred and seventysix thousand million years in a car park but not me i may just be a menial robot but im far too intelligent to expect anyone to think of me for a moment far too intelligent in fact im so intelligent ive probably got time to go through the five million things i hate most about organic life forms one theyre so stupid cut from tv script invasion usa and now began the press release for something completely different as has been seen douglas adamss contribution to monty python was neither major nor earthshattering consisting as it did of having had an old sketch rewritten by diverse hands for the soundtrack album of monty python and the holy grail and two walkon parts in the final series this was not however the impression one got from the american pr for the hitchhikers guide to tbe galaxy which represented douglas as a former scriptwriter for monty python in addition to which the initial press release for the hardback copy of hitchhikers published by harmonycrown in october contained the following praise for the book really entertaining and fun john cleese much funnier than anything john cleese has ever written terry jones i know for a fact that john cleese hasnt read it graham chapman who is john cleese eric idle really entertaining and fun michael palin an american fan might have been forgiven for supposing that douglas adams not terry gilliam was the sixth member of the python team monty python and hitchhikers its funny when i was at university i was a great python fan i still am but that was obviously when python was at its most active so i have very much an outsiders view of python an audiences view as far as hitchhikers goes im the only person who doesnt have any outsiders view whatsoever i often wonder how id react to it if i wasn t me but i still was me so to speak and how much id like it and how much id be a fan or whatever the way i would perceive it in among everything else obviously i cant answer that question i have no idea because im the one person who cant look at it from outside you can see all the elements in hitchhikers in which it is a bit this or a bit that i mean its an easy line for people wanting to categorise it in the press to say it is a cross between monty python and dr who and in a sense it is there are all kinds of elements that go into making it what it is but at the end of the mixing you have something which is different from anything else in its own peculiar way but then everything is like that python was a mixture of all kinds of things thrown together to give you something different from anything else even the beatles were a mixture of all kinds of elements drawn from other things mixed together and they created something which was extraordinarily different although hitchhikers does not have any real political significance there is a theme there of the ubпquity of bureaucracy and paranoia rampant throughout the universe and that is a direct debt to python along with the comparative style of individual events little worlds the difference comes with the narrative structure so the world of hitchhikers is based outside the real world while still coexisting with it its like looking at events through the wrong end of a telescope in a few american radio stations had already broadcast hitchhikers and national public radio was just waiting for its new stereo system to begin operating before it started to broadcast the radio series nationally even so the show was not going to have the same effect on the states that it had had in england through radio and a new tack was needed the book had done moderately well in hardcover on its release but did not reach the cult status it had in england and that it was imagined it had the potential of reaching in america the radio series was finally broadcast by national public radio member stations in march national response was so good that the twelve episodes were rebroadcast six months later douglas adams had paid his first visit to america in january on completion of the bbc television series he lived in new york had a wonderful time despite contracting an ear infection and visited mexico before returning to england where he was to begin working on life tbe universe and everything in many ways the paperback release of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy had a lot in common with the promotion of the cult film the rocky horror picture show in order to get people along to rocky horror the film company realised that the public had to discover it for themselves there had to be a word ofmouth campaign among the right sort of people it is peculiar that even more than favourable reviews or national advertising neither of which admittedly ever hurt sales the factor that seems to sell most books is wordofmouth promotion people reading books and recommending them to friends it was to be hoped that hitchhikers could have the same kind of impact that some of the campus classics of the sixties and seventies had had books that had built up high sales and then remained perennial bestsellers could it be the next catcher in the rye the next lord of the rings or dune hitchhikers needed advance wordofmouth among science fiction fans and more importantly among the college crowd and the kind of people who would appreciate its humour the solution an advertisement in the th august rolling stone giving away three thousand copies of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy to the first people to write to the hyperspace hitchhiking club earth div co pocket books by th august this was combined with many advance reading copies and giveaway promotions which were distributed by pocket in the months before publication to ensure that people would begin to read hitchhikers and that they would pocket hoped tell their friends how much they had enjoyed it pocket did not skimp on the promotion however england they explained in their press release the country that gave america the beatles and monty pythons flying circus has just exported another zany craze the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy by doug adams a wild spoof available in october from pocket books the book was released in october and did reasonably well douglas was again in america at this time in los angeles while abc tried to put together the american version of the television series it was like every horror story you have ever heard says douglas they werent really interested in how good it was going to be they just wanted to do lots of special effects and they also wanted not to have to pay for them the show was to be one of the many british comedy shows that had been turned into american comedy shows there is a long and noble tradition of this that includes dragging such shows as steptoe and son fawlty towers and the fall and rise of reginald perrin across the atlantic recasting them rewriting them and frequently removing whatever it was that happened to make the show funny in the first place squares have all reached the uk from the us quite what abc planned to do with hitchhikers is unknown the script was to be by other people than douglas and was being written and put together by various committees there were terrible stories coming back after meetings with executives theyd make remarks like would an alien be green eventually everything got abandoned because the first episodes budget came to million it would have been the most expensive twentytwo minute show ever made the script was terrible douglass sole contribution was to come in and hang around the production office for a week as he later pointed out it gives you an idea of the crazy proportion of this thing when you think that they paid me four times as much for that one week as i was paid to write the whole series for radio it was with the release of the restaurant at the end of the universe shortly afterwards that douglas first made it onto the us bestseller lists and with the american broadcast of the bbc television series hitchhikers popularity was assured many people were surprised that something as essentially british as hitchhikers took off in america not douglas adams one is told at every level of the entertainment industry that the american audience does not like or understand english humour we are told that at every level except that of the audience who as far as i can see love it its everybody else the people whose job it is to tell you what the audiences like but the people i meet here and in the us who are fans are very much the same type of people the most commonly heard plea from american audiences is dont let them americanise it we get all sorts of pabulum over here in terms of sales these days it is more popular in america than england it sells twice as many books to four times as many people so its either twice as popular or half as popular i think too much is made of the difference between us and uk humour i dont think theres a difference in the way those audiences are treated audiences in the us are treated as complete idiots by the people who make programmes and when youve been treated as an idiot for so long you tend to respond that way but when given something with a bit more substance the tend to breathe a deep sigh of relief and say thank god for that there are things that the british think are as english as roast beef that the americans think are as american as apple pie the trick is to write about people if you write about situations that people recognise then people will respond to it the humour that doesnt travel is stuff like the johnny carson monologue for which you needed to know precisely who said what about who that week and how it affected the performance of the la rams if you dont have the information then it isnt funny but anything that relies on how a person works is universally accessible how it works in translation is another matter as in that respect comedy is a fragile plant and very often i suspect it might not stand up in translation i dont know hitchhikers has been translated into all kinds of languages and ive no idea which ones work and which ones dont as it is life the universe and everything and more especially so long and thanks for all the fish have sold amazingly well in the us the latter riding high on the us bestseller lists for over eighteen months the computer game which was not a big hit in the uk was the number one game in the us for a year selling over a quarter of a million copies much of douglass mail and the greater part of his income now comes from america life the universe and everything zaphod theres nothing wrong with my sense of reality i have it thoroughly serviced every fortnight cut from radio script episode three the first two hitchhikers books were based on material developed for the radio series when douglas adams agreed to write the third book he had sworn he would never write he took the plot from a storyline he had had knocking around for ages he had once suggested it as a dr who story but graham williams thought it was just too silly later when there was talk of a dr who film to star tom baker he had written the story as a film outline dr who and the krikkitmen the film never materialised but later when talk began of the second hitchhikers television series douglas began to look at the krikkitmen script as a hitchhikers vehicle as things turned out for reasons explained at length elsewhere there was not going to be a second television series however the process of turning dr who and the krikkitmen into life the universe and everything had begun as far as plots go the storylines are essentially the same douglas divided the dr who role between slartibartfast trillian and arthur dent although what would have been the last half of the dr who format became the final thirty pages of life the universe and everything in the dr who version after having failed to prevent the krikkitmen from taking the components of the wicket gate the doctor arrives with sarah jane on krikkit and spends most of the rest of the story in classic dr who style running around getting captured escaping learning vital bits of plot running around getting captured escaping rescuing sarah jane and so on life the universe and everything was different in kind from the other hitchhikers books in that it was not written serially douglas knew what was going to happen next but this gave him a new problem that of fitting the hitchhikers characters into the dr who plot hitchhikers characters are essentially feckless and instead of say saving the universe they would tend instead towards going to a party staying cool looking bewildered or moaning this really left only trillian whose personality had never been fully explored as a substitute worldsaver more so perhaps than any other part of douglass oeuvre the creation of life the universe and everything was fraught with difficulties as with everything i put it off longer than i should have and then i had a huge domestic crisis which knocked me for six i couldnt think of anything funny to save my life i wanted to jump off cliffs and things like that it was an emotional episode which im not going to go into in any detail although adams will no longer discuss it his then girlfriend had left him as he said in an interview given about that time she went off with this bloke on to me the spurious grounds that he was her husband as a result of this adams wrote a very bleak first draft of life the universe and everything i had the first draft of it threequarters finished and then i had to go and do a major book promotion tour in the us for a month i was suddenly confronted by the fact that this book was not anything like right at that point and i had to phone up my publisher and say look its not finished yet im going to have to rewrite it but i have to go now it was terrible so i went away and did this tour feeling terrible about the situation id left behind then i came back and sat down and wrote and threw out practically every word of the first draft of life the universe and everything take for example in the first draft the first twenty pages which were arthur waking up in his cave two and a half million years ago i think it was just that was where i wanted to be at the time i rewrote it and rewrote it and rewrote and at the end of twenty rewrites those thirty pages were the first two lines of the book and that was it what is amazing is that the third book ever got written at all that it got into existence and was as good as it was but it is patchy simply because it was written in circumstances i wouldnt want to build a bookcase under let alone write a book but its true of each book ive written that ive hated it and then written the next book and was so busy hating the next book i discovered i rather liked the previous book there are problems in the third book which have to do with the way i handled the plot since it was actually a plotted story occasionally you can hear the grinding gears where i had to do something which had to establish a plot point and at the same time had to be funny and id have to overstretch to make it funny thats the real problem you can sort of hear the tyres screech around a few corners the struggle between substance and structure reached a pitch with the third book as it was the one where i had a very detailed plan of the logical structure and virtually none of that actually got into the book i always go off at tangents but whereas before id follow the tangents and go on from there this time i was determined to go back to the plot each time the tangents remained purely as tangents so there was a real fight going on between the way i felt i ought to be doing things and the way things naturally end up getting done thats why it has a slightly bitchy feeling i keep yanking it back to where its going even though it hasnt shown any inclination to go there an awful lot of the explanations in my outline never got anywhere near the book and every time you get yanked back to the plot you dont get told what the plot is i think i must be a very weird person on the other hand some of my favourite bits of actual writing are in that book the agrajag section and the flying bit i didnt revise any of the flying bit it was all done first draft although i cheated slightly as being aware i had written the entire sequence straight off i felt slightly superstitious about it and left things i could have revised i wasnt pleased with the resolution of the agrajag episode it was a bit perfunctory and i should have got that right overall i think life the universe and everything has some of the best and some of the worst hitchhikers writing in it geoffrey perkins suggested to me that life the universe and everything had a succession of endings in chapters and because douglas had felt that the book wasnt long enough no thats not true actually its one of the longest of the books it was almost the opposite when i got the proofs back from pan i read through and had the niggling feeling there was something wrong if it had been a small thing wrong i would have spotted it immediately but it was one of those things that was so big and wrong that it takes you a while to see exactly what it is what it was was this there were two chapters missing those two had disappeared and actually turned up later in america by which time the number of pages in the final bound copy had actually been determined and that is why in the english edition the text of the book carries on to the very last page there arent any ads or anything in the back of the book but its actually quite a long book no that stuff wasnt put in because the book wasnt long enough but because there was a bit i wanted to put in that i hadnt managed to get in anywhere else which was the story of the reason thats one of my favourite bits that no one else seems to have responded to very well when you write you often feel a constant salvage from impending catastrophe i mean theres a constant disastrous bit followed by disastrous bit and just occasionally you come up with a bit of which you think oh ill pat myself on the back for that that bit was one of those i actually thought it was quite neat but the problem of the third book is that i have a plot which actually signifies something and there are momentous events afoot but id created such a feckless bunch of characters that before writing each scene id think well ok whos involved here and id mentaliy go around each of the characters in my mind explaining to them what was going on and they would all say yeah well so what i dont want to get involved either they didnt want to get involved or they didnt understand in the end slartibartfast had to become the character who had to get them all to get a move on and that really wasnt in his nature either you see all the characters are essentially character parts i had a lot of supporting roles and no main character on writing humour writing comes easy all you have to do is stare at a blank piece of paper until your forehead bleeds i find it ludicrously difficult i try and avoid it if at all possible the business of buying new pencils assumes gigantic proportions i have four word processors and spend a lot of time wondering which one to work on all writers or most say they find writing difficult but most writers i know are surprised at how difficult i find it i usually get very depressed when writing it always seems to me that writing coincides with terrible crises breaking up my life i used to think these crises had a terrible effect on my being able to write these days i have a very strong suspicion that its the sitting down to write that precipitates the crises so quite a lot of troubles tend to get worked out in the books its usually below the surface it doesnt appear to tackle problems at a personal level but it does implicitly even if not explicitly im not a wit a wit says something funny on the spot a comedy writer says something very funny two minutes later or in my case two weeks later i dont think i could do a serious book anyway im sure that jokes would start to creep in i actually do think that comedy is a serious business when you are working on something you have to take it absolutely seriously you have to be passionately committed to it but you cant maintain that if you are going to stay sane so when i talk about it to other people i tend to be flippant about it im always so glad to have got through it i say its just jokes its a relief what i do now on many occasions is have say an inconsequential idea for a throwaway line that seems quite neat then i go to huge lengths to create the context in which to throw that line away and make it appear that it was just a throwaway line when in fact youve constructed this huge edifice off which to chuck this line its a really exhausting way of writing but when it works often the things that seem frivolous and whimsical are the hardest to get right take the opening section of life the universe and everything which is something im quite pleased with they are stuck on prehistoric earth and then suddenly they find themselves on lords cricket ground which comes about because they chased a sofa across a field it all sounds inconsequential or iliogical or whatever but completely belies the fact that i tried over and over again and rewrote that bit over and over going absolutely crazy with it until i eventually found the right elements to create the air of whimsical inconsequence if you like so i could come rightup at the end of that long section with they suddenly found themselves in the middle of the pitch at lords cricket ground st johns wood london with australia leading and england needing so many runs to win i forget the exact quote now in order to chuck away a line like that at the end of the chapter you needed all that stuff about ford coming back and explaining what he has been doing in africa which was obviously very unpleasant and then him trying to explain about the flotsam and jetsam and eddies in the spacetime continuum which was really a very silly joke but you are allowed the odd silly joke and the sofa and so on lt required all that just to be able to suddenly say bang here they were somewhere else because if you do just say that without getting all the rhythm right then it doesnt work it wouldnt have been enough for them to just be magically transported without it suddenly being a tremendous surprise coming at that moment kits those kind of effects that take an awful lot of engineering when you dont necessarily know what the answer is going to be you are just thrashing around in the dark trying to find something somewhere thats going to help you get to that point and when you are operating within a convention which says anything goes you have to be extremely careful how you use that i think if i have a strength as a writer it is in recognising that and trying to deal with it and if i have a weakness its that i dont always deal with it as well as i would like to be able to kanyway the reason i liked that bit where they appeared at lords so much was that i knew what a huge problem i had solved and the fact that it wouldnt appear to the reader to be a transition from one bit to another and the reader would feel well that was easy wasnt it you say here they are in one place then here they are in another but for that to be easy you have to do an awful lot of engineering douglas adams when life the universe and everything was released the critical response was far less favourable than that for the first two books and most of the critics said similar things the third time around i found arthur dent and his ridiculous dressing gown why hasnt he found a change of clothes somewhere along the line increasingly tedious never a very substantial hero he is in danger of being shrivelled in the heat of his authors imagination perhaps adams should now look beyond sf i feel that his cynicism and detachment are too strong for a genre which depends so much on naivety and trust the humour depends on a limited repertoire of gimmicks and this third volume though by no means lacking in enthusiastic drive does little to suggest that the idea could or should be taken much further from here richard brown times literary supplement fans will relish the mixture as before but signs of padding and selfparody suggest that adams would be wise to avoid a fourth even the interviewers most of them obviously fans were complaining to douglas that life the universe and everything was less funny than the earlier books and douglas hating the book couldnt have agreed with them more in his defence he pointed out how depressed he had been during the writing how he felt he was no longer writing in his own voice how writing a third hitchhikers book had been a major mistake and one he would not repeat after i wrote the second hitchhikers book i swore on the souls of my ancestors that i would not write a third having written the third i can swear on the souls of the souls of my ancestors there will not be another was a typical quote and i utterly intend not to write another sequel was another what he wanted to do next he told all the interviewers would have nothing to do with the hitchhikers characters hed write a stage play perhaps or a film on something else definitely indubitably unarguably nothing else with hitchhikers connections in any shape colour or form but it was not long before the souls of the souls of douglass ancestors were revolving in the graves of their graves making movies i went to hollywood and i kept thinking this is just like going to hollywood the experience of it conformed far more closely to the one that everyone said id have than the one i expected to have i told people this is going to work its going to be great but i fell foul of all the clichs of hollywood douglas adams november on his return from la in douglas was approached with an offer he found almost irresistible a hitchhikers film all he had to do was sign a piece of paper and he would have in his hand the only trouble was that what the director seemed to have in mind was star wars with jokes we seemed to be talking about different things and one thing after another seemed not quite right and i suddenly realised that the only reason i was going ahead with it was the money and that as the sole reason was not good enough although i had to get rather drunk in order to believe that i was quite pleased with myself for not doing it in the end but i knew that we were doing it for tv anyway at that time im sometimes accused of only being in it for the money i always knew there was a lot of money to be made out of the film but when that was the whole thing prompting me to do it when the only benefit was the money i didnt want to do it people should remember that ford what is it youre after zaphod well its partly the curiosity partly a sense of adventure but mostly i think its the fame and the money ford money aphod yes money in mindmangling amounts ford zaphod last time i knew you you were one of the richest men in the galaxy what do you want money for zaphod oh i lost it all ford all of it what did you do gamble it away zaphod no i left it in a taxi ford stylish unused dialogue first radio series a couple of years later terry jones of monty python and a scriptwriter and director in his own right decided that he would like to make a hitchhikers film the concept was to do a story that was based solidly in the first radio series but pretty soon douglas began to have second thoughts he had done it four times and had recently done it for a fifth time so decided that in order to avoid the problems of repetition that would occur if he wrote the same script again i didnt want to drag it through another medium i was in danger of becoming my own word processor they would create a new story that would be totally consistent with what had gone before for the sake of those people who were familiar with hitchhikers and totally selfcontained for the sake of those who werent and that began to be a terrible conundrum and in the end terry and i said it would be nice to do a film together but lets start from scratch and not make it hitchhikers also terry and i have been great friends for a long time but have had no professional links and theres a slight risk you take when you go and do a professional job with a friend that it might spoil things so we didnt do it in douglas went to california with john lloyd to write the meaning of liff and it was then that he was approached by two people with whom he got on extremely well michael gross and joe medjuck about a hitchhikers film at the time douglas was excited by the possibilities of what could be done with computers having seen some amazing special effects and technical work imagine real computer graphics done with computers and decided that he would write the film he moved to los angeles taking his girlfriend jane belson with him bought a rainbow word processor and began to write mike and joe were producers working for ivan reitman then known only for animal house now better known for s smashhit ghostbusters and unfortunately there was not the same rapport between adams and reitman as there had been between adams and the other two frankie now earth creature as you know weve been at this ultimate question business for seventeen and a half million years benjy oh longer surely frankie no it just seems longer white mice dialogue cut from first radio series douglas now describes as a lost year he and jane hated los angeles missed london and their friends he found it hard to work spending much of his time learning how to work a computer playing computer games learning to scuba dive and writing unsatisfactory screenplays transforming hitchhikers into a film hit two snags the first was that of organising the material there are inherent problems with the material its a hundred minute film of which the first twentyfive minutes are concerned with the destruction of earth then you start a whole new story which has to be told in seventy five minutes and not overshadow what went before its very very tricky and ive had endless problems getting the structure right with radio and television you have three hours to play with the material just doesnt want to be organised hitchhikers by its very nature has always been twisty and turny and going off in every direction a film demands a certain shape and discipline that the material just isnt inclined to fit into the other problem was that ivan reitman and douglas adams did not see eye to eye on the various drafts of the screenplay again douglas started using the phrase of star wars with jokes unfortunately this time he had already signed the contracts was signed up as a coproducer and had accepted amazingly large amounts of money to work on the film the versions of the script done in los angeles were attempts by douglas adams to meet reitman halfway of which he says they fell between two stools they didnt please me and they didnt please them frankie weve got to have something that sounds good arthur sounds good an ultimate question that sounds good frankie well i mean yes idealism yes the dignity of pure research yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms but there comes a point im afraid where you begin to suspect that if theres any real truth its that the entire multidimensional infinity of the universe is almost cenainly being run by a bunch of maniacs and if it comes to a choice between spending another ten million years finding that out and on the other hand just taking the money and running then i for one could do with the exercise more white mice dialogue cut from the tv series this time los angeles was getting douglas more and more depressed he began to feel he was losing touch with the very things that had made him write what he did anyway eventually he decided to leave i didnt realise how much i hated la until i left then the floodgates opened and everything came out it wasnt a good period for me nor a productive period i had a slight case of farnham thats the feeling you get at in the afternoon when you havent got enough done so there came a point when we all decided to disagree and id come back to the uk where i felt more in touch and try to get it right to my own satisfaction two what are you talking about professional ethics vroomfondel look dont you mess with me about ethics let me tell you that i have got three first class degrees in moral sciences ethics and funher ethics a phd in a lot funher ethics and have written three bestselling books on why sex is ethical why more sex is ethical and five hundred and seventy three more totally ethical positions so i know what im talking about when i say that ethically that machine is a writeoff get rid of it unused dialogue from first radio series douglas returned to england where he began to work once more on the screenplay of the film in addition to beginning work on so long and thanks for all the fish and the hitchhikers computer game at that time he told me what im trying to do with the film is use a completely different selection process to that which went into the tv series we are trying to show the stuff you didnt see in the v series so if you go back to the book and find all the things not in the tv series thats the film also a lot of the film comes to have a completely different rationale ive just put the scene with marvin and the battletank into the film from the second book liff and other places zaphod soulianis and rahm two ancient furnaces of light that have warmed this dead and barren planet through the countless millennia guarding its priceless secrets just looking at it makes me feel i could really you know really write travelogues unused dialogue from first radio series script douglas adams and john lloyd have collaborated on a number of projects some have already been mentioned one dr snuggles was an animated television series for which two episodes were scripted by adams and lloyd dr snuggles was a cross between professor branestawm and dr dolittle and produced by a dutch television company for the international market one of their episodes apparently won them an award although neither of them has seen either the award or the series dr snuggles was essentially a childrens series and while the adamslloyd scripted episode i have seen dr snuggles and the nervous river was superior to the run of scripts for the series fans of douglas adamss or john lloyds work are missing nothing if they havent seen it the plot however was science fiction dr snuggles meets a nervous river too scared to go down to the sea because huge chunks of the sea are disappearing after a number of adventures the doctor goes off into space to discover that the water is being taken by aliens who thought we didnt want our water because we kept throwing rubbish into it they give the water back dr snuggles ties it to the back of his spaceship and returns to earth another project of theirs was rather better known in britain but for some reason not a success in the us a curious book entitled the meaning of liff it began during the holiday in corfu which john and douglas had booked to write the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy but during which for reasons already chronicled only douglas wrote the book they were sitting in a tavern playing charades and drinking retsina with a few friends they had been drinking retsina all afternoon and after a while decided they needed a game to play that did not require as much standing up douglas remembered an english exercise he had been set at school fifteen years earlier and suggested it as a game the rules were fairly simple someone would say the name of a town and someone else would say what the word meant as john lloyd explained it was a fantastically enjoyable holiday for a month we got drunk and wed stay up all night playing these incredibly long games of charades then we began playing this placenames game near the end of the holiday i started writing them down not having very much else to do by the end of the holiday we had about twenty of these things some of the best ones in the meaning of liff like ely the first tiniest inkling that something has gone terribly wrong many of them were to do with greece sitting in wickerwork chairs and so on and we kept doing them after the holiday was over douglas clarified the concept on a press release for the meaning of liff we rapidly discovered there were an awful lot of experiences ideas and situations that everybody knew and recognised but which never got properly identified simply because there wasnt a word for them they were all of the do you ever have the situation where or you know what feeling you get when you know i always thought it was just me all it takes is a word and the thing is identified the vaguely uncomfortable feeling you get from sitting in a seat which is warm from somebody elses bottom is just as real a feeling as the one you get when a rogue giant elephant charges out of the bush at you but hitherto only the latter has actually had a word for it now they both have words the first one is shoeburyness and the second of course is fear we started to collect more and more of these words and concepts and began to realise what an arbitrarily selective work the oxford english dictionary is it simply doesnt recognise huge wodges of human experience like for instance standing in the kitchen wondering what you went in there for everybody does it but because there isnt or wasnt a word for it everybody thinks its something that only they do and that they are therefore more stupid than other people it is reassuring to realise that everybody else is as stupid as you are and that all we are doing when we are standing in the kitchen wondering what we came in here for is woking following john lloyds disappointment with the hitchhikers book he was similarly disappointed over a comedy series he was meant to have been cowriting to the manor born starring penelope keith instead he found himself producing a bbc satire show not the nine oclock news starring pamela stephenson rowan atkinson mel smith and griff rhys jones after a while not the nine oclock news became a major success which according to douglas meant that john in his turn spent a while being as obnoxious as douglas had been in the early days of the success of hitchhikers and spawned a number of records and books one of the books was the not calendar lloyd found himself stuck for material to fill in space at the bottoms of some pages and at the tops of some pages and in quite a few of the middles so he dug out of the best definitions he had accumulated about and inserted them into the book as extracts from the oxtail english dictionary faber and faber johns publisher were very enthusiastic about the definitions they said this is the best idea in the whole calendar why dont you do it as a book this time it was the reverse situation i hadnt expected douglas to be very interested in doing it as a book so i expected to do it on my own then douglas said lets do it together and said yes i cant stand doing things on my own which is one reason why im a producer and not a writer the meaning of liff was written in september in a rented beach hut in malibu the two of them sat on the beach watched the ocean drank beer thumbed through a gazetteer and thought up definitions douglas also started learning to scuba dive at this time he finished learning to scuba dive in australia two years later and has a number of wise sayings on the subject of sharks it was published in november by pan in a co publishing deal with faber and faber in a remarkable format a very small very slim very black book with a bright orange sticker on the cover that proclaimed this book lvill change your life the selling point summary that went out to reps included small format for discreet consultation on retrieval from inside pocket authors expert in field and possible early quote from john cleeses psychoanalyst as selling points on its release it went to number four in the sunday times bestseller lists however overall it didnt do as well as a hitchhikers book or for that matter a not the nine oclock news book as douglas said at the time normally i dont enjoy writing at all but it was a real pleasure doing this book but whats really nice is that my family and so on who say yes dear its nice about hitchhikers johns say the same about not the nine oclock news love this book my kid brother and sister like it lts selling briskly but not as well as it could do i think thats because people have no idea what it is its totally enigmatic and anonymous unless you happen to recognise our names in both cases the product is more famous than the names but on the other hand it has terrific wordofmouth but i enjoy it i can reread it whereas normally i cringe when i read my stuff the meaning of liff also kicked off a minor controversy in the newspapers although it was well and extensively reviewed primarily because it was so easily quotable despite the presence of the word ripon described in the meaning of liff as to include all the best jokes from the book in the review to make it look as if the critic had thought of them there were also accusations of plagiarism having just undergone a traumatic time trying to get a certain advertising agency to pay up for having stolen the idea for an ad campaign using the phrase the oxtail english dictionary adams and lloyd were rather put out when it was widely pointed out that the idea had originated in an essay written by paul jennings called ware wye and watford published in the late s douglas suggested that the teacher who gave him the exercise had probably got the idea from the jennings book and sent jennings a note of apology miles kington in the times rushed to adamss and lloyds defence pointing out the essential difference between the two that while jennings had been primarily interested in the sound and flavour of the placename he suggested that rickmansworth as in a small cafe in was really the nominal rent paid to the lord of the manor for hay it sounds right but isnt particularly funny lloydadams had been far more concerned in amassing meanings for which there were no words previously in existence the actual word or placename they picked being less than important an additional coincidence although certain devoted fans have woven intricate conspiracy theories around it was its release at almost exactly the same time as the monty python film the meaning of life the films title sequence shows the title carved in classically modest terry gilliam fashion out of huge slabs of rock a lightning bolt removes the bottom bar of the e turning it into an f the meaning of liff it was a meaningless coincidence discovered by douglas and terry jones slightly before the release of either of their products but too late for anything to be changed it was a coincidence but if you wish to concoct conspiracy theories and what does happen in the forty second minute of the film then go right ahead although the meaning of liff was published in the us in a different format and with some extra words it is the least known of douglass books there i did some college readings in america you would think that a high concentration of people who knew what i had written would be in those audiences yet hardly anybody there had heard of the meaning of liff i read sections and they went over well people kept asking me where they could find the book no one could find it i think it suffered from nobody knowing what to do with it liff incidentally is a town in scotland its meaning a book the contents of which are totally belied by its cover for instance any book the dust jacket of which bears the words this book will change your life postscript adams and lloyd assisted by stephen fry returned to liff in their work for the utterly utterly merry comic relief christmas book coedited by douglas adams and in an expanded version the deeper meaning of liff was published slatfat fish cut to a blurry closeup of zaphod lying asleep on the ground ford zaphod wake up zaphod

the universe and everything and having sworn never again on the hitchhikers saga why did douglas adams sign a contract to write the fourth book in the trilogy firstly he was under a great deal of pressure to write it both from his agent and his publishers on his return from the us he explained i felt so disoriented being in los angeles and so keen to be home and just sort of grab hold of things i knew again it became very easy to give in to the temptation of sort of re establishing what i knew i could do by doing another hitchhikers book secondly he did have gods final message to his creation and since he was never going to tell people what the ultimate question was he felt that that was something he should reveal thirdly the advance he was offered topped six hundred thousand pounds he signed the contract i asked him about the book in november i can tell you more about the working title than what its actually going to be about the working title is so long and thanks for all the fish its about something left hanging at the end of the third book which is arthurs quest to find gods final message to his creation my agent thinks so long and thanks for all the fish isnt the right title for the book since the first three all have galaxy or universe in the title so he wants me to call it gods final message to his creation i dont know but i dont think that has the ironical ring to it in the way that that most modest of titles life the universe and everything does or doesnt however that sentence started also i do want it to be a quotation from the first book as the titles of the other two books were while ed victor douglass agent was not too keen on so long and thanks for all the fish as a title everyone else was especially douglass american publisher and fivesixths of the advance money had come from america at this point douglas had a title and a contract and an idea but not much of one deep thought it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create considerable interest in the whole area of popular philosophy yes majikthise keep talking deep thought everyones going to have their own theories about what answer im eventually going to come up with and who better to capitalise on that media market than you yourselves by this time we are quite close in on one of deep thoughts iv screens a new scene comes up on it a tv programme called deep thought special at the bottom of the screen flashes the word simulation which alternates with the words merely a suggestion though no sound comes with the programme we see that it features both vroomfondel and majikthise as importantlooking pundits on a discussion programme they appear to be arguing on either side of a swingometer which is labelled answer predictor as they argue the swingometer needle moves backwards and forwards between two extremes marked life affirmatlon and hopelessness and futility these details are not particularly important in themselves if we cant make them out the important thing to establish is that it looks important the real vroomfondel and majikthise are clearly fascinated by this picture deep thought so long as you can keep violently disagreeing with each other and slagging each other off in the popular press and so long as you have clever agents you can keep yourselves on the gravy train for life from early draft of tv series episode four life the universe and everything had given douglas the problem of trying to force jokes onto a carefully workedout plot this time he would just follow the story wherever it led him for the first time the book was to be released in the uk in a hardback edition first the presses were booked the deadlines were agreed the finalfinal deadlines were agreed the extensionsbeyondwhichonecould notextend were agreed douglas was late although he had made a number of notes on the book had toyed with various ideas including pulling in some of the weirder stuff from the second radio series and getting a computer spreadsheet programme to organise his ideas for him he had not written it in his islington home incidentally life the universe and everything is the only hitchhikers book douglas has ever written at home as opposed to somewhere else it has been suggested that this was because he had only just moved in there and it seemed like somewhere else he had gone down to the west country where earlier books had been written but did not write it there which was why the sales kit that went out to pan books sales representatives in late summer began as follows the great test of a promotion person is to devise a promotion for a book about which one knows absolutely zilch the same goes for a representative selling such a book at the time of writing douglas adams is holed up somewhere i believe in the west country incommunicado as they say prayers are held every morning in the editorial department along the lines of please god grant to douglas adams the gift of inspiration along with his daily bread so that he can deliver the manuscript in time for us to make publication date we just hope we have a fund of goodwill up there but of course you know that all the hitch hiker promotions have been devised without sight of a book thats what makes working on them such fun in the sales pack were such assorted goodies as badges and posters showing birds under glass bowls also there was douglass promo piece for the book a plot description that began everything you wanted to know about the first three books but never thought to ask it deals with that most terrible and harrowing experience in life trying to remember an address which somebody told you but you didnt write down at the end of life the universe and everything arthur dent was told where to find gods final message to his creation only he cant remember where it was he tries everything he can to jog his memory meditation mind reading hitting himself about the head with blunt objects he even tries to combine them all by playing mixed doubles tennis but none of it works still it plagues him gods final message to his creation he cant help feel it must be important in desperation he decides to throw himself off a cliff in the hope that his life will then flash before his eyes on the way down as to what will happen when he reaches the bottom he decides hell meet that challenge when he gets to it he lost all faith in the straight forward operation of cause and effect the day he got up intending to catch up on some reading and brush the dog and ended up on prehistoric earth with a man from betelgeuse and a spaceshipload of alien telephone sanitisers he picks a nice day a nice cliff and does it he falls he remembers he remembers an awful lot of other things besides which throws him into such a state of shock that he misses the ground completely and ends up in the top of a tree with scratches bruises and a lot to think about all his past life on earth takes on a completely new meaning now he really wants to find gods final message to his creation and knows where to look arthur dent is going home although a fascinating book outline this is lightyears away from the book that eventually came out before starting the book douglas had received a lecture from sonn mehta pan s editorial director and ed victor his agent on getting the book in on time to begin with i had been slightly unwilling to write another hitchhikers book then i went off to do long promotional tours and got very involved in the writing of the computer game which took a lot of time and then i had to write another version of the screenplay so i kept putting off the book over and over taking on all these other things i would do and then ended up having to write the book in a terribly short space of time still not absolutely certain that i wanted to do it in order to make the deadline remember the presses had been booked to print the book the quantities even the reprint times had been worked out in advance the book had to be written in less than three weeks the last time a situation like this had occurred was with the restaurant at the end of the universe when douglas had wound up in monastic seclusion hidden away from the world and doing nothing but writing for a month once more the job of finding douglas somewhere to write fell to jacqueline graham of pan who recalls id just got back from maternity leave and i was asked by sonny mehta to find a suite in a central london hotel near to hyde park so douglas could go jogging with air conditioning and a betamax video for sonny i rang around and sonny chose the berkeley they had a very posh suite with a small bedroom and a big bedroom sonny gave douglas the small bedroom as he said douglas wouldnt be needing it very much sweating over his typewriter douglas sat and wrote he was allowed out twice a day for exercise sonny mehta sat next door watching videos and acting as onthespot editor at this time douglas sent another synopsis of so long and thanks for all the fish to pan and his american publishers while this bore rather more relation to the book that eventually came out than the original synopsis it concluded along the way they meet some new people and some old including wonko the sane and his remarkable asylum noslenda bivenda the galaxys greatest clam opener an ultrawalrus with an embarrassing past a lorry driver who has the most extraordinary reason for complaining about the weather marvin the paranoid android for whom even the good times are bad zaphod beeblebrox exgalactic president with two heads at least one of which is saner than an emu on acid and introducing a leg it may be observed that not all of these characters made it into the book as it eventually came out douglas explained the leg was something i rather liked actually and it came curiously enough out of the film script but as soon as i took it out of context it fell apart and i couldnt get it to work elsewhere do you remember the robot who had the fight with marvin i never had any clear visual description of the battletank but it was going to appear in the movie at one point and i wanted to give it lots of mechanical legs the idea was that it was like a dinosaur a dinosaur has one subsidiary brain to control its tail and i thought this machine would have lots of subsidiary brains to deal with different bits of it after the thing smashed itself to bits the one thing that would be left with some kind of independent existence would be one of its legs it was actually one of my favourite new things that i came up with in the film script of course we dont know what will happen with the film script but that bit will almost certainly never make it into the completed version not because its not good but because its completely detachable from the rest and because the scripts too long the galaxys greatest clam opener i dont remember very much about that it had something to do with a seafood restaurant in paris there was someone i had in mind for the character he was the only person who could open this particular type of clam which was one of the great gаstronomic experiences im not sure why it was one of the great gastronomic experiences but i think it was because whenever you ate it you got a flicker of memory all the way back to the primeval ooze it might have had some plot function but i cant remember what and anyway it didnt make it beyond the very early version the ultrawalrus with the embarrassing past well this is very selfindulgent im afraid i got the idea after watching let it be and feeling very sorry for this obviously very embarrassed policeman having to go and make the beatles stop playing i mean knowing this is actually an extraordinary moment the beatles are playing live on a rooftop in london and this poor policemans job was to go and tell them to stop it i thought that somebody would be so mortified that they would do anything not to be in this embarrassing position so i thought of someone who was placed in such an embarrassing position one he hated so much that he would just want not to be there the thought goes through his mind i would do anything rather than do what i now have to do whereupon someone appears and says to him look you have the option to either go and do this thing you dont want to do or i can offer you a life on a completely different planet so he opts to go and be this strange sort of walrus creature and its a rather dull life as a walrus but on the other hand hes perpetually grateful for the fact that he wasnt in this incredibly embarrassing position and had ended up a walrus the reason i made it a walrus was well first of all i didnt know what the alternative life would be and then when gary day ellison who designed the cover showed me that lenticular picture i thought i might as well make him a walrus its because gary always designs a cover that can clearly not have any function in relation to the book and if i still had a chance id always try and work it in somehow not that it ever actually happened that way in november the book was released in england and america the english cover was all black with a lenticular picture of a dinosaur that changed into a walrus stuck on the front there are no dinosaurs or walruses in so long and thanks for all the fish the american cover marginally more logically showed some leaping dolphins there are no dolphins in so long and thanks for all the fish but there are more dolphins than there are walruses or dinosaurs it was in october that the worlds most expensive hitchhikers book was sold at a dinnerparty at douglass british inventorial entrepreneur sir clive sinclair spotted a pre publication copy of so long and thanks for all the fish and asked if he could have it douglas refused pointing out it was the only copy he had whereupon sir clive whipped out his cheque book and offered douglas for the charity of his choice providing he could have the book douglas had him make the cheque out to greenpeace however douglass hesitation to give the book away may have less to do with the fact it was his only copy and more to do with the fact that it was not a book with which he was altogether happy so long and thanks for all the fish is very different from the other hitchhikers books and the critical reaction to it was mixed for many of the fans it was a disappointment they wanted more zaphod more marvin more space they wanted arthur to make it with trillian they wanted to find out how the agrajag problem resolved why arthur dent was the most important being in the universe they wanted towel jokes and extracts from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy what they got was a love story so long and thanksfor all the fish is no longer science fiction and for much of the book it is no longer humour although it is often funny and has certain science fiction elements in it it was not the book the fans were expecting and many of them were disappointed many of the mainstream critics however preferred it finding the gentler pace and the relatively downtoearth tone easier to cope with and coming up with such quotes as fish is the best evidence yet that adams is not simply a funny scifi writer but a bombheaving satirist others commented that it read as if it had been written in a hotel room in two weeks with such comments as a work in which bits and pieces of different sketches orbit around a nonexistent plot so long and thanks for all the fish went on to sell as well as any of the other books and won the city limits best book award for talking to adams about the book one finds a mix of emotions relief and slight embarrassment that it sold as well as it did added to the feeling that he had used up a life with the book why werent the expected characters in the book panly because they didnt fit and partly because i didnt want to do them it was like a chore people were saying lets have a zaphod bit and i didnt feel like doing a zaphod bit this attitude of i am not going to buckle down to the wishes of the fans comes across in the book to its detriment most obviously in chapter where having asked somewhat rhetorically whether or not arthur dent ever indulges the pleasures of the senses other than flying and drinking tea douglas comments those who wish to know should read on others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has marvin in it it is patronising and unfair and undoubtedly would have been cut from a later draft of the manuscript had there been one occasionally douglas threatens that at some future date he will rewrite all four hitchhikers books into one massive selfconsistent tome douglas continued you see i didnt even want to do marvin but then what happened was that i finally had an idea of something i wanted to do that would have to involve marvin which is the way it should be i didnt have that with zaphod or i couldnt but when i needed the extra element for that scene it looked like a job for marvin its very strange that walking across the desert scene when they find the message i felt very haunted by that when i wrote it its not panicularly funny or anything but curiously enough i was very proud of it i actually felt very sorry for and sympathetic with marvin in that i felt close to the character in a way that sometimes i hadnt because i was just doing it out of duty but yes the book is lighter weight than the others in a sense i came close to owning up to that on the last page it was hard not to see parallels between arthur dents return from space which involves telling everybody hes just returned from california and douglas adamss return from a not altogether happy year in los angeles to the safer environs of islington and while he maintains that fenchurch is no relation to jane his fiance fenchurch being based more on his memories of adolescent love he admits there is an element of this in the book it wouldnt be fanciful to say that there is an echo of my return from la in there but i do think that one problem with the book and there are many is that up to that point i had been writing pure fantasy which id had to do as id destroyed the earth in the first reel so to speak so my job was to make the fantastical and dreamlike appear to be as real and solid as possible that was always the crux of hitchhikers whereas in so long and thanks for all the fish a curious kind of thing happenedi got back to the everyday and somehow for the first time it seemed to be unreal and dreamlike it was rather in reverse i think its largely because i thought id get rid of this problem of not having the earth there to relate to by just bringing it back and i suppose a part of me knew a part of me said that you cant really do that so therefore it wasnt the real earth and therefore it was bound to become unreal and dreamlike and that was really a problem with the book also you see the character of arthur dent has undergone a fundamental change by then because up to that point he has been our representative in a fantastical world he has been everyman the person we can relate to and through whose eyes we have seen the strange things that have happened now suddenly its been turned around and we have a real everyday earth and this character who far from being our representative has just spent the last eight years of his life alternately living in a cave on prehistoric earth or being flung around the galaxy so he is no longer someone through whose eyes we can see things the whole thing has turned upside down and i dont think i had got to grips with that until i was too far committed thats why i am staning afresh now because i feel all the lines have gotten rather too tangled whatever happened to the jumping off a cliff plot it was a structural idea i came up with which i still think is neat as a structure but doesnt work as a book the book would start with him leaping off a cliff with the idea that just before you die your life flashes before you there was something he wanted to remember and hed deal with what happened when he got to the bottom when he got there so the entire book would be a flashback which would come from what he thought and he remembered as he fell down the cliff i decided after hacking away at that for a while that its a short story structure but not a novel structure some people might argue and with i think a certain amount of justice that i didnt achieve a novel structure in the end so what was i making a fuss about but i suppose one reason why a lot of that stuff went why it never materialised was i had the feeling during that period of the whole world looking over my shoulder while i was writing every time someone would write to me and say what are you going to do with this character or why dont you do this to resolve this situation then you instantly shy away from it and think its no longer yours to control it seemed to me like there was too much to tie up and mop up in hitchhikers so that trying to write it like that would just be a continual task of knotting up the loose ends when in fact it might be better just to think of something completely different to do so long and thanks for all the fish was to be the last word on hitchhikers at least in novel form there were still to be the computer games the film the towel possibly more television and more radio even this book but in novel form the story had gone as far as it was going to go at least for then douglas said so do you know where your towel is a towel as explained at length in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a jolly useful thing a towel is also a fairly obvious piece of merchandising while the merchandising properties of a number of anifacts mentioned in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy have obvious commercial potential joo janta sunglasses for example which turn black when danger threatens or disaster area records or even the guide itself technology has not yet reached the point where these things could be manufactured in bulk nor indeed at all not so with towels at one point marks and spencer considered marketing the towel of the book however nothing came of this in douglas had lunch with eugene beer of birmingham publicists beerdavies eugene was handling the publicity for the hitchhikers computer game during the course of this lunch douglas mentioned the abonive marks and spencer towel project eugene immediately saw the potential in real authorised money making towels with the relevant page of hitchhikers emblazoned on it he began marketing them taking out an advert in private eye and sending complimentary towels all over the place the complimentary towels were intended to cause the writers who received them to recommend them in print something which happened almost without exception the towels were originally available in a son of purple and a son of blue they were large strong good value and did all the things that hitchhikery towels are well known for doing in addition to which they gave you something to read on long journeys something that even douglas adams in his initial treatise on towels failed to think of the second edition of towels were available in squornshellous silver and beeblebrox brown and were by but no towels games with computers douglas adams has always been fascinated by gadgets of every kind his home and indeed his life is awash with all those little devices designed to reduce the complications of the workaday world televisions and amplifiers computers and cameras tape players of all descriptions electronic objects of every colour and size the tendency for me to take the piss out of technology is me taking the piss out of myself digital watches and a kitchen full of juice extractors im a sucker for it while the initial success of hitchhikers allowed him to indulge his passion for tape players walkmans and the like he remained for a long time on a battered manual typewriter neither liking nor trusting computers deep thought design the computer is basically a tall white tower which tapers as it goes up as it goes down it widens out so that it actually becomes the floor you quite literally walk up to it to either side of it and set slightly forward of it are two similar but smaller towers set into the front of each tower is a tv screen the screen on the main tower has a picture of a mouth when deep thought talks the mouth moves in synch one of the other screens shows a single eye and the third screen shows a side view of a single ear each eye and ear and mouth should be as anonymous as possible but it should be apparent that they are not from the same person suggested design for deep thought from tv script episode four in a interview he revealed that he considered computers to be if not intrinsically malevolent then useless either hactars or eddles he had just moved into the islington flat and had found it impossible to convince the various utilities companies computers that he had in fact moved dealing with the american express computer he told the reporter has been beyond kafkas worst nightmares in retaliation he had created a scenario for life the universe and everything in which a world much like our own is poised on the brink of nuclear armageddon and tipped over the brink not by a flock of geese or a madmans finger on a red button but by a changeofaddress card fouling up a computer the scene never made it into the final draft he had tried to like computers indeed had gone to a computer show earlier that year but had been overcome by jargon and was forced to leave his enthusiasm bordering on messianic fervour for computers did not really begin until when he spent seven months in los angeles supposedly writing the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy film screenplay while it is true that he did write one and a half drafts of a screenplay over this time it would be equally fair to say that he spent much of the time playing with his word processor and getting involved with interminable computer games douglas had received many requests to turn hitchhikers guide to the galaxy into a computer game and had so far refused all of them however the time spent playing computer games had given him definite ideas he knew he wanted the hitchhikers game to be far more a problemsolving interactive novel than an arcade or space invaders game in late he contacted infocom a massachusetts based company whose previous games had impressed him and suggested a collaboration they agreed enthusiastically and by january douglas was in a position to announce im going to get the computer game done this year which will give me an excuse for playing around with my computer ill be doing the work on a computer in boston and accessing it from here on international packetswitching i love all that new deep thought design deep thought is a huge edifice as huge as set and budget limitations will allow it is brilliant gold it is clearly a computer but it bears an uncanny resemblance to a huge fat buddha the fact that it does so must look awesome and impressive deep thought design from tv script episode four douglas adamss collaborator on the computer game was an american steve meretzky they began by corresponding via electronic bulletin board and then met in february for initial discussions adams wrote chunks of material sent them via computer to meretzky who programmed them and sent them back douglas adams actually designed and wrote more than half the game the rest was a joint effort using douglass ideas and material and meretzkys computer experience the game itself was released in late and proved an immediate success the packaging was imaginative containing an illustrated booklet with pictures of the guide and sundry alien phenomena together with a dont panic badge joo janta sunglasses fluff a microscopic space fleet demolition orders real eagerbeavers should take a very careful look at the signatures on them and no tea the computer game which adams describes as bearing as much relationship to the books as rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead does to hamlet opens much as the other versions of hitchhikers you are arthur dent waking with a hangover on the morning that your house is demolished but you rapidly find yourself in a fiendish and phantasmagoric nightmare in which the object seems to be as much to find out what the purpose of the game is as it is to play it as adams explains it gets the player going and lulled into a false sense of security and then all hell breaks loose and it goes through the most extraordinary number of directions the game just glances at events which were a major part of the books while things i used as one line throwaways are those that i used for the games set pieces the reason was to keep me interested in doing it and i wanted to make it fair for the people who havent read the books so readers and nonreaders were as much as possible on an equal footing the game is equally difficult for both the response to the game was extraordinary described by the londontimes as without doubt the best adventure ever seen on computer it became the bestselling adventure game in america on its release selling over a quarter of a million copies a major part of the games success must have been due to the fact that a reallife author was for the first time actively involving himself in indeed writing a computer game based on his work and also to adamss own love of messing around with computers and devising problems doing crosswords and the like not to mention his need to keep himself interested and amused by that game which communicates itself to participants the game contains much that is new and doubtless apocryphal obscure brainbaffling problems and much new adams text including another opportunity to examine and rewrite the events of the first half of the first book doors babel fish peanuts and tea take on a whole new lease of life some sample passages include of a pub cheese sandwich the barman gives you a cheese sandwich the bread is like the stuff that stereos come packed in the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes and margarine and pickle have combined to produce something that shouldnt be but is turquoise since it is clearly unfit for human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it of one of the many deaths of arthur dent your serious allergic reaction to protein loss from matter transference beams becomes a cause cl bre among various holistic pressure groups in the galaxy and leads to a total ban on dematerialisation within fifty years space travel is replaced by a keen interest in old furniture restoration and market gardening in this new quieter galaxy the art of telepathy flourishes as never before creating a new universal harmony which brings all life together converts all matter into thought and brings about the rebirth of the entire universe on a higher and better plane of existence however none of this affects you because you are dead later in the game when one obtains a copy of the guide it can be consulted on a number of subjects fluff for example fluff is interesting stuff a deadly poison on bodega minor the diet staple of frazelon v the unit of currency on the moons of the blurfoid system and the major crop of the laundry supplies planet blastus one ancient legend claims that four pieces of fluff lie scattered around the galaxy each forming one quarter of the seedling of a tree with amazing properties the sole survivor of the tropical planet fuzzbol the ultimate source of fluff is still a mystery with the scientific community divided between the big lint bang theory and the white lint hole theory footnote should you care to check informs you that its not much of a legend really the game is bizarre and improbable it has the text of a short novel in its memory and means that a good part of douglas adamss mail now consists of heartfelt cries from people trapped on the bridge of the heart of gold or unable to obtain a babel fish a second game was planned at the same time as the first this to take place on the planet of magrathea whether or not the game is a valid part of the hitchhikers canon for which the only requisite for joining would seem to be that it is completely different from any other versions could be debated but comparison is not really needed as douglas adams explained when interviewed about interactive literature you cant compare il with literature if you do you can very easily make a fool of yourself when leo fender first invented an electric guitar one could have said but to what extent is this real music to which the answer is all right were not going to play beethoven on it but at least lets see what we can do what matters is whether its interesting and exciting the thing i like about this is that i can sit down and know that i am the first person to be working in this specific field when you are writing a novel you are aware that you are manipulating your readers here you know you are going to have to make them think how you want them to reason i dont regard it as being an abdication of creative art yes at first i was horrified in fact there is a sense in which now the author is even more in control because the reader has more problems to solve all the devices of the novel are still at your disposal because a novel is simply a string of words and words can mean whatever you want them to it just offers the opportunity to have a lot of fun adams enjoyed putting together and writing the computer game more than any other aspect of hitchhikers following the computer game adamss interest in computers computer games and programming has remained high although at one point he found that he was spending so much time playing with his apple macintosh that he switched back to a manual typewriter in order to get some work done and as a form of penance computer related projects for the future include bureaucracy planned for a mid release projects that were slated to happen but probably wont include reagan god hitchhikers ii and the muppet institute of technology the muppet institute of technology was to have been a one hour special for television using the muppets to promote the idea of computer literacy the late jim henson the muppets creator flew adams and twenty other people to new york for discussions and while douglas was enthused about the project and found henson associates extraordinarily nice people to work with the project did not happen the idea for the reagan program occurred to douglas after watching one of the reaganmondale debates in it occurred to me that people who have to brief reagan for a debate such as that have to provide him with the minimum number of facts and the maximum number of ways of getting to those facts and the most allembracing fallback positions lines to come up with when he doesnt really know the answer to the question and maybe doesnt even understand the question but has recognised some key phrase and can come up with a phrase or line that will cover it and i thought this is exactly the way you program a computer to appear to be taking part in a conversation so with a friend in new york i was going to do a program to emulate reagan so you could sit down and talk to a computer and it would respond as reagan would and then we could do a thatcher one and after a while you could do all the world leaders and get all the various modules to talk to each other after that we were going to do a program called god and program all gods attributes into it and youd have all the different denominations of god on it you know a methodist god a jewish god and so on i wanted to be the first person to have computer software burned in the bible belt which i felt was a rite of passage that any young medium had to pass through however with the recession in the american computer industry all that came to nothing largely because the people who wanted to do it with me discovered they didnt have cars or money or jobs the game itself it is difficult to say too much about the computer game without giving information away that could spoil it for somebody playing it essentially it is based on the events in the first twothirds of the book the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy one starts out as arthur dent in bed one morning in tiverton in devon with an awful hangover initial problems include how to pick something up without it slipping through your fingers and how not to be killed when a large yellow bulldozer knocks down your house things remain fairly faithful to the book until you reach the heart of gold at which point ford zaphod and trillian go off to have a sauna and you are left to your own devices in a ship full of uncooperative gpp machines after that things get very bizarre indeed events are experienced from a multitude of viewpoints problems to be solved occur in places as disparate as damogran a party in islington and the interior of a whale to get you through the game are your copy of the hitchhikers guide your subetha sensomatic thumb and your towel not to mention your native wit luck and a sense of humour and a thing your aunt gave you that you dont know what it is the game is addictive fiendishly hard yet impossible to leave alone until every last problem is solved which can only be done by paying attention to every piece of information that comes your way and often by thinking extremely laterally the game can be played by novices who might in some ways have less difficulty than experienced computer gamers who would not necessarily find it easy to tune in to the games peculiar mindset it is easy to see why douglas adams found this the most enjoyable part of hitchhikers almost all aspects of it from the adventure to the guide entries to the footnotes even to the invisiclues hints book display a relaxed attitude missing from the books and radio series adams has a tendency to have ideas that dont always fit into the framework of what he is doing at the time the enjoyable thing about the computer game is that the most bizarre ideas can be incorporated into it with ease also adamss love of problemsolving is given full rein the weakest part of the game is the opening section of the packaging and manual an eightpage advertisement for the guide yes the universe can be yours for less than altairian dollars per day which comes across as sophomoric more like mad magazine than douglas adams the game however is a major achievement one that even the least computer literate hitchhikers fan should enjoy letters to douglas adams im terribly grateful for the fans apart from anything else they provide my bread and butter im obviously delighted there are so many people who enjoy this stuff but i try to keep a little bit of distance because i believe the most dangerous thing a person can do is believe their own publicity i know from people i look up to and admire for instance john cleese it took me a long time to be able to perceive him as an ordinary human being and i know how very very easy it is to look at somebody who is actually a perfectly normal human being who happens to have a particular talent an ability or facility that puts them into the limelight to see them as being some sort of very elevated and extraordinary person which theyre not i think you do yourself a favour if you try not to expose yourself too much to people who are going to tell you you are gods gift to the human race which youre not the media present you as being some kind of superhuman and you arent so you just have to keep all that at arms length its rather curious when i discover that a phrase of mine has entered the language i mean one never seriously thinks that what one gets up to at home has much effect on anything else and though you see the bestseller lists and get letters and royalty statements it doesnt impinge on me that it has that kind of effect on other people i dont want to believe that it does people like me dont make the gossip pages because they dont know our faces i get the advantages of being famous with none of the disadvantages its startling when somebody does recognise me i feel slightly vulnerable when it occurs i can understand why writers take a pseudonym its strange having an existence in other peoples minds which has little to do with you its not the same me they wrote about on my school reports douglas adams on fame browsing through douglas adamss letters file is a truly mind expanding experience all human life and a fair amount of putative alien life is there certain themes however tend to recur most people want to know where he gets his ideas one american wouldbe author wanted to know if she could have any leftover ideas he didnt need others ask questions want advice propose marriage or sex and occasionally offer solutions to matters raised in the books three students from huddersfield university for example claim to have discovered the ultimate question of life the universe and everything the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything is not in fact but is stored in the reproductive cells of all life forms and this answer is found via to explain better all or most cells reprodure by splitting in two to form two cells thus one cell becomes two two becomes four and so on it follows that the answer must therefore be some power of two deep thought came up with the number and this is indeed the power to which must be raised to find this answer thus by obtaining reducing it to morse code turning the morse code into letters rearranging the letters into passable words and interpreting the answer thus obtained they were able to work out what the question was i would not dare to give the game away by revealing it but will simply say that any kabbalistic scholar would have been proud of their work you may reproduce it if you wish these are some of the most common questions he gets asked q what was the dire straits songfrom so long and thanks for all the fish a the dire straits song is tunnel of love and its on the making movies album q did you steal the biscuits story from jeffrey archer a the origin of the story about the biscuits was that it actually happened to me at cambridge station england in since when ive told the story so often on radio and tv that people have begun to pinch it this is why i wanted to put it down in black and white myself i didnt know jeffrey archer had used a similar story in a quiver full of arrows having never read the book i would point out that the date comes somewhat after the date q what was the question of life the universe and everything a the actual question for which arthur dent has been seeking has now been revealed to me it is this as soon as ive managed to decipher it and im waiting for someone to send me a primer for the language in which it is written and it may be some time i will let you know to a thirteenyearold young novelist who was having great difficulty thinking up names for characters a if you are having trouble in thinking up character names you are probably using the wrong kind of coffee have you tried an italian blend q how do you mix a pan galactic gargle blaster a im afraid it is impossible to mix a pan galactic gargle blaster in earths atmospheric conditions but as an alternative i suggest you buy up the contents of your local liquor store pour them into a large bucket and redistil them three times im sure your friends would appreciate this q what is the point of dr who a the whole point of dr who is that if you take the second letter of each of the th words of all the episodes over the last twenty years of broadcast and run them together backwards the original location of the lost city of atlantis is revealed i hope this answers your question to a student who wished to do a thesis on scientific and philosophical themes in hitchhikers a most of the ideas in hitchhikers come from the logic of jokes and any relation they bear to anything in the real world is usually completely coincidental to someone enquiring where arthur got the copy of the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy in so long and thanks for all the fish and in which pub in taunton fenchurch and arthur met a although copies of the actual guide have never been published on earth copies of it are freely or rather expensively available throughout the galaxy arthur acquired another one for himself on his journey back to earth in other words between the end of life the universe and everything and so long and thanks for all the fish although i set the pub scene in taunton the pub i had in mind was in fact one in gillingham in dorset the name of which i forget q will you ever novelise the dr who episodes you wrote a as far as the pirate planet or city of death are concerned although i wouldnt mind adapting them into books at some time in the future there are far too many other things that i want to do in the meantime certainly i dont want anyone else doing them though as for shada no i dont particularly want to see that done i think that its not such a great story and has only gained the notoriety it has got because no ones seen it if it had been finished and broadcast it would have never have aroused so much interest often he receives numbered questions which often get numbered answers q why did you decide to start writing what aspects of science fiction are you ripping off what experiences do you feel affected your attitudes and values can your feelings be linked with those of any of the characters in your boorfs s what is your background why do you write science fiction rather than normal fiction do you enjoy writing e what do you think is your style of writing a because i couldnt think of anything else to do are you sure you mean the same by ripping off as i do all of them some of them varied im not sure no both q how long did it take you to write life the universe and everything are any of the characters designed from your own personality have you ever considered doing a comic book who is your favourite character in the trilogy where did you get the inspiration to do your books a several months no no dont have one from a mail order company in iowa q why did you start to write why do you write science fiction where do you get your ideas from a because i was broke i didnt mean to i just exaggerate a lot a small mail order firm in cleveland q how do you come up with those names what gave you the idea to write the books why this subject when did you decide to become an author and why did you like the results of the books why did you put ford and arthur on ancient earth how long did it take to write the books a yes no somerset last thursday morning french no and finally a letter that douglas scrawled answers in on but which was never posted since the correspondent had omitted his name and address do you parallel yourself on any of the main characters how no how did working with the monty python troupe affect your work i didnt i knew them but did not work with them how often have you been railroaded or forced into doing something you just didn t want to do as arthur dent in life the universe and everything times do you believe in fate and do you try to put this idea across in your work no could you include a short autobiography including anything tbat you consider contributing to your work born havent died yet what is your favourite planet earth its the only one i know did you do much research before doing the writing none have you studied history in depth semidepth what is your main message in life the universe and everything no message if id wanted to write a message id have written a message i wrote a book have you ever had experiences similar to that your characters have no have you ever been hounded by the galactic police for the whereabouts of one zaphod beeblebrox no they are fictional characters sex and the single hitchhiker since i have such an indepth knowledge of your work i feel i am worthy of meeting you and chatting to you about our dear friends trill zaphod and not forgetting miserable marvin please write and let me know when and where you would like to arrange a meeting im mostly to be found feet above iceland but if you feel like popping up for a drink id be glad to say hello dear mr adams rest easy im not a beverly hills real estate agent if youre still unmarried and have no children and youre interested in girls pick up the phone next time youre in new york city dial and ask for marion i would love to meet the man behind that silly grin references furnished on request dear mr adams let me start by telling you im not a surrey estate agent i will get straight to the point im formally offering you the opportunity of an affair with me you have been selected out of many worldfamous writers of humerus prose to be the recipient of a romantic involvement with me the duration of which will depend on a whether or not we speak the same language and b how good you are at screwing the young lady in question said she was five feet eight nine stone six a brunette with multicoloured eyes and described herself as discreet adventurous agile willing to do anything provided it doesnt do me permanent physical damage and ive a good phone manner douglas did not reply then there was the fan letter from an american writer hopefully working on a film script who explained its a lot of work but i break the monotony getting laid in the back bars by pretending to be you thanks fruitcakes dear mr adams thank you for no longer writing about aphod beeblebrox because i grew to feel a keen sense of identification with him from acquiring two heads a fleet and experiencing the flying city in the pyramids your hhgg corporation building at least i deduce it was because the motto was dont panic see daniel because at that very hour the planets were in conjunction this is followed by a lengthy ramble through the bible and the works of adams castenada and moorcock which proves that is really the number of the beast and concludes well thanks for all the fish a word from you might help matters with my girlfriend who doesnt seem to understand i actually lived through your books if you don t understand this then ill just give up the gods dont dwell amongst men daniel dear mr adams i had a dream this morning that jack lemmon came up to me and asked directions to the royal albert hall dear douglas adams the answer is not it is nammyotorengekyo this is the law of life as propounded by nichiren derishonin in about ad dear douglas what age will i be when mankind is born out of mother earth i am now do you know kit williamss phone number happy christmas and many ofthem i reckon about eight by my digital watch love muz a number of people have said that hitchhikers belongs to the same genre as pilgrims progress thats not to compare the two just to point out that there is a genre with a long history which is that of the innocent abroad in a fantastical world a graduate student sent me a long paper on one book that we know for sure that john bunyan actually read its called the plain mans path to heaven written by an english puritan writer called arthur dent he assumed that i was бware of this and was having some extraordinary academic joke once youve decided to find parallels you can find them all the time you can add up numbers you can compare images you can pick up any two books and if you wished to prove they were parallel you could do it you could pick up the bible and the telephone directory and you could prove that each has a direct relationship to the other douglas adams the last word dear mr adams youre weird or at least your writing is weird thats okay by me im a little weird myself if you are really one of those terribly dull people who just write weird please keep it a secret i hate being disillusioned dirk gently and time for tea im half inclined to look at other genres i never set out to parody sf but to use the trappings of sf to look at other things i think id like to do a detective novel not as a parody but to use those conventions to do something else then again people could say why dont you do something else directly and i dont know the answer to that except that id feel very nervous about it i always have to dogleg around something to get somewhere id like to do a mystery story or a detective story not influenced by any one author as soon as you do that you become a parodist and im not a parodist parody is one of the easier forms of writing and its one that is too easy to slip into when you arent trying hard enough im not saying ive not slipped into it but when i did it was usually one of my less successful moments douglas adams january i feel written out in hitchhikers and i dont feel i have anything more to say in that particular medium there are other things i want to do ive been thinking of writing in the horrormysteryoccult area really the whole thing is to find a whole new set of characters and a new environment it isnt just that its new but that its an environment and a set of characters that i now at age thought up rather than what i came up with when i was theres an awful lot of things i want to do and the major thing the core is going to have to be writing books douglas adams october its called dirk gentlys holistic detective agency douglas adams december one morning in november douglas adams and his agent ed victor sat in a hotel room in which a number of phone lines had been set up and waited for the phones to ring by the end of the working day one lucky publisher had come away with the rights to dirk gentlys holistic detective agency and its sequel and douglas was over two million dollars richer than he had been that morning the first book was to be delivered in a years time and would be published in april and after that well the moment you always feel like writing a book is when youve just finished one so now ive actually got a twobook deal what id like to do is write this book then immediately write the second book and see if i can get them both done in a year at the moment the second book will be a dirk gently book as well assuming the first one works from the original outline of dirk gentlys holistic detective agency it was obviously a detective novel an occultghost story a dissertation on quantum physics and a great deal of fun as has already been commented on certain characters and situations from shada and city of death recur one of my objectives with this book is although it is going to be a comedy it is not as hitchhikers was going to be primarily a comedy because with hitchhikers everything would have to bow and bend to the jokes and often you would have to abandon bits of plot or turn them on their heads or do real violence to a plot in order to get the joke to be funny what i want to do with this and am in the process of getting is a tightly organised plot with a lot of ideas packed in it and then write by that plot and allow it to be funny when it wants to be but not force it to be funny which was the problem with hitchhikers once thats straight then all sorts of things become naturally funny but theres never any sense of well its like when you used to have to write essays at school you would always want to put in jokes but the moment youve got to write a sketch you cant think of anything funny to save your life so im setting this up in a different way this time it will be apparent when you read it that being funny is an imponant pan of it but its just not the prime mover any more in the uk the bidding saw the book go to heinemann with pan as the paperback house something that douglas saw as solving a problem he had faced hitheno the problem was that ive always gone into paperback first and even with so long and thanks which went into hardback first it was still from a paperback house but theres a different way that paperback houses are geared to doing things than hardbacks because at a paperback house the schedule is so much tighter because they are going to sell so many more copies of the book and because everything a paperback house does is almost always after the hardback publication of the book theres no need to build flexibility into the system hardback publishers on the other hand are completely geared to the fact that writers are always late and always difficult in the past every time i hit a problem which was pretty frequently there was no time to stop and get it right it began to seem absurd to me that here i was an author of incredibly popular books so what i wrote was imponant not only to me but to a very large public and i didnt have a chance to get it right and this seemed absolutely crazy the more successful you become the less chance there is of getting the stuff you are writing to work properly now i want to make it clear that im not being rude about pan who did a wonderful job in promoting and marketing and selling an enormous number of copies but it is just not in the nature of a paperback house to deal with the problems of actual authorship thats not what they are geared up to do so now that i have a hardback publisher i think this is going to malie a huge difference to the way things go from now on my lifestyle its very boring i do spend a lot of money on things that i dont need like fast cars which is pretty silly considering i only use them to pooter about town ive been through this thing with cars before as id always promised myself that when i had some money i wouldnt do something silly like buying a flashy car so as soon as hitchhikers went to number one in the bestseller lists i went out and bought a porsche i hated it driving it around in london was like taking a ming vase to a football match going for a drive was like setting out to invade poland i got rid of it after going into a skid coming out of hyde park and crashing into a wall by the hard rock caf there was a huge queue of people outside all of whom cheered loudly so i got rid of it and got a golf gti when i was in la i had a saab turbo and when i came back to the uk with an la state of mind i bought a bmw which was nice but i didnt need a car that cost spendthrift is part of my lifestyle i spend a lot of my money in restaurants like jane and i going off last year to france we decided to have fun which was about the only thing we failed to do everywhere we went the hotels were shut so we decided to go down to burgundy where at least the meals would be good we arrived there late at night and i had one of the best omelettes ive ever tasted unfortunately it had some strange mushrooms in it and i was in bed for two days with food poisoning we were booked into all these wonderful restaurants and i never got to any of them then we drove back as soon as my stomach was strong enough to hold anything down we couldnt find anything decent to eat then it rained all the time and we missed the ferry and had to drive to calais and i was seasick all the way back home thats the jetset lifestyle for you somehow it cost me a lot of money adams spent most of editing the utterly utterly merry comic relief christmas book spending less time than he had hoped assisting in the writing of the bureaucracy computer game it involves you in a bewildering series of adventures from your own home to the depths of the african jungle but the object of the game is simply to get your bank to acknowledge a changeof address card and planning dirk gently dirk gently has nothing at all to do with hitchhikers its a kind of ghosthorrordetectivetimetravelromanticcomedy epic mainly concerned with mud music and quantum mechanics the strange thing is that while i was working on hitchhikers i would always find myself telling people i wasnt a science fiction writer simply a humour writer who happened to be using some science fiction ideas to tell jokes with but dirk gently is changing my mind i think maybe i am a science fiction writer its very strange on science fiction extract from an interview with douglas adams conducted by the author in november ive read the first pages of a tremendous amount of science fiction one thing ive found is that no matter how good the ideas are a lot of it is terribly badly written years ago i read asimovs foundation trilogy the ideas are captivating but the writing i wouldnt employ him to write junk mail i loved the film of saw it six times and read the book twice and then i read a book called the lost worlds of in which clarke chronicles the disagreements between himself and kubrick he goes through all the ideas left by the wayside look at this idea he left out and this idea and at the end of the book one has an intense admiration for kubrick i read when it came out and it was like all the stuff that kubrick had been sensible enough to leave out of whats good vonnegut hes great but hes not an sf writer people criticise him for saying it but its true he started with one or two ideas he wanted to convey and happened to find some conventions of sf that suited his purpose i thought the sirens of titan was close in many ways to hitchhikers the chronosynclastic infundibulum for example if lve got that right thats right yes its funny people make this comparison and im always incredibly flattered because i dont think its a fair comparison its unfair to vonnegut apart from anything else because when you are talking about his best books im not talking about his later books where i cant understand how he gets the enthusiasm to get in front of the typewriter and actually write that stuff its like going through the motions of his own stylistic tricks those first three were deeply serious books my books arent serious at that level they are on some level but theres a very clear disparity between them read a vonnegut book next to one of mine and its clear theyre utterly different people are tempted to compare them for three reasons firstly they are both funny in some way and secondly theyve got spaceships and robots in them its the labelling a much much stronger influence in my writing is pg wodehouse he didnt write about robots and spaceships though so people dont spot it they are looking for labels there are wodehousian turns ofphrase in your writing like the line about aunt calling to aunt like dinosaurs across a marsh yes i actually pinched that line somewhere in the third book im not sure where the mattresses yes its at the end of the mattresses scene in the swamp but i have to point that out to people since no one noticed as regards good sf books well a canticle for leibowitz is a wonderful book theres also someone i came across because of hitchhikers people kept saying if you write this stuff you must know the work of robert sheckley l assumed you must have read sheckleys dimension of nliracles people kept saying that so i finally sat down and read it and it was quite creepy the guy who constructed earth it was completely fortuitous those are coincidences and after all there are only a small number of ideas i felt what i did was more akin to sheckley than vonnegut as with everything else douglas has done dirk gently was late by the time it was finished there was no time to get it properly typeset and to get proof copies out something that spurred douglas to become a desktop publisher the book was typeset on his macintosh computer indeed the proof copies were printed on his laser printer and came out on time in spring to mixed reviews some people found it more satisfying than a hitchhikers book others missed the nonstop cavalcade of jokes saving the world at no extra charge dirk gently is a detective and a rather improbable one at that hes smug hes fat hes bespectacled hes a smartass he sends out ludicrous bills with positively ridiculous expenses claims and worst of all hes probably right hes the kind of person you only ever want to know under the direst of circumstances svald cjelli popularly known as dirk though again popular was hardly right notorious certainly sought after endlessly speculated about those too were true but popular only in the sense that a serious accident on the motorway might be popular everyone slows down to have a good look but no one will get too close to the flames infamous was more like it svald cjelli infamously known as dirk dirk gentlys holistic detective agency douglas adams knows nothing about detectives or at least not very much indeed so woeful is his level of knowledge that dirk gentlys holistic detective agency was criticised for the sloppy way in which the author disentangled the problems he posed for the sleuth adams also violates cardinal rules of mystery writing by supplying readers with information insufficient to solve the crime and by introducing deux ex machina to bail out the the plot logjams according to the chicago tribune if dirk gently was genuinely a detective the criticism might have been valid but then gently is really a conman who has a disproportionate interest in the interconnectedness of all things and the workings of quantum mechanics thats what really fascinates gently and working as a private eye simply enables him to engage that passion and charge his clients for the privilege of course i will explain to you again why the trip to the bahamas was so vitally necessary said dirk gently soothingly nothing could give me greater pleasure i believe as you know mrs sauskind in the fundamental interconnectedness of all things furthermore i have plotted and triangulated the vectors of the interconectedness of all things and traced them to a beach in the bahamas which it is therefore necessary for me to visit from time to time in the course of my investigations i wish it were not the case since sadly i am allergic to both the sun and rum punches but then we all have our cross to bear dont we mrs sauskind dirk gently dirk gentlys holistic detective agency as a whodunit dirk gently doesnt really hang together since there is only one murder and if you were paying attention its fairly obvious who did it even if you werent paying attention you get told before too long so if dirk gently doesnt work as either a detective story or an archetypal whodunit how does it engage any interest well like all douglas adams books it is funny its an amusing and engaging romp through the spurious borders of the detective yarn within these parameters douglas constructs a hugely improbable tale which requires the introduction of a detective to unravel theres also adamss fascination with science fiction computers ecology quantum mechanics and even a touch of fractal mathematics the story in which dirk gently finds himself is almost incidental whats important is all the peripheral stuff which may or may not advance the plot both reviewers and detective novel fans were annoyed by the introduction of a bit of science fiction to get out of some of tricky plot twists this is understandable or at least it would be understandable if dirk gentlys holistic detective agency was in fact a detective novel but it isnt its a douglas adams novel where the rules arent quite the same even so adams does take liberties and using the timetravel trick is perhaps an easy way out but there is plenty to enjoy for a start theres dirk himself a thoroughly wretched character with few redeeming features and then theres the electric monk perhaps adamss finest creation since marvin the paranoid android the electric monk was created to believe things which would save their creators the trouble of believing them themselves this is such a mind meldingly brilliant ploy its a wonder no one ever thought of it before but then no one ever thought of writing a fully realised ghosthorrordetectivewhodunittime travelromantic musicalcomedy epic before either the electric monks only flaw is that it has developed a fault and insists on believing the most ludicrous things even if only for twentyfour hours but when an electric monk believes something it will believe it up to the hilt and nothing will shake its fundamental certainty until such time as it finds something more interesting to believe in this monk had first gone wrong when it was simply given too much to believe in one day it was by mistake crossconnected to a video recorder that was watching eleven tv channels simultaneously and this caused it to blow a bank of illogic circuits the video recorder only had to watch them of course it didnt have to believe them all as well this is why instruction manuals are so important so after a hectic week of believing that war was peace that good was bad that the moon was made of blue cheese and that god needed a lot of money sent to a certain box number the monk started to believe that thirtyfive percent of all tables were hermaphrodites and then broke down dirk gentlys holistic detective agency dust had not even begun to think about settling on dirk gentlys holistic detective agency when douglas produced a followup the long dark teatime of the soul here dirk continues to explore the interconnectedness of all things this time the things that are interconnected include a new fridge a cocacola drinks dispensing machine an echo perhaps of some previous episode a selfimmolating airline checkin desk and the gods of asgard one of whom thor is currently an unhappy patient of the nhs now normally that might be enough to spoil anyones day but what really upsets dirk is that his client is dead so whos going to pay the bill dirk is never one to let anything so trivial as saving the world interfere with the important stuff like getting paid promptly and by someone living the plot frailties of the first book were largely remedied in the sequel and dirk gently looks set to become at least as long running as hitchhikers as many novelists have discovered the public loves a good detective whats more theyre damn difficult to kill off just ask sir arthur conan doyle the long dark teatime of the soul was dedicated to jane belson a barrister and douglass longterm companion the book was published in october but it still took them another three years to get married this took place on november at islington town hall in north london the only reason it probably hadnt happened earlier was that douglas was well not exactly noticeable by his presence throughout the entire dirk gently episode douglas was in constant contact with a zoologist called mark carwardine they were organising or attempting to organise a series of expeditions to track down some of the worlds rarest animals but what with one thing and another books coming out and needing to undertake world tours to promote them that sort of thing this would be another episode that would be three years in the making douglas and other animals in mark carwardine the zoologist and douglas adams the extremely ignorant nonzoologist went to madagascar in search of the ayeaye a creature no one had actually seen for years at the behest of the observer colour supplement and the world wildlife fund setting off for an island in pursuit of the nearextinct lemur they caught a twenty second glimpse of the creature on the island of neco mangabo on the first night photographed it and returned feeling remarkably pleased with themselves in fact they were so remarkably pleased they decided to do it all again only this time with some different species of endangered animal and in places other than madagascar but as mark carwardine was to discover getting himself douglas adams and a bunch of threatened animals together in the same place at the same time was to prove a logistical nightmare and since logistics are not douglass strong point this was all left to mark it was several years before we both had the time as we were both involved in other projects to set off and undertake last change to see but when we actually sat down to do it it was amazing we actually worked out that if we had three weeks to search for each endangered species and went for all the main ones in the world it would take us years and thats just the animals if we had decided to include threatened plants as well it would have taken another years so we decided wed be selective we just sat down and i said well how about going to the congo and douglas would say well id rather go to the seychelles and so wed hit on a happy medium and go to mauritius it was a bit like that we picked a whole variety so wed get different kinds of animal we had the komodo dragon which is a reptile we had the rodrigues fruitbat which is a mammal we went to look for the yangtze river dolphin in china the kakapo which is a bird a kind of parrot in new zealand the juan fernandez fur seal in chile the manatee in the amazon in brazil and the northern white rhino in zaire mark carwardine once they had decided where they were going to go and in search of which animals all they had to do was arrange a time this was not to prove an easy task but by may after a year of anxious juggling and rearranging the pair were ready to probe the darker recesses of mans inhumanity to everything else he shares the planet with with a selfimposed time limit of just three weeks for each trip they set off in search of dolphins and dragons and on and off they werent to reemerge until mid meanwhile as is the way in all these things other forces were at work heinemann had been persuaded to stump up a staggeringly huge advance to enable the intrepid explorers to go off exploring intrepidly they also thought it would make a fairly nifty tv series this idea was quickly dismissed after a conversation with the chinese authorities as mark carwardine explains the first expedition we tried to set up was the yangtze river dolphin we started making investigations enquiring with the right people in china about permits for filming and all that kind of thing and we got a reply back saying sure we can arrange for you to come and film itll take at least nine months to organise the permit and itll cost you so we put a stop to that straight away and then started thinking about radio and so armed with only a bbc radio sound engineer the pair set off for the far corners of the planet sometimes they were successful sometimes not either way the bbc managed to get themselves six wildlife programmes for next to nothing as the zoologist began to realise the benefits of recording for radio and the nonzoologist began to get wet we were trying to land on an island off the coast of mauritius called round island which they reckon has more endangered species per square metre than anywhere else in the world its a tiny little island very hard to land on because of the swell and theres no good landing points we all had our gear wrapped up but the soundman just had a microphone sticking out and was recording when douglas fell out of the boat and was being smashed against the rock there was blood everywhere and it was all quite dramatic we got the whole thing on tape but if wed had a tv crew there wed have had to dry douglas off mop up all the blood and then get him to do it again and it just wouldnt have been the same initially we were thinking about radio as a second choice but in retrospect it worked much better than television and they always say about radio you get better pictures there was an occasion when we were just checking into the lodge on the island of komodo in indonesia we had three chickens with us for food and a komodo dragon came and grabbed the chickens and ran off and the sounds of all this the squawking of the chicken and the three of us chasing after the dragon and the shouting of the guards and scrabbling in the dust comes across so well on radio maybe wed have got some of it on telly if wed have had the cameras ready by chance but i think its more impressive when you sit back eyes closed and just listen to it and build up your own picture so i think in retrospect radio worked better than television could have mark carwardine with douglas dried off and mopped down they returned to civilization and the south of france where douglas had been exiled for a year by his accountant for tax reasons there the explorers were to write of their adventures instead as the zoologist confesses they became strenuously involved in lots of sitting in french cafs discussing it we just spent hours and hours and hours talking it through listening to the tapes they were really useful sorting information we kept notes about facts and figures and what happened and quotes from people and that kind of thing but just listening to some of the sounds on the tapes brought back memories of our impressions and a feeling for places rather than the pure facts and figures we spent hours listening to those discussing it all talking it through then we sat down and douglas did most of the writing with me feeding ideas and information and checking facts while he was sitting at the word processor with me looking over his shoulder that was basically how it was done we did it in different ways it was done in bits basically and then put together with a mad period of twentyfourhour days at the end in fact the south of france proved a less than productive environment for the pair too many distractions too may cafs to sit in after four months they had produced a total of one page but one way or another the book eventually got written heinemann published last chance to see a bizarre combination of travelogue and conservation in october to good reviews the times considered it descriptive writing of a high order this is an extremely intelligent book the pan paperback followed thirteen months later last chance to see was also made available on cdrom by the voyager company providing hundreds of colour stills interviews and audio essays by mark carwardine and extracts from the radio series to accompany the text lazier readers could simply listen to douglas reading the book voyager have also published the complete hitchhikers guide to the galaxy at least it was complete until mostly harmless put in an appearance as an expanded book for use on a macintosh computer in fact hitchhikers continues appearing in different formats bbc enterprises have released an audio tape or cd boxset which was followed by the long dark tea time of the soul this time just on tape the bbc broadcast the last chance to see programmes weekly on radio between october and november with repeats later the same week curiously enough four of the programmes were rebroadcast the following year though what happened to the kakapo and the fruitbat tapes can only be guessed also lost it seems was a ten minute programme called natural selection in search of the aye aye broadcast on november recalling that first expedition but the question remains after all this did they do any good mark carwardine thinks so when we went to new zealand to look for the kakapo which is this groundliving parrot which cant fly but its forgotten that it cant fly it jumps out of trees and just lands on the ground with a thud its down to roughly the last forty to fortyfive birds thats all thats surviving and people had sort of half given up in new zealand there were a few dedicated scientists but the powersthatbe werent really putting enough resources into it and the scientists were having a hard time getting what they needed to save the bird from extinction when we went there for some reason our visit got a lot of interest and there was a lot of publicity and one thing led to another over the weeks we were there and the bird was suddenly put as top priority and more resources were made available to help it so that was good in other parts of the world where the books been published its really hard to say my general view is that if you can aim a book like last chance to see at people who wouldnt normally buy a wildlife book and get a radio series out to people who wouldnt normally listen to one then youre reaching a completely different audience and if you can capture just one per cent of them then its doing some good the more people you can make aware of the problems the wildlifes facing and whats being done about it and what needs to be done the better from that point of view i think it probably has done some good the captured chicken on komodo might have had other ideas as to any future adamscarwardine collaborations the zoologist has this idea one possibility is doing warzone wildlife going to countries that have had wars or suffered from wars and looking at the effect its hбd on conservation and the environment and the wildlife given douglas adamss inability to successfully negotiate a landfall on round island without blood being spilt heading into a warzone doesnt immediately strike one as being a particularly smart move perhaps with this in mind douglass next move was instead to leave the planet altogether and seek out something mostly harmless anything that happens happens it goes something like this after the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy trilogy is completed it well isnt not really there are too many loose ends left dangling out there in hyperspace that need tying together so douglas adams is locked into a room and told not to come out until he has completed the fourth and absolutely final book in the trilogy all those dangling plot threads have to be clipped and tied off there has to be no going back ever at all not even slightly but then then there was mostly harmless after so long and thanks for all the fish wherein gods last message to his creation was finally revealed and marvin could at last relieve the pain in all the diodes down his left side by finally dying things were supposed to have been wrapped up neatly and conclusively but as adams himself writes in the preamble to mostly harmless anything that happens happens anything that in happening causes something else to happen causes something else to happen anything that in happening causes itself to happen again happens again it doesnt necessarily do it in chronological order though which means that what exactlys going on in mostly harmless is anybodys guess after douglass travels undertaken for last chance to see his outlook on the world and its mercurial workings were altered irrevocably this is hardly surprising given the staggering vista those expeditions had opened to the author adams took this new perspective and naturally began writing it into his books and there were also those tantalisingly unanswered questions lingering from so long and thanks for all the fish such as what was to become of arthur dent and his newfound love fenchurch what had become of ford prefect zaphod bebblebrox and trillian the other occupants of the heart of gold what was to become of that most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and perhaps most importantly could marvin really be dead there is a positive answer to at least one of these questions but in order that some sense of mystery remain to those who have not read mostly harmless it wont be revealed which question this answer relates to until the end of this book was bookended by hitchhikers activity at the beginning of the year the bbc finally issued the tv series on video having previously been prevented by the uncertain contractual situation between douglas and the movie moguls in hollywood to whom he had sold the film rights that is another saga that has yet to be resolved to recoup these rights is costing douglas something in the region of with a bunch of other catch clauses thrown in for good or bad measure but once the dust has settled there may yet be more hitchhikers stories reaching the tv screens the original series was released on video in a twovolume set eleven years after its initial transmission the second volume even contained previously unseen material a few minutes that were cut to make the programmes fit their timeslot the bbc also managed to remaster the mono soundtrack into stereo and on radio the bbc rebroadcast the second hitchhikers series at the end of the year came mostly harmless fifth in the increasingly inaccurately named hitchhikers guide to the galaxy trilogy while many fans may have been disturbed by so long and thanks for all the fishs lack of science fiction it was after all a love story kind of mostly harmless has a whole truckload of sf and theres the occasional passage you just know could not have been written by douglas prior to his ecological jaunt around the world it was a sight that arthur never quite got used to or tired of he and ford had tracked their way swiftly along the side of the small river that flowed down along the bed of the valley and when at last they reached the margin of the plains they pulled themselves up into the branches of a large tree to get a better view of one of the stranger and more wonderful visions that the galaxy has to offer the great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of perfectly normal beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across the anhondo plain in the early pale light of the morning as the great animals charged through the fine steam of the sweat of their bodies mingled with the muddy mist churned up by their pounding hooves their appearance seemed a little unreal and ghostly anyway but what was heartstopping about them was where they came from and where they went to which appeared to be simply nowhere mostly harmless theres also some bizarre physics and temporal paradoxes that may or may not have come about since the earth or what we popularly believe to be the earth was destroyed by the vogons way back when the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy has in what we laughingly call the past had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel universes very little of this is however at all comprehensible to anyone below the level of advanced god and since it is now wellestablished that all known gods came into existence a good three millionths of a second after the universe began rather than as they usually claimed the previous week they already have a great deal of explaining to do as it is and are therefore not available for comment on matters of deep physics at this time mostly harmless mostly harmless delves into that decidedly murky pool of parallel universes so youre never entirely sure whether the arthur dent featured here is in fact the same arthur dent as popped up elsewhere after all theres an astrophysicist called trillian in the stars and also a thrusting young tv reporter called tricia mcmillan and they may be related in some way or other and the tv reporter who once met an extraterrestrial called zaphod at a party in islington but didnt go with him is apparently a tv reporter on earth at least an earth although which one is anybodys guess this earth hasnt been destroyed or if it has it is showing a remarkable reluctance to disappear altogether meanwhile aside from tackling such weighty sfcosmologicalscientific questions as parallel universes theres a little astrology plus some aliens called grebulons the grebulons are currently stationed on the recently discovered tenth planet in the solar system named after nothing much in particular rupert the grebulons who set out to wreak havoc or something met with a slight accident counesy of a meteor storm on the way and have since entirely forgotten what it was that they were supposed to do when they got wherever it was they were meant to be going so they watch tv instead in the meantime arthur having singularly failed to find the earth or at least an earth that remotely resembles the one we still presume the vogons to have blown up settles on a pleasant little planet after his ship crashlands and he is the only survivor there he becomes the sandwich maker and is reasonably happy reasonably happy that is for a man who has managed to lose not only his planet but also since then the love of his life fenchurch in an accident involving improbability drive however improbable that may seem but arthur manages to remain stoical throughout since he knows he cant die until he meets the hapless agrajag on the anarchically named stavromula beta as he discovered during the unfolding plot of life the universe and everything and yes if nothing else this is a story that does manage to resolve itself elsewhere ford is having huge problems with the new owners of the hitchhikers ghide to the galaxy infinidim enterprises they are not only no fun to be with at panies but are also horror upon horror in the process of replacing the guide with the guide mark ii which comes in a box on which is printed in large unfriendly letters the word panic ford unable to go to a party is understandably not at all happy and the more he learns of infinidim enterprises the less happy he is he engages the services of a mechanical friend called colin and attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery that is why there are no panies or even drink at the hitchhikers offices anymore by leaping out of the building a lot and eventually going off in search of anhur while all that is happening anhur discovers to his shock that he has become a father his daughter has the unlikely name of random and is generally surly and badtempered and has a mother called trillian and if youre wondering no they didnt it was all down to dna sampling and stuff like that anyway random is definitely not the sort of person you want to lend a watch to and arthur is a little taken aback when his peaceful existence as sandwich maker is interrupted by the arrival of trillian who dumps their daughter on him and disappears into the stratosphere once again arthur loses happiness and gains responsibility he isnt happy all this goes on between the covers of mostly harmless which contains only mentions of zaphod bebblebrox and not a single appearance meanwhile douglas adamss time becomes more and more crowded and before long he may well wish to escape to a parallel universe himself his every waking hour for the foreseeable future is swallowed up by a world tour to promote the book in all the far flung corners of the planet he is about to be enveloped by the media circuit in this country and appearances on radio and tv chat shows are promised or even threatened douglas adams once again is about to become a multimedia personality in hitchhikers fan kevin davies is releasing his the making of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy video which has been approved by douglas and over in new york dc comics are publishing the official hitchhikers guide to the galaxy comic book adaptation the comic will run over three issues and is scripted by john carnell and drawn by steve leilohah it will be published by pan in the uk but as to any more books well there definitely categorically absolutely and unequivocally wont be any more hitchhikers books although only zarquon knows for sure mostly harmless is the last book douglas will publish through heinemann he is following his editor sue freestone to jonathan cape he would have done so already were it not for heinemann not unnaturally being none too willing to let one of their leading authors go without a struggle douglas and his agent ed victor became entangled in a wrangle which has now been resolved to everyones satisfaction but it managed to delay the publication of mostly harmless since while it was going on douglas couldnt put pen to paper or more accurately finger to word processor oh yes and if you are still wondering and havent bought mostly harmless yet and shame on you if you havent yes marvin really is dead and doesnt appear in the book at all of such exclusions are great tragedies made dirk appendix hitchhikers the original synopsis tiffs the text itself the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy douglas adams the show is a science fiction comedy adventure in time and space which weaves in and out of fantasy jokes satire parallel universe and time warps in the wake of two men who are researching the new revised edition of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy an electronic boook designed to help the footlose wanderer find his way round the marvels of the universe for les than thirty altarian dollars a day one of the men is an extraterrestrial who has spent some years living incognito on the earth when he first arrrived the minimal research he had done suggested to his that the name ford perfect would be nicely incoonspicous the other is an earthma arthur dent who was a friend of fords for years without feeling that he wasnt a perfectly ordinary human being the first episode tells of how ford reveals the truth about himself to an incredulous arthur and how they both escape from a doomed earth to begin their wanderings the story starts as arthur is lying on the ground in the path of a buldoser which is about to demolish his house to make away for a new bypass having fought the plane at every level this is his last ditch effort he is arguing with a man from the council who is pointing out to him in a godfatherly way that the bulldozer driver is is a rather careless gentleman who isnt too fussy about what he drives over in the middle of this confrontation ford arrives in a rather anxious state and asks arthur is he is busy at al and if theres somewhere they can go and chat arthur astonished refuses to move ford is very insistenty and eventually arthur calls the man from the council and asks him if they could declare a truce for half an hour the councilman very charmingly agrees and says that if he likes to slip away for half an hour hell make sure they dont try and knock his house till he gets back word of honour ford and arthur repair to a nearby pub where ford asks arthur how he woud react if he told him that he wasnt from guilford at all but from a small planet in the vicinity of betelgeuse as soon as theyre out of the way the councilman oorders the demolition ceremony to start a local lady dignitary makes a very movin speech about how wonderful life will suddenly become as soon as the bypass is built and swings a bottle of champagne against the bolldozer which moves in for the kill the sound of the crashingf building reaches arthur who is in the middle of not believing a woord that frd is telling him and he chardes back to his exhouse shouting about what a naughty world we live in at the moment the sky is suddenly torn apart by the scream of jets an a fleet of flying saucers streak towards the earth as everyone fless in panic an unearthly voice rings through the air announcing that due to redevelopment of this sector of the galaxy they are building a new hyperspace bypass and the earth will unfortunately have to be demolished in answer to appaled cries of protest the voice says thta the plane have been on public display in the planning office in alpha centauri for ten years so its far too late to start making a fuss now he orders the demolition to start a low rumble slowly builds into an earshattering explosion folowed by silence a arthur wakes not knowing where he is ford tells him theyve managed to get a lift aboard one of the ships of the vogon constructor fleet not to worry about the earth he says there are an infinite multiplicity of parallel universes in which the earth is still alive and well he explains how they got on the ship by producing a copy oof an electronic book called the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy under the entry marked vogoon constructors it gives detailed instructioons as to get best way of hitching a ride from oone of their ships you have to play on vogon psychology which it describes ford explains thta its his job to research a new edition of the book which is now a lttle out of date would arthur like to accompany his in the task arthur only wants to get back to earth or at least its nearest equivalent however he is fascinated to browse through this strange book he is suddenly appalled when he discovers earths entry thoough the book is over a miion pafge long the inhabitants oof the earth only warrant a one word entry harmless ford rather embarrassed explains that the reason he had been on earth was to gather a bit more material hed had a bit of an argument with the editor oover it but finlally hed been allowed to expand the entry to mostly hamrless theyare very short of space arthur is stung to the quick he agrees to go with ford end of episode one the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy some suggestions for future development each episode should be more or less self contained but lead on quite naturally to thenext one perhaps with a cliff henger a narrative structure can be achievend by having short extracts read from the guide itself since much of its information woould naturally be presented in the form of anecdote foord ands alric frequently have to subsidise their travels by taking ofdd jobs along the way as well as strange new worlds they can visit parallel alternatives of earth which are more or less the same but not quite they find that many of the eccentric alien races they encounter epitomise some human folly such as greed pretentiouenses etc rather in the manner of gullivers tarvels in one episode they was hired by a fabolously wealthy but rather nervous man to act as internal body guards for this they are reduced to microscopic size in order to escort meals through his digestive system in another the encounter a race of dentists exiled from their home planet for having pronounced that everything you can possibly eat or breathe up to and including toothpaste is bad for your teeth they have been told not to return till they have evolved an entirely new way of life that is both hygienic and fun in another episode they finfd themselves on an alternative earth which is receiving its first visitatioon from alien beings who announce that they have come to pay court at the home of the most intelligent life form of the galaxy after a lot of self satisfied parading by the humans it turns out that it was the olphins the aliens actually had in mind the guide structure should allow for the almost unlimited development of freewheeling ideas whilst at the same time retaining a fairly simple and cherent shape and purpose appendix ii the

hotblack desiato is no longer talking to his old friend ford prefect because he is dead which is going to be fired into the sun they escape through a wonky transporter unit operated by marvin sending zaphod and trillian heaven knows where and ford and arthur to the b ark it was also established that the mice were quite keen on sliceanddicing arthurs brain to extract the answer from it the books i the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy in terms of plot this resembles the first four radio episodes at the end however marvin depresses shooty and bang bangs ship to death blowing up each of the cops life support units and they leave magrathea ii the restaurant at the end ofthe universe this starts off with arthur trying to get a cup of tea from the heart of gold tying up all its circuits as the

universe steal hotblack desiatos ship and wind up in a predicament from there ford and arthur go to prehistoric earth while trillian and zaphod go to the man in the shack this time abandoning zarniwoop there shoes and the shoe event horizon which merited rather more than an episode of the second radio series get a paragraph in this book iii life the universe and everything ford and arthur are rescued from two million years ago by a sofa which dumps them at lords cricket ground a few days before the earth wasiswill be destroyed trillian and zaphod on the heart of gold sort of split up marvin has spent a long time in a swamp theres a plot about the robots of krikkit but im not giving anything away theres also a statue of arthur dent but for a different reason from the radio series variations between the british and american editions include a certain amount of translation the respelling of a sound effect and an extra words are added to chapter adapted from radio episode ten concerning belgium as term of profanity the british edition just goes right ahead and uses the word fuck thus avoiding the problem entirely iv so long and thanks for all the fish the dolphins restore

hitchhikers guide to the galaxy a trilogy in four parts the same as the hitchhikers trilogy only in english editions and with an extra three lines of introduction and so long and thanks for all the fish added the expanded books the complete hitchhikers guide to the galaxy a collection of the first four books for use on a macintosh computer appendix iii whos who in the galaxy some comments by douglas adams arthur dent arthur wasnt based on simon jones simon is convinced ive said this at some point whereas what ive said was very similar which was that i wrote the part with him in mind which is a very different thing to say about an actor i wrote the part for him and i wrote the part with his voice in mind and with an idea of what he was strong on playing and so on but theres only the slightest echo of simon himself in it he isnt based on simon but he is based on what i thought simons strengths as an actor were which is a very different thing nor by the same token is it autobiographical having said that arthur dent is not so remote from myself that its impossible to use things which have happened to me in writing about him deep thought the name is a very obvious joke fenchurch she isnt based on any particular person but on a number of different thoughts or observations of people or incidents it was a bit of a parody of the oscar wilde thing in the importance of being earnest being found in a bag at the left luggage office at victoria when in fact its paddington station where the ticket queues are always insane and you cant understand why it happens like that every single day why it isnt sorted out paddington was the station i had in mind but i couldnt call her that because theres already a bear named paddington after the station so i just went through the various names of the london termini and fenchurch seemed a nice name i just selected the one that seemed the most fun as a name i dont think its even a station ive ever been to that was where that came from it was just an idea id had floating around for a character whereas i was also looking for a character who was going to be the girl whod been in the caf in rickmansworth i put the two things together then the whole thing of anhur falling in love with her was sort of going very much into adolescent memories really ford prefect i remember the idea i had when i created ford which was that he is a reaction against dr who because dr who is always rushing about saving people and planets and generally doing good works so to speak and i thought the keynote of the character of ford prefect was that given the choice between getting involved and saving the world from some disaster on the one hand and on the other hand going to a party hed go to the party every time assuming that the world if it were worth anything would take care of itself so that was the departure point for ford he wasnt based on any particular character but come to think of it aspects of fords later behaviour became more and more based on memories of geoffrey mcgiverns more extreme behaviour in pubs hotblack desiato i had this appalling overblown rockstar character and i couldnt come up with a name for him then i saw an estate agents board up outside a house well i nearly crashed my car with delight i couldnt get the name out of my mind eventually i phoned them up and said can i use your name i cant come up with anything nearly as good they said fine it hasnt done them any harm except its terribly unfair as people keep phoning them up and saying come on its a bit cheeky nicking a name from hitchhikers to call your estate agents by isnt it and they were a bit upset when i moved back to england that i didnt buy my house from them the man in the shack i suppose he came from a discussion i had with someone about this not entirely original observation that everyones experience of the world on which we build this enormous edifice of what we consider the world is of what we think the universe is and our place in it and how matter behaves and everything is actually a construct which we put on little electrical signals that we get when you think of what we know about the universe and the data we have to go on its a pretty huge gap even the information we have is not only just what we happen to have been told but the interpretation that we have put on the little electrical signals which tell us that somebodys told us this we really have nothing to go on at all so that character was someone who took that observation to the ultimate extreme which is that he would take absolutely nothing on trust at all he wouldnt accept anything as being proved or assumed and therefore responds absolutely intuitively if you like thoughtlessly to whatever happens he makes everything up as he goes along because he makes no assumptions about anything he really is the best qualified person to rule to exercise power because hes completely disinterested on the other hand that level of disinterest makes him completely unable to produce any rational or useful decisions whatsoever as i say in the passage that introduces him who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to marvin marvin came from andrew marshall hes another comedy writer and he is exactly like that when i set out to write the character i wanted to write a robot who was andrew marshall and in the first draft i actually called the robot marshall it only got changed on the way to the studio because geoffrey perkins thought that the word marshall suggested other things andrew was the sort of guy you are afraid to introduce to people in pubs because you know hes going to be rude to them his wife recognised him first time hes cheered up a lot recently but i said that on the radio once that marvin was marshall and my mother heard it next time i spoke to her she said marvin isnt andrew marshall hes eeyore i said what she said marvin is just like eeyore go and look so i did and blow me but literature is full of depressives marvin is simply the latest and most metal the other place that a lot of marvin comes from is from me i get awfully gloomy and a lot of that comes out in marvin but i havent been that depressed in a year or so i havent had one of these terrible depressions curiously enough i never had a very clear idea of what marvin looked like and i still dont have one i dont think the tv one quite got it i described him differently for the film script hes not silver any more hes the colour of a black saab turbo he isnt so square either he needs a kind of stooping quality on the one hand hes been designed to be dynamic and streamlined and beautiful but he holds himself the wrong way so the design has gone completely to naught because he looks pathetic utterly pathetic the patheticness comes from his attitude to himself rather than any inherent design as far as his design is concerned he looks very sleek a hitech robot people ask me what my favourite character is to which the answer has usually been after a long umm and a pause probably marvin its not something i strongly feel marvin was interviewed in the sunday times colour supplement in july q would you like to be a human being a if i was a human being id be very depressed but then im very depressed already so it hardly matters sometimes i think it might be quite pleasant to be a chair q how does it feel to have a brain the size of a planet a ghastly but only someone with a brain the size of a planet could hope to understand exactly how appalling it really is q why are you so miserable a ive been in precisely the same mood ever since i was switched on its just the way my circuits are connected very badly q can you repair yourself a why should i want to do that id just as soon rust q do you like reading a i read everything there was to read on the day i was switched on it was all so dull i dont see any point in reading it again q music a hate it q hobbies a hating music q what do you like the least a the entire multidimensional infinity of all creation i dont like that at all oolon colluphid see yooden vranx roosta the guy who played roosta wasnt very certain what kind of person roosta was meant to be because i wasnt either it happens from time to time when youre writing serially when you introduce a character at the end of a show and youre going to bring him back at the start of the next show and get him working properly that you can leave a character dangling like that you realise that you dont need the character or its not the right character or whatever but in the meantime youve already got the actor there so have to have him do something slartibartfast slartibartfast was actually a favourite character of mine in the first book though i think i slightly misused that character in the third book one thing i dont think i explained in the script book was that i was also teasing the typist geoffreys secretary because the character had actually been on stage for quite a long time before you know what his name is i was teasing the typist because shed be typing out this long and extraordinary name which would be quite an effon to type and right at the beginning he says my name is not imponant and im not going to tell you what it is i was just being mean to geoffreys secretary trillian her name was a son of feeble little twist actually when she is introduced to the audience you think trillian she must be an alien then later you realise it was just a nickname for her real name tricia macmillan and that she was actually from earth its a feeble surprise isnt it i thought it would be useful to have somebody else from earth so that arthur could have somebody that he could have some kind of normal conversation with otherwise he is going to be totally lost and the readerviewerlistenerwhoever will be utterly lost as well there has to be someone who will understand when arthur mentions something which is earthspecific therefore there must be someone else who survived earth but in fact that wasnt really necessary because obviously ford fulfills that function so im afraid the main problem with trillian is that the pan wasnt really required it was superfluous she makes less noise than the others do but she comes very much to the fore at the end of the third book she is far more acute perceptive aware and able than most of the rest of them put together that was something i finally spotted about her and i was pleased about that everyone always asked me why is trillian such a cipher of a character its because i never really knew anything about her and i always find women very mysterious anyway i never know what they want and i always get very nervous about writing one as i think ill do something ternbly wrong you read other male accounts of women and you think hes got them wrong and i feel very nervous about going into that area vogons the name was just a sort of code name they sound like the typical baddies from dr who or star trek or wherever dont they wonko the sane the whole notion of this character actually came from this thing about toothpicks i came across this packet of toothpicks which had instructions for use inside i just imagined somebody who might feel that this was the final thing which just tipped them over the edge in terms of what they thought of the world and how they thought you could live in a world which had such a thing in it so from that came the idea of the universe turned inside out if you like he built this house to enclose the universe which he called the asylum and he really thought that was what the universe should be put into an asylum and that he would live outside the asylum and look after it that was where it came from really toothpicks the worst poet in the universe he was a bloke i was at school with he used to write appalling stuff about dead swans in stagnant pools dreadful garbage the name of this character was changed to paula nancy millstone jennings after complaints by paul neil milne johnson an ex schoolfriend of douglas adams captain thy micturations are to me as plurdled gabbleblotchits in a lurgid bee now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrune and livid glupules fran and slipulate like jowling meated liverslime a variant and unused version of the poem from an early draft tv script yooden vranx yooden vranx was a character who was introduced in order to pave the way to some bit of plot which then didnt get properly pursued because something funny happened and i thought well ill go with that instead in a way its more interesting to keep a character on the sidelines and never bring him out on stage like oolon colluphid who only appears as an author and you just keep adding books i think some of these characters become so popular because theres this hint of who the pfrson might be the whole time the audience have to use their imaginations if i were to sit down and explore them in the same depth it would probably be disappointing you select the characters you are interested in and deal with them fully but its the little characters on the fringes that the audience can make of what they will that really involve the audience zaphod beeblebrox zaphod was originally based on somebody i knew at cambridge called johnny simpson who i think is now a bloodstock agent he had that nervous sort of hyperenergetic way of trying to appear relaxed that in a way is where it came from he was always trying to be so cool and relaxed but he could never sit still having said that none of my characters are really based on actual people they start with an idea then they take on a life of their own or they fizzle out the two heads three arms was a oneoff radio gag if id known the problems it was going to cause ive had lots of rationales for where the extra head and arms came from and they all contradict each other in one version i suggested that he had always had two heads in the other i suggest he had it fitted and i suggested somewhere he had the extra arm fitted to help with his skiboxing then there was the question of how e managed to pass himself off on earth arthur says in early versions rather inexplicably that he only had one head and two arms and called himself phil but i never really explained that in the computer game i actually dealt with that and zaphod is there at the party but its actually a fancy dress party and he claims to have a parrot on his shoulder he has a cage for it with a drape over it and his second head is sitting under the drape saying pretty polly theres a scene in which trillian cant understand why zaphod seems on the one hand quite bright and on the other appallingly dumb that was a bit of selfportraiture i sometimes strike myself as being quite a clever guy and sometimes cannot imagine how i can be so slowwitted and stupid so dull and brainless i cant understand why i should be able to write something which everybody thinks is terribly clever and at the same time be personally so dumb i think im schizophrenic appendix iv the definitive how to leave the planet you have been carefully selected as a totally random member of the human race

make physical contact with friendly objects this panel is your friend nb on the assumption that nothing terrible is going to happen to the world and everythings suddenly going to be alright really all the advise in this chapter may be safely ignored douglas adams originally wrote how to leave the planet under the title of the abandon earth kit which appeared as a fourteensided figure a quatuordecahedron of a silvery blue colour which was issued partly in the interests of assuring some reasonably relaxed and pleasant future for the human race partly to introduce the world to athleisure the footwear company who distributed the kit as a marketing ploy and partly because its a rather nice shape he then rewrote bits of it changing the concept of the planet athleisure to ursa minor beta for the restaurant at tbe end of the universe he then rewrote the whole of it leaving out some bits for the liner notes of the american editions of the hitchhikers albums he then took the first section and rewrote that not very much for the american hitchhikers trilogy introduction and not at all for the english hitchhikers trilogy introduction the version above is a pretty definitive compilation of all the others appendix v doctor who and the krikkitmen an excerpt from the film treatment by douglas adams cricket at lords the last day of the final test england need just a few more runs to beat australia the tardis lands in the members enclosure very bad form the members are only slightly mollified when the doctor emerges wearing a hastily donned tie and waving a very old membership card three runs still needed the batsman hits a six and the crowd goes wild in the middle of the pitch the ashes are presented to the england captain the doctor causes a sensation by strolling over and asking if he could possibly take them as they are rather important for the future of the galaxy confusion reigns along with bewilderment indignation and all the other things the english are so good at then whilst the doctor is discussing the matter quite pleasantly with one or two redfaced blustering gentlemen something far more extraordinary happens a small cricket pavilion materialises on the centre of the pitch its doors open and eleven automata all apparently wearing cricket whites caps pads and carrying cricket bats file out onto the pitch bewilderment turns to horror as these automata moving as a tightly drilled and emotionless team club those in their immediate vicinity with their bats seize the urn containing the ashes and file back towards their pavilion before they depart two of them use their bats as beam projectors to fire a few warning shots of stunray into the crowd another tosses what appears to be a red ball into the air and with a devastating hook smacks it straight into a tea tent which promptly explodes the doors of the pavilion close behind them and it vanishes again after a few seconds of stunned shock the doctor struggles back to his feet my god he breathes so theyve come back but its preposterous absurd people exclaim it is neither pronounces the doctor it is the single most frightening thing i have seen in my entire existence oh ive heard of the krikkitmen i used to be frightened with stories of them when i was a child but till now ive never seen them they were supposed to have been destroyed over two million years ago but why people demand were they dressed as a cricket team its ridiculous the doctor brusquely explains that the english game of cricket derives from one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind eons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time of all the races in the galaxy only the english could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific star wars that ever sundered the universe and transform it into what is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game it is for that reason that the earth has always been regarded slightly askance by the rest of the galaxy it has inadvertently been guilty of the most grotesquely bad taste the doctor smiles again for a moment and says that he did enjoy the match and could he possibly take the ball as a souvenir the doctor and sarah leave in the tardis during the next couple of scenes we learn some of the background history of the krikkitmen from the doctors explanation to sarah and his arguments with the time lords if it can be done partly using flashback and archive recordings from gallifrey then so much the better brief history of krikkit the planet of krikkit lies in an isolated position on the very outskirts of the galaxy its isolation is increased by the fact that it is obscured from the rest of the galaxy by a large opaque dust cloud for millions of years it developed a sophisticated scientific culture in all fields except that of astronomy of which it understandably had virtually no knowledge in all their history it never once occurred to the people of krikkit that they were not totally alone therefore the day that the wreckage of a spacecraft floated through the dust cloud and into their vicinity was one of such extreme shock as to totally traumatise the whole race it was as if a biological trigger had been tripped from out of nowhere the most primitive form of racial consciousness had hit them like a hammer blow overnight they were transformed from intelligent sophisticated charming normal people into intelligent sophisticated charming manic xenophobes quietly implacably the people of krikkit aligned themselves to their new purpose the simple and absolute annihilation of all alien life forms for a thousand years they worked with almost miraculous speed they researched perfected and built the technology to wage vast interstellar war they mastered the technique of instantaneous travel in space and they built the krikkitmen the krikkitmen were anthropomorphic automata they wore white uniforms peaked skull helmets which housed scything laser beams carried batshaped weapons which combined the functions of devastating ray guns and handtohand clubs the lower half of their legs were in ribbed rocket engines which enabled them to fly by an ingenious piece of systems economy they were enabled to launch grenades with phenomenal accuracy and power simply by striking them with their bats these grenades which were small red and spherical and varied between minor incendiaries and nuclear devices were detonated by impact once their fuses had been primed by being struck by a bat finally all preparations were complete and with no warning at all the forces of krikkit launched a massive blitz attack on all the major centres уf the galaxy simultaneously the galaxy reeled at this time the galaxy was enjoying a period of great harmony and prosperity this was often represented by the symbol of the wicket gate three long vertical rods supporting two short horizontal ones the left upright of steel represented strength and power the right upright of perspex represented science and reason the centre upright wood represented nature and spirituality between them they supported the gold bail of prosperity and the silver bail of peace the star wars between krikkit and the combined forces of the rest of the galaxy lasted for a thousand years and wreaked havoc throughout the known universe after a thousand years of warfare the galactic forces after some heavy initial defeats eventually defeat the people of krikkit then they have to face the great dilemma the unswerving militant xenophobia of the krikkitas rules out any possibility of reaching any modus vivendi any peaceful co existence they continue to believe their sacred purpose is the obliteration of all other life forms however they are quite clearly not inherently evil but simply the victims of a freakish accident of history it is therefore impossible to consider simply destroying them all what can be done the solution the planet of krikkit is to be encased for perpetuity in an envelope of slow time inside which life will continue almost infinitely slowly all light is deflected round the envelope so that it remains entirely invisible and impenetrable to the rest of the universe escape from the envelope is impossible until it is unlocked from the outside the action of entropy dictates that eventually the whole universe will run itself down and at some point in the unimaginably distant future first life and then matter will simply cease to exist at that time the planet of krikkit and its sun will emerge from the slow time envelope and continue a solitary existence in the twilight of the universe the lock which holds the envelope in place is on an asteroid which slowly orbits the envelope the key was the symbol of the unity of the galaxy a wicket of steel wood perspex gold and silver shortly after the envelope had been locked a group of escaped krikkitmen had attempted to steal the key in the process of which it was blasted apart and fell into the space time vortex the passage of each separate component was monitored by the time lords the ship containing the escaped krikkitmen had been blasted out of the sky all the other millions of krikkitmen were destroyed the doctor and sarah go to gallifrey to try and find some answers the doctor is furious with the bureaucratic incompetence of the time lords the last component of the wicket to emerge from the space time vortex was the wooden centre stump which materialised in melbourne australia in and was burnt the following year and presented as a trophy to the english cricket team only now a hundred years later have the time lords woken up to the fact that every part of the wicket is now back in circulation and should be collected up and kept safely the time lords at first refuse to believe the doctors story that the krikkitmen have stolen the ashes of the wooden stump they say that every single krikkitman was accounted for and they are all safe safe exclaims the doctor i thought they were all destroyed two million years ago ah well not exactly destroyed as such begins one of the time lords and a rather curious story emerges the krikkitmen it seems were in fact sentient androids rather than mere robots the difference is crucial particularly in war time a robot however complex is basically a programmable fighting machine even if an almost infinitely large number of response patterns give it the appearance of intelligent thought on the other hand a sentient android is taught rather than programmed it has a capacity for actual initiative and creative thought and a corresponding slight reduction in efficiency and obedience they are in fact artificial men and as such protected under the galactic equivalent of the geneva convention it was therefore not possible to exterminate the krikkitmen and they were instead placed in a specially constructed suspended animation vault buried in deep time an area of the space time vortex under the absolutely exclusive control of the time lords and no krikkitman has ever left it suddenly news arrives that the perspex stump has disappeared from its hiding place the time lords are forced to admit that the doctors story may be true and tell him the locations of the other components of the wicket the doctor and sarah hurriedly visit the planets where the other components are stored first the steel stump they are too late it is gone second the gold bail it is gone third the silver bail it is still there if they can retrieve it the key is useless and the universe is safe it is worshipped as a sacred relic on the planet of bethselamin the bethselamini are predictably a little upset when the doctor and sarah materialise in the chamber of worship and remove the sacred silver bail the doctor cannot stay to argue the point but gives them all a little bow just as he is about to leave the chamber thus fortuitously ducking his head at the precise moment that a krikkit bat swings at him from the open door they have arrived a pitched battle ensues in which the bethselamini are rather forced to conjoin on the doctors side during the battle the doctor finds his way into the krikkitmens pavilion where he has to fight for his life just as a death blow is apparently about to be struck the doctor half dazed falls against a lever and the krikkitman slumps forward paralysed the doctor has inadvertently switched them all off the battle is over the doctor is incredulous if it is possible simply to turn them off then they cant possibly be sentient androids they must be robots so what were the time lords talking about why werent the krikkitmen destroyed the bethselamini are recovering sarah seems to be slightly dazed staring into the face of a paralysed krikkitman she soon recovers we gather that she may have been hypnotised the doctor dismantles one krikkitman to examine its interior he discovers that it is cunningly disguised as an android but that in all crucial respects the circuitry is robotic a fact that anyone making a thorough examination would quickly notice unless of course he didnt want to look very hard the doctor and sarah return to the tardis the next step is clear if the krikkitmen are merely robots after all then they must all be destroyed at once so off to the deep time vault sarah points out that they shouldnt leave the pavilion and paralysed krikkitmen on bethselamin but take them back to gallifrey for safe keeping andor destruction the doctor complains that he cant do both things at once sarahs bright idea if the doctor will preset all the controls in the pavilion and guarantee that all the krikkitmen are now absolutely harmless then she will take them back to gallifrey and wait for him there nothing basically wrong with that says the doctor and agrees what he doesnt see is that while his back is turned for a few moments sarah quickly and quietly switches a few of the tardiss controls whilst a foreign intelligence flickers briefly though her eyes as they leave the tardis sarah surreptitiously hangs her hat over a panel of lights the doctor sets the controls of the pavilion and rather reluctantly leaves her to it as soon as she is alone sarah completely resets the pavilion controls and it dematerialises the doctor watches the pavilion leave and then returns to the tardis whilst he is setting the controls he notices that one or two of them are in the wrong position with a momentary frown he resets them and dematerialises the tardis it is clear that the journey into deep time is immediately complicated and actually requiresthe active assistance of the time lords on gallifrey eventually the tardis materialises in a large chamber full of life support sarcophagi the chamber is clearly just one of a very large number he leaves the tardis he passes sarahs hat but fails to notice that underneath it a bright warning light is flashing after he has gone a hand picks up the hat under it a lighted panel reads screens breached intruders in tardis the hand is sarahs keeping carefully out of sight she follows the doctor out of the tardis the doctor has passed through into the next chamber sarah goes to a large control panel set in the wall of the chamber and carefully quietly moves a switch krikkitmen are coming out of the tardis the doctor has opened a sarcophagus and is examining the internal workings of the krikkitman within it not far behind him another sarcophagus begins to open the doctor is intent on his work this krikkitman is also quite definitely a robot a voice says hello doctor he stans and looks up there in front of him is sarah jane around them are several dozen functioning krikkitmen all the sarcophagi are opening a bat swings and connects with the back of the doctors head he falls he comes to lying in the tardis surrounded by sarah and the krikkitmen you should be on gallifrey he says to her how did you get here the pavilion isnt a tardis machine it cant possibly travel into deep time then he catches sight of the flashing panel which sarahs hat had previously obscured and the penny drops he struggles to his feet and presses a button a wall drops away and there behind it stands the pavilion inside the tardis so thats why the switches were off you lowered the tardiss defence field and then reset the pavilions controls so that instead of going to gallifrey you materialised a few seconds later inside the tardis in fact gave you all a free ride into deep time says the doctor a krikkitman announces that the entire krikkit army has now been revived all five million of them the vault has been shifted out of deep time into normal space and they must now go to release their masters on krikkit he orders the doctor to transport the tardis to the asteroid which holds the lock and if i refuse asks the doctor i will kill myself says the hypnotised sarah jane holding a knife to her own throat the doctor complies as soon as the tardis materialises on the asteroid sarah slumps over she is of no funher use to the krikkitmen when she comes to she can remember nothing since the battle in bethselamin the krikkitmen have reconstituted the ashes into the original stump shape and reconstructed the wicket key they bear it before them out onto the surface of the asteroid the doctor explains to sarah that there in front of them yet totally invisible is the star and single planet of krikkit it has remained invisible and isolated for two million years during which time it has ony known the passage of five years in another direction they can see the great dust cloud that obscures the rest of the galaxy a very large altarlike structure rises out of the surface of the asteroid a krikkitman climbs up to and pulls a lever a perspex block rises up out of the altar it has deep grooves carved in it evidently designed to hold the upright wicket the wicket is insened lights glow power hums in a scene that would make kubrick weep like a baby the star slowly reappears before them with its planet tiny but visible in the distance all the krikkitmen turn to face the aweinspiring sight and together chant krikkit krikkit krikkit in that moment of distraction the doctor grabs sarah and makes a dash for the tardis they escape leaving that small group of krikkitmen stranded on the asteroid the doctor explains that theres no point in trying to fight the robots now that theyve all been released their only chance now is to go to the centre of it all krikkit the doctor is palpably scared stiff krikkit is about the most dangerous place that anyone other than a krikkita could possibly go to and theyve got to go and make them change their minds they land on the planet picking their way carefully through the back streets of a city they suddenly inadvertently walk into a main square and come face to face with a large number of people there is stunned shock on all the faces after a few seconds on both sides a howling cry stans up in the crowd of pure animal fear and hatred the doctor and sarah run for their lives with the crowd in hot pursuit they duck down a side street and suddenly find thernselves ambushed from in front they are knocked senseless acknowledgements i owe a debt of thanks to all who helped with this book not only those who gave interviews who helped with
